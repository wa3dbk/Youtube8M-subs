do it all the way around the entire base
the<00:00:26.039> goal<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.220> me<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:27.300> doing<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.930> not

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the goal for me for doing this is not

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.730 
the goal for me for doing this is not
only<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.039> Electra<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> outside

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
only to get the Electra on the outside

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.959 
only to get the Electra on the outside
but<00:00:31.740> also<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.099> try<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> hit<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.579> fifty

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
but also to try to hit that fifty

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.400 
but also to try to hit that fifty
percent<00:00:33.239> sure<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> stay<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> control<00:00:34.230> fees

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
percent sure so I stay a control fees

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.260 
percent sure so I stay a control fees
and<00:00:34.620> continue<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.130> climb<00:00:35.370> I'm<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.059> because

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
and continue to climb I'm just because

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.420 
and continue to climb I'm just because
I'm<00:00:36.360> looking<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.930> start<00:00:37.350> forming<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.010> lot<00:00:38.219> more

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
I'm looking to start forming a lot more

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.270 
I'm looking to start forming a lot more
gradual<00:00:38.820> attrition<00:00:39.950> unfortunately<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.010> can't

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
gradual attrition unfortunately I can't

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.279 
gradual attrition unfortunately I can't
get<00:00:41.730> into<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.719> center<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.170> base<00:00:43.469> with<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
get into the center of the base with the

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.400 
get into the center of the base with the
strategy<00:00:46.289> most<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.800> time<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.250> need<00:00:47.579> more

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
strategy most of the time I need more

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.100 
strategy most of the time I need more
wall<00:00:49.410> breakers<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.950> whatnot<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.989> most<00:00:51.989> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
wall breakers and whatnot but most of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.299 
wall breakers and whatnot but most of
the<00:00:52.170> time<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.469> me<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.949> worth<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the time for me it's just not worth it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.069 
the time for me it's just not worth it
so<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> pick<00:00:54.180> off<00:00:54.300> whatever<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.719> can<00:00:54.870> be

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
so just to pick off whatever I can be

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.510 
so just to pick off whatever I can be
outside<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.000> go<00:00:57.000> from<00:00:57.149> there<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.520> um

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
outside and go from there so um

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.930 
outside and go from there so um
otherwise<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:01.340> forgot<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.460> point<00:01:02.550> out<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> little

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
otherwise I forgot to point out a little

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.399 
otherwise I forgot to point out a little
bit<00:01:03.059> early<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.539> time<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> bottom

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
bit early at that time on the bottom

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.590 
bit early at that time on the bottom
right<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.860> tend<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> deploy<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.510> bit

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
right they tend to deploy a little bit

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.000 
right they tend to deploy a little bit
more<00:01:06.720> troops<00:01:07.049> when<00:01:07.290> there's<00:01:07.470> no<00:01:07.680> splash

to<00:01:53.760> take<00:01:53.880> more<00:01:54.060> damage<00:01:54.180> if<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.630> spray<00:01:55.170> another

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to take more damage if you spray another

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.370 
to take more damage if you spray another
line<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.369> barbs<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.090> generally<00:01:57.720> helps<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.260> keep

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
line of barbs it generally helps to keep

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.780 
line of barbs it generally helps to keep
them<00:01:58.590> off<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.740> longer<00:01:59.220> you'll<00:01:59.490> get<00:01:59.640> more

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
them off the longer you'll get more

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:08.419 
them off the longer you'll get more
damage<00:02:00.240> overall

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.470 

um<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:10.420> yeah<00:02:10.929> pretty<00:02:11.170> much<00:02:11.290> taking<00:02:11.920> care<00:02:12.130> of

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
um so yeah pretty much taking care of

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.740 
um so yeah pretty much taking care of
most<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.630> elixirs<00:02:14.080> they're<00:02:15.660> trying<00:02:16.660> to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
most of the elixirs they're trying to

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.090 
most of the elixirs they're trying to
finish<00:02:16.900> off<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.200> gold<00:02:17.380> storage<00:02:17.740> on<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.950> right

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
finish off the gold storage on the right

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.880 
finish off the gold storage on the right

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
side dropped an archer first on top just

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.440 
side dropped an archer first on top just
to<00:02:21.010> distract<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.459> mortar<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.300> other

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
archers at the bottom to finish off that

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.580 
archers at the bottom to finish off that

house on the outside and this guy is one

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.709 
house on the outside and this guy is one
of<00:02:46.349> those<00:02:46.439> guys<00:02:46.680> who<00:02:46.739> leaves<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.569> Tesla's<00:02:48.569> on

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
of those guys who leaves the Tesla's on

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.410 
of those guys who leaves the Tesla's on
the<00:02:48.840> outside<00:02:49.170> but<00:02:49.939> truffle<00:02:50.939> quick<00:02:51.090> barbs

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
the outside but truffle quick barbs

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.839 
the outside but truffle quick barbs
takes<00:02:51.750> care<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.819> unfortunately<00:02:53.819> I

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
takes care of that unfortunately I

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.380 
takes care of that unfortunately I
noticed<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:55.230> most<00:02:55.469> of<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.090> collectors<00:02:57.090> on

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
noticed that most of the collectors on

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.000 
noticed that most of the collectors on
the<00:02:57.540> top<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.930> bottom<00:02:58.049> were<00:02:58.319> behind<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.829> cell

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
the top and bottom were behind the cell

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.270 
the top and bottom were behind the cell
walls<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.959> top<00:03:01.200> one<00:03:01.409> I<00:03:01.439> could<00:03:01.739> get<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.250> I

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
walls the top one I could get to and I

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.940 
walls the top one I could get to and I
could<00:03:02.459> get<00:03:02.609> some<00:03:02.760> elixir<00:03:03.090> out<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.299> that<00:03:03.390> tube

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
could get some elixir out of that tube

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.069 
could get some elixir out of that tube
so<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:04.980> decided<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.459> go<00:03:05.549> for<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.939> but<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.870> two

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
so I decided to go for that but the two

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.869 
so I decided to go for that but the two
next<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.680> wizard<00:03:07.980> towers<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.549> middle

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
next to the wizard towers in the middle

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.960 
next to the wizard towers in the middle
I<00:03:09.569> mean<00:03:10.469> we're<00:03:10.680> surrounded<00:03:10.920> by<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.340> mortars

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
I mean we're surrounded by the mortars

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.229 
I mean we're surrounded by the mortars
and<00:03:12.650> cannons<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.950> expose<00:03:14.430> too<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:14.909> I<00:03:14.970> really

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
and cannons and expose too so I really

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.309 
and cannons and expose too so I really
didn't<00:03:15.450> think<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.689> was<00:03:15.750> gonna<00:03:15.900> be<00:03:16.019> able<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.230> get

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
didn't think I was gonna be able to get

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.330 
didn't think I was gonna be able to get
to<00:03:16.500> those<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:18.959> ended<00:03:19.230> up<00:03:19.349> just<00:03:19.620> deploying

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
to those so I ended up just deploying

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.149 
to those so I ended up just deploying
everything<00:03:20.900> at<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> bottom<00:03:22.349> to<00:03:22.590> get<00:03:22.769> those

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
everything at the bottom to get those

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.599 
everything at the bottom to get those
three<00:03:23.519> collectors<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.419> then<00:03:24.750> hopefully<00:03:25.609> move

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
three collectors and then hopefully move

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.080 
three collectors and then hopefully move
my<00:03:26.760> way<00:03:26.939> out<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.329> grab<00:03:27.900> some<00:03:28.639> of<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.730> elixir

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
my way out and grab some of the elixir

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.170 
my way out and grab some of the elixir
and<00:03:30.269> whatever's<00:03:30.810> inside<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.319> base<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:32.180> pretty

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
and whatever's inside the base so pretty

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.909 
and whatever's inside the base so pretty
much<00:03:33.299> decided<00:03:33.629> to<00:03:33.930> go<00:03:34.079> from<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.470> bottom<00:03:34.799> and

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
much decided to go from the bottom and

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.449 
much decided to go from the bottom and
deploy<00:03:35.340> everything<00:03:36.030> they<00:03:36.120> had<00:03:36.299> their<00:03:37.459> since

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
deploy everything they had their since

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.970 
deploy everything they had their since
this<00:03:38.579> was<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.790> free<00:03:39.000> one<00:03:39.150> anyways<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:40.409> see<00:03:40.829> what

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
this was a free one anyways and see what

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.719 
this was a free one anyways and see what
I<00:03:41.040> could<00:03:41.099> get<00:03:42.379> so<00:03:43.379> unfortunately<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:44.129> wall

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
I could get so unfortunately the wall

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.490 
I could get so unfortunately the wall
breakers<00:03:45.060> will<00:03:45.269> offensive

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
breakers will offensive

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.650 
breakers will offensive
didn't<00:03:47.310> open<00:03:48.060> up<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:49.890> center<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.460> lift<00:03:50.670> the

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
didn't open up the center to lift the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.760 
didn't open up the center to lift the
giant<00:03:52.050> so<00:03:52.140> my<00:03:52.290> thing<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.580> we<00:03:54.170> got<00:03:55.170> stuck<00:03:55.440> moving

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
giant so my thing is we got stuck moving

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.520 
giant so my thing is we got stuck moving
a<00:03:55.830> little<00:03:55.980> bit<00:03:56.100> to<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.430> left<00:03:56.460> side<00:03:57.440> here<00:03:58.440> at

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
a little bit to the left side here at

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.480 
a little bit to the left side here at
off<00:03:58.620> course<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.070> then<00:03:59.220> pretty<00:03:59.370> much

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
off course and then pretty much

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.600 
off course and then pretty much
everybody<00:03:59.970> got<00:04:00.440> destroyed<00:04:01.440> here<00:04:01.770> with<00:04:02.460> all

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
everybody got destroyed here with all

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.060 
everybody got destroyed here with all
the<00:04:02.730> splash<00:04:03.000> damage<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:04.380> king<00:04:04.560> did<00:04:04.590> manage<00:04:04.980> to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
the splash damage the king did manage to

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.780 
the splash damage the king did manage to
stay<00:04:05.280> up<00:04:06.770> and<00:04:07.770> I<00:04:08.160> probably<00:04:08.430> should<00:04:08.670> have<00:04:08.730> used

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
stay up and I probably should have used

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.550 
stay up and I probably should have used
his<00:04:09.090> ability<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.600> little<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:09.990> longer<00:04:10.140> I<00:04:10.470> was

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
his ability a little bit longer I was

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.930 
his ability a little bit longer I was
waiting<00:04:10.680> until<00:04:10.860> his<00:04:11.130> health<00:04:11.340> dropped<00:04:11.580> in<00:04:11.760> case

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
waiting until his health dropped in case

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
looks like it's in the pumps and mines

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.850 
looks like it's in the pumps and mines
on<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.150> outside<00:04:45.450> so<00:04:45.930> I'm<00:04:46.169> just<00:04:46.410> going<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:46.650> drop

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
lectures and a circular patch around the

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.680 
lectures and a circular patch around the
wizard<00:04:55.950> tower<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.280> know<00:04:56.400> on<00:04:56.550> that<00:04:56.729> punk<00:04:57.540> goes

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
wizard tower you know on that punk goes

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.690 
wizard tower you know on that punk goes
well<00:04:57.900> because<00:04:58.860> it<00:04:59.100> will<00:04:59.220> take<00:04:59.430> out<00:04:59.580> your

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
well because it will take out your

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.320 
well because it will take out your
troops<00:05:00.110> very<00:05:01.110> difficult<00:05:01.530> if<00:05:01.620> you<00:05:01.710> do

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
troops very difficult if you do

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.980 
troops very difficult if you do
and<00:05:03.810> then<00:05:03.930> again<00:05:04.199> just<00:05:04.409> lining<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:04.740> with

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
and then again just lining it with

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.370 
and then again just lining it with
novartis<00:05:06.950> behind<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.720> to<00:05:08.720> take<00:05:08.900> out

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
novartis behind it to take out

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.320 
novartis behind it to take out
whole<00:05:10.980> buildings<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.640> try<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.030> get<00:05:12.210> that

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
whole buildings and try to get that

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:19.220 
whole buildings and try to get that
fifty<00:05:12.630> percent<00:05:12.900> again

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.870 

so<00:05:19.770> this<00:05:19.920> one's<00:05:20.100> a<00:05:20.220> little<00:05:20.310> bit<00:05:20.550> easier

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
so this one's a little bit easier

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.090 
so this one's a little bit easier
actually<00:05:21.390> just<00:05:21.840> because<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.500> archers<00:05:22.890> could

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
actually just because the archers could

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.900 
actually just because the archers could
take<00:05:23.280> out<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.610> stuff<00:05:23.850> on<00:05:24.840> the<00:05:25.050> outside

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
take out the stuff on the outside

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.550 
take out the stuff on the outside
initially<00:05:26.910> so<00:05:27.150> I<00:05:27.180> had<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.480> use<00:05:27.750> less<00:05:27.960> troops<00:05:28.260> to

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
initially so I had to use less troops to

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.670 
initially so I had to use less troops to
grab<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:30.360> remaining<00:05:30.810> buildings<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.410> hit<00:05:31.530> that

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
grab the remaining buildings to hit that

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.800 
grab the remaining buildings to hit that
fifty<00:05:32.010> percent<00:05:32.310> which<00:05:32.610> is<00:05:32.790> kind<00:05:32.970> of<00:05:33.030> nice<00:05:33.150> just

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
fifty percent which is kind of nice just

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.540 
fifty percent which is kind of nice just
so<00:05:33.930> i<00:05:33.960> can<00:05:34.080> wait<00:05:34.680> again<00:05:34.890> what's<00:05:35.190> around<00:05:35.430> the

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
so i can wait again what's around the

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:44.210 
so i can wait again what's around the
next<00:05:35.580> time<00:05:35.880> round<00:05:42.260> and<00:05:43.260> i<00:05:43.530> just<00:05:43.560> need<00:05:43.920> one<00:05:44.070> more

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
next time round and i just need one more

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.730 
next time round and i just need one more
here<00:05:44.460> i<00:05:44.490> think<00:05:44.700> is<00:05:44.850> gonna<00:05:44.970> go<00:05:45.150> for<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.740> air

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
here i think is gonna go for the air

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.280 
here i think is gonna go for the air
defense<00:05:47.070> so<00:05:47.340> I<00:05:47.370> dropped<00:05:47.730> one<00:05:48.110> or<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.170> couple

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 
defense so I dropped one or a couple

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.870 
defense so I dropped one or a couple
bars<00:05:49.590> up<00:05:49.770> at<00:05:49.890> the<00:05:49.950> top<00:05:50.130> and<00:05:50.430> letting<00:05:50.700> the

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
bars up at the top and letting the

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.330 
bars up at the top and letting the
archers<00:05:51.240> a<00:05:51.270> little<00:05:51.540> bit<00:05:51.660> below<00:05:52.100> just<00:05:53.100> so<00:05:53.220> they

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
archers a little bit below just so they

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.600 
archers a little bit below just so they
don't<00:05:53.370> get<00:05:53.610> hit<00:05:53.760> by<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:53.940> more<00:05:55.190> and<00:05:56.190> that

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
don't get hit by the more and that

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.290 
don't get hit by the more and that
should<00:05:56.820> be<00:05:56.850> it<00:05:56.940> oh<00:05:57.410> so<00:05:58.730> like<00:05:59.730> if<00:05:59.910> it<00:06:00.000> helped<00:06:00.240> you
