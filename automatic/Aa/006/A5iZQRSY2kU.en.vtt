with<00:01:41.729> two<00:01:41.880> hands<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.509> go<00:01:42.600> fits

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
with two hands but there you go fits

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.289 
with two hands but there you go fits
right<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.430> them<00:01:44.549> moving<00:01:45.090> around

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
right in and you see them moving around

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
this is one of the smaller cartridges if

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.870 
this is one of the smaller cartridges if
you<00:01:52.170> will<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.829> stand<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.399> right<00:01:53.670> there

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
all now keep in mind this one's a

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.630 
all now keep in mind this one's a
prototype<00:02:56.530> I've<00:02:56.739> been<00:02:56.860> handling<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.400> for<00:02:57.610> a

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
prototype I've been handling it for a

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.580 
prototype I've been handling it for a
couple<00:02:57.910> hours<00:02:58.269> now<00:02:58.420> got<00:02:58.870> fingerprints<00:02:59.350> on<00:02:59.560> it

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
couple hours now got fingerprints on it

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.979 
couple hours now got fingerprints on it
that's<00:02:59.830> just<00:02:59.890> a<00:03:00.130> shiny<00:03:01.000> black<00:03:01.209> plastic<00:03:01.600> thing

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
that's just a shiny black plastic thing

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.110 
that's just a shiny black plastic thing
so<00:03:02.260> don't<00:03:02.500> don't<00:03:02.769> mind<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.190> stuff<00:03:03.519> in<00:03:03.819> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
so don't don't mind that stuff in the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.330 
so don't don't mind that stuff in the
back<00:03:04.330> here<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.810> did<00:03:05.170> crack<00:03:05.500> but<00:03:05.769> this<00:03:05.950> one<00:03:06.130> she

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
back here it did crack but this one she

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.120 
back here it did crack but this one she
said<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.970> lady<00:03:07.150> is<00:03:07.530> old<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.769> it's<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.040> a

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
said the lady is old and it's just a

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.070 
said the lady is old and it's just a
prototype<00:03:09.550> so<00:03:09.700> it's<00:03:09.819> not<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:09.940> big<00:03:10.120> deal<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.569> think

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
prototype so it's not a big deal I think

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.710 
prototype so it's not a big deal I think
I<00:03:11.590> may<00:03:12.340> have<00:03:12.370> actually<00:03:12.700> inadvertently<00:03:13.450> found

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
I may have actually inadvertently found

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.050 
I may have actually inadvertently found

boxes to Big Bear and he wouldn't tell
me<00:03:18.400> for<00:03:18.670> sure<00:03:18.820> who<00:03:19.120> he<00:03:19.329> ordered<00:03:19.630> him<00:03:19.720> from

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
me for sure who he ordered him from

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.270 
me for sure who he ordered him from
because<00:03:20.110> he<00:03:20.200> wanted<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.560> protect<00:03:20.709> his<00:03:20.980> source

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
because he wanted to protect his source

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.979 
because he wanted to protect his source
and<00:03:21.489> he<00:03:21.549> didn't<00:03:21.760> want<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.000> run<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.630> risk<00:03:22.810> of

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
and he didn't want to run the risk of

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.170 
and he didn't want to run the risk of
having<00:03:23.140> any<00:03:23.500> problems<00:03:23.920> with<00:03:24.519> me<00:03:24.700> using<00:03:25.060> them

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
having any problems with me using them

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.940 
having any problems with me using them
and<00:03:25.480> that's<00:03:25.630> understandable<00:03:26.140> but<00:03:26.440> I<00:03:26.650> think

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
and that's understandable but I think

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.860 
and that's understandable but I think
these<00:03:27.100> are<00:03:27.160> right<00:03:27.519> on<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> money<00:03:27.820> so<00:03:28.450> if<00:03:28.720> you

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
these are right on the money so if you

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.330 
these are right on the money so if you
look<00:03:29.049> here<00:03:29.290> this<00:03:29.410> one<00:03:29.590> fits<00:03:29.799> in<00:03:29.950> a<00:03:30.010> little<00:03:30.250> bit

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
look here this one fits in a little bit

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.180 
look here this one fits in a little bit
more<00:03:30.459> snug<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:32.140> doesn't<00:03:32.410> come<00:03:32.620> out<00:03:32.739> quite

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
more snug and it doesn't come out quite

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.240 
more snug and it doesn't come out quite
is<00:03:33.430> easy<00:03:34.170> so<00:03:35.170> had<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.620> use<00:03:35.709> my<00:03:35.860> thigh<00:03:36.040> there

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
is easy so had to use my thigh there

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.590 
is easy so had to use my thigh there
because<00:03:36.459> I<00:03:36.519> hold<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.000> camera<00:03:37.180> with<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.480> other

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
because I hold the camera with the other

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.420 
because I hold the camera with the other
one<00:03:37.780> but<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.290> fit<00:03:38.440> in<00:03:38.560> really<00:03:38.769> well<00:03:39.040> no

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
one but it fit in really well no

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.009 
one but it fit in really well no
problems<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.450> we'll<00:03:40.570> go<00:03:40.690> ahead<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.930> do<00:03:40.989> a

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
problems so we'll go ahead and do a

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.080 
problems so we'll go ahead and do a
another<00:03:41.620> little<00:03:41.890> quick<00:03:42.070> round<00:03:42.310> again<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.910> see

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
the little gaps here for this to close

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.660 
the little gaps here for this to close
in<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:44.859> keep<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.160> shut
