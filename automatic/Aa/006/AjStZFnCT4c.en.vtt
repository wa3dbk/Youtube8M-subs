00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.479 
I guess they're not beats quality but
they<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> good<00:00:39.059> alternative<00:00:40.070> all<00:00:41.070> right<00:00:41.219> so

unlike<00:01:16.409> beats<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.979> don't<00:01:17.400> think<00:01:17.880> these<00:01:18.090> fold

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
unlike beats I don't think these fold

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:26.870 
unlike beats I don't think these fold
like<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.580> half<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:22.439> beats<00:01:23.659> Studios<00:01:24.659> do<00:01:25.880> maybe

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
like in half the beats Studios do maybe

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.450 
like in half the beats Studios do maybe
they<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.180> actually<00:01:31.640> yeah<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:34.040> it<00:01:35.040> doesn't<00:01:35.369> look

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
they do actually yeah so it doesn't look

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.289 
they do actually yeah so it doesn't look
too<00:01:36.180> bad<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:37.470> build<00:01:37.799> quality<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.640> can

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
too bad it's it's build quality is I can

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.950 
too bad it's it's build quality is I can
already<00:01:39.479> tell<00:01:39.750> very<00:01:41.840> very<00:01:42.840> uh<00:01:44.810> Beats<00:01:45.810> Studio

don't even know why this is in here but
uh<00:03:37.930> yes<00:03:38.650> if<00:03:38.800> you're<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.250> kind<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.550> guy<00:03:39.610> who

likes to clean your headphones that's

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.250 
likes to clean your headphones that's
for<00:03:41.590> you

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
for you

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.699 
for you
cable<00:03:44.260> standard<00:03:45.190> 3.5<00:03:45.790> millimeter<00:03:46.470> plug<00:03:47.470> in

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
cable standard 3.5 millimeter plug in

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.020 
cable standard 3.5 millimeter plug in
and<00:03:48.489> uh<00:03:49.410> yeah<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.440> guess<00:03:50.920> these<00:03:51.250> also<00:03:51.580> come<00:03:51.970> with

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
and uh yeah I guess these also come with

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.430 
and uh yeah I guess these also come with
controls<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:54.160> this<00:03:54.370> will<00:03:54.519> probably<00:03:54.700> work<00:03:55.030> with

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
controls so this will probably work with

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:04.869 
controls so this will probably work with
iPods<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.739> believe<00:03:57.220> from<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:59.160> yeah<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:03.640> uh

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
iPods I believe from and yeah and uh

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.460 
iPods I believe from and yeah and uh
you<00:04:05.360> can<00:04:05.480> never<00:04:05.690> figure<00:04:05.930> out<00:04:06.050> what<00:04:06.200> these<00:04:06.290> are

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
you can never figure out what these are

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.449 
you can never figure out what these are
called<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.739> just<00:04:07.010> like<00:04:07.099> to<00:04:07.190> call<00:04:07.340> them

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
splitters because there are two things

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.649 
splitters because there are two things
at<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.620> end<00:04:09.799> but<00:04:10.310> there's<00:04:10.790> that<00:04:11.000> too<00:04:11.239> if<00:04:11.540> you

at the end but there's that too if you

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.089 
at the end but there's that too if you
can<00:04:11.870> figure<00:04:12.049> it<00:04:12.200> out<00:04:12.379> please<00:04:12.680> put<00:04:12.830> that<00:04:12.980> in<00:04:13.040> the

comment teach me something new so yeah

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.259 
comment teach me something new so yeah
surprisingly<00:04:17.600> not<00:04:17.989> that<00:04:18.229> many<00:04:18.979> things<00:04:19.489> in

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
surprisingly not that many things in

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.530 
surprisingly not that many things in
terms<00:04:20.510> of<00:04:20.750> our<00:04:20.930> accessories<00:04:21.970> and<00:04:22.970> as<00:04:23.210> I<00:04:23.240> think

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
terms of our accessories and as I think

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.020 
terms of our accessories and as I think
there<00:04:23.630> was<00:04:23.750> no<00:04:23.930> charge<00:04:24.800> cable<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.790> came<00:04:26.000> with

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
there was no charge cable that came with

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.890 
there was no charge cable that came with
this<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:26.570> can<00:04:26.870> assume<00:04:27.199> that<00:04:27.229> this<00:04:27.590> probably<00:04:28.250> is

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
this I can assume that this probably is

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.280 
this I can assume that this probably is
badly<00:04:29.900> powered<00:04:30.650> if<00:04:30.860> not<00:04:31.190> even<00:04:32.020> powered<00:04:33.020> at<00:04:33.139> all

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
badly powered if not even powered at all

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.460 
badly powered if not even powered at all
with<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.590> battery<00:04:35.830> yeah<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.160> uh<00:04:37.330> you<00:04:38.330> know<00:04:38.479> for

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
with a battery yeah and uh you know for

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.950 
with a battery yeah and uh you know for
uh<00:04:39.789> for<00:04:40.789> a<00:04:40.850> headphone<00:04:41.210> that's<00:04:41.830> $250<00:04:42.830> I

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
uh for a headphone that's $250 I

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.020 
uh for a headphone that's $250 I
wouldn't<00:04:44.960> say<00:04:45.229> that<00:04:45.260> it's<00:04:45.740> beats<00:04:46.070> quality<00:04:46.760> in

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
wouldn't say that it's beats quality in

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.360 
wouldn't say that it's beats quality in
terms<00:04:47.060> of<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.539> overall<00:04:49.389> build<00:04:50.389> I<00:04:50.780> guess<00:04:51.229> but<00:04:52.039> I

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
terms of the overall build I guess but I

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.909 
terms of the overall build I guess but I
haven't<00:04:52.610> actually<00:04:52.970> tried<00:04:53.210> these<00:04:53.840> so<00:04:54.139> we'll

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
haven't actually tried these so we'll

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.850 
haven't actually tried these so we'll
have<00:04:55.039> to<00:04:55.160> figure<00:04:55.340> out<00:04:55.520> what<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.090> actual<00:04:56.860> using

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
have to figure out what the actual using

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.810 
have to figure out what the actual using
and<00:04:58.130> and<00:04:58.940> music<00:04:59.449> quality<00:04:59.960> is<00:05:00.430> but<00:05:01.430> from<00:05:01.699> what

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
and and music quality is but from what

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.779 
and and music quality is but from what
I'm<00:05:01.940> hearing<00:05:01.970> it's<00:05:02.600> not<00:05:02.900> too<00:05:03.199> bad<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:04.220> that's

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
I'm hearing it's not too bad so that's

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.850 
I'm hearing it's not too bad so that's
pretty<00:05:05.210> much<00:05:05.330> it

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
pretty much it

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.640 
pretty much it
that's<00:05:07.190> what<00:05:07.400> comes<00:05:07.699> when<00:05:08.710> you<00:05:09.710> buy<00:05:10.010> the
