00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
definitely not the same thing as flying

definitely not the same thing as flying
I<00:03:09.300> was<00:03:09.420> thinking<00:03:09.630> was<00:03:09.750> gonna<00:03:09.870> be<00:03:09.930> like<00:03:09.990> diddy

it's okay it's not great it's more of a
in-depth<00:03:19.530> 3d<00:03:19.860> it's<00:03:19.980> not<00:03:20.130> a<00:03:20.160> pop<00:03:20.400> out<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.580> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
better job in the 3d not a big fan of it

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.800

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.790 
kind of surprising now there's a time
trial<00:04:51.690> mode<00:04:51.870> where<00:04:52.080> you<00:04:52.110> can<00:04:52.200> race<00:04:52.470> against
