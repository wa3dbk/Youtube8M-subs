that they had to initiate a series of

time<00:00:57.520> eventually<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.579> know<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.820> the

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
time eventually you know the the

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.060 
time eventually you know the the
political<00:01:01.840> system<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.290> society<00:01:02.800> can't

political system the society can't
sustain<00:01:03.309> it<00:01:03.550> so<00:01:04.139> my<00:01:05.139> hope<00:01:05.379> is<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.770> that<00:01:05.799> Greece

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
sustain it so my hope is is that Greece

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.179 
sustain it so my hope is is that Greece
can<00:01:06.329> remain<00:01:07.329> in<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.200> euro<00:01:08.380> zone<00:01:08.499> I<00:01:08.799> think<00:01:08.829> that

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
can remain in the euro zone I think that

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.379 
can remain in the euro zone I think that
will<00:01:09.340> require<00:01:09.869> compromise<00:01:10.869> on<00:01:11.229> all<00:01:11.380> sides

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:12.389 
will require compromise on all sides

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:15.929 
will require compromise on all sides
when<00:01:13.389> the<00:01:14.259> financial<00:01:14.709> crisis<00:01:15.159> in<00:01:15.729> Greece

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
when the financial crisis in Greece

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.239 
when the financial crisis in Greece
first<00:01:16.329> flared<00:01:16.659> up<00:01:16.840> several<00:01:17.259> years<00:01:17.380> ago<00:01:17.709> we

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.249 
first flared up several years ago we

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:20.969 
first flared up several years ago we
were<00:01:18.399> very<00:01:18.639> active<00:01:18.939> in<00:01:19.270> trying<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.920> arrive<00:01:20.920> at

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
were very active in trying to arrive at

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.480 
were very active in trying to arrive at
some<00:01:21.909> sort<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.209> accommodation<00:01:22.889> I<00:01:23.889> think

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
some sort of accommodation I think

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.830 
some sort of accommodation I think
there's<00:01:24.639> a<00:01:24.700> recognition<00:01:24.909> on<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:25.569> part<00:01:25.600> of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
there's a recognition on the part of

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.719 
there's a recognition on the part of
Germany<00:01:26.229> and<00:01:26.350> others<00:01:26.560> that<00:01:26.859> it<00:01:27.399> would<00:01:27.609> be

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
Germany and others that it would be

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.910 
Germany and others that it would be
better<00:01:27.909> for<00:01:28.049> Greece<00:01:29.049> to<00:01:29.079> stay<00:01:29.529> in<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:29.740> euro

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
better for Greece to stay in the euro

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.239 
better for Greece to stay in the euro
zone<00:01:30.009> than<00:01:30.459> be<00:01:30.609> out<00:01:30.759> outside<00:01:31.359> of<00:01:31.539> it<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:32.249> the

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
zone than be out outside of it and the

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:34.230 
zone than be out outside of it and the
markets<00:01:33.609> obviously<00:01:33.969> are<00:01:34.029> going<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.179> be

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
markets obviously are going to be

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.839 
markets obviously are going to be
skittish<00:01:34.539> about<00:01:34.929> this<00:01:35.109> but<00:01:35.399> but<00:01:36.399> more<00:01:36.520> broadly

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:36.849 
skittish about this but but more broadly

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:39.679 
skittish about this but but more broadly
I'm<00:01:37.119> concerned<00:01:37.509> about<00:01:37.719> growth<00:01:37.959> in<00:01:38.349> Europe<00:01:38.829> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
I'm concerned about growth in Europe and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.510 
I'm concerned about growth in Europe and
fiscal<00:01:40.689> prudence<00:01:40.899> is<00:01:41.229> important<00:01:41.679> structural

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
fiscal prudence is important structural

fiscal prudence is important structural
reforms<00:01:43.060> are<00:01:43.240> necessary<00:01:43.389> in<00:01:43.899> many<00:01:44.109> of<00:01:44.259> these

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
reforms are necessary in many of these

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.769 
reforms are necessary in many of these
countries<00:01:46.499> but<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:48.520> we've<00:01:48.700> learned<00:01:48.999> in<00:01:49.659> the

US experience and this is an argument

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.589 
US experience and this is an argument
obviously<00:01:51.819> I<00:01:51.849> had<00:01:52.060> for<00:01:52.779> a<00:01:52.810> long<00:01:53.020> time<00:01:53.319> with<00:01:53.590> my
