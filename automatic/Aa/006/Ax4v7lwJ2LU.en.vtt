00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 or the burning I had the good my hands 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.629
 I have the samsung galaxy s phone a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.730
 very comfortable phone very good for 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.570
 that come from the blackberry curtsies 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.790
 this phone is gtb 53 30 l 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.490
 this time I will teach you how to study 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.740
 correctly install the micro sd 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.320
 remember that the box has a small 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.890
 micro sd 2 gigas for this phone 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.789
 however this phone already has 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.619
 internally two girls for 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.510
 applications which make it telecom 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.489
 very good of great capacity and were 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.930
 made with a great processor then 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.940
 to install that card correctly 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.090
 of the giga what we should do is turn off 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.870
 the card phone and then put 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.430
 the phone 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.280
 I usually besides that 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.710
 I remove the pile then we go to here to 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.960
 verify the real state of the memory 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.170
 Internal phone 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.640
 as here by configuration and we search 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.329
 the storage option to see 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.290
 how are we initially and how 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.660
 we finish at the end of the installation 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.710
 now we have the memory data 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.909
 internal everything arrives slowly is available 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.369
 usable which have that moment 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.710
 an attentive four girls down tell me 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.750
 be card in memory telling you 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.009
 inserted still and then here where 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.540
 let's find the information of this 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.300
 card let's turn off the phone 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.700
 there where there was no information should 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.220
 appear like this one 32 gigas for 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.690
 appear 1.85 comes this space is 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.810
 possible 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.640
 we see that the slot the card is 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.280
 internal so we are required to 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 remove the lid and if we are bound 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.490
 until the stage then the most recommended 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.200
 as you will see here I think I felt in the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.810
 phone while trying to turn off the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.409
 phone 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.080
 if we remove the lid gently here 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.660
 we can see the depth to one side 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.480
 to insert the microsim simply 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.700
 we follow the drawing that appears there that 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.230
 it seems that the mosque on the right 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.270
 must that up 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.620
 previously for security that we are 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.430
 the battery 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.070
 and we enter microsd following the 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.640
 drawing as it says here with the slot 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.069
 upwards 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.019
 we enter smoothly 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.380
 and not annual part of a small 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:23.540
 push until we hear the click 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.040
 here we heard the click and it was 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.430
 correctly and salty if we wanted 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.040
 withdrawal simply we put the nail 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.460
 We hear the click and we can get it out 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.410
 also the wall is already at the top 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:42.160
 that is, we enter the pile again 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.750
 and we put again the potato of that 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.180
 very simple way we have installed 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.590
 correctly in the micro sd in this 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.630
 case a micro sd or gigas 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.420
 let's wait here for the 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.010
 phone already verify through their 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.590
 options settings and 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.260
 storage that really corresponds 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.990
 the space that says the micro sd or girls 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.030
 with which you will recognize the phone 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.800
 after turning the phone up 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.260
 will appear a notification that you have to 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.260
 see with the micro sd which he says that 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.340
 that he accepted or is not setting up 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.340
 something very similar 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.720
 do not forget to subscribe to my candy 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.260
 next god I will teach you how to 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.489
 soon so serious and archives or how 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.319
 transfer applications to existence 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.660
 However, this phone has a large 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.560
 Storage capacity normally 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.560
 It is not necessary 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.129
 this has already turned on the phone 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.290
 we have to be winning typical action 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.290
 up has to do with the microsd 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.390
 preparing microsd memory card it 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.069
 It requires and was all ready we are 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.109
 here the configuration is like the time 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.109
 passed configuration 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.950
 configuration we look for the option of 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.050
 storage 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.820
 storage 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.500
 and we have the information that you have to 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.750
 see with the internal and here we go 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.520
 and here is the one that has to do with the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.210
 memory card 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.890
 finally 1.85 gigabytes is basically 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.359
 for this video he invited us to subscribe 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.140
 to my channel 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.140
 thank you very much for him
