00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:08.610
 bernd bredeck hello good day 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:11.700
 Hi owner founding idea of the donor 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.150
 Concept away ans first time in berlin 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.810
 popped her a mid-2011 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.760
 not always here in the meantime 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.390
 Warschauer Strasse is its 30th in Berlin 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.990
 was the branch and I would like from 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.619
 jan feather pillow how did he come to be there 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.730
 give up this job at daimler and 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.980
 as a grocer a new format 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.149
 to found 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:46.590
 The answer is actually quite simple 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.969
 myself vegan for five years always 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.410
 very difficult to do in the search for food 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.100
 and then more and more 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.559
 times to watch what for 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.469
 to help elsewhere in the world like that 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.750
 successively the idea arose this 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.159
 to summarize products and more 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.080
 and more of this product at the gates 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.090
 So it was like that at night 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.950
 I woke up and said I 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.729
 make vegan supermarket on so it 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.649
 was it developed 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.560
 we then have a certain 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.380
 lead time the first load opened 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.600
 We were surprised how many customers 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.229
 the offer be perceived and 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.819
 which customers buy from them 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.679
 We have about two and a half years 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.240
 lead time and the range 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.690
 to assure 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.740
 that all products meet our requirements 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.700
 just be fair first 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.800
 to be diligent 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:46.030
 to be fair and we were 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.150
 very surprised once over 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.430
 Amount of credit from the first day to the 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:57.549
 amount of 100 150 people 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.840
 per day and were from the first day in the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:05.110
 cut 400 customers 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.920
 per day in the first store 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.180
 Our customers are not the same 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:16.570
 vegan vegetarians, therefore , we are 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.590
 have meat eaters everything 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.980
 is 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.270
 people who may have illnesses 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.010
 or risks 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.960
 to just like diseases 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.430
 are still new to us 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.450
 something else looking for etc 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:38.400
 Allergy sufferers are a huge at 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:41.950
 Recruiting us from those who have relative 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.690
 Ambitious plans are now in short supply 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.060
 Two years have three branches 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.190
 opened 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.140
 it should be in the tempo or maybe 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.270
 even more dynamic against them 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.810
 We have the time now 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.020
 used to prepare that 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.970
 the next steps and we do 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.220
 now a few weeks hamburg and her 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.740
 fourth branch already very fast 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.190
 erwin and leipzig 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.190
 and 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.300
 do not say 20 branches in 2019 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.660
 because we are not just up 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.520
 restrict Germany but the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.520
 large cities in Europe in focus
