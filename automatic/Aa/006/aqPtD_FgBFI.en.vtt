00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.530 
have a lesson for you guys today on how
to<00:00:04.319> solo<00:00:05.279> more<00:00:05.490> effectively<00:00:06.060> inside<00:00:06.390> the

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
to solo more effectively inside the

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.690 
to solo more effectively inside the
minor<00:00:06.750> pentatonic<00:00:07.020> scale<00:00:07.710> it's<00:00:08.160> actually<00:00:08.670> a

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
minor pentatonic scale it's actually a

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.240 
minor pentatonic scale it's actually a
lot<00:00:09.360> easier<00:00:09.690> than<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.290> think<00:00:10.530> so<00:00:10.830> let's<00:00:10.980> dive

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
lot easier than you think so let's dive

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.970 
lot easier than you think so let's dive
right<00:00:11.550> into<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.200> minor<00:00:13.200> pentatonic<00:00:13.559> today

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
right into this minor pentatonic today

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.470 
right into this minor pentatonic today
we're<00:00:14.130> going<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.370> playing<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.849> D<00:00:15.150> our

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
we're going to be playing in D our

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.260 
we're going to be playing in D our
fingering<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.680> would<00:00:16.980> be<00:00:17.190> one<00:00:17.880> four<00:00:18.240> one

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
fingering for that would be one four one

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.630 
fingering for that would be one four one

four not really new information to most
of<00:00:23.580> us<00:00:23.699> but<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.570> foreign<00:00:24.990> information<00:00:25.529> to

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
of us but what is foreign information to

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.410 
of us but what is foreign information to
us<00:00:25.859> might<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.640> intervals<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.359> are

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
us might be the intervals that are

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.359 
us might be the intervals that are
actually<00:00:27.900> inside<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.439> scale<00:00:28.769> now<00:00:29.220> when

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
actually inside that scale now when

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.890 
actually inside that scale now when
we're<00:00:29.519> playing<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.880> scale<00:00:30.210> everything<00:00:30.599> is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
we're playing that scale everything is

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.560 
we're playing that scale everything is
heard<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> comparison<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> root<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.450> the

heard as a comparison to the root of the

whole thing the root being D that's the

whole thing the root being D that's the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
home tone that's where people feel most

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.470 
home tone that's where people feel most
comfortable<00:00:38.280> that's<00:00:38.760> where<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> music

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
comfortable that's where the music

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.510 
comfortable that's where the music
sounds<00:00:39.870> most<00:00:40.110> result<00:00:40.590> since<00:00:41.100> we're<00:00:41.280> playing

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
sounds most result since we're playing

in<00:00:41.670> D<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.120> note<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.570> D<00:00:42.930> intervallic<00:00:43.860> ly<00:00:44.160> when

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
in D that note is D intervallic ly when

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.130 
in D that note is D intervallic ly when
I<00:00:44.370> run<00:00:44.700> through<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> minor<00:00:45.210> pentatonic<00:00:45.480> scale

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I run through the minor pentatonic scale

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.330 
I run through the minor pentatonic scale
I<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.590> root<00:00:47.750> minor<00:00:48.750> third<00:00:49.140> perfect<00:00:49.890> fourth

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
I have root minor third perfect fourth

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.600 
I have root minor third perfect fourth
perfect<00:00:51.210> fifth<00:00:51.420> hmm<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.710> minor<00:00:52.920> seventh<00:00:53.460> on

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
perfect fifth hmm and minor seventh on

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.459 
perfect fifth hmm and minor seventh on
their<00:00:53.850> own<00:00:54.000> they<00:00:54.660> don't<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:55.020> create<00:00:55.440> any

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
their own they don't really create any

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.410 
their own they don't really create any
kind<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.100> clash<00:00:56.340> against<00:00:56.910> each<00:00:57.030> other<00:00:57.239> where

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
kind of a clash against each other where

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.819 
kind of a clash against each other where
you'd<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.660> hearing<00:00:57.870> music<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.440> watch<00:00:58.620> what

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
you'd be hearing music but watch what

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.799 
you'd be hearing music but watch what
happens<00:00:59.129> when<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> play<00:00:59.489> those<00:00:59.670> intervals<00:01:00.180> with

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
happens when I play those intervals with

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.680 
happens when I play those intervals with
D<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> bass<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> root<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
D in the bass so here is the root and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.420 
D in the bass so here is the root and
minor<00:01:03.930> third

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.790 

so<00:01:08.060> if<00:01:08.240> you're<00:01:08.420> playing<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.780> solo<00:01:09.020> in<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.530> key

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
so if you're playing a solo in the key

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.350 
so if you're playing a solo in the key
of<00:01:09.830> D<00:01:09.980> and<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:10.490> keep<00:01:10.700> resolving<00:01:11.120> to<00:01:11.240> that

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
of D and you keep resolving to that

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.450 
of D and you keep resolving to that
minor<00:01:11.600> third<00:01:11.930> note<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.740> is<00:01:13.010> what<00:01:13.280> your

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
minor third note that is what your

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.400 
minor third note that is what your
audience<00:01:13.880> is<00:01:14.030> going<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.300> be<00:01:14.390> hearing<00:01:14.780> most

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
audience is going to be hearing most

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.070 
audience is going to be hearing most
audiences<00:01:15.950> prefer<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.730> more<00:01:17.180> resolved<00:01:17.840> piece

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
audiences prefer a more resolved piece

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.230 
audiences prefer a more resolved piece
of<00:01:18.230> music<00:01:18.650> it's<00:01:18.980> a<00:01:19.100> great<00:01:19.340> piece<00:01:19.580> of<00:01:19.790> tension

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
of music it's a great piece of tension

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.490 
of music it's a great piece of tension
that<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:20.450> can<00:01:20.630> use<00:01:20.780> depending<00:01:20.930> on<00:01:21.229> what<00:01:21.380> kind

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
that you can use depending on what kind

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.469 
that you can use depending on what kind
of<00:01:21.590> style<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.160> like<00:01:22.400> but<00:01:22.670> I'm<00:01:23.030> talking

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
of style that you like but I'm talking

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.840 
of style that you like but I'm talking
about<00:01:23.540> resolving<00:01:24.229> things<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.890> where<00:01:25.490> most

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
about resolving things to where most

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.969 
about resolving things to where most
people<00:01:26.000> would<00:01:26.420> be<00:01:26.600> satisfied<00:01:27.200> we're<00:01:27.770> going<00:01:27.920> to

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
people would be satisfied we're going to

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.620 
people would be satisfied we're going to
need<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.310> try<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.520> get<00:01:28.729> back<00:01:28.910> to<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.210> root<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:29.600> I

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
need to try to get back to the root so I

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.719 
need to try to get back to the root so I
can<00:01:29.810> use<00:01:29.990> that<00:01:30.260> minor<00:01:30.500> third<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:34.100> get<00:01:34.280> back<00:01:34.490> to

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
can use that minor third and get back to

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.760 
can use that minor third and get back to
the<00:01:34.850> root<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.690> have<00:01:35.840> used<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.229> minor<00:01:36.440> third

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
the root and I have used the minor third

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.590 
the root and I have used the minor third
as<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.010> tension<00:01:37.610> note<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.940> create<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.210> little<00:01:38.479> bit

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
as a tension note to create a little bit

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.570 
as a tension note to create a little bit
of<00:01:38.690> interest<00:01:39.050> on<00:01:39.290> my<00:01:39.440> way<00:01:39.560> back<00:01:39.830> so<00:01:40.340> there's

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
of interest on my way back so there's

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.340 
of interest on my way back so there's
root<00:01:40.880> minor<00:01:41.119> 3rd<00:01:42.009> root<00:01:43.009> perfect<00:01:43.430> fourth

these blues guys were doing that's what

these blues guys were doing that's what
a<00:02:38.900> lot<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.200> players<00:02:39.470> are<00:02:39.769> doing<00:02:39.890> I'll<00:02:40.340> use<00:02:40.730> a

a lot of players are doing I'll use a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.309 
a lot of players are doing I'll use a
note<00:02:41.090> from<00:02:41.360> within<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.810> scale<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.290> create

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
note from within the scale to create

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.100 
note from within the scale to create
intrigue<00:02:43.280> and<00:02:43.519> then<00:02:44.209> resolve<00:02:44.599> back<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.989> the

intrigue and then resolve back to the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.050 
intrigue and then resolve back to the
roof<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.830> not<00:02:45.980> just<00:02:46.250> one<00:02:46.519> no<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.879> way<00:02:47.030> I

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
roof and it's not just one no the way I

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.300 
roof and it's not just one no the way I
can<00:02:47.390> do<00:02:47.599> two<00:02:47.959> notes<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.500> then<00:02:48.739> resolve<00:02:49.069> back

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
can do two notes and then resolve back

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.490 
can do two notes and then resolve back
to<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.610> root<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:49.970> I'll<00:02:50.090> go<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:56.930> terms<00:02:57.230> of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
to the root so I'll go and in terms of

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.650 
to the root so I'll go and in terms of
musicality<00:02:58.099> it's<00:02:58.549> there<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.120> can<00:02:59.329> hear<00:02:59.540> it

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
musicality it's there you can hear it

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.809 
musicality it's there you can hear it
it's<00:02:59.810> good<00:02:59.989> solo<00:03:00.260> pieces<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:00.980> your<00:03:01.430> technical

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
it's good solo pieces and your technical

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.430 
it's good solo pieces and your technical
ability<00:03:02.360> doesn't<00:03:02.569> have<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:02.989> be<00:03:03.110> through<00:03:03.319> the

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
ability doesn't have to be through the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.960 
ability doesn't have to be through the
roof<00:03:03.590> it's<00:03:03.860> just<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.099> little<00:03:04.400> bit<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.610> thinking

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
roof it's just a little bit of thinking

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.089 
roof it's just a little bit of thinking
hopefully<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:06.110> figured<00:03:06.530> out<00:03:06.620> how<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:06.799> put<00:03:07.040> a

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
hopefully I figured out how to put a

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.430 
hopefully I figured out how to put a
chart<00:03:07.489> on<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.150> screen<00:03:08.569> so<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:08.989> guys<00:03:09.230> can

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
chart on the screen so that you guys can

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.630 
chart on the screen so that you guys can
see<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.739> intervals<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.130> I'm<00:03:10.250> talking<00:03:10.400> about

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
see the intervals that I'm talking about

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.640 
see the intervals that I'm talking about
but<00:03:11.000> if<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.599> didn't<00:03:12.019> you<00:03:12.110> can<00:03:12.260> head<00:03:12.379> over<00:03:12.620> my

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
but if I didn't you can head over my

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.289 
but if I didn't you can head over my
Facebook<00:03:13.280> where<00:03:13.430> I'll<00:03:13.519> make<00:03:13.700> some<00:03:13.879> charts

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
Facebook where I'll make some charts

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.490 
Facebook where I'll make some charts
I'll<00:03:14.420> put<00:03:14.599> them<00:03:14.690> together<00:03:14.840> with<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.290> video

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
I'll put them together with this video

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.589 
I'll put them together with this video
and<00:03:15.890> you<00:03:16.340> guys<00:03:16.519> can<00:03:16.730> experiment<00:03:17.150> with<00:03:17.420> that

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
and you guys can experiment with that

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.020 
and you guys can experiment with that
you<00:03:18.049> can<00:03:18.230> play<00:03:18.470> any<00:03:18.829> combination<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.819> those

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
you can play any combination of those

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.150 
you can play any combination of those
notes<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:20.480> create<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:21.140> nice<00:03:21.590> interesting

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.760 

that's<00:03:48.670> deep<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.360> resolved<00:03:50.110> if<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.349> created<00:03:50.620> a

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
that's deep I resolved if I created a

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.380 
that's deep I resolved if I created a
little<00:03:50.980> bit<00:03:51.099> interest<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.760> played<00:03:51.970> back<00:03:52.209> to

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
little bit interest and I played back to

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.670 
little bit interest and I played back to
the<00:03:52.510> deep<00:03:52.720> or<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:53.470> bent<00:03:53.709> here<00:03:53.950> that's<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:56.470> deep

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
the deep or this bent here that's a deep

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.920 
the deep or this bent here that's a deep
that's<00:03:57.310> why<00:03:57.610> it<00:03:57.670> sounds<00:03:58.150> like<00:03:58.330> it<00:03:58.480> fits<00:03:58.720> but

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
that's why it sounds like it fits but

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.690 
that's why it sounds like it fits but
fight<00:03:59.200> land<00:03:59.410> on<00:03:59.620> something<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.220> stay<00:04:00.459> there

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
fight land on something and stay there

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.870 
fight land on something and stay there
being<00:04:01.569> like<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.780> minor<00:04:02.080> third<00:04:05.580> not<00:04:06.580> that<00:04:06.760> it

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
being like a minor third not that it

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.490
