00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.490
 Welcome dear audience to 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.490
 a new issue of certificates 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.020
 currently the gold really shine 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.430
 could that be it already 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.410
 whole little ago, it turns the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.580
 why why is it with me? 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.810
 the price for the precious metal like that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.830
 The others have also gone down 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.210
 perspectives 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.350
 what does that mean for investors, of course 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.660
 that's exactly what I'm talking about with one 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.070
 films from the commerzbank he wants 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.990
 now addressed for gold sat too 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.579
 already much better than must 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.040
 The euro crisis has to be explained 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.380
 now for the time being as quasi 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.520
 Keywords for the gold price you have 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.930
 just do not want to go to crisis mode anymore 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.180
 and that's why it went down or 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.770
 how do you have to explain that to yourself 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.960
 gold price has in principle first 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.730
 again reasonably stabilized at 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.020
 1400 1500 dollars 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.329
 and that of course means that 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.620
 There is a certain depreciation there 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.420
 was actually on these two days 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.430
 gold price was then considerable 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.840
 But the analysts have gone down 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.160
 especially at the commerzbank 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.410
 Still convinced that the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.059
 gold price should rise and that until 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.809
 end of this year at about 1600 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.489
 dollar 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.799
 and they are also optimistic about that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.720
 the following year 2014 should be the 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.330
 gold price also rise again 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.799
 So overall, the story is right according to the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
 analysts still gold should continue 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.950
 first tend to grow 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.890
 but the big question is also what 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.640
 of course we have the crash factors 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.350
 caused and also means which 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.540
 factors are now crucial for 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.590
 further increase or just that is 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.930
 maybe it could go down again 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.280
 So one has especially suspected 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.110
 at that time in the crash that the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 banks are responsible 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.770
 but in reverse is not the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.240
 case our analysts have that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.680
 just broken down which means they are 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.689
 came to the conclusion that the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.979
 central banks tend to be still gold 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.259
 will buy just because currently one 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.119
 averts a currency depreciation 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.890
 takes place in the world see you 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.180
 just when the yen is very strong 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.720
 devalued over the others 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.549
 currencies 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.860
 that means there is currently one here 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.860
 in principle, reorganization of the central banks 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.090
 Towards gold as a substitute currency city ​​and 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.829
 Of course that tends to lead 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.649
 in the long run, too, that the gold price 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.030
 should continue to stabilize and you 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.280
 Do not forget the investors 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.780
 many have gone over to it at all 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.790
 first raw materials and gold 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.410
 for example, as a depot admixture too 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.910
 you could see before 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.740
 gold mainly physically at the switch 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.360
 buy meanwhile it is very much 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.960
 easy and inexpensive possible 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.210
 gold over an etf etc or even over 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.920
 Just add a certificate to the depot 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.690
 Buy and have many investors 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.130
 made and one assumes that 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.170
 tends to be long term, too 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.090
 other financial investors in gold 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.230
 stay invested let's take a look 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.850
 product and what they now considered us 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.500
 have brought an example that is 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.110
 namely the interesting question is something 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.150
 a classic discount certificate on gold 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.800
 they have addressed it physically 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.880
 Of course , gold is hardly anything 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.610
 now the advantage why I should not 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.720
 physically more depending on the world situation 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.040
 ingot or maybe a bit 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.690
 buy less and at home in the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.160
 safe or under the pillow left why 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.300
 should i do that in this form now 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
 what do I have of it 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.450
 So you have to say very clearly if I am 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.190
 It can actually physically buy then 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.870
 I actually look at my gold 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.250
 that has a certain effect too 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.380
 or if I invest in coins the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.850
 look very nice i can put you in 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.470
 camp and I can in principle there 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.600
 really for the absolute crisis case 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.700
 precautions but many investors are 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.220
 today gold as an admixture for 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.440
 Depot to see that is insecure 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.440
 especially on the stock exchange 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.240
 I still have a quiet position in the depot 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.280
 and that is hopefully that 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.870
 gold what I have in the depot now I have 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.660
 but a problem now compared to 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.010
 shares or other forms of investment 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.500
 gold does not raise interest or dividends 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.810
 So that's when I'm in gold 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.209
 invest if I depend on it for 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.260
 the future that the price rises otherwise 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.910
 in principle i have from this 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.780
 investment nothing and if thats me 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.930
 compare over a long-term 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.850
 Period over 10 15 20 years and me 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.380
 for example, buy a share the 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.060
 has three three and a half percent return 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.400
 then I win no matter what 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.620
 Price trend is just over 10 20 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.600
 years almost the price out of me 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.340
 once paid for that is at 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.590
 gold not so that means I have to 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.910
 assume that the price rises and 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.290
 if we look at the product what 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.330
 I brought an exemplary man today 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.510
 I then it's just a discount 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.459
 certificate related to gold and the 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.170
 charming with this certificate is it 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.760
 even if the gold price is now the 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.500
 next time until the end of the year is not 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.910
 moved then I earn here the 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.950
 return of eight percent 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.359
 I can realize that by that 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.660
 they slightly cheaper at the time 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.280
 Certificate of purchase as the gold price so 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.900
 that's why the word discount I come from 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.150
 buy it cheaper 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.340
 so in principle my entry into gold 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.410
 then in principle cheaper and one 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.400
 Optimize a bit 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.419
 However, I assume course development 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.130
 upwards no longer participate 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.389
 that must be aware of everyone so mine 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.710
 Return is on a sideways movement 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.660
 at 8 percent 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.130
 but it goes up is it 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.820
 even in quotes then at 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.889
 8 percent 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.030
 that was now I can lie up 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.380
 continue to participate as it look 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.210
 with the movement down out what 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.410
 happens when gold just in the cellar 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.060
 should the noise happens to 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.490
 the certificate and in the worst case 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.160
 with my employed capital so you 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.810
 can compare about that I buy 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.669
 products at the discount store so this 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.280
 certificate I also buy with one 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.419
 discount on gold that means I pay 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.080
 today less than the gold price 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:09.449
 actually worth it at the moment and 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.610
 that's about $ 100 110 I 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.770
 Buy this gold cheaper today and 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.630
 So that means that buffer 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.260
 me and that protects me 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.680
 price losses just about 100 110 us 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.020
 dollar 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.610
 go down then I'll take only at 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.979
 loss part that means first off 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.419
 I make that limit in the first place 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.729
 a loss so if i have this 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.240
 I have eight percent certificate of purchase 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.070
 yield 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.169
 in the middle of the additional course buffer 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.210
 however, if that is achieved and there 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.560
 now come to your question what 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.630
 happens then I take to the 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.570
 loss of share down one-to-one 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.060
 that means from about 1300 80 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.159
 dollar on current exchange rate 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.599
 here at this certificate below 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.220
 current conditions actually the 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.900
 losses start and then I have 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.610
 actually also risk that down 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.900
 If the price of gold falls then 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.970
 I also lose my return here 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.590
 power loss, of course, too 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.360
 issuer risk as with products 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.010
 this kind of thing you have to joke that 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.360
 they would say accordingly of the 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.060
 risks which investors it is 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.919
 suitable for anyone who considers 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.750
 but not to invest in gold 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.270
 directly to buy gold because time 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.889
 he just was afraid of that 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.449
 gold may not be strong anymore 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.860
 I do not or not only climb or not 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.630
 moderately rising and the one on one 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.159
 Sideways movement sets the gold price 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.130
 and then just a stately one 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.720
 wants to take yield 8 percent the 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.580
 is already a house number until the end of 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.750
 year, however, there we are allowed 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.030
 then risks are not forgotten 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.280
 if it then rushes down then it is 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.219
 one only partially protected wilms many 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.349
 thanks for the interview so far on and 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.669
