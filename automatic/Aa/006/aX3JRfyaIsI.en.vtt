here the Sainsbury laboratory my

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.490 
here the Sainsbury laboratory my
research<00:00:10.299> is<00:00:10.480> focused<00:00:10.719> on<00:00:11.110> a<00:00:11.170> couple

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
research is focused on a couple

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.799 
research is focused on a couple
different<00:00:11.709> aspects<00:00:12.250> of<00:00:12.400> plant<00:00:12.699> biology<00:00:13.180> some

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
different aspects of plant biology some

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.599 
different aspects of plant biology some
very<00:00:13.990> interested<00:00:14.410> in<00:00:14.500> plant<00:00:14.680> development<00:00:15.219> I'm

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:15.609 
very interested in plant development I'm

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:17.990 
very interested in plant development I'm
interested<00:00:16.209> in<00:00:16.359> plant<00:00:16.780> stress<00:00:17.170> adaptation

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
interested in plant stress adaptation

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.250 
interested in plant stress adaptation
environmental<00:00:19.000> changes<00:00:19.690> so<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:19.900> speak<00:00:20.110> how

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.260 
environmental changes so to speak how

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.720 
environmental changes so to speak how
plants<00:00:20.530> respond<00:00:20.950> to<00:00:21.100> that<00:00:21.220> and<00:00:21.490> I<00:00:21.580> think

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
plants respond to that and I think

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.340 
plants respond to that and I think
there's<00:00:21.880> a<00:00:21.970> real<00:00:22.270> nice<00:00:22.420> precedence<00:00:23.020> here<00:00:23.200> in

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
there's a real nice precedence here in

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.930 
there's a real nice precedence here in
the<00:00:23.440> botanic<00:00:23.830> garden<00:00:24.130> where<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.490> Sainsbury

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
the botanic garden where the Sainsbury

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:35.520 
the botanic garden where the Sainsbury
lab<00:00:25.090> is<00:00:25.240> located

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.530 

one<00:00:36.530> thing<00:00:36.680> that's<00:00:36.740> very<00:00:36.980> I<00:00:37.610> would<00:00:38.090> necessary

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
one thing that's very I would necessary

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.670 
one thing that's very I would necessary
unique<00:00:38.840> about<00:00:38.990> plants<00:00:39.290> but<00:00:39.380> I<00:00:39.440> think<00:00:39.560> it's

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
unique about plants but I think it's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.990 
unique about plants but I think it's
very<00:00:39.740> important<00:00:40.160> or<00:00:40.220> special<00:00:40.520> about<00:00:40.640> plants

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
very important or special about plants

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.820 
very important or special about plants
is<00:00:41.420> that<00:00:41.480> there's<00:00:42.380> sessile

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
is that there's sessile

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.530 
is that there's sessile
organisms<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:43.460> essentially<00:00:43.910> where<00:00:44.150> they<00:00:44.330> sit

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
organisms so essentially where they sit

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.320 
organisms so essentially where they sit
down<00:00:44.750> or<00:00:45.170> where<00:00:45.440> they<00:00:45.620> they<00:00:46.190> grow<00:00:46.370> it's

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
down or where they they grow it's

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.220 
down or where they they grow it's
essentially<00:00:47.660> where<00:00:47.750> they're<00:00:47.840> gonna<00:00:47.990> be<00:00:48.080> for

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
essentially where they're gonna be for

essentially where they're gonna be for
the<00:00:48.290> rest<00:00:48.350> of<00:00:48.470> their<00:00:48.590> lives<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.130> there's<00:00:49.670> a

the rest of their lives and there's a

the rest of their lives and there's a
lot<00:00:49.880> of<00:00:50.000> important<00:00:50.480> developmental<00:00:50.870> and

in the last 10 or 15 years one emerging
topic<00:01:01.640> of<00:01:01.760> biology<00:01:02.239> has<00:01:02.660> been<00:01:02.930> quite<00:01:03.290> relevant

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
topic of biology has been quite relevant

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.439 
topic of biology has been quite relevant
both<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:04.100> human<00:01:04.550> health<00:01:04.699> and<00:01:04.970> plant<00:01:05.300> biology

both to human health and plant biology
is<00:01:05.930> something<00:01:06.200> called<00:01:06.380> epigenetics<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.280> this

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
is something called epigenetics and this

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.840 
is something called epigenetics and this
is<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:08.240> idea<00:01:08.600> that<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:09.500> have<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:10.040> basic<00:01:10.340> DNA

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
is the idea that you have a basic DNA

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.330 
is the idea that you have a basic DNA
sequence<00:01:11.360> you're<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.690> G<00:01:12.170> C<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:12.560> T<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:13.220> has

sequence you're a G C and T and this has

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.800 
sequence you're a G C and T and this has
been<00:01:13.490> known<00:01:13.610> about<00:01:13.640> for<00:01:14.030> extremely<00:01:14.630> long<00:01:14.750> time

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.630 
been known about for extremely long time
Watson<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:16.070> corrected<00:01:16.369> a<00:01:16.400> lot<00:01:16.520> of

Fundamental Research in this but since

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.570 
Fundamental Research in this but since
then<00:01:18.440> there's<00:01:18.619> sort<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:18.830> another<00:01:19.040> layer<00:01:19.310> of

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
then there's sort of another layer of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.890 
then there's sort of another layer of
information<00:01:20.150> that's<00:01:20.270> been<00:01:20.390> discovered

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
information that's been discovered

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.800 
information that's been discovered
that's<00:01:21.380> very<00:01:21.590> important<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.040> how<00:01:22.220> this<00:01:22.460> AG<00:01:23.390> CT

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
that's very important to how this AG CT

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.530 
that's very important to how this AG CT
is<00:01:23.960> actually<00:01:24.320> being<00:01:24.470> read<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:24.979> understood<00:01:25.820> so

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
is actually being read and understood so

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.690 
is actually being read and understood so
you<00:01:26.930> have<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:27.259> information<00:01:28.070> that's<00:01:28.520> being

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
you have this information that's being

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.180 
you have this information that's being
encoded<00:01:29.030> above<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:30.350> DNA<00:01:30.650> sequence<00:01:31.070> with<00:01:31.160> the

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
encoded above the DNA sequence with the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.060 
encoded above the DNA sequence with the
age<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.580> G<00:01:31.850> C<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.150> T<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:33.410> this<00:01:33.710> can<00:01:33.860> be<00:01:33.950> thought

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
age a G C and T and this can be thought

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.800 
age a G C and T and this can be thought
of<00:01:34.130> as<00:01:34.310> decorations<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.420> DNA<00:01:35.750> so

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
of as decorations to the DNA so

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.600 
of as decorations to the DNA so
modifications<00:01:36.680> that<00:01:36.830> can<00:01:36.950> be<00:01:37.039> put<00:01:37.220> on<00:01:37.250> and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
modifications that can be put on and

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.460 
modifications that can be put on and
these<00:01:38.090> modifications<00:01:38.509> can<00:01:38.929> be<00:01:39.020> placed<00:01:39.289> for

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
these modifications can be placed for

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.139 
these modifications can be placed for
various<00:01:39.740> reasons<00:01:40.160> for<00:01:40.340> either<00:01:40.429> developmental

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
various reasons for either developmental

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.490 
various reasons for either developmental
reasons<00:01:41.300> so<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.690> have<00:01:41.780> different<00:01:41.869> cell<00:01:42.259> types

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
reasons so you have different cell types

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.240 
reasons so you have different cell types
they're<00:01:42.679> going<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.860> have<00:01:42.950> different

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
they're going to have different

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.249 
they're going to have different
modifications<00:01:43.910> and<00:01:44.119> these<00:01:44.570> modifications

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
modifications and these modifications

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.840 
modifications and these modifications
can<00:01:45.410> also<00:01:45.530> be<00:01:45.740> put<00:01:45.950> on<00:01:46.070> in<00:01:46.250> response<00:01:46.700> to

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
can also be put on in response to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.639 
can also be put on in response to
certain<00:01:47.030> things<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:47.929> there's<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.110> growing

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
certain things so there's a growing

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.859 
certain things so there's a growing
amount<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.009> evidence<00:01:49.369> that<00:01:49.520> actually<00:01:49.869> stress

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
amount of evidence that actually stress

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.510 
amount of evidence that actually stress
conditions<00:01:51.380> environmental<00:01:51.740> changes<00:01:52.340> can

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
conditions environmental changes can

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.340 
conditions environmental changes can
actually<00:01:52.789> induce<00:01:53.179> these<00:01:53.690> different<00:01:54.050> types<00:01:54.200> of

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
actually induce these different types of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.260 
actually induce these different types of
marks<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:54.830> these<00:01:55.429> marks<00:01:55.729> I<00:01:55.819> think<00:01:55.970> they're

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
marks and these marks I think they're

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.120 
marks and these marks I think they're
very<00:01:56.300> special<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:56.929> quite<00:01:57.080> important<00:01:57.560> because

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
very special and quite important because

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.270 
very special and quite important because
they<00:01:58.789> have<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.060> capacity<00:01:59.720> both<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.679> change

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
they have the capacity both to change

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.520 
they have the capacity both to change
the<00:02:02.149> phenotype<00:02:02.569> of<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.750> organism<00:02:03.259> how<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
the phenotype of the organism how the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.320 
the phenotype of the organism how the
organism<00:02:04.039> is<00:02:04.160> actually<00:02:04.429> responding<00:02:04.850> how<00:02:05.149> it's

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
organism is actually responding how it's

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.749 
organism is actually responding how it's
growing<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:05.869> these<00:02:06.830> changes<00:02:07.250> can<00:02:07.460> actually

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
growing and these changes can actually

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.609 
growing and these changes can actually
be<00:02:07.880> put<00:02:08.179> on<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.690> they<00:02:08.810> can<00:02:08.929> also<00:02:09.080> be<00:02:09.259> removed

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
be put on and they can also be removed

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.140 
be put on and they can also be removed
so<00:02:10.190> that's<00:02:10.340> quite<00:02:10.520> important<00:02:10.970> whereas

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
so that's quite important whereas

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.210 
so that's quite important whereas
changes<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.660> DNA<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.080> not<00:02:12.230> possible<00:02:12.770> at

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
changes to the DNA it's not possible at

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.830 
changes to the DNA it's not possible at
least<00:02:13.280> in<00:02:13.520> an<00:02:13.640> organism's<00:02:14.060> lifetime<00:02:14.600> to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
least in an organism's lifetime to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.250 
least in an organism's lifetime to
change<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.410> AGC<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:15.950> T

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.420 

so<00:02:23.260> here<00:02:23.440> we<00:02:23.560> have<00:02:23.739> three<00:02:24.010> varieties<00:02:24.400> of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
so here we have three varieties of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.940 
so here we have three varieties of
tomato<00:02:24.790> plants<00:02:25.209> cherry<00:02:26.049> tomato<00:02:26.349> plant<00:02:26.680> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
tomato plants cherry tomato plant and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.240 
tomato plants cherry tomato plant and
then<00:02:27.040> two<00:02:27.310> full<00:02:28.030> size<00:02:28.239> tomato<00:02:28.569> plants<00:02:28.959> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
then two full size tomato plants and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.800 
then two full size tomato plants and
what<00:02:30.250> we'd<00:02:30.400> like<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.670> do<00:02:30.790> here<00:02:31.000> is<00:02:31.150> wrap<00:02:31.569> them

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
what we'd like to do here is wrap them

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.080 
what we'd like to do here is wrap them
together<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.760> very<00:02:33.970> ancient

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
together this is a very ancient

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.880 
together this is a very ancient
technique<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.810> it's<00:02:34.900> relatively<00:02:35.260> simple<00:02:35.620> and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
technique and it's relatively simple and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.860 
technique and it's relatively simple and
straightforward<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.879> I'll<00:02:37.120> go<00:02:37.510> ahead<00:02:37.629> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
straightforward and I'll go ahead and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.809 
straightforward and I'll go ahead and
graph<00:02:38.019> these<00:02:38.170> guys<00:02:38.379> so<00:02:39.220> typically<00:02:39.580> we<00:02:39.730> do

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
graph these guys so typically we do

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.250 
graph these guys so typically we do
these<00:02:39.940> graphing<00:02:40.330> experiments<00:02:40.870> seven<00:02:41.110> days

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
these graphing experiments seven days

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.869 
these graphing experiments seven days
after<00:02:41.410> germination<00:02:41.890> or<00:02:42.220> plants<00:02:42.760> are

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
after germination or plants are

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.309 
after germination or plants are
extremely<00:02:43.360> tiny<00:02:43.569> they're<00:02:43.870> only<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.079> couple

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
extremely tiny they're only a couple

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.500 
extremely tiny they're only a couple
millimeters<00:02:44.769> long<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:46.120> here's<00:02:46.390> something

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
millimeters long so here's something

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.290 
millimeters long so here's something
called<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.840> V<00:02:47.019> graft

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
called the V graft

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.920 
called the V graft
put<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> notch<00:02:49.810> there

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.460 

watch<00:02:53.379> them

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.750 

so<00:02:58.470> now<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> idea<00:02:58.740> is<00:02:58.950> pretty<00:02:59.220> simple<00:02:59.460> we<00:02:59.610> just

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
so now the idea is pretty simple we just

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.490 
so now the idea is pretty simple we just
essentially<00:03:00.210> want<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.510> stick<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.290> ones

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
essentially want to stick the ones

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.880 
essentially want to stick the ones
together<00:03:01.710> like<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:03.650> stick<00:03:04.650> them<00:03:04.770> together

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
together like this stick them together

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.890 
together like this stick them together
like<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:07.370> there<00:03:08.370> we<00:03:08.490> go

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.960 

so<00:03:14.769> I've<00:03:14.860> just<00:03:15.040> grafted<00:03:15.400> these<00:03:15.519> two<00:03:15.670> tomato

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
so I've just grafted these two tomato

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.990 
so I've just grafted these two tomato
plants<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.480> each<00:03:16.599> other<00:03:16.950> one<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.250> cherry

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
plants to each other one is the cherry

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.850 
plants to each other one is the cherry
tomato<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.599> the<00:03:19.750> other<00:03:19.930> one<00:03:20.110> is<00:03:20.290> our<00:03:20.440> standard

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
tomato and the other one is our standard

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.830 
tomato and the other one is our standard
variety<00:03:21.250> of<00:03:21.280> tomato<00:03:21.640> so<00:03:22.239> now<00:03:22.390> essential<00:03:22.750> we've

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
variety of tomato so now essential we've

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.229 
variety of tomato so now essential we've
generated<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.349> chimeric<00:03:23.830> organisms<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:25.060> it's

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
generated a chimeric organisms so it's

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.289 
generated a chimeric organisms so it's
now<00:03:25.360> two<00:03:25.420> genotypes<00:03:26.730> one<00:03:27.730> gene<00:03:27.909> type<00:03:28.090> in<00:03:28.239> the

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
now two genotypes one gene type in the

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.390 
now two genotypes one gene type in the
shoot<00:03:28.510> another<00:03:28.780> genotype<00:03:29.230> in<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.440> route<00:03:29.620> that

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
shoot another genotype in the route that

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.000 
shoot another genotype in the route that
had<00:03:30.519> now<00:03:30.700> been<00:03:30.909> grafted<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.450> each<00:03:31.569> other<00:03:32.010> now

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
had now been grafted to each other now

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.250 
had now been grafted to each other now
why<00:03:33.220> would<00:03:33.370> we<00:03:33.400> want<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.700> do<00:03:33.849> this<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.930> one

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
why would we want to do this so one

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.390 
why would we want to do this so one
thing<00:03:35.409> that's<00:03:35.500> very<00:03:35.620> interesting<00:03:36.159> from<00:03:36.280> a

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
thing that's very interesting from a

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.369 
thing that's very interesting from a
scientific<00:03:36.549> point<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.239> view<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.599> that<00:03:37.900> having

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
scientific point of view is that having

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.259 
scientific point of view is that having
a<00:03:38.440> chimeric<00:03:38.920> organism<00:03:39.430> allow<00:03:39.640> us<00:03:39.819> to<00:03:39.970> look<00:03:40.120> at

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
a chimeric organism allow us to look at

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.940 
a chimeric organism allow us to look at
molecules<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:41.019> can<00:03:41.140> move<00:03:41.230> from<00:03:41.409> one<00:03:41.470> part<00:03:41.890> of

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
molecules that can move from one part of

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.100 
molecules that can move from one part of
the<00:03:42.040> plant<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.519> other<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.079> can

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
the plant to the other so you can

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.809 
the plant to the other so you can
imagine<00:03:44.349> a<00:03:44.560> molecule<00:03:44.980> would<00:03:45.040> be<00:03:45.190> produced<00:03:45.549> in

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
imagine a molecule would be produced in

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.460 
imagine a molecule would be produced in
the<00:03:46.450> chute<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.840> this<00:03:47.019> plant

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
the chute of this plant

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.470 
the chute of this plant
could<00:03:47.950> move<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.370> root<00:03:48.670> and<00:03:48.940> then<00:03:49.150> have<00:03:49.329> an

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
could move to the root and then have an

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.330 
could move to the root and then have an
effect<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.049> because<00:03:50.500> these<00:03:50.680> organisms<00:03:51.010> now

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
effect and because these organisms now

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.680 
effect and because these organisms now
have<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.549> different<00:03:51.700> genome<00:03:52.180> from<00:03:52.329> one<00:03:52.450> another

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
have a different genome from one another

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.900 
have a different genome from one another
we<00:03:53.170> can<00:03:53.319> monitor<00:03:53.799> which<00:03:54.129> organist<00:03:54.549> are<00:03:54.700> which

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
we can monitor which organist are which

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.300 
we can monitor which organist are which
molecules<00:03:55.510> appear<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.650> roots<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.190> are

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
molecules appear in the roots that are

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.949 
molecules appear in the roots that are
not<00:03:57.459> normally<00:03:57.849> produced<00:03:58.239> there<00:03:58.480> because

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
not normally produced there because

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.199 
not normally produced there because
they're<00:03:59.109> being<00:03:59.260> produced<00:03:59.560> in<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.890> chute<00:04:00.209> we

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
they're being produced in the chute we

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.640 
they're being produced in the chute we
could<00:04:01.359> take<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.569> plant<00:04:01.900> that<00:04:02.049> was<00:04:02.290> no<00:04:02.470> longer

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
could take a plant that was no longer

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.619 
could take a plant that was no longer
producing<00:04:03.220> specific<00:04:03.670> types<00:04:03.849> of<00:04:03.970> harness<00:04:04.420> that

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
producing specific types of harness that

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.140 
producing specific types of harness that
we<00:04:04.750> thought<00:04:04.959> were<00:04:05.109> important<00:04:05.650> for<00:04:06.150> these

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
we thought were important for these

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.630 
we thought were important for these
epigenetic<00:04:07.450> processes<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:09.250> when<00:04:09.370> we<00:04:09.459> did<00:04:09.579> this

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
epigenetic processes so when we did this

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.130 
epigenetic processes so when we did this
experiment<00:04:10.030> we<00:04:10.359> actually<00:04:10.659> could<00:04:10.780> discover

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
experiment we actually could discover

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.180 
experiment we actually could discover
that<00:04:11.440> about<00:04:11.680> 70%<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:13.599> RNA<00:04:14.019> that<00:04:14.230> was<00:04:14.920> being

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
that about 70% of the RNA that was being

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.529 
that about 70% of the RNA that was being
you<00:04:15.609> could<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:15.940> could<00:04:16.060> think<00:04:16.120> of<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.329> as<00:04:16.389> the

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
you could you could think of it as the

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.539 
you could you could think of it as the
mutant<00:04:16.930> lacking<00:04:17.320> all<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.650> RNA<00:04:18.010> and<00:04:18.220> then<00:04:18.430> when

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
mutant lacking all the RNA and then when

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.099 
mutant lacking all the RNA and then when
we<00:04:18.639> did<00:04:18.729> this<00:04:18.880> graft<00:04:19.180> we<00:04:19.359> could<00:04:19.479> restore<00:04:19.690> about

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
we did this graft we could restore about

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.200 
we did this graft we could restore about
70<00:04:20.530> percent<00:04:20.680> of<00:04:20.919> these<00:04:21.039> small<00:04:21.310> RNAs<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.940> with

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
70 percent of these small RNAs and with

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.550 
70 percent of these small RNAs and with
that<00:04:22.360> as<00:04:22.510> well<00:04:22.660> we<00:04:22.780> could<00:04:22.870> actually<00:04:23.020> restore

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
that as well we could actually restore

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.620 
that as well we could actually restore
the<00:04:23.710> epigenetic<00:04:24.310> marks<00:04:24.639> so<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.300> think<00:04:25.419> this<00:04:25.510> was

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
the epigenetic marks so I think this was

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.430 
the epigenetic marks so I think this was
actually<00:04:25.750> quite<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.080> nice<00:04:26.229> demonstration

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
actually quite a nice demonstration

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.589 
actually quite a nice demonstration
because<00:04:27.010> we<00:04:27.130> could<00:04:27.280> show<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:28.060> one<00:04:28.300> part<00:04:28.570> of

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
because we could show that one part of

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.029 
because we could show that one part of
the<00:04:28.720> plan<00:04:28.900> could<00:04:29.139> produce<00:04:29.349> a<00:04:29.620> signaling

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
the plan could produce a signaling

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.740 
the plan could produce a signaling
molecule<00:04:30.460> this<00:04:30.760> molecule<00:04:30.820> can<00:04:31.330> then<00:04:31.599> move

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
molecule this molecule can then move

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.420 
molecule this molecule can then move
long<00:04:32.050> distances<00:04:32.110> through<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.950> plant<00:04:33.190> and

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
long distances through the plant and

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.950 
long distances through the plant and
then<00:04:33.789> it<00:04:33.910> could<00:04:34.000> direct<00:04:34.150> epigenetic

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
then it could direct epigenetic

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.110 
then it could direct epigenetic
information<00:04:35.229> at<00:04:35.590> specific<00:04:36.010> regions<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.700> RNAs

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
information at specific regions the RNAs

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.670 
information at specific regions the RNAs
can<00:04:37.180> move<00:04:37.450> from<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:37.750> shoots<00:04:38.020> into<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.470> roots

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
can move from the shoots into the roots

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.110 
can move from the shoots into the roots
and<00:04:38.919> have<00:04:39.099> an<00:04:39.220> effect<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.550> change<00:04:39.639> in<00:04:39.940> gene

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
and have an effect to change in gene

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.010 
and have an effect to change in gene
expression<00:04:42.360> importantly<00:04:43.360> though<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.810> think

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
expression importantly though I think

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.689 
expression importantly though I think
these<00:04:44.260> epigenetic<00:04:44.770> marks<00:04:45.010> can<00:04:45.220> also<00:04:45.400> probably

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
these epigenetic marks can also probably

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.070 
these epigenetic marks can also probably
go<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.030> other<00:04:46.150> direction<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.930> can

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
go the other direction so you can

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.810 
go the other direction so you can
imagine<00:04:47.260> a<00:04:47.560> signal<00:04:48.160> might<00:04:48.280> be<00:04:48.370> produced<00:04:48.699> in

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
imagine a signal might be produced in

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.310 
imagine a signal might be produced in
this<00:04:48.910> leaf<00:04:49.180> here<00:04:49.479> I<00:04:49.570> think<00:04:49.750> it's<00:04:49.870> attacked<00:04:50.169> by

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
this leaf here I think it's attacked by

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.540 
this leaf here I think it's attacked by
a<00:04:50.349> pathogen<00:04:50.650> it's<00:04:51.010> going<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.190> produce<00:04:51.340> a

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
a pathogen it's going to produce a

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.279 
a pathogen it's going to produce a
signal<00:04:51.940> which<00:04:52.330> could<00:04:52.539> then<00:04:52.660> move<00:04:52.780> up<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.169> the

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
signal which could then move up to the

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.620 
signal which could then move up to the
plant<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:53.830> in<00:04:54.039> in<00:04:54.400> some<00:04:54.669> ways<00:04:54.820> perhaps<00:04:55.030> prime

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
plant and in in some ways perhaps prime

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.110 
plant and in in some ways perhaps prime
defenses<00:04:56.229> or<00:04:56.949> get<00:04:57.130> this<00:04:57.280> plant<00:04:57.550> ready<00:04:57.849> for

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
defenses or get this plant ready for

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.490

these<00:04:58.240> sort<00:04:58.449> of<00:04:58.479> environmental<00:04:59.139> stresses

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
these sort of environmental stresses

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.260 
these sort of environmental stresses
such<00:04:59.800> as<00:04:59.949> this<00:05:00.130> pathogen<00:05:00.490> attack<00:05:00.910> or<00:05:01.150> maybe

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
such as this pathogen attack or maybe

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.450 
such as this pathogen attack or maybe
it's<00:05:01.449> detecting<00:05:01.840> salinity<00:05:02.349> in<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.590> roots<00:05:02.830> and

it's detecting salinity in the roots and

it's detecting salinity in the roots and

not only do these epigenetic marks have

ready and better to respond to these
types<00:05:11.289> of<00:05:11.590> stresses<00:05:11.889> but<00:05:12.520> there's<00:05:12.699> also<00:05:12.849> the

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
types of stresses but there's also the

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.390 
types of stresses but there's also the
potential<00:05:13.360> that<00:05:13.930> these<00:05:14.139> epigenetic<00:05:15.099> marks

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
potential that these epigenetic marks

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.969 
potential that these epigenetic marks
then<00:05:15.789> go<00:05:15.970> into<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.389> flowers<00:05:16.840> be<00:05:17.380> inherited

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
then go into the flowers be inherited

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.770 
then go into the flowers be inherited
into<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.460> seeds<00:05:18.759> and<00:05:19.030> then<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.270> progeny<00:05:19.750> of

into the seeds and then the progeny of

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.360 
into the seeds and then the progeny of
this<00:05:19.960> plant<00:05:20.229> would<00:05:20.440> then<00:05:20.590> be<00:05:20.710> better<00:05:20.889> adapted

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
this plant would then be better adapted

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.129 
this plant would then be better adapted
to<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.610> stress<00:05:24.660> so<00:05:25.660> what<00:05:25.780> you<00:05:25.840> can<00:05:25.990> actually

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
to the stress so what you can actually

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.260 
to the stress so what you can actually
imagine<00:05:26.470> is<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:27.069> a<00:05:27.280> plant<00:05:27.970> for<00:05:28.150> instance

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
imagine is that a plant for instance

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.760 
imagine is that a plant for instance
would<00:05:28.990> be<00:05:29.050> growing<00:05:29.319> in<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.530> certain

would be growing in a certain
environment<00:05:29.889> that<00:05:30.280> would<00:05:30.340> find<00:05:30.610> quite

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
environment that would find quite

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.850 
environment that would find quite
stressful<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:31.660> it<00:05:31.960> could<00:05:32.080> actually<00:05:32.199> modify

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
stressful and it could actually modify

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.860 
stressful and it could actually modify
these<00:05:33.340> decorations<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.300> DNA<00:05:34.690> it<00:05:34.840> can

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
these decorations to the DNA it can

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.260 
these decorations to the DNA it can
change<00:05:35.169> its<00:05:35.380> epigenetic<00:05:35.949> marks<00:05:36.280> things<00:05:37.060> like

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
change its epigenetic marks things like

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.390 
change its epigenetic marks things like
histone<00:05:37.870> modifications<00:05:38.590> DNA<00:05:39.009> methylation

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
histone modifications DNA methylation

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.700 
histone modifications DNA methylation
and<00:05:40.300> it<00:05:40.750> can<00:05:40.870> change<00:05:41.080> these<00:05:41.229> marks<00:05:41.590> in

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
and it can change these marks in

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.100 
and it can change these marks in
response<00:05:42.130> to<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.400> stress<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:43.930> thing

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
response to the stress and the thing

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.570 
response to the stress and the thing
that's<00:05:44.289> I<00:05:44.470> think<00:05:44.530> becoming<00:05:45.130> more<00:05:45.430> and<00:05:45.550> more

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
that's I think becoming more and more

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.980 
that's I think becoming more and more
apparent<00:05:45.759> now<00:05:46.120> is<00:05:46.240> that<00:05:46.360> some<00:05:46.539> of<00:05:46.630> these<00:05:46.690> marks

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
apparent now is that some of these marks

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.570 
apparent now is that some of these marks
can<00:05:47.139> actually<00:05:47.409> be<00:05:47.500> inherited<00:05:48.039> to<00:05:48.250> subsequent

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
can actually be inherited to subsequent

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.360 
can actually be inherited to subsequent
generations<00:05:49.050> so<00:05:50.050> a<00:05:50.409> plant<00:05:51.069> that<00:05:51.220> would<00:05:51.280> be

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
generations so a plant that would be

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.249 
generations so a plant that would be
growing<00:05:51.610> under<00:05:51.849> for<00:05:52.060> instance<00:05:52.360> heat<00:05:52.900> stress

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259 
growing under for instance heat stress

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.559 
growing under for instance heat stress
pathogen<00:05:53.919> stress<00:05:54.220> it<00:05:54.880> could<00:05:55.060> actually<00:05:55.180> change

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
pathogen stress it could actually change

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.779 
pathogen stress it could actually change
the<00:05:55.750> modifications<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:56.919> DNA<00:05:57.280> and<00:05:57.430> then

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
the modifications to the DNA and then

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.640 
the modifications to the DNA and then
inherit<00:05:58.240> these<00:05:58.360> modifications<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:59.440> its

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
inherit these modifications to its

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.950 
inherit these modifications to its
progeny<00:05:59.949> so<00:06:00.669> both<00:06:00.849> to<00:06:01.030> its<00:06:01.150> children<00:06:01.569> and<00:06:01.659> to

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
progeny so both to its children and to

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.899 
progeny so both to its children and to
its<00:06:02.080> grandchildren<00:06:02.740> and<00:06:02.919> there<00:06:03.340> is<00:06:03.430> extremely

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
its grandchildren and there is extremely

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:05.969 
its grandchildren and there is extremely
good<00:06:04.060> evidence<00:06:04.240> now<00:06:04.659> that<00:06:05.199> both<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.710> children

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
good evidence now that both the children

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.170 
good evidence now that both the children
and<00:06:06.190> grandchildren<00:06:06.789> are<00:06:06.880> then<00:06:07.030> more

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
and grandchildren are then more

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.540 
and grandchildren are then more
resistant<00:06:07.750> to<00:06:07.990> that<00:06:08.139> original<00:06:08.409> stress<00:06:08.949> so

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
resistant to that original stress so

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.890 
resistant to that original stress so
they<00:06:09.639> become<00:06:09.909> more<00:06:10.150> resistant<00:06:10.569> to<00:06:10.630> heat

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
they become more resistant to heat

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.779 
they become more resistant to heat
stress<00:06:11.199> or<00:06:11.469> to<00:06:11.680> pathogens<00:06:11.919> and<00:06:12.430> I<00:06:12.520> think<00:06:12.699> this

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
stress or to pathogens and I think this

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.370 
stress or to pathogens and I think this
has<00:06:12.940> very<00:06:13.210> important<00:06:13.630> implications<00:06:13.719> for

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
has very important implications for

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.920 
has very important implications for
biology<00:06:15.009> I<00:06:15.130> mean<00:06:15.610> both<00:06:15.759> in<00:06:16.000> terms<00:06:16.240> of<00:06:16.449> how

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
biology I mean both in terms of how

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.540 
biology I mean both in terms of how
plants<00:06:17.229> are<00:06:17.349> responding<00:06:17.889> and<00:06:18.039> adapting<00:06:18.430> to

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
plants are responding and adapting to

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.779 
plants are responding and adapting to
stress<00:06:18.820> so<00:06:19.060> in<00:06:19.180> terms<00:06:19.389> of<00:06:19.539> crop<00:06:19.750> engineering

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
stress so in terms of crop engineering

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.610 
stress so in terms of crop engineering
thinking<00:06:21.789> about<00:06:22.060> the<00:06:22.120> biology<00:06:22.330> of<00:06:22.570> plants<00:06:23.020> and

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
thinking about the biology of plants and

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.480 
thinking about the biology of plants and
it<00:06:23.710> also<00:06:23.830> seems<00:06:24.130> like<00:06:24.190> some<00:06:24.370> of<00:06:24.430> these

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
it also seems like some of these

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.980 
it also seems like some of these
principles<00:06:24.759> could<00:06:25.090> be<00:06:25.150> relevant<00:06:25.539> to<00:06:25.599> humans

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
principles could be relevant to humans

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.640 
principles could be relevant to humans
how<00:06:26.710> we<00:06:26.770> be<00:06:27.070> living<00:06:27.250> our<00:06:28.000> lifestyles<00:06:28.690> could

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
how we be living our lifestyles could

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.689 
how we be living our lifestyles could
actually<00:06:29.830> be<00:06:30.099> what<00:06:30.219> we're<00:06:30.370> doing<00:06:30.550> in<00:06:30.639> our
