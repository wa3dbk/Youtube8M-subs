a beautiful little flower and then

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.310 
a beautiful little flower and then
naturalized<00:00:30.510> quite<00:00:30.810> easily

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
naturalized quite easily

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.650 
naturalized quite easily
now<00:00:31.740> I'm<00:00:31.890> flat<00:00:32.160> planting<00:00:32.669> header<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.300> foliage

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
now I'm flat planting header of foliage

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.940 
now I'm flat planting header of foliage
but<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:33.870> planting<00:00:34.079> both<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> same<00:00:34.920> time

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
but I'm planting both at the same time

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.319 
but I'm planting both at the same time
it<00:00:35.370> doesn't<00:00:35.550> make<00:00:35.760> any<00:00:35.880> difference

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
it doesn't make any difference

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.360 
it doesn't make any difference
they'll<00:00:36.870> flower<00:00:37.170> when<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.620> their<00:00:37.829> time<00:00:38.309> to

plant in the cup-shaped

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.540 
plant in the cup-shaped
you'll<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.379> some<00:00:49.559> remnants<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.039> roots<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
plant them in a low depression probably

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.180 
plant them in a low depression probably
about<00:00:57.420> half<00:00:57.750> inch<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.109> soil<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.649> top<00:00:58.859> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
about half inch of soil on the top and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.939 
about half inch of soil on the top and
these<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.760> swell<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.660> they<00:01:01.140> disappear<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
these just swell and they disappear the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
these just swell and they disappear the
beauty<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.340> these<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.489> they<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.270> disappear

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
beauty of these is they just disappear

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.329

you<00:01:03.690> forget<00:01:04.080> you've<00:01:04.229> planted<00:01:04.470> them<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.920> then

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you forget you've planted them and then

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.740 
you forget you've planted them and then
suddenly<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:06.090> these<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.540> pink

fantastic<00:01:10.970> so<00:01:11.970> all<00:01:12.150> I'm<00:01:12.299> doing<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.140> small

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
fantastic so all I'm doing is a small

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.469 
fantastic so all I'm doing is a small
depression<00:01:13.799> because<00:01:14.310> bear<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.610> mind<00:01:14.790> they

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
depression because bear in mind they

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.859 
depression because bear in mind they
want<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:16.100> about<00:01:17.100> half<00:01:17.460> an<00:01:17.640> inch<00:01:17.790> above<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
want to be about half an inch above the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.770 
want to be about half an inch above the
core<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.640> probably<00:01:20.640> about<00:01:20.909> two<00:01:21.180> inches<00:01:21.450> apart

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
core and probably about two inches apart

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.270 
core and probably about two inches apart
it's<00:01:22.080> more<00:01:22.320> than<00:01:22.439> enough<00:01:22.590> they're<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.100> going

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it's more than enough they're just going

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.850 
it's more than enough they're just going
to<00:01:23.340> swell<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.960> actually<00:01:24.960> flower<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.710> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
to swell up and actually flower for you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.070 
to swell up and actually flower for you
half<00:01:26.790> an<00:01:26.939> inch<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.180> soil<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> top<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
half an inch of soil on the top and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.740 
half an inch of soil on the top and
that's<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.920> all<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.189> takes<00:01:29.630> there<00:01:30.630> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
that's really all it takes there is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.870 
that's really all it takes there is
nothing<00:01:31.079> more<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.530> than<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.579> next

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
nothing more to do than that but next

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.289 
nothing more to do than that but next
spring<00:01:33.180> or<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> autumn<00:01:34.710> time<00:01:35.060> these<00:01:36.060> will

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
spring or in the autumn time these will

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.660 
spring or in the autumn time these will
actually<00:01:36.750> look<00:01:37.220> stunning<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> that's<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
actually look stunning so that's the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
actually look stunning so that's the
head<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> Foley<00:01:42.210> implanted<00:01:42.840> I'm<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
head of the Foley implanted I'm going to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.300 
head of the Foley implanted I'm going to
plant<00:01:43.409> Combe<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> minute

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
plant Combe in a minute

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.889 
plant Combe in a minute
and<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:45.000> will<00:01:45.090> give<00:01:45.210> me<00:01:45.240> flowers<00:01:45.479> next
