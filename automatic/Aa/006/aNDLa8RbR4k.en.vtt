00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.229 
been done over the last 10 years that
made<00:00:30.529> it<00:00:30.619> much<00:00:30.740> more<00:00:30.800> flexible<00:00:31.490> so<00:00:32.089> it's

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
made it much more flexible so it's

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.360 
made it much more flexible so it's
easier<00:00:32.780> than<00:00:32.960> ever<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.379> do<00:00:33.620> Atkins<00:00:34.040> okay

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
easier than ever to do Atkins okay

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.710 
easier than ever to do Atkins okay
that's<00:00:34.550> what<00:00:34.670> I<00:00:34.730> like<00:00:34.850> to<00:00:34.970> hear<00:00:35.000> flexibility

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
that's what I like to hear flexibility

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.299 
that's what I like to hear flexibility
no<00:00:35.809> I<00:00:35.839> know<00:00:35.989> when<00:00:36.500> I've<00:00:36.589> heard<00:00:36.710> of<00:00:36.830> Adkins<00:00:37.159> what

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309

I think about is ok you limit your carbs
that's<00:00:39.350> that's<00:00:39.799> how<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:39.979> do<00:00:40.190> it<00:00:40.309> you<00:00:40.339> just

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
that's that's how you do it you just

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.860 
that's that's how you do it you just
take<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:40.970> carbs<00:00:41.239> out<00:00:41.360> of<00:00:41.420> your<00:00:41.510> diet<00:00:41.600> what's

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870

happening in our bodies when we have all
these<00:00:44.839> carbs<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:45.440> resistance<00:00:45.979> so<00:00:46.190> Athens<00:00:46.580> has

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
these carbs and resistance so Athens has

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:47.920 
these carbs and resistance so Athens has

capacity<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.100> make<00:01:37.280> fat<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.299> this<00:01:38.479> blue

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
capacity you make fat so this blue

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.989 
capacity you make fat so this blue
bucket<00:01:39.109> here<00:01:39.380> is<00:01:39.590> actually<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.189> fat<00:01:40.429> so<00:01:40.850> this

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
bucket here is actually the fat so this

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:43.660 
bucket here is actually the fat so this
bucket<00:01:41.390> is<00:01:41.509> basically<00:01:41.899> like<00:01:41.929> my<00:01:42.469> thighs<00:01:42.710> well

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
bucket is basically like my thighs well

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.959 
bucket is basically like my thighs well
okay<00:01:44.630> suppose<00:01:45.109> so<00:01:45.350> but<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:46.429> just<00:01:46.640> keep<00:01:46.819> eating

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
okay suppose so but you just keep eating

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.730 
okay suppose so but you just keep eating
the<00:01:47.240> sugar<00:01:47.389> and<00:01:47.539> you<00:01:47.780> overwhelm<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.499> sugar

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
the sugar and you overwhelm the sugar

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.340 
the sugar and you overwhelm the sugar
storage<00:01:49.249> and<00:01:49.460> then<00:01:49.579> it<00:01:49.759> becomes<00:01:50.119> fat<00:01:50.509> so

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
storage and then it becomes fat so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.899 
storage and then it becomes fat so
that's<00:01:51.530> what<00:01:51.679> happens<00:01:51.979> when<00:01:52.100> you<00:01:52.219> eat<00:01:52.249> too

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
that's what happens when you eat too

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.550 
that's what happens when you eat too
much<00:01:52.939> sugar<00:01:53.359> so<00:01:53.929> that's<00:01:54.109> what's<00:01:54.289> happening

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
much sugar so that's what's happening

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.959 
much sugar so that's what's happening
when<00:01:54.679> I<00:01:54.710> eat<00:01:54.950> this<00:01:55.130> giant<00:01:55.490> cup<00:01:55.609> of<00:01:55.729> jelly<00:01:55.880> beans

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
when I eat this giant cup of jelly beans

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.730 
when I eat this giant cup of jelly beans
here<00:01:56.270> that's<00:01:56.539> right<00:01:56.659> so<00:01:56.899> basically<00:01:57.259> what<00:01:57.649> we

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
here that's right so basically what we

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.760 
here that's right so basically what we
can<00:01:57.920> do<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.340> limit<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.149> carb<00:01:59.749> intake<00:02:00.109> and<00:02:00.590> eat

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
can do is limit the carb intake and eat

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.249 
can do is limit the carb intake and eat
some<00:02:01.189> great<00:02:01.999> food<00:02:02.060> for<00:02:02.569> our<00:02:02.600> system<00:02:02.899> i<00:02:02.959> notice

Africans<00:02:23.540> we<00:02:23.840> explained<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.440> can<00:02:24.560> start

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
Africans we explained that you can start

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.680 
Africans we explained that you can start
at<00:02:24.950> any<00:02:24.980> one<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.370> four<00:02:25.640> phases<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.390> then<00:02:26.540> the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
at any one of four phases and then the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.270 
at any one of four phases and then the
maintenance<00:02:27.050> phase<00:02:27.140> if<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.620> have<00:02:27.800> fruit<00:02:28.040> in

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
maintenance phase if you have fruit in

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.370 
maintenance phase if you have fruit in
that<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.090> may<00:02:29.630> be<00:02:29.690> able<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:30.080> your<00:02:30.230> body

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
that so you may be able if your body

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.830 
that so you may be able if your body
responds<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.580> can<00:02:31.760> tolerate<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.690> can

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
responds and can tolerate it you can

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.940 
responds and can tolerate it you can
have<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.140> berries<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.680> one<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.830> the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
have the berries so one of the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.380 
have the berries so one of the
misconceptions<00:02:34.160> is<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:34.970> know<00:02:35.060> you<00:02:35.120> think<00:02:35.330> of

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
misconceptions is you know you think of

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.520 
misconceptions is you know you think of
someone<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.720> Atkins<00:02:36.020> diet<00:02:36.080> you<00:02:36.290> think<00:02:36.470> of

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
someone on the Atkins diet you think of

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.990 
someone on the Atkins diet you think of
them<00:02:36.620> having<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:36.950> big<00:02:37.100> plate<00:02:37.430> with<00:02:37.670> steak

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
them having this big plate with steak

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.460 
them having this big plate with steak
and<00:02:38.210> like<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.330> pound<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.750> bacon<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.230> but

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
and like a pound of bacon on it but

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.900 
and like a pound of bacon on it but
that's<00:02:39.620> not<00:02:39.770> necessarily<00:02:39.920> what<00:02:40.460> we're<00:02:40.610> doing

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
that's not necessarily what we're doing

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.700 
that's not necessarily what we're doing
well<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:41.540> know<00:02:41.660> those<00:02:42.020> foods<00:02:42.260> are<00:02:42.380> okay<00:02:42.650> but

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
well you know those foods are okay but

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.620 
well you know those foods are okay but
it<00:02:43.010> no<00:02:43.400> there's<00:02:43.640> much<00:02:43.790> more<00:02:44.030> variety<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
it no there's much more variety and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.880 
it no there's much more variety and
that's<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.960> key<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.260> being<00:02:45.410> able<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.650> do<00:02:45.770> it

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
that's the key to being able to do it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.800 
that's the key to being able to do it
for<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.370> lifetime<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.360> have<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.660> have
