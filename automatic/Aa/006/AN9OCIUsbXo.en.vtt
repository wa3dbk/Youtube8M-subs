00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.210
 at 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.130
 it is at the end of the 80s that the city 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.670
 is a nation had decided to make 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.230
 permanent symphonic secondhand as 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.360
 he had orchestrated the sorbonne it's 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.700
 a kind of fashion in the 80s 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.739
 to have university orchestras and 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.000
 we were in charge of conducting 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.100
 in 89 and we built the 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.010
 functioning we have today it's 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.540
 an orchestra of young professionals 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.070
 future professionals rather because 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.800
 most are still students 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.860
 in conservatories at the level 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.989
 superior in the Paris region 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.320
 they really have a really good level 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.510
 instrumental we get back to it accepts them 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.409
 here it's after hearing or 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.970
 recommendations by the biggest 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.670
 teachers in a big phase at 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.229
 national conservatory and therefore the level 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.040
 instrumental is already professional 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.750
 now between mastery of 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.270
 the instrument and the control of a game 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.729
 overall that much more complex it 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.430
 there are steps to take anyway and 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.060
 so suddenly many come here to 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.240
 perfect a little bit this aspect 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.160
 of their training and to confront with 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.330
 a directory that we do not play everywhere 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.970
 because maybe should be a progress 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.430
 orchestra need means so we 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.500
 are fortunate to have the means to 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.850
 do things well and it attracts 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.450
 the best young musicians who 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.540
 wish switches into ready position 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.720
 professional or to confront with the 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.710
 repertoire of great orchestras 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.260
 the symphonic orchestra is not a 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.210
 original idea is not happy with that in 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.550
 a place like in international city where we 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.340
 to 140 nationalities that rub shoulders 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.960
 still finds between 15 and 20 sometimes 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.190
 25 different nationalities in their 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.310
 crates the international city 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.100
 there is a resonance already with the place 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.190
 where does it go next if we have a 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.170
 programming feature I would say 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.420
 that it is the fact to make a work 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.010
 contemporary of a living composer 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.560
 and still most of the time it's 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.820
 world premieres at every concert on 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.390
 does the great classical repertoire 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.820
 modern romantic and then we have a 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.980
 work of a living composer who in 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.330
 the hall that meet their helmet 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.950
 for rehearsals and who has not 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.600
 met the audience after the concert 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:40.420
 to assume what he did and that that 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.310
 make us that gives us a status to 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.630
 share of other youth funds that 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.440
 do from time to time a work 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.959
 contemporary 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.400
 but I do not think I know another one 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.910
 does it systematically at each 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.530
 program 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.670
 the peculiarity of gold that it is quoted 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.340
 international it is perhaps also 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.720
 our audience because we have an audience that 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.760
 very young at the big parties there are 25 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.959
 30% of residents who come in this 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.050
 room for idiots that's what is 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.180
 huge 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.310
 and it's a proportion of youth 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.790
 that we do not always see in the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.980
 great concert halls in Paris there 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.130
 to an audience young son she but this 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.540
 proportion is remarkable and it's the 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.160
 people who do not necessarily have the habit 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.620
 behind radio francois room pleyel 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.110
 or quoted from music and that came in 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.020
 jeans and sneakers quite relaxed on 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.490
 embarks on spoken theater after either 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.020
 with the musicians are with composer 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.120
 so a proximity 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:38.450
 there is already an age community between 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.670
 musicians who are students or 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.590
 just finished studying and 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.200
 students international support and 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.970
 so that gives us a close one 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.040
 dynamism between the musicians of 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.540
 artists and the audience that can be 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.540
 privileged here more than elsewhere 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.290
 well two three things
