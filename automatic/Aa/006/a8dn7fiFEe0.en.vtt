00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
show us so what he did was that he

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.950 
show us so what he did was that he
summoned<00:04:20.830> a<00:04:21.010> set<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.340> rats<00:04:21.580> then<00:04:22.180> he<00:04:22.330> froze

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
which is this kind of mind that you can

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.980 
which is this kind of mind that you can
stick<00:04:28.270> to<00:04:28.390> things<00:04:28.540> that<00:04:28.690> we<00:04:28.810> could<00:04:28.960> actually

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
stick to things that we could actually

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.070 
stick to things that we could actually
froze<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.160> rat<00:04:30.340> stick<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.630> mind<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
guard and ejected as the mind exploded I

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.080 
guard and ejected as the mind exploded I
think<00:04:41.110> what<00:04:41.230> a<00:04:41.260> special<00:04:41.580> dishonored<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:42.760> that

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
think what a special dishonored is that

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.140 
think what a special dishonored is that
the<00:04:43.690> moment<00:04:43.900> moment<00:04:44.350> emotion<00:04:45.010> is<00:04:45.220> great<00:04:45.520> in<00:04:45.940> a

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
the moment moment emotion is great in a

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.970 
the moment moment emotion is great in a
shooter<00:04:46.630> for<00:04:46.900> example<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:47.650> know<00:04:47.680> that

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
shooter for example you know that

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.730 
shooter for example you know that
shooting<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:48.700> a<00:04:48.760> guy<00:04:48.940> will<00:04:49.300> kill<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:50.020> you

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
shooting and a guy will kill you and you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.610 
shooting and a guy will kill you and you
have<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.010> take<00:04:51.490> cover<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:52.330> progress<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.230> work

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
have to take cover and progress and work

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.790 
have to take cover and progress and work
but<00:04:54.610> in<00:04:54.820> Dishonored<00:04:55.390> you<00:04:55.810> can<00:04:55.960> combine<00:04:56.230> things

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
but in Dishonored you can combine things

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.310 
but in Dishonored you can combine things
in<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.220> way<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.460> even<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.210> result<00:04:58.660> can<00:04:59.290> be

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
in a way that even the result can be

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.020 
in a way that even the result can be
unpredictable<00:04:59.680> for<00:05:00.430> us<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.670> thing<00:05:00.820> that<00:05:00.940> is<00:05:01.000> a

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
unpredictable for us the thing that is a

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.480 
unpredictable for us the thing that is a
thrill<00:05:01.390> is<00:05:01.510> whenever<00:05:01.810> we<00:05:02.590> are<00:05:02.860> surprised<00:05:03.340> by

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
thrill is whenever we are surprised by

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.670 
thrill is whenever we are surprised by
the<00:05:03.610> game<00:05:03.880> we<00:05:04.330> see<00:05:04.630> that<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.960> first<00:05:05.230> time<00:05:05.410> like

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
the game we see that the first time like

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.040 
the game we see that the first time like
a<00:05:06.070> character<00:05:06.460> responding<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.210> something<00:05:07.420> the

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
a character responding to something the

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.960 
a character responding to something the
all<00:05:08.170> those<00:05:08.350> powers<00:05:08.650> will<00:05:09.010> chain<00:05:09.280> together<00:05:09.460> and

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
all those powers will chain together and

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.230 
all those powers will chain together and
and<00:05:10.420> still<00:05:11.020> simulation<00:05:11.800> works<00:05:12.040> for<00:05:12.910> us<00:05:13.060> it's

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
and still simulation works for us it's

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.740 
and still simulation works for us it's
our<00:05:13.360> it's<00:05:13.540> real

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
our it's real

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.270 
our it's real
knowing<00:05:14.990> what<00:05:15.320> I<00:05:15.350> like<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.800> do<00:05:15.950> when<00:05:16.130> I'm

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
knowing what I like to do when I'm
