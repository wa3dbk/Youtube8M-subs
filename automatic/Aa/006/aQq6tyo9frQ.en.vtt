00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
added a instruction that just there so

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.170 
added a instruction that just there so

minute<00:01:57.800> did<00:01:58.760> you<00:01:58.910> realize<00:01:59.300> that<00:01:59.330> you<00:01:59.479> have<00:01:59.660> got

minute did you realize that you have got

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.300 
minute did you realize that you have got
this<00:01:59.869> wonderful<00:02:00.140> addition<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.860> multiplies

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
this wonderful addition and multiplies

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.580 
this wonderful addition and multiplies
but<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.210> divide<00:02:02.540> that<00:02:02.570> they've<00:02:03.050> once<00:02:03.350> in<00:02:03.560> a

but the divide that they've once in a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.890 
but the divide that they've once in a
lifetime<00:02:03.860> takes<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.970> whole<00:02:05.090> time<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:05.660> we

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
lifetime takes the whole time so we

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
lifetime takes the whole time so we
decided<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.380> make<00:02:07.310> an<00:02:07.460> innovation<00:02:07.940> over<00:02:08.060> there

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.530 
decided to make an innovation over there
virtual<00:02:09.920> something<00:02:10.790> become<00:02:11.120> more<00:02:11.360> more

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
virtual something become more more

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.680 
virtual something become more more
important<00:02:12.550> application<00:02:13.550> like<00:02:13.700> VMware<00:02:14.270> like

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
important application like VMware like

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.490 
important application like VMware like
the<00:02:15.610> being<00:02:16.610> able<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:16.970> run<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.600> windows<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.100> FL

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
the being able to run a windows on a FL

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.220 
the being able to run a windows on a FL
not<00:02:21.500> working<00:02:22.030> one<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.240> complexities<00:02:23.930> in

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
not working one of the complexities in

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.380 
not working one of the complexities in
virtualization<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:25.250> how<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.610> get<00:02:25.850> in<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.300> out

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
virtualization is how to get in and out

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.640 
virtualization is how to get in and out
the<00:02:26.600> move<00:02:26.780> there<00:02:26.959> are<00:02:27.019> a<00:02:27.050> lot<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.230> trips

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the move there are a lot of trips

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.800 
the move there are a lot of trips
because<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.489> think<00:02:28.760> you're<00:02:28.940> going<00:02:29.390> right<00:02:29.600> to

because you think you're going right to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.470 
because you think you're going right to
a<00:02:30.050> device<00:02:30.500> but<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.519> is<00:02:31.880> not<00:02:31.970> really<00:02:32.239> there

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480
