00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 5 you right there the whole wade four come times 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:17.609
 word is minus super in 1935 million 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.980
 all dollars will have to harn as always 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.230
 this rubric play like in this issue we 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.100
 watch the game a single player from 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 whole team 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.140
 newbie 4 international winners showed 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.240
 really decent game grand 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.550
 finale despite losing one 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.520
 the game all subsequent games they won 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.950
 and sure enough let's 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.870
 let's see how it was in the first place 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.149
 the peak is a big responsibility for the game 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.800
 that is, 50 percent success depends on 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.050
 competent peak hero in captain 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.820
 teams 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.730
 all wade the captain of the newbie team without 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.620
 no doubt brought out the peak so much 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.329
 almost every new big country hero 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.239
 almost every hero of the year. 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.660
 for all that , the newbee command is strong 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.489
 as at the beginning of the game and closer to its end 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.409
 another important part of a successful 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.390
 team play this is an individual 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.760
 the number of players from the one and the other 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.280
 teams and every player has a high 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.270
 solo skill everyone knows their place and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.950
 target on the map 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.500
 but still the five newbee look 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.840
 slightly preferable if only because 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.270
 that they do not get stuck on the farm and 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.000
 almost every minute they are satisfied with gang 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.310
 what they are actively helped by Smoke and the scroll 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.140
 teleportation constant gangs and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.600
 manifestations of aggression and murder 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.770
 moral pressure on the team vg from what 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.299
 she's getting weaker and weaker 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.430
 let's take a couple of moments where 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.380
 players show their individual and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.259
 team quality games 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.299
 in this moment we will follow the game mu 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.100
 brewmaster is on the 6th minute of the game and this 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.820
 means gangs will soon go 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.530
 both from enemies and from allies therefore 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.420
 brewmaster bears the like 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.149
 in case of saving allies or 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.909
 killing enemies and oddly enough 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.220
 after 20 seconds the alchemist stood on 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.769
 bote need help from their team 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.230
 brewmaster and vivir as fast as possible and 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.220
 promptly teleported to the bot in order 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.090
 help the alchemist 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.200
 and here I noticed a very interesting clue 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.510
 viverr which stood on top i 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.299
 teleports to t2 brewmaster 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.700
 standing on mid, teleporting to p1 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.560
 All this is not just because of teleport 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.590
 on the same product of several heroes 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.840
 there is some delay to avoid it 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.530
 and fly as quickly as possible to the safe and 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.049
 and how is teleported to different goods in 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.480
 all thanks to tpc his newbie team 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:44.799
 in exchange for 1 kimiko , three heroes were killed 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.350
 teams in r in this moment moon apathy 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.850
 well lured embera to his armpit 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.850
 where was waiting for him than 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.430
 next moment also with the participation of the bug 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.010
 which delightfully flew in gave sala and 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.810
 dream coil thanks to this newbee 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.769
 quickly destroyed key characters 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.769
 teams v.g. 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.910
 professional duty often occurs 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.030
 all the opposite than in the pub i either 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.470
 any amateur tournaments so in 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.140
 4 decisive game 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.500
 Grand Final team newbee from the first 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.840
 minutes 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.269
 organizes gang on mid where it stands 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.400
 innocent wine monsir who has neither 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.330
 single escape 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.890
 kill him no problem on 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.319
 last three games 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.550
 the grand finals we saw domination only 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.190
 just one team 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.220
 teams of winners of 4 international 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.810
 newbie commands 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.569
 I think it's time to bring a short 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.940
 the result just we saw a live example 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.980
 perfect team game based 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.290
 team games are customized 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.450
 quality skills and experience of all players 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.640
 so you always need to sharpen your 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.280
 personal gaming qualities in parallel with 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.829
 commanding if we talk about the international 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.840
 In general, I was pleased though 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.329
 the result of some teams is not very me 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.430
 pleased I think that after 4 the Internet 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.500
 again many people have an opinion about 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.450
 eSports will change significantly in 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.880
 largely due to the prize pool and 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.860
 number of viewers about it at all 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.900
 can talk for a long time 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.590
 so on this beautiful note I am with you 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.780
 I say goodbye and wish you victories like in a pub 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.850
