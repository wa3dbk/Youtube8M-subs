00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.910 

so<00:00:02.969> first<00:00:03.569> try<00:00:03.929> with<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.319> Adafruit<00:00:05.070> trinkets

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:06.920 
so first try with the Adafruit trinkets

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.730 
so first try with the Adafruit trinkets
it's<00:00:07.920> quite<00:00:08.130> interesting<00:00:08.519> little<00:00:09.000> board<00:00:09.269> this

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
it's quite interesting little board this

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.390 
it's quite interesting little board this
though<00:00:10.740> it's<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.010> bit<00:00:11.160> fiddly<00:00:11.430> to<00:00:11.640> get<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.300> work

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
though it's a bit fiddly to get to work

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.970 
though it's a bit fiddly to get to work
that<00:00:14.400> I'm<00:00:14.519> not<00:00:14.730> too<00:00:14.880> fond<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.660> it's<00:00:16.500> in<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
that I'm not too fond of but it's in the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.179 
that I'm not too fond of but it's in the
early<00:00:17.810> state<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.169> its<00:00:19.829> life<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.949> it<00:00:22.949> will

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
early state of its life so it will

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.729 
early state of its life so it will
surely<00:00:23.429> get<00:00:23.759> a<00:00:23.819> lot<00:00:24.060> better<00:00:24.329> because<00:00:25.259> now<00:00:25.679> you

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:25.739 
surely get a lot better because now you

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.439 
surely get a lot better because now you
have<00:00:25.919> to<00:00:26.359> either<00:00:27.359> use<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:28.349> VR<00:00:28.649> dude<00:00:28.890> or<00:00:29.449> modify

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
have to either use a VR dude or modify

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.770 
have to either use a VR dude or modify
the<00:00:30.509> Arduino<00:00:31.199> IDE<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.040> did<00:00:32.540> you<00:00:33.540> update

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the Arduino IDE that I did you update

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.110 
the Arduino IDE that I did you update
some<00:00:34.200> files<00:00:34.470> and<00:00:34.800> swap<00:00:35.010> some<00:00:35.220> conflicts<00:00:35.790> and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
some files and swap some conflicts and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.050 
some files and swap some conflicts and
things<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.930> get<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.290> work<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.160> basically

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
things to get that work and basically

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.480 
things to get that work and basically
this<00:00:39.600> appears<00:00:40.080> si<00:00:40.560> now<00:00:40.890> let's<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.190> what<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.490 
this appears si now let's see what it is

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:48.260 
this appears si now let's see what it is
called<00:00:42.770> it's<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.630> USB<00:00:45.630> tiny<00:00:46.080> ISP<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.670> that's<00:00:48.060> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
called it's a USB tiny ISP and that's a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.990 
called it's a USB tiny ISP and that's a
USB<00:00:48.990> programmer<00:00:49.530> that's<00:00:49.830> sold<00:00:50.160> by<00:00:50.400> Adafruit

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
USB programmer that's sold by Adafruit

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.230 
USB programmer that's sold by Adafruit
Industries<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:53.250> way<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> program<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
Industries and the way you program the

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.740 
Industries and the way you program the
trinket<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.720> bit<00:00:56.210> different<00:00:57.210> from<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.540> Ori

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
trinket is a bit different from the Ori

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.840 
trinket is a bit different from the Ori
no<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.530> basically<00:00:58.890> select<00:00:59.130> the<00:00:59.370> board<00:00:59.610> here

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
no you basically select the board here

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.310 
no you basically select the board here
which<00:01:00.060> is<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> interpret<00:01:00.720> drink<00:01:00.930> at<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.170> is

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
which is the interpret drink at this is

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.950 
which is the interpret drink at this is
the<00:01:01.410> 8<00:01:01.530> megahertz<00:01:02.010> model<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:03.239> don't<00:01:03.540> select

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the 8 megahertz model you don't select

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.080 
the 8 megahertz model you don't select
any<00:01:04.229> comport<00:01:04.710> instead<00:01:05.219> in<00:01:05.339> program<00:01:05.819> when<00:01:05.999> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
any comport instead in program when you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.480 
any comport instead in program when you
selected<00:01:06.569> a<00:01:06.689> use<00:01:06.929> be<00:01:07.109> tiny<00:01:07.350> ISP<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:10.369> here<00:01:11.369> we

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
selected a use be tiny ISP and here we

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.419 
selected a use be tiny ISP and here we
get<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.880> blink<00:01:12.509> program<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:13.170> pin<00:01:13.409> 0<00:01:13.619> and

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
get a blink program on pin 0 and

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.459 
get a blink program on pin 0 and
basically<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.569> do<00:01:15.719> is<00:01:15.899> if<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.139> hit<00:01:16.259> this

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
basically what to do is if you hit this

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.910 
basically what to do is if you hit this
button<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.490> then<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> will<00:01:18.679> disconnect<00:01:19.679> from

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
button and then it will disconnect from

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.580 
button and then it will disconnect from
USB<00:01:20.280> it'll<00:01:20.999> enter<00:01:21.329> bootloader<00:01:22.020> mode<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
USB it'll enter bootloader mode and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.870 
USB it'll enter bootloader mode and
reconnect<00:01:23.579> again

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
reconnect again

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.190 
reconnect again
so<00:01:24.179> it<00:01:24.299> basically<00:01:24.450> appears<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.469> a<00:01:26.030> isp<00:01:27.200> USB

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
so it basically appears as a isp USB

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.300 
so it basically appears as a isp USB
programmer<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.999> we<00:01:30.149> hit<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
programmer so if we hit that in there it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.039 
programmer so if we hit that in there it
starts<00:01:32.670> flashing<00:01:32.909> we<00:01:33.389> hit<00:01:33.719> upload<00:01:36.920> yeah

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
starts flashing we hit upload yeah

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.529 
starts flashing we hit upload yeah
there's<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.139> blink<00:01:40.499> so<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.609> works<00:01:41.789> pretty<00:01:42.389> well

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
there's a blink so it works pretty well

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.749 
there's a blink so it works pretty well
I<00:01:42.749> have<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.289> say<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.740> bit<00:01:43.889> fiddly<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.639> it

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
I have to say it's a bit fiddly but it

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.929 
I have to say it's a bit fiddly but it
does<00:01:44.909> work<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.740> for<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.159> small<00:01:47.310> project

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
does work and for really small project

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.090 
does work and for really small project
it's<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.359> bad<00:01:48.600> board<00:01:48.950> that<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.069> can

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it's not a bad board that you can

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.559 
it's not a bad board that you can
emulate<00:01:51.679> computer<00:01:52.679> mice<00:01:52.880> keyboards<00:01:53.880> and

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
emulate computer mice keyboards and

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.249 
emulate computer mice keyboards and
other<00:01:55.100> human<00:01:56.100> interface<00:01:56.670> devices<00:01:57.229> which<00:01:58.229> is

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
other human interface devices which is

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.429 
other human interface devices which is
their<00:01:58.709> needs<00:01:58.920> as<00:01:59.249> it's<00:01:59.579> got<00:01:59.789> a<00:01:59.999> proper<00:02:00.569> USB

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
their needs as it's got a proper USB

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.489 
their needs as it's got a proper USB
interface<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.039> it<00:02:03.439> sadly<00:02:04.439> now<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:06.179> serial<00:02:07.109> comm

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
interface on it sadly now a serial comm

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.590 
interface on it sadly now a serial comm
through<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.190> though<00:02:08.459> that's<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.150> bit<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.450> a

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
through this though that's a bit of a

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.010 
through this though that's a bit of a
shame<00:02:09.960> there<00:02:10.320> isn't<00:02:10.560> any<00:02:10.710> UART<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.340> this

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
shame there isn't any UART on this

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.270 
shame there isn't any UART on this
and<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.100> can<00:02:13.310> probably<00:02:13.550> add<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.770> software<00:02:15.770> UART

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
and you can probably add a software UART

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.180 
and you can probably add a software UART
but<00:02:16.670> there<00:02:17.270> isn't<00:02:17.390> any<00:02:17.630> hardware<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.980> what

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
but there isn't any hardware and what

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.970 
but there isn't any hardware and what
yeah<00:02:19.400> that's<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.480> little<00:02:20.990> quick<00:02:21.350> look<00:02:21.650> at<00:02:21.800> the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
yeah that's a little quick look at the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.780 
yeah that's a little quick look at the
Adafruit<00:02:22.820> trinket<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.810> works<00:02:24.580> very<00:02:25.580> well<00:02:25.670> for

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
Adafruit trinket it works very well for

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.850 
Adafruit trinket it works very well for
what<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.480> costs<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.020> what<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.560> would<00:02:27.680> say

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
what it costs and what it is I would say

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.360 
what it costs and what it is I would say
so<00:02:28.580> yeah<00:02:29.230> really<00:02:30.230> really<00:02:30.740> interesting<00:02:31.160> board

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
so yeah really really interesting board
