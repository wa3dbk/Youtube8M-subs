00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.490
 hello my name is carina today explain 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.379
 I'll tell you what to do in biology 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.740
 Behavior understands and experiences something 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:19.320
 Isolation experiment is also learning 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.560
 you the difference between innate ones 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.560
 and learned behavior 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:32.000
 So let's start with what exactly is 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.580
 Actually behave if you have the word 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.850
 You certainly already have behavior 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.850
 a concrete idea maybe 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.120
 Are you thinking of a guzzling dog or 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.559
 to a fleeing rabbit 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.410
 However, you can not behave 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.960
 simply call it a movement because 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.210
 plants also move man 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.390
 but not on the idea of ​​behavior 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.760
 to talk about plants 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.480
 Defining behavior is not so 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.700
 easy 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.140
 that's why there are many different ones 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.270
 definitions 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:11.020
 One can behave under all movements 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.060
 postures as well as the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.450
