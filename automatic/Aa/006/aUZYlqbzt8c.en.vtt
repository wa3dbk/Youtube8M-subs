 officialism by people linking to 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.300
 government can IRLE to light fire to 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.000

 they rested in control of studies that are 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.460
 the documents of life as of 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.910

 the protest is rising the government 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.520
 and that those who are protesting who 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.070
 they are thus denying the right 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.340

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.410
 chest 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.410
 to which we must put in the 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.940
 street has already been clearly said 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.770
 formerly here who did 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.100
 activity of this nature were 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.140
 judged by military courts and 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.330
 it was requested that they be judged by 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.250
 civil courts or the constitution 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.140
 allows everyone who is in a 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.820
 action here we are not at war the 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.540
 war has on them in the head has 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.430

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.539
 our actions against the 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.610
 university were lost even the 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.860
 documents control study 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.220
 boys were cleverly affected 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.900
 but in a recent holder of the national 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.680
 it was intended to make it look like it was the 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.139
 own state that was generating in 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.720
 that door that may be listening 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.430

 Bolivarian University of Venezuela 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.449
 card for which was transformed 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.860
 university that had 34 thousand students 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.110

 around 270 thousand students with 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.470
 an immense variety of opportunity 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.509
 of study for all our youth 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.130
 that was exclusive to one sector and that 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.020
 it was given to the entire population that 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.849
 President Chavez made proud who 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.169
 was inspired by that university and the 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.849
 Bolivarian university and the rest what

 as private 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:26.020
 by the violent group of affection 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:30.169
