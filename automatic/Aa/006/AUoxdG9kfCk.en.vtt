give him a bit of a boost and cheer him
up<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:27.540> thing<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:27.810> we're<00:01:27.930> doing<00:01:28.080> is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
up the thing what we're doing is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.920 
up the thing what we're doing is
presenting<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.560> an<00:01:28.650> iPad<00:01:29.150> yeah<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
presenting with an iPad yeah so that

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.289 
presenting with an iPad yeah so that
will<00:01:31.020> give<00:01:31.140> him<00:01:31.229> some<00:01:31.409> follow<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> walls

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.460 

I<00:01:36.299> think<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.720> plan<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.049> try<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.320> surprise

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I think the plan is to try and surprise

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.770 
I think the plan is to try and surprise
him<00:01:37.770> somehow<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.400> think<00:01:38.610> he'll<00:01:38.820> he'll<00:01:39.630> say

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
him somehow do you think he'll he'll say
