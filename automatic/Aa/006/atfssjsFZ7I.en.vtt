00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
couple times to make sure that the color

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.310 
couple times to make sure that the color
wasn't<00:01:34.470> shining<00:01:34.829> through<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.140> overall<00:01:37.140> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
wasn't shining through and overall it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.660 
wasn't shining through and overall it
turned<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:37.799> cool<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:38.549> I'm

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
turned out really cool but what I'm

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.609 
turned out really cool but what I'm
doing<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.180> I'm<00:01:39.329> making<00:01:39.750> three<00:01:40.140> different

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
doing is I'm making three different

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.740 
doing is I'm making three different
parts<00:01:41.369> two<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.880> them<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:42.060> gonna<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> same

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
parts two of them are gonna be the same

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
parts two of them are gonna be the same
and<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.170> third<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:43.860> gonna<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.250> kind<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.549> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and the third one is gonna be kind of a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:02:02.230 
and the third one is gonna be kind of a
half<00:01:44.939> apart

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.539 

so<00:02:03.240> as<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.960> guys<00:02:04.140> can<00:02:04.350> tell<00:02:04.409> these<00:02:04.860> are<00:02:05.009> super

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
so as you guys can tell these are super

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.280 
so as you guys can tell these are super
easy<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.970> put<00:02:06.119> together<00:02:06.299> even<00:02:07.020> as<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.259> was

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
easy to put together even as I was

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.990 
easy to put together even as I was
gluing<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.920> keeps<00:02:08.190> us<00:02:08.250> together<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.759> thought

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
gluing that keeps us together I thought

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.479 
gluing that keeps us together I thought
oh<00:02:09.149> my<00:02:09.450> gosh<00:02:09.660> if<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.170> added<00:02:10.410> like<00:02:10.709> silver<00:02:11.190> hooks
