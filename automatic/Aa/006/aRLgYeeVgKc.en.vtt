00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.100 
second it's optional I guess if you put
on<00:01:25.890> armor<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.210> black<00:01:27.420> armor<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.990> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
on armor I like the black armor on it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
on armor I like the black armor on it
but<00:01:28.290> again<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:29.040> outfit<00:01:29.369> doesn't<00:01:29.579> call<00:01:29.880> for<00:01:30.150> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
but again the outfit doesn't call for it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.060 
but again the outfit doesn't call for it
so<00:01:30.479> that's<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.409> if<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> want<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.890> put

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so that's up to you if you want to put

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
so that's up to you if you want to put
it<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.280> there<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.939> either<00:01:33.060> way<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.689> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it on there but either way this kind of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.910 
it on there but either way this kind of
reminds<00:01:34.170> me<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.619> know<00:01:34.650> when<00:01:34.829> you're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
reminds me of you know when you're

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.490 
reminds me of you know when you're
playing<00:01:35.130> games<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.090> militia<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.630> enemy<00:01:37.200> team

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
playing games the militia the enemy team

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.100 
playing games the militia the enemy team
the<00:01:38.100> bad<00:01:38.369> guys<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> speak<00:01:39.360> they<00:01:39.810> always

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the bad guys so to speak they always

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.770 
the bad guys so to speak they always
wear<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.560> red<00:01:40.890> clothing<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.970> them<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.420> if

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
wear like a red clothing to them so if

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.749 
wear like a red clothing to them so if
you<00:01:42.810> want<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.890> type<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.250> character

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
you want to be that type of character

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.460 
you want to be that type of character
then<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:45.810> nice<00:01:45.930> outfit<00:01:46.290> for

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
then this is a really nice outfit for

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.590 
then this is a really nice outfit for
you<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.130> next<00:01:47.369> outfit<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.240> called

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you the next outfit we have is called

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.620 
you the next outfit we have is called
Mario<00:01:49.170> now<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.369> isn't<00:01:50.640> exactly<00:01:51.060> like

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
Mario now this one isn't exactly like

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899 
Mario now this one isn't exactly like
you<00:01:51.960> know<00:01:52.079> Mario<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> game<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.759> it's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
you know Mario in the game but it's

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.310 
you know Mario in the game but it's
really<00:01:54.090> close<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.899> looks<00:01:55.229> pretty

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
really close and I think it looks pretty

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.260 
really close and I think it looks pretty
cool<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:55.649> obviously<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.640> start<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:56.939> off<00:01:57.060> we

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
cool so obviously to start it off we

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.940 
cool so obviously to start it off we
have<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.390> red<00:01:57.719> tank<00:01:58.020> top<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:58.799> also

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
have a red tank top and then we also

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.580 
have a red tank top and then we also
have<00:01:59.159> blue<00:01:59.369> track<00:01:59.640> pants<00:02:00.090> copper<00:02:00.930> work<00:02:01.290> boots

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
have blue track pants copper work boots

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.969

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and a red flat cap and when you put it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.950 
and a red flat cap and when you put it
on<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.700> definitely<00:02:06.149> look<00:02:06.299> like<00:02:06.329> Mario<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
little bit and it's kind of funny to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.979 
little bit and it's kind of funny to
just<00:02:08.610> go<00:02:08.729> run<00:02:08.910> around<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.330> streets<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.840> maybe

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
just go run around the streets and maybe

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.470 
just go run around the streets and maybe
if<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.289> had<00:02:10.470> like<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.619> Mario<00:02:11.099> themed<00:02:11.580> car<00:02:11.940> this

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
with the bane mask I don't know what

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
with the bane mask I don't know what
else<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.420> want<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.630> call<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:30.960> but<00:02:31.140> it's

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
else you want to call this one but it's

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.620 
else you want to call this one but it's
the<00:02:31.260> black<00:02:31.500> mask<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:33.090> know<00:02:33.180> as<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.450> see

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
the black mask that you know as you see

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.550 
the black mask that you know as you see
on<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.810> screen<00:02:33.900> right<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.530> I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
on the screen right here and I

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.320 
on the screen right here and I
definitely<00:02:35.340> think<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.730> one<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:35.970> pretty<00:02:36.120> cool

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
definitely think this one is pretty cool

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.760 
definitely think this one is pretty cool
and<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.660> guess<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:37.080> wanted<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.500> you<00:02:37.710> don't

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
and I guess if you wanted to you don't

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.500 
and I guess if you wanted to you don't
need<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.040> add<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.400> mask<00:02:38.640> that's<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.450> of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
need to add the mask that's kind of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.060 
need to add the mask that's kind of
optional<00:02:39.960> but<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.200> think<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.470> adds<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.860> little

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
optional but I think it adds a little

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.370 
optional but I think it adds a little
bit<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.550> outfit<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.960> definitely

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
bit to the outfit and it definitely

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.080 
bit to the outfit and it definitely
looks<00:02:43.560> like<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.920> mercenary<00:02:44.430> if<00:02:44.670> you're<00:02:44.790> going

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
looks like a mercenary if you're going

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.640 
looks like a mercenary if you're going

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.620 
for that look but moving on we have the
mobster<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.670> one<00:02:47.880> consists<00:02:48.240> of<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.420> lot<00:02:48.600> of
