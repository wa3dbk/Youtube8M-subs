00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.660
 chile perÃº jessica chile is going to go well 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.850
 as a sovereign within this group and 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.700
 says that they are going to achieve much more than 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.950
 what they thought if they frustrates 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.650
 fact that you have to work hard and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.199
 that they have to run too much like that 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.720
 They get tired very well, but it is 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.880
 very worked the party one of the most 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.039
 injured makes a goal and is super 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 important to the group because it gives them 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.839
 tranquility in the first stage but 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.420
 one of the injured as it falls and not 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:36.120
 can work in the other party it 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.510
 unstable much destabilizes the group 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.640
 the chile group looks somehow 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.920
 returning to organize to be able 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.739
 defend the places and rearming 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.469
 they have a person within the group who 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.870
 He is very affectionate and organizes them all 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.460
 when this fails and probably they 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.589
 says where they have to work what 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.960
 they have to do and how they look good 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.600
 dynamic and the possibility that Chile 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.370
 meat is eminent because it has a 10 of 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.769
 gold that is a total triumph and the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.840
 empress the Empress is super good 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.469
 it did not come out in another game that came out 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.750
 in relation but Peru is seen with a 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.789
 very prominent young man who works 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.340
 I burn but sometimes air noise and even 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.920
 violent everyone celebrates all what 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.869
 support up could I have a part 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.030
 important among media of the party of 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.159
 triumph but after they leave 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.920
 tears because there is a strength that he 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.170
 can not beat the strengths for me 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.509
 is the archer says who can achieve 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.729
 important things up valuable in the 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.530
 place but then the archer limits him 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.049
 to the goals and probably the guy 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.390
 has more than one goal but not everyone wins 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.719
 in that it's like they're there in the 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.479
 goal of that idea is there your name 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.060
 Peru team that is like enojon is 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.280
 rabid and is older he is a little 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.709
 injured will walk very upset and believe 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.770
 some problems and fight until 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.840
 there may be a fight that goes further and 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.000
 who comes to an institution because 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.579
 probably angry with indignation 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.940
 with someone from the group and probably goes 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.069
 to have another quarrel says that to work 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.810
 with balance and with order and 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.540
 they probably look super 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.540
 well on the court and in the place they 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.239
 they emphasize in working very well that yes that 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.980
 they work pretty well only the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.590
 fact that there is triumph and tears 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.480
 would show them that probably not 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.480
 achieve the necessary goal that they 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.890
 they want but probably the same and it's a 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.580
 challenge and it's quite powerful 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.580
 Chile 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.599
 Chile has to put their fears inside 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.060
 the court and says it fears 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.340
 move away in the second time says that 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.739
 they touch roots in the second 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.900
 pretty good although the same in the first 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.900
 you see a goal inside the cards 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.280
 and Peru has a lot of wisdom to win 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.260
 but within your wisdom lose the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.719
 control and they get anxious because 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.939
 probably one of the Chileans we 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.569
 it hurts a lot in the arch in some 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.569
 moment
