also<00:00:59.850> use<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> microwave<00:01:00.660> but<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.170> prefer<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
also use a microwave but I prefer this

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.650 
also use a microwave but I prefer this
method<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.760> don't<00:01:03.210> bread<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
method because I don't bread the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.060

chocolate

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.740 

so<00:01:13.070> every<00:01:13.369> few<00:01:13.580> minutes<00:01:13.729> I'm<00:01:14.090> just<00:01:14.360> giving<00:01:14.689> a

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
so every few minutes I'm just giving a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.510 
so every few minutes I'm just giving a
disservice<00:01:15.140> about<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.950> heat<00:01:16.250> can<00:01:16.490> be

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
disservice about the heat can be

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.749 
disservice about the heat can be
distributed<00:01:16.939> evenly<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:18.340> soon<00:01:19.340> enough<00:01:19.580> it

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
distributed evenly and soon enough it

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.670 
distributed evenly and soon enough it
should<00:01:19.970> become<00:01:20.299> glossy<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:20.930> smooth<00:01:21.259> just

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
should become glossy and smooth just

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.830 
should become glossy and smooth just
like<00:01:21.920> this<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.580> you<00:01:23.000> want<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.210> take<00:01:23.360> it<00:01:23.479> off<00:01:23.690> of

like this and you want to take it off of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.910 
like this and you want to take it off of
the<00:01:23.869> heat<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:26.049> now<00:01:27.049> you're<00:01:27.200> going<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.619> place

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
the heat and now you're going to place

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.889 
the heat and now you're going to place
the<00:01:28.130> melted<00:01:28.670> chocolate<00:01:28.880> onto<00:01:29.570> your<00:01:29.690> baking

the melted chocolate onto your baking

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.120 
the melted chocolate onto your baking
sheet<00:01:32.020> now<00:01:33.020> I'm<00:01:33.080> taking<00:01:33.320> an<00:01:33.590> offset<00:01:34.009> spatula

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
sheet now I'm taking an offset spatula

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.180 
sheet now I'm taking an offset spatula
to<00:01:34.789> spread<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.210> choc<00:01:35.450> evenly<00:01:36.049> as<00:01:36.170> I<00:01:36.320> can<00:01:36.590> if

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
to spread the choc evenly as I can if

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.130 
to spread the choc evenly as I can if
you<00:01:37.280> don't<00:01:37.460> have<00:01:37.640> an<00:01:37.759> offset<00:01:38.149> spatula<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:38.960> can

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
you don't have an offset spatula you can

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.960 
you don't have an offset spatula you can
simply<00:01:39.530> use<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.680> butter<00:01:40.009> knife<00:01:40.070> or<00:01:40.580> just<00:01:40.850> a

simply use a butter knife or just a
regular<00:01:41.119> spatula<00:01:41.690> will<00:01:42.170> work<00:01:42.409> as<00:01:42.619> well<00:01:58.240> so

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
regular spatula will work as well so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.399

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.499 
to melt down your white chocolate and I
added<00:02:06.770> some<00:02:06.950> green<00:02:07.490> food<00:02:07.819> coloring<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.330> this

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
added some green food coloring to this

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.359 
added some green food coloring to this
but<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:09.319> don't<00:02:09.440> have<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.890> if<00:02:09.979> you<00:02:10.100> don't<00:02:10.130> want

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
but you don't have to if you don't want

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.490 
but you don't have to if you don't want
to<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:11.000> just<00:02:11.480> thought<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.019> would<00:02:12.140> be<00:02:12.290> more

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
to I just thought it would be more

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.740 
to I just thought it would be more
festive<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.430> I'm<00:02:13.730> just<00:02:13.970> spreading<00:02:14.299> this<00:02:14.510> white

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
festive so I'm just spreading this white

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.140 
festive so I'm just spreading this white
chocolate<00:02:14.989> out<00:02:15.410> over<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.220> regular<00:02:16.700> chocolate

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
chocolate out over the regular chocolate

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.289 
chocolate out over the regular chocolate
and<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:18.680> you<00:02:18.920> can<00:02:19.040> see<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.280> kind<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.790> melted<00:02:20.209> the

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
and as you can see I kind of melted the

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.180 
and as you can see I kind of melted the
chocolate<00:02:20.480> layer<00:02:20.870> underneath<00:02:21.230> but<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.070> the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
chocolate layer underneath but in the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.520 
chocolate layer underneath but in the
end<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.519> turned<00:02:22.700> out<00:02:22.910> okay<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:23.299> it<00:02:23.870> wasn't<00:02:24.260> that

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
end it turned out okay so it wasn't that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:33.170 
end it turned out okay so it wasn't that
much<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:25.010> problem

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.910 

so<00:02:34.180> now<00:02:34.330> you're<00:02:34.480> going<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.990> do<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.290> fun<00:02:35.530> part

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
so now you're going to do the fun part

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.160 
so now you're going to do the fun part
which<00:02:36.160> is<00:02:36.220> sprinkling<00:02:36.970> on<00:02:37.270> all<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.690> toppings

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
which is sprinkling on all the toppings

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.640 
which is sprinkling on all the toppings
so<00:02:39.160> again<00:02:39.760> here<00:02:40.030> I'm<00:02:40.120> just<00:02:40.330> using<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.900> baking

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
