it really is brutally difficult and it
almost<00:03:47.730> seems<00:03:48.000> like<00:03:48.060> David<00:03:48.480> Gray<00:03:48.720> has<00:03:48.989> tried

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
almost seems like David Gray has tried

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.630 
almost seems like David Gray has tried
to<00:03:49.319> make<00:03:49.439> the<00:03:49.590> levels<00:03:49.860> as<00:03:49.980> frustrating<00:03:50.579> as

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
to make the levels as frustrating as

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.240 
to make the levels as frustrating as
possible<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:52.049> game's<00:03:52.260> real<00:03:52.500> saving<00:03:52.890> grace<00:03:53.069> is

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
possible the game's real saving grace is

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.500 
possible the game's real saving grace is
the<00:03:53.370> writing<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:53.790> content<00:03:54.269> which<00:03:54.390> is

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
the writing and content which is

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.809 
the writing and content which is
undeniably<00:03:55.140> original<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:56.220> first<00:03:56.459> episode

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
undeniably original the first episode

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.490 
undeniably original the first episode
ends<00:03:57.120> with<00:03:57.150> Hugo<00:03:57.569> trapped<00:03:57.870> in<00:03:57.989> some<00:03:58.200> sort<00:03:58.439> of

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
ends with Hugo trapped in some sort of

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.259 
ends with Hugo trapped in some sort of
alternate<00:03:58.890> dimension<00:03:59.400> leaving<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.150> on<00:04:00.209> a

alternate dimension leaving it on a

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.330 
alternate dimension leaving it on a
really<00:04:00.569> fantastic<00:04:00.780> cliffhanger<00:04:01.680> but

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
really fantastic cliffhanger but

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.860 
really fantastic cliffhanger but
ultimately<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.909> enjoyment<00:04:03.359> factor<00:04:03.450> is<00:04:03.720> all

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
ultimately the enjoyment factor is all

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.000 
ultimately the enjoyment factor is all
let<00:04:04.019> down<00:04:04.200> by<00:04:04.439> some<00:04:04.620> really<00:04:04.920> bad<00:04:05.129> design<00:04:07.010> for

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
let down by some really bad design for

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.259 
let down by some really bad design for
the<00:04:08.069> longest<00:04:08.370> time<00:04:08.579> I<00:04:08.609> only<00:04:08.909> ever<00:04:09.060> had<00:04:09.239> a

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
the longest time I only ever had a

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.640 
the longest time I only ever had a
shareware<00:04:09.659> copy<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:09.989> this<00:04:10.079> game<00:04:10.290> which<00:04:10.440> meant

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
shareware copy of this game which meant

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.080 
shareware copy of this game which meant
I<00:04:10.739> never<00:04:10.950> truly<00:04:11.190> got<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.489> experience<00:04:12.030> a

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
I never truly got to experience a

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.279 
I never truly got to experience a
complete<00:04:12.450> nightmare<00:04:12.659> 3d<00:04:13.200> game<00:04:15.229> during<00:04:16.229> a

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
complete nightmare 3d game during a

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.779 
complete nightmare 3d game during a
period<00:04:16.530> when<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.769> was<00:04:16.799> preparing<00:04:16.979> this<00:04:17.430> review

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
period when I was preparing this review

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.430 
period when I was preparing this review
I<00:04:17.820> actually<00:04:18.150> found<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:18.630> copy<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.049> game<00:04:19.229> on

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
I actually found a copy of the game on

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.340 
I actually found a copy of the game on
David's<00:04:19.859> still<00:04:20.100> existing<00:04:20.669> website<00:04:21.350> somewhere

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
David's still existing website somewhere

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.080 
David's still existing website somewhere
deep<00:04:22.620> inside<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.130> me<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.220> actually<00:04:23.550> thought<00:04:23.910> the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
deep inside of me I actually thought the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.580 
deep inside of me I actually thought the
ensuing<00:04:24.389> chapters<00:04:24.960> might<00:04:25.139> be<00:04:25.289> a<00:04:25.320> little<00:04:25.500> bit

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
ensuing chapters might be a little bit

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.830 
ensuing chapters might be a little bit
better<00:04:25.740> than<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.010> first<00:04:26.340> so<00:04:27.030> what<00:04:27.180> did<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.419> do

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
better than the first so what did I do

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.129 
better than the first so what did I do
yeah<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.620> bought<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.870> last<00:04:31.020> two

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
yeah I bought it and is the last two

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.409 
yeah I bought it and is the last two
chapters<00:04:31.349> any<00:04:31.620> better<00:04:31.860> no<00:04:32.520> it's<00:04:33.060> more<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.360> the

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
chapters any better no it's more of the

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.719 
chapters any better no it's more of the
same<00:04:33.650> even<00:04:34.650> worse<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.099> it<00:04:35.190> seems<00:04:35.430> like<00:04:35.610> the

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
same even worse is it it seems like the

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.339 
same even worse is it it seems like the
version<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:36.120> bought<00:04:36.389> has<00:04:36.570> updated<00:04:36.930> some<00:04:37.199> of<00:04:37.289> the

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
version I bought has updated some of the

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.810 
version I bought has updated some of the
graphics<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.919> textures<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.520> enemy

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
graphics to the textures and enemy

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.610 
graphics to the textures and enemy
models<00:04:39.120> yet<00:04:39.660> they<00:04:39.810> strange<00:04:40.199> you<00:04:40.320> left<00:04:40.530> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
models yet they strange you left the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.920 
models yet they strange you left the
majority<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:41.070> things<00:04:41.370> unchanged<00:04:42.210> which<00:04:42.720> just

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
majority of things unchanged which just

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.939 
majority of things unchanged which just
makes<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.199> game<00:04:43.410> look<00:04:43.590> like<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.830> has<00:04:43.919> a

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
makes the game look like it has a

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.700 
makes the game look like it has a
mishmash<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.490> art<00:04:44.699> styles<00:04:45.349> but<00:04:46.349> look<00:04:46.470> at<00:04:46.620> the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
mishmash of art styles but look at the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.990 
mishmash of art styles but look at the
end<00:04:46.860> of<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:47.010> day<00:04:47.160> I've<00:04:47.370> got<00:04:47.400> nothing<00:04:47.880> but

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
end of the day I've got nothing but

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.089 
end of the day I've got nothing but

just too confusing frustrating maze hunt

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.230 
just too confusing frustrating maze hunt
which<00:05:19.110> loses<00:05:19.500> its<00:05:19.620> appeal<00:05:19.740> very<00:05:20.460> early<00:05:20.760> on<00:05:20.789> if

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
FPS then maybe something like

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.020 
FPS then maybe something like
Wolfenstein<00:05:25.650> 3d<00:05:25.979> or<00:05:26.159> catacombs<00:05:26.639> is<00:05:26.789> a<00:05:26.820> better
