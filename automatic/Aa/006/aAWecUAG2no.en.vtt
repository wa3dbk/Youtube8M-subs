spring

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.580 

so<00:01:18.060> anyway<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> thought<00:01:18.630> I'd<00:01:18.780> show<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:21.590> it

so anyway I thought I'd show you this it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:32.789 
so anyway I thought I'd show you this it
is<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:23.040> gorgeous

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.010 

and<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:34.180> video<00:01:34.390> probably<00:01:35.109> does<00:01:35.799> not<00:01:36.009> do<00:01:36.280> this

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and this video probably does not do this

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:47.520 
and this video probably does not do this
justice<00:01:38.020> at<00:01:38.469> all<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:41.409> it<00:01:41.530> counts<00:01:41.710> for<00:01:41.950> t-shirt

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.700 

the<00:01:47.950> sheet<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.340> comes<00:01:48.550> in<00:01:48.760> is<00:01:48.970> pretty<00:01:49.360> cool

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the sheet that comes in is pretty cool

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.660 
the sheet that comes in is pretty cool
what<00:01:50.710> it's<00:01:50.860> made<00:01:51.010> out<00:01:51.160> I<00:01:51.220> think<00:01:51.520> it's

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.090 

so<00:01:57.670> anyway<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.210> is<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.420> good<00:01:58.780> degree<00:01:59.530> from

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
so anyway this is the good degree from

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.050 
so anyway this is the good degree from
all<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.890> would<00:02:06.040> make<00:02:06.190> its<00:02:06.490> can<00:02:06.610> make<00:02:06.760> a<00:02:06.790> really

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
all it would make its can make a really

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.290 
all it would make its can make a really
good<00:02:07.300> machete

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
good machete

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:23.520 
good machete
I<00:02:09.330> thought<00:02:09.630> I'd<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:09.930> that<00:02:10.170> much

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.700 

anyway<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.250> thought<00:02:24.490> I'd<00:02:24.640> share<00:02:24.850> this<00:02:25.000> with<00:02:25.180> you

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
anyway I thought I'd share this with you

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.850 
anyway I thought I'd share this with you
nothing<00:02:26.710> to<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.070> with<00:02:27.160> motorcycles<00:02:27.820> but<00:02:28.860> very

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
nothing to do with motorcycles but very

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.770 
nothing to do with motorcycles but very
very<00:02:30.280> cool<00:02:30.550> knife

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.710 

we'll<00:02:38.320> talk<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.680> later
