00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.400
 so that's the vacuum terroir that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.679
 does that rhombus mean so who is 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.540
 so it's professional equipment that 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.369
 it's the salary he's going to give away 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.289
 this is surely under vacuum this is our 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.490
 lady and a board inside it's 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.010
 depending on the capacity and especially 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.590
 the size of your sachets so good there we 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.609
 the aged heart as it's individuals so 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.990
 I had bluntly put it all 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.880
 save people like in a credit 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.969
 tight when I hear sachets of 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.860
 depth if not to be able to 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.219
 position also positioned sorry for the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.899
 bag as flat as possible 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.000
 I put the end directly to 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.450
 level 2 of the band that will allow 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.239
 to seal I close the lid and then 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.620
 after actually i have the choice of p1 called 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.300
 In fact, these are all programs 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.100
 for we will say parameterize the amount 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.230
 of air emphasizes that I that I wish 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.750
 to the news so so urd youth 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.129
 is simple you can actually save 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.939
 according to the foods can 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.900
 save different percentages of 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.909
 obviously remove on animals a 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.979
 little bit sturdy like the fish the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.799
 meat we ask the maximum it is to 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.210
 say to 99 cents if I do it by 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.580
 example on a treble like a tomato 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.950
 sigean the slingers who swallows crushed 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.330
 on eggs it's the same, so it's 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.890
 there once I launch there in a 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.140
 first time via the ball 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.930
 I extract under the bell era the air 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.659
 is rejected outside and ultimately 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.390
 that we will get closer to the 99 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.219
 dust be more time press 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.319
 learns that it takes a little less 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.840
 one minute 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.789
 we will actually see the air 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.530
 which will be removed directly from 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.270
 sachet though free was created in the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.350
 bell there we go last 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.350
 percentages are 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.850
 I wish to interrogate press the 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.210
 touch if they wish to interrupt at 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.210
 4 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.439
 I extract the air directly which was 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.799
 good 5 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:19.239
 I'm waiting for the program I had 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:24.629
 programmed appear and there I can 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.629
 open it is welded the layouts 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.140
 just the question of this place and that 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.480
 you attacked me as you see he is the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.570
 coordinator ge yes then freezers 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.650
 refrigerators for this done since his 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.180
 yes because it's plastic 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.490
 food so it goes up to 120 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.890
 degrees like in cooking with the 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.890
 steam programs goes beyond 96
