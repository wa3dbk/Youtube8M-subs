 hello preparing an egg casserole 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.130
 the perfect companion for the small meal 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.799
 of Sunday night for example so this is 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.890
 very simple very easy to do some 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.230
 ingredients to new a little cream 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.300
 thick salt and pepper and that's 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.859
 everything then in my ramekins I have a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.689
 little butter to butter 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.810
 precisely the ramekin I will add 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.489
 then a little cream in the bottom of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.420
 ramekin I have table and there I go 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:39.230
 pepper here is a little bit 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.230
 salt flower 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:48.390
 then I break my time on this 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.910
 cream here avoiding to pierce the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.829
 yellow and I'm going to add a little bit 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.690
 of pro cream on it so it's not 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.079
 inevitably a dish diet that I am 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.789
 okay but in any case it's 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.950
 delicious and above I'll add 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.930

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.510
 7.9 at the bain-marie 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.340
 but we will put hot water from in to 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.420
 about half the height of the ramekin 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.420
 and we go to the oven so to the bain marie 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.520

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:28.179
