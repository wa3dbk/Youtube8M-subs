00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.900
 four girls are just on is like on 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.760
 the beach promenade have this morning 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.050
 packed our feedbacks and thought us 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.820
 we'll show you what we all have today 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.820
 so nice have a lot of fun 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.960
 First, I always have one 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 sunglasses with me because I like this 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.120
 I'm totally sensitive to the human 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.739
 Sunlight I have now for 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.480
 video kindly taken off but 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.949
 I always need one in midsummer 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 sunglasses because I otherwise connect too 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.750
 Find 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.570
 that does not look so nice , especially 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 not then Cannes is second 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.379
 of course, a book is included 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.489
 I'm the total books for that 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.170
 I think so, too 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.210
 on youtube of james that from him 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.530
 looks at the poor and that is a whole 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.149
 little love story at college 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.609
 game I have on the away actually 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 Almost read 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.729
 the pages or visibly sorry just like that 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.619
 and I'm curious how it goes on then 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.950
 I have in mind when that was in the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.080
 glossybox trend so thermal water 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.640
 Refreshment straits quite the wrong thing 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.860
 only water but if somehow 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.149
 time is and you are not in the water 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.890
 want to go to the reading rat is easy 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.810
 on the arms or in the face how to 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.280
 Whatever the want and I find that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.170
 really great because it is such a 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.400
 small fresh kick gives then if one 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.540
 Of course, what else would like to eat or 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.740
 who wants to buy an ice should 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.090
 Of course you just come with the song 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.960
 Display of mango is certainly already 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.210
 three years old 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.340
 at that time was 1 11 15 euro costs so 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.810
 very practical has many beautiful subjects 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.979
 in there and there are the whole 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.640
 important things in it like ec cards or 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.340
 badge so everything you actually 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.990
 A vacation needs money as 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.939
 Allergy I hope I have mine 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.380
 We take this bag because I really 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.909
 getting snow all day long for that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.530
 if soon the spring somehow 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.850
 I am the whole of people 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.610
 time in mini is then always snow 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.960
 that's why the paperbacks a must 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.450
 have in my beach beck or 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.920
 General of my purse and what 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.620
 Of course, the water is still whole 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.440
 The script is super great Italian 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.340

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.260
 Every handbag especially now at the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.060

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.990
 liter if not even 3 4 liters of water 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.430
 drink in the daytime 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.110
 but I have those little ones 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.320
 Several of my fantasies are in there because of us 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.340

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.200

 In addition, I have a few more 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.060
 other things I want to show you 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.590

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.430
 little bit of control 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.590
 Of course I have to fight boredom 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.880
 Do something on the beach and have it 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.410

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.510

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.600
 to simply hold all I here 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.340
 Of course I live the whole time 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.830
 the most important things are water 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.840
 my mobile phone and things in addition 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.030

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.480
 I only have that day on the 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.740
 started the same and so far I find 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.610
 quite well I have time I see have 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.560
 I have not seen the movie yet 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.490
 he seems to be above me but yes he has to 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.260
 in any case and music because I can 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.340
 not on the stand somehow lying around and 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.030
 I do not have to do anything 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.170
 music were 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.840
 and now I have this one 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.890
 simple mp3 player with 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.880
 and that we are even on the 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.540
 can bring 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.490
 a big beach towel okay what the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.390
 girls have not shown what completely 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.520
 important is 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.140
 sunscreen in any case and I have 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.360
 Here is a super handy that is one 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.680
 sun spray what transparent is that 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.359
 means you can just do it 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.620
 do not need a lot of fun 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.930
 and forth that simply moves into the skin 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.240
 one with SPF 30 was dubai 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.100
 it is important here in the ikea it is something 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.770
 from heinz and then I have for all 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.450
 still an extra bikini 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.400
 mails in this cool bikini tank from 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.660
 driver is if it is so 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.070
 is that I change clothes quickly 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.570
 because the clothes still leave or 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.280
 like that and we are going to eat somehow 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.970
 or something, then I can always fast 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.400
 switch 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.430
 and maybe very interesting 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.100
 is because we film a lot here too 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.230
 that's why I have my little lowepro 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.550
 With it I can also underwater 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.080
 recordings are what we do now 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.570
 It's going to be really cool 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.890
 and yes, I would say that was it 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.240
 content of our bags that 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.800
 most important thing we in any case 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.360
 and we'll go straight back 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.740
 back to the beach and enjoy one 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.090
 a bit the great weather and we see 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.440
 hopefully we'll be down here soon 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.300
 two videos linked look at you 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.300
 necessarily on and see you next time
