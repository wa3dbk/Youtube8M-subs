00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
here and there so it's find the point

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.510 
here and there so it's find the point
that<00:03:55.230> out<00:03:55.350> that<00:03:55.380> he<00:03:55.560> does<00:03:55.740> come<00:03:56.010> with<00:03:56.220> an<00:03:56.340> extra

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
that out that he does come with an extra

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.120 
that out that he does come with an extra
fist<00:03:56.850> again<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:58.020> like<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.590> head<00:03:58.740> sculpt<00:03:59.010> on

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
fist again I like the head sculpt on

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.250 
fist again I like the head sculpt on
this<00:03:59.250> figure<00:03:59.550> I<00:04:00.000> like<00:04:00.570> how<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.780> eyes<00:04:00.990> are

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
this figure I like how the eyes are

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.050 
this figure I like how the eyes are
silver<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.680> just<00:04:02.130> gives<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.460> that<00:04:02.490> menacing

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
silver and just gives it that menacing

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.650 
silver and just gives it that menacing
look<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.680> guess<00:04:05.370> we'll<00:04:05.550> get<00:04:05.640> into<00:04:05.820> some<00:04:06.360> of

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
look so I guess we'll get into some of

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.940 
look so I guess we'll get into some of
the<00:04:06.750> detail<00:04:07.050> let<00:04:07.200> me<00:04:07.260> just<00:04:07.410> back<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.770> camera

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
the detail let me just back the camera

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.160 
the detail let me just back the camera
up<00:04:08.070> a<00:04:08.130> little<00:04:08.310> bit<00:04:11.300> so<00:04:12.300> I<00:04:12.330> guess<00:04:12.600> we'll<00:04:13.080> start

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
up a little bit so I guess we'll start

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.280 
up a little bit so I guess we'll start
from<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.590> bottom<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.550> figure<00:04:15.049> so<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.140> can
