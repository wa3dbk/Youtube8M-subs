through this with me so let's jump in
right<00:01:22.950> now<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.340> start<00:01:23.610> laying<00:01:23.790> our<00:01:23.939> pearl

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
right now and start laying our pearl

00:01:24.119 --> 00:02:10.410 
right now and start laying our pearl
coats<00:01:24.390> down

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.500 

now<00:02:11.260> this<00:02:11.470> was<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.710> very<00:02:12.100> fun<00:02:12.280> project<00:02:13.210> and<00:02:13.300> a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
now this was a very fun project and a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.990 
now this was a very fun project and a
great<00:02:13.900> experiment<00:02:14.620> for<00:02:15.040> us<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.340> ocean<00:02:15.850> blue

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
great experiment for us the ocean blue

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.780 
great experiment for us the ocean blue
pearl<00:02:16.360> did<00:02:16.870> exactly<00:02:17.709> what<00:02:18.040> we<00:02:18.160> wanted<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.760> to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
pearl did exactly what we wanted it to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.480 
pearl did exactly what we wanted it to
do<00:02:19.180> it's<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:19.870> enhancing<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.980> light<00:02:21.220> blue

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
do it's just enhancing the light blue

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.280 
do it's just enhancing the light blue
Plasti<00:02:22.030> Dip<00:02:22.060> base<00:02:22.360> underneath<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:23.110> not

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
Plasti Dip base underneath it's not

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.140 
Plasti Dip base underneath it's not
covering<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.950> smothering<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.030> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
covering and smothering it and the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.240 
covering and smothering it and the
effect<00:02:25.569> on<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.140> actually<00:02:26.800> increasing

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
effect on that is actually increasing

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.910 
effect on that is actually increasing
the<00:02:27.520> depth<00:02:28.000> tremendously<00:02:28.959> we<00:02:29.350> let<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.680> light

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
the depth tremendously we let the light

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.010 
the depth tremendously we let the light
blue<00:02:30.130> bass<00:02:30.370> play<00:02:30.850> a<00:02:30.880> big<00:02:31.209> role<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.840> end
