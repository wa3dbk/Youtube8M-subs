scared<00:00:31.910> but<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.210> strongly<00:00:33.870> believe<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.440> there

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
scared but I strongly believe that there

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.510 
scared but I strongly believe that there
was<00:00:35.309> two<00:00:36.059> factors<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:37.350> have<00:00:37.520> combined

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
was two factors that have combined

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.290 
was two factors that have combined
strongly<00:00:39.920> will<00:00:40.920> contribute<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> success

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
strongly will contribute to the success

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.910 
strongly will contribute to the success
of<00:00:42.510> passing<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> NCLEX<00:00:43.530> exam<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:45.680> those<00:00:46.680> two

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
of passing the NCLEX exam and those two

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.029 
of passing the NCLEX exam and those two
factors<00:00:47.399> are<00:00:49.489> motivation<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.969> inspiration

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
factors are motivation and inspiration

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.160 
factors are motivation and inspiration
now<00:00:53.300> both<00:00:54.300> usually<00:00:54.600> go<00:00:55.020> hand<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.379> hand<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
now both usually go hand in hand and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.720 
now both usually go hand in hand and
symbiotically<00:00:58.170> right<00:00:58.590> since<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.100> order<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.579> be

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
symbiotically right since in order to be

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.500 
symbiotically right since in order to be
motivated<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.690> has<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:02.059> usually<00:01:03.059> be

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
motivated one has to be usually be

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.000 
motivated one has to be usually be
inspired<00:01:04.100> but<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> also<00:01:05.430> believe<00:01:06.119> that

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
inspired but I also believe that

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.890 
inspired but I also believe that
inspiration<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:09.119> search<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.659> greater

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
inspiration in a search of a greater

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.960 
inspiration in a search of a greater
purpose<00:01:10.260> or<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> deeper<00:01:11.040> sense<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.490> meaning

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
purpose or a deeper sense of meaning

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.350 
purpose or a deeper sense of meaning
that<00:01:12.930> leads<00:01:13.740> us<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.400> extraordinary<00:01:14.850> things

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
that leads us to do extraordinary things

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.789 
that leads us to do extraordinary things
often<00:01:16.340> we<00:01:17.340> think<00:01:17.369> such<00:01:17.939> as<00:01:18.119> passing<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.689> NCLEX

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
often we think such as passing the NCLEX

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.969 
often we think such as passing the NCLEX
can<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:20.040> very<00:01:20.759> beneficial<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:22.439> our<00:01:22.470> mindset

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
can be very beneficial to our mindset

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.080 
can be very beneficial to our mindset
and<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:24.119> kind<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.479> leads<00:01:24.689> me<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> my<00:01:25.080> story<00:01:25.530> I
