 only a few more times to sleep then 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.470
 they finally microsofts next gen 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.010
 console the xbox one 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.719
 who of you the 499 euro on the table 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.759
 lays out for the new console 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.850
 Of course he wants some new ones as well 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.529
 and fat exclusive games gambling which 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.750
 but are the first day ever 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.119
 available and worth playing 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.519
 the purchase is really a little here 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.359
 guide with all xbox of exclusive 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.820
 Start titles cute and gaudy 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.680
 it in suzuka kuhn too in the business 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.649
 you have to do your own simulation like that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.879
 Build and manage sounds 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.800
 undemanding but the predecessors had 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.520
 especially with the manager aspects much 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.530
 draft 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.360
 the game is developed by frontier 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.950
 developments that guys and girls have 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.989
 already with rollercoaster tycoon 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.629
 proved that the business simulations 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.969
 So Tycoon has been doing a real thing so far 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.710
 good impression of the tycoon brand 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.719
 That may well with a purchase 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.670
 by the way , flirting with tycoon appears 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.870
 also with a stripped-down graphic for 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.280
 The xbox 360 with xbox fitness is available 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.869
 again a sports game which you 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.400
 using kinect and many 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.570
 workouts to the dream body 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.700
 to help 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.740
 if that really works we know 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.900
 Although not everyone can 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.700
 an xbox live gold abo has the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.700
 use fitness software for free 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.659
 rice fan of rome from german 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.920
 developer studio crytek has a real one 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.049
 had a difficult time 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.479
 Originally, the Romans Metsos 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.159
 play a kinect game from this one 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.140
 Idea is adopted, however 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.939
 still in the early stages of development and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.579
 now relies on a classic gameplay 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.100
 with the controller though she boldly 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.470
 bombastic from the actual game 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.030
 but did not convince us yet 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.920
 Often we had to go in the demoversion 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.299
 just at the right moment on the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.100
 press the right button 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.079
 First of all, the currency applies here 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100
 wait and see the criticism of 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.100
 wait for the press 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.750
 but we have to wait for this game 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.479
 not a single second forsa 5-win 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.310
 Bombastic leaking butter was me and 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.590
 is a phenomenal racing game 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.090
 many ps-boliden many 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.560
 different lengths 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.750
 mature multiplayer and 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.269
 of course the grand 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.160
 driving the front row all that 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.959
 paired with the bombastic look and feel 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.580
 make the hammer sound researcher five 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.980
 probably the best racing game today 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.680
 Anyone who genre with the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.040
 fast cart stands the must forsa 5 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.040
 to buy 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.110
 you may like racing games but one 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.659
 simulation is not her thing 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.489
 how about logo cycle with 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.799
 a racing game is the game actually 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.930
 Do not hide a fighting game 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.750
 camera into the game universe you see 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:54.450
 not quite like a real xbox game 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.890
 but does not play very nice 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.620
 nice this is playing here 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.390
 fighting game continues to be a controller 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.700
 you do not need to fight over that here 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.709
 motion control from kinect that works 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.700
 Although quite good the rest of the game it 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.700
 but to forget 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.420
 benefit 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.350
 who wants a fighting game should be 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.300
 killer instinct look 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.250
 The fighting game is actually one 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.290
 nintendo classic almost ten years ago 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.170
 but microsoft has the brand and 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.220
 the then developer rare bought 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.080
 killer instinct is really good 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.220
 and especially in dueling with others 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.690
 people's class 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.850
 Although the game is in theory 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.709
 free but who have all characters 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.250
 he wants 20 euro on the table 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.050
 lay 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.850
 the free to play version is quasi 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.540
 nothing more than an extensive one 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.540
 demo version 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.480
 also for the fans of rail shooter there 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.370
 it's almost nice crimson dragon with one 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.410
 kite nasty opponents off and so on 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.600
 The highscore crack is nothing 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.340
 but for us it certainly has its fans 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.750
 who wants to access the game must 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.980
 however, on the xbox live marketplace 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.050
 download 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.930
 Crimson Dragon is a pure digital 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.060
 title the same applies to power star golf 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.350
 as the name suggests, everyone here 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.150
 of course, golfing 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.730
 But that would not be boring 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.750
 There are also some power ups and one 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.490
 extensive multiplayer you want though 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.110
 but they do not like to play golf 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.900
 golf balls but much rather with 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.720
 zombie minds then dead rising 3 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:36.300
 probably your game crazy humor 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.880
 Thousands of combos and an awful lot 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.830
 pixel blood of course there are 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.350
 in the predecessor in part 3 again 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.420
 a cool action and a co- op mode 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.550
 Many psychopaths are in the zombie 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.830
 apocalypse have lost their mind 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.920
 the zombie likes an action game like that 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.450
 must get the 33 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.770
 Besides these exclusive titles there are 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.140
 of course many games of 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.350
 third-party manufacturers for example of duty 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.270
 ghost battlefield 4 or fifa 14 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.100
 a real reason to buy a new one 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.420
 console are of course the 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.100
 exclusive games 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.080
 Incidentally, one compares the start offer 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.100
 the xbox one with the line up the 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.500
 playstation 4 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.910
 so does the microsoft console currently 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.910
 the stronger line up
