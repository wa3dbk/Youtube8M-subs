00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.130
 Hello everyone at all artur and after 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.650
 long break i'm coming back 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.530
 Vidosik's own production for 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.960
 I wanted to show you a fight on t-43 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.350
 with a game but one of my favorites 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.210
 ruinberg map I don't even know if so 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.230
 offhand which card I like 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.680
 more ruinberg 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.720
 even Himmelsdorf as a reference such 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.610
 city map 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.530
 still gives less opportunity for 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.800
 less maneuvering 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.829
 what ruinberg here is ideally done here 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.930
 the city is just super clear with these 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.970
 fishing rods are not big enough 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.560
 so that there art overturned straight 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.810
 everywhere at the same time is enough 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.340
 spacious to place there 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.250
 several tanks and they were ok 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.550
 tank in contrast to the same enska where 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.890
 as if the urban part seems to be there but 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.960
 total there have to go open 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.300
 on the enemy because not enough of all places 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.899
 especially if there is a lot of heavy 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.090
 accommodate and somehow fight proper 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.790
 here I always occupy the same 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.310
 position from this spawn food from to this 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.060
 churches and standing here we aim triest 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.510
 you sheet the most important thing actually such 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.260
 artery heavy tanks which any 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.150
 camp will be taken by seemingly enemies here 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.790
 a little bit unlucky with allies you 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.040
 just look at this topic of genius 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.020
 people of course the enemy has boys and 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.610
 worse but you understand that if u 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.280
 human bad winning percentage 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.560
 then at least he can't apply 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.250
 adequate damage yes even if 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.880
 he will survive 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.619
 here 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.539
 then for the time he will live 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.640
 his own he will do much less 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.060
 than let's say so dudes with 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.049
 at least 5020 on this here because 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060
 winning percentage 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.009
 specifically here shows a man 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.010
 capable of some elementary 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.690
 actions or not and actually i have in 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.700
 the team has a few dudes who 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.730
 now logged on quickly from come 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.400
 that is why I will have to 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.160
 drag this fight to do a little 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.620
 extraordinary actions for t34 three because 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.420
 that in my previous vidosah I already 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.060
 told me that this is not a tank for the neighbor 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.330
 battle it is not very convenient for him to fight in the butt 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.610
 with adversary due to low angle 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.410
 it is also inconvenient for him to shoot his forehead 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.260
 head because dpm is not the best 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.620
 which by the way will raise here literally 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.840
 tomorrow until when the patch itself comes out 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.269
 this vidos was still made 093 so I 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.560
 here I ride with a doppike to somehow 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.769
 level this sad one 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.230
 rate of fire and after the patch we'll see 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.109
 may even take away even before the train will 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.880
 ride like a kid here you can 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.609
 notice that shooting initially be be 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.380
 homi because in ruinberg I always 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.060
 counting on the fact that I will shoot at 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.549
 the sides of the tanks that they all leave 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.739
 usually overflowing such bras to the bar 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.130
 does not come very well but as soon as I saw 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.380
 t8 the first shot went to him himself in 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.420
 bbc bucket 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.690
 175 orbit they lack calmly 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.620
 the next one charged gold to 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.420
 opportunity to hammer it directly into the body 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.100
 because the tool is not super exactly yes 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.019
 so every time but throw towers 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.209
 suddenly I understand that my comrades 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.120
 give away three tanks we just 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.030
 lost three tanks understand three tanks 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.160
 almost immediately just got killed and so 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.130
 drag here fight I saw that there is 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.549
 opportunity to dance like this 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.950
 way to go gold block pick on 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.010
 the sixth following charges behu and pass 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.799
 past to the tower hole and on avtopritzel and dry 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.290
 Immediately I get distracted while doing so 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.400
 I try to press just cool guys 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.780
 don't look at the explosions kill someone 3 and 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.340
 I go from the window to the side and bitches but we do not 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.459
 distracted by it actually was 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.840
 calculation so she dad as you see she 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.250
 just missed it because 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.699
 crap but submit you for 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.669
 back 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:19.430
 122 millimeters and as it hints to you that 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.919
 but now you play and that's why he is 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.740
 equals lu mort mortus such a kin 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.150
 somewhere in the air in general everything is like this 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.310
 here 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.490
 blast chick followed by sawing like 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.229
 see already brought our team very 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.419
 meaningful results and essentially a city on 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.780
 now dragging only thanks here 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.440
 this rush is quite epic which 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.180
 by the way 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.139
 part of my viewers could watch on 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.340
 Stream it was a fight in my opinion just this 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:52.310
 fight I finished one of my streams 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.910
 still the city ​​just ruled one here 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.669
 so chinese waffenturger yes it 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.880
 really from test 43 is a sample 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:05.570
 Chinese vaffentragera just a wagon 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.110
 with a gun, that is, it is not a medium tank 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:12.410
 have it not signed it such 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.090
 vaffentrager with armor yah like for like 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.419
 for vaffentrager travel scary 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.050
 the good thing is that the tower is about 200 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.090
 millimeters in the forehead and in general you 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.650
 ends so that I am a little bit 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.220
 I enjoyed it 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.229
 Soviet comrades to capture and 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.720
 my access base is still grab 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.289
 ok so in general thanks for 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.440
 viewing 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.680
 who doubted the purchase n 343 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.940
 did you think whether he could farm or not 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.150
 I advise you to actually buy it 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.220
 introduced farming and playing it not so 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.020
 difficult as it may seem 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.650
 I want soon here after 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.270

 whole streams are dedicated to this tank 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.780
 panzer wonderfully understand the intricacies 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.410
 gameplay and make full so

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.530
 additional equipment with exactly not 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.140
 so that it is on the back 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.910
 I ride with a lot of Golda and 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.210
