00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
so Coleman is down at the bottom of the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.359 
so Coleman is down at the bottom of the
driveway<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:09.020> we<00:01:09.680> got<00:01:09.830> a<00:01:09.860> little<00:01:10.100> bit<00:01:10.190> of<00:01:10.280> snow

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
driveway and we got a little bit of snow

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.340 
driveway and we got a little bit of snow
over<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.820> past<00:01:11.000> couple<00:01:11.210> days<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.840> he's<00:01:12.110> been

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
over the past couple days and he's been

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.240 
over the past couple days and he's been
working<00:01:12.650> on<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.830> driveway

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
working on the driveway

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.580 
working on the driveway
but<00:01:14.090> he's<00:01:14.240> gonna<00:01:14.390> show<00:01:14.659> us<00:01:14.810> just<00:01:14.990> how<00:01:15.110> easy<00:01:15.470> it

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
but he's gonna show us just how easy it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.580 
but he's gonna show us just how easy it
is<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:16.040> come<00:01:16.280> up<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.640> driveway<00:01:17.290> he<00:01:18.290> told<00:01:18.530> me

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
is to come up the driveway he told me

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.260 
is to come up the driveway he told me
that<00:01:18.710> he<00:01:18.950> was<00:01:19.100> worried<00:01:19.400> about<00:01:19.610> how<00:01:19.909> a

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
that he was worried about how a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.359 
that he was worried about how a
snowblower<00:01:20.960> would<00:01:21.229> handle<00:01:21.590> on<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:21.920> incline

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
snowblower would handle on the incline

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.609 
snowblower would handle on the incline
but<00:01:23.030> it's<00:01:23.420> really<00:01:23.750> pretty<00:01:23.990> smooth<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:24.500> you

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
but it's really pretty smooth and you

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.649 
but it's really pretty smooth and you
can<00:01:24.740> see<00:01:24.920> he<00:01:25.100> just<00:01:25.280> walks<00:01:25.490> right<00:01:25.610> behind<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.240> he

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
can see he just walks right behind it he

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.780 
can see he just walks right behind it he
said<00:01:26.840> it's<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.079> really<00:01:27.290> powerful<00:01:27.860> machine<00:01:28.490> and

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
said it's a really powerful machine and

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.249 
said it's a really powerful machine and
it's<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.060> Briggs<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.420> Stratton<00:01:29.450> motor<00:01:29.869> and

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
it's a Briggs and Stratton motor and

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.510 
it's a Briggs and Stratton motor and
it's<00:01:30.890> quite<00:01:31.479> heavy<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.159> weight<00:01:34.159> of<00:01:34.189> it

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
it's quite heavy and so the weight of it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.639 
it's quite heavy and so the weight of it
actually<00:01:34.729> helps<00:01:35.210> with<00:01:35.270> traction<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:36.380> coming

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
actually helps with traction and coming

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.770 
actually helps with traction and coming
up<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.890> hill<00:01:37.040> is<00:01:37.250> very<00:01:37.909> easy<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.299> can<00:01:38.329> see<00:01:38.659> the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
up the hill is very easy you can see the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.280 
up the hill is very easy you can see the
chute<00:01:39.049> too<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:40.360> just<00:01:41.360> throws<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.869> snow<00:01:42.079> it's

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
chute too is just throws the snow it's

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.289 
chute too is just throws the snow it's
really<00:01:43.210> really<00:01:44.210> powerful<00:01:45.759> so<00:01:46.759> in<00:01:46.970> fact<00:01:47.149> I've

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
really really powerful so in fact I've

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.580 
really really powerful so in fact I've
gotten<00:01:47.570> behind<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.869> snowblower<00:01:48.140> too<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:48.530> I

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
gotten behind the snowblower too and I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.800 
gotten behind the snowblower too and I
think<00:01:48.860> if<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:49.460> had<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.790> do<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.000> driveway<00:01:50.329> myself

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
think if I had to do the driveway myself

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.139 
think if I had to do the driveway myself
which<00:01:51.079> I<00:01:51.200> haven't<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:51.710> far<00:01:52.009> but<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:52.790> think<00:01:52.880> I

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
which I haven't so far but I think I

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.359 
which I haven't so far but I think I
could<00:01:53.329> handle<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.719> it's<00:01:53.899> really<00:01:54.340> quite<00:01:55.340> the

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
could handle it it's really quite the

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.359 
could handle it it's really quite the
machine<00:01:55.820> here<00:01:56.259> so<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.320> can<00:01:57.770> see<00:01:57.920> that's<00:01:58.100> a

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
machine here so you can see that's a

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.840 
machine here so you can see that's a
