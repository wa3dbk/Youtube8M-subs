00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.719
 while reappearing in theaters 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.550
 obscure the films in relief the thing is 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.370
 looks tonight on this technique well 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.599
 special 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.680
 today the trick is interested in 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.600
 relief images 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.760
 maybe you have already experienced these images 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.119
 spectacular that sometimes gives the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.470
 nausea 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.090
 know in any case that they are 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.099
 currently considered the future of the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.849
 cinema and so we need you some 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.349
 explanations 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.570
 first of all what is perception 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.669
 of relief well it rests in great 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.739
 part on our faculty to look at the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.980
 world with two distant eyes on average 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.610
 of 65 mm if you look at the object with 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.730
 a sun then with the other you 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.530
 will find that it seems to have moved 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.809
 and when you open both eyes these 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.820
 two different images are transmitted 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.430
 to the brain that superimposes them for 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.960
 restore distance and depth 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.329
 it's this neural process named 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.760
 stereoscopic vision that exploits the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 cinema in relief for all to butry the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.940
 first step is to produce 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.680
 stereoscopic images 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.090
 ie to film the scene with two 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.610
 cameras one for each eye 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.590
 ideally his cameras to adjust from 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.840
 identical way will be placed as two 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.299
 eyes ie to 65 mm one of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.740
 the other is not always easy 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.720
 better to use a camera 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.630
 stereoscopic that brings together two 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.950
 lenses in one housing 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.900
 we now have two 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.729
 close to our one scene for each 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.290
 but how to make sure that 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.659
 viewers only see their eye 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.729
 left with their left eyes and the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.490
 right with their eyes 3 many 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.600
 existing processes first method the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.329
 transformation of images 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.829
 stereoscopic anaglyph 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.939
 remember our video images are 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.890
 composed of complementary colors 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.900
 red green and blue the famous f 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.150
 well we did not keep left 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.159
 than the red component of the image and to 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.770
 right only the green components 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.150
 and blue then we overlapping the two 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.650
 sequences and we observe them at 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.840
 through glasses including glass 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.010
 left is a red filter and the right 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.930
 a six children filter 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.540
 cyan being the sum of green and 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.580
 blue and that's the left eye only sees that 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.320
 the red component of the captured scene 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.300
 by the left camera and the right eye 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.520
 conscious those who had been captured 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.150
 by the right camera the brain no longer 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.590
 to do his job 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.030
 obviously other colors 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.080
 complementary can be chosen 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.510
 for this process 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.900
 but in the era of digital image the rvb 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.120
 time to win second process the 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.350
 polarized projection to simplify to 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.150
 the extreme know that waves 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.340
 bright can be polarized 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.110
 that is to say, rushing you are in space 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.090
 so we're going this time 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.010
 use two projectors with 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.840
 polarizing filter the projector from 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.850
 left will project the film rush to 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.350
 left by polarizing it horizontally 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.440
 and the right projector 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.790
 the rush 3 polarized vertically we 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.280
 observe them through glasses 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.840
 polarizers whose left filter does not 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.360
 lets pass that horizontal waves 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.989
 and the right that waves up the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.579
 you're done 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.739
 every eye sees only what they 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.900
 have to be and the brain and of 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.880
 new bluffed third proceed 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.010
 even more at ithe projection 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.590
 alternate this time we project a 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.170
 picture of the left camera then one of the 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.170
 right camera then move you tu boxes 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.250
 right like the left 3d glasses to 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.260
 liquid crystals are then 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.800
 synchronize on seven year frames by 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.100
 more impulses 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.840
 their left and right glass clogs 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.580
 alternatively to fool our poor 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.050
 do not make current searches 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.000
 relate to the possibilities of 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.800
 projection without the use of glasses 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.230
 the most effective is also the most 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.850
 simple the cross projection this time 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.470
 here we project our two sequences 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.660
 side by side but we place the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.440
 sequence filmed right and left and 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.020
 reciprocally 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.000
 it only remains to squint for 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.860
 experience that delightful sensation of 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.620
 relief and to train rich and without 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.900
 vomit for 90 minutes would have 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.270
 capital the relief images exploits 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.130
 the stereoscopic vision 3 process of 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.260
 spectacle projection is distinguished the 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.780
 projection tana glyphs projection 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.460
 polarized and alternate projection the 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.910
 projection without glasses is still at 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.010
 the study 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.010
 See you soon for a new trick
