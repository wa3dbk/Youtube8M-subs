00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
repeating the moves but it wasn't

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.319 
repeating the moves but it wasn't
certain<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> were<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> force<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
certain if you were going to force a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.720

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
thoughts well I thought I owed to repeat

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.549 
thoughts well I thought I owed to repeat
moves<00:00:54.120> once<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:54.719> try<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
moves once and then try to go for the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.369 
moves once and then try to go for the
win<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.280> mean<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.899> bit<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.170> time

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
and so on no but I mean you could at

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.000 
and so on no but I mean you could at
that<00:01:00.840> moment<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.350> could<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.620> taken<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that moment you could have taken the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.789 
that moment you could have taken the
draw<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.670> norm<00:01:02.850> immediately<00:01:03.559> it<00:01:04.559> never

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
draw and the norm immediately it never

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.469 
draw and the norm immediately it never
crossed<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.220> mind<00:01:05.489> well<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.119> did<00:01:06.240> cross<00:01:06.420> my

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479

winning probably and I mean for me a

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.880 
winning probably and I mean for me a
norm<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.659> not<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> most<00:01:16.200> important<00:01:16.619> thing<00:01:16.650> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
norm it's not the most important thing I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.649 
norm it's not the most important thing I
mean<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.759> game<00:01:17.909> was<00:01:18.119> important

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
mean it's just the game was important

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.570 
mean it's just the game was important
okay<00:01:19.259> well<00:01:19.530> he's<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> very<00:01:20.040> interesting

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
okay well he's a very interesting

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.810 
okay well he's a very interesting
opponent<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.650> also<00:01:22.830> made<00:01:23.490> no<00:01:23.580> difference

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
opponent so it also made no difference

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.609 
opponent so it also made no difference
that<00:01:24.180> winning<00:01:24.540> would<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:24.990> meant<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.380> i<00:01:25.470> am

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
