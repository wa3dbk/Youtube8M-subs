I'm doing this as a son singer so I do

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.480 
I'm doing this as a son singer so I do
get<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.590> little<00:00:22.980> bit<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:24.980> boost<00:00:25.980> here<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
get a little bit of a boost here in the

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.990 
get a little bit of a boost here in the
beginning<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:27.029> my<00:00:27.150> overall<00:00:27.510> time<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:28.619> is

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
beginning to my overall time this is

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.220 
beginning to my overall time this is
incredibly<00:00:30.000> difficult<00:00:30.269> compared<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
incredibly difficult compared to the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.520 
incredibly difficult compared to the
normal<00:00:31.529> road<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.399> because<00:00:32.700> you're

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
normal road and not just because you're

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.889 
normal road and not just because you're
down<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> level<00:00:34.890> which<00:00:35.280> does<00:00:35.579> hurt<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.750> means

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
down a level which does hurt that means

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.920 
down a level which does hurt that means
boomers<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.530> take<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.800> out<00:00:37.890> three<00:00:38.219> hits<00:00:38.930> also

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
boomers can take you out three hits also

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.500 
boomers can take you out three hits also
because<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.950> timer<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.610> much<00:00:41.969> shorter<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
because the timer is much shorter and

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.330 
because the timer is much shorter and
they<00:00:42.960> patched<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.649> bug<00:00:43.829> where<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> could

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
they patched the bug where you could

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.979 
they patched the bug where you could
leave<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> room<00:00:44.930> without<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:47.719> timer<00:00:48.719> going

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
leave the room without the timer going

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.090 
leave the room without the timer going
off<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.129> if<00:00:50.219> you're<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.719> son<00:00:51.719> singer<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.440> do

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
off so if you're a son singer you can do

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.680 
off so if you're a son singer you can do

for this part because I hate to tell
people<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.150> don't<00:01:06.270> think<00:01:06.689> you'll<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.960> able<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
people I don't think you'll be able to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.620 
people I don't think you'll be able to
do<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:07.740> honestly<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.390> think<00:01:09.390> you're

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
do this but honestly I think you're

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.429 
do this but honestly I think you're
gonna<00:01:09.810> need<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:11.520> could<00:01:11.729> try<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.720> hunger<00:01:13.320> of

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
gonna need it you could try a hunger of

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.899 
gonna need it you could try a hunger of
crota<00:01:15.290> icebreaker<00:01:16.290> combination<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.520> has

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
crota icebreaker combination that has

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.170 
crota icebreaker combination that has
potential<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.759> think<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> be

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
potential but I think it's going to be

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.050 
potential but I think it's going to be
even<00:01:21.450> harder<00:01:21.780> than<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.790> came

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
even harder than this is and this came

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.370 
even harder than this is and this came
