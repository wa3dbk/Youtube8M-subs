00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.680
 mixed 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.020
 I mix yeast with flour 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.950
 and I mix cars 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.719
 yeah 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.820
 the dough is very smooth I do not have 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.060
 more than add whites to mount 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.060
 in snow 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.189
 it is 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.149
 at the outputs 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.640
 the ba ba you can cook it in a 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.070
 mold a big mold like this for everything 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.130
 the world to have a baba share or 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.370
 then in small individual molds 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.750
 nice too 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.790
 by the way that's what I'm going to do I 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.930
 have them well buttered and I'm going to put the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.930
 paste inside 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.090
 it's gone for about 20 minutes of 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.999
 cooking for large format it's 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:28.069
 rather 25 minutes or 180 degrees that's 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:30.079
 the moment to prepare the syrup for that 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.510
 I'm just going to heat 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.019
 and bring to the boil the sugar syrup 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.709
 cane 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.709
 rum and 25 centilitres of water 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.930
 it is 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:53.130
 the babas come out of the oven I go them 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:55.319
 unmold immediately without calf this 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.670
 recipe is an express recipe it wants 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.400
 say that a societal mussels and one 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.780
 will water them with the message syrup that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.920
 if you want to take your time as in 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.160
 the traditional recipe 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.230
 you bake cookies the day before and 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.300
 the idea is to rehydrate them in the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.260
 syrup from Europe because they will be 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.340
 become a little dry 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.989
 it only remains to cool 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.209
 these little things to serve them well 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.769
 fresh with a volute of cream 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.090
 whipped 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.400
 as they cool I invite you 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.830
 to watch the ping baba that I realized 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.170
 with herbaceous food in gourmet equation 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.610
 and this desire to achieve another 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.260
 cake 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.980
 maybe you could try the forest 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.980
 black for example 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.030
