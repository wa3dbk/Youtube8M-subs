00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
okay so now we've opened up the neck

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.619 
okay so now we've opened up the neck
right<00:02:38.430> here<00:02:39.139> and<00:02:40.139> I<00:02:40.709> want<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.430> back<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.510> be

higher<00:02:43.019> than<00:02:43.499> the<00:02:44.099> front<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.790> that's<00:02:44.969> the<00:02:45.150> only

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
higher than the front so that's the only

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.929 
higher than the front so that's the only
that's<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.810> reason<00:02:46.079> why<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> cut<00:02:46.499> it<00:02:46.590> there<00:02:47.129> so
