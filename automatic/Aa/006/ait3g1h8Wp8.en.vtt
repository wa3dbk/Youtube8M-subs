I<00:00:24.070> wanted<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:25.160> see<00:00:25.340> if<00:00:25.460> I<00:00:25.519> can<00:00:25.699> actually<00:00:25.880> make<00:00:26.150> a

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
I wanted to see if I can actually make a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.060 
I wanted to see if I can actually make a
book<00:00:26.509> it<00:00:27.109> wasn't<00:00:27.380> just<00:00:27.500> a<00:00:27.650> collection<00:00:27.919> of

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
book it wasn't just a collection of

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.099 
book it wasn't just a collection of
images<00:00:28.460> it's<00:00:28.550> not<00:00:28.699> catalogue<00:00:29.240> but<00:00:29.810> is<00:00:29.960> an

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
images it's not catalogue but is an

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.200 
images it's not catalogue but is an
actual<00:00:30.380> story<00:00:30.829> about<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.460> world

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
actual story about the world

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.690 
actual story about the world
there's<00:00:33.810> absolutely<00:00:34.170> no<00:00:34.380> language<00:00:34.620> except<00:00:35.550> on

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
there's absolutely no language except on

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.480 
there's absolutely no language except on
the<00:00:35.880> back<00:00:36.390> cover<00:00:36.660> where<00:00:37.560> the<00:00:37.590> word<00:00:37.860> at<00:00:38.190> earth

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:38.490 
the back cover where the word at earth

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.670 
the back cover where the word at earth
is<00:00:39.090> written<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.660> about<00:00:40.080> 40<00:00:40.500> different

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
is written in about 40 different

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.060 
is written in about 40 different
languages<00:00:41.870> so<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> idea<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.740> read

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
languages so the idea is that you read

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.700 
languages so the idea is that you read
it<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.360> would<00:00:45.510> language<00:00:46.230> because<00:00:46.560> it's

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
it like you would language because it's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.540 
it like you would language because it's
made<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.190> photomontages

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.430 

something<00:00:52.550> that's<00:00:52.730> gone<00:00:53.030> through<00:00:53.330> all<00:00:54.230> my

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
something that's gone through all my

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.490 
something that's gone through all my
work<00:00:54.680> for<00:00:55.100> years<00:00:55.580> is<00:00:55.970> the<00:00:56.750> image<00:00:56.960> of<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.170> human

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
work for years is the image of the human

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.370 
work for years is the image of the human
face<00:00:57.910> most<00:00:58.910> images<00:00:59.360> are<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.780> people<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.170> are

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
face most images are the people that are

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.190 
face most images are the people that are
actually<00:01:00.530> being<00:01:01.340> affected<00:01:02.000> by<00:01:02.240> the<00:01:02.630> subjects

there's a strength in enduring what's

there's a strength in enduring what's
going<00:01:13.610> on<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:15.320> images<00:01:15.620> from<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:15.890> time<00:01:16.070> are

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
going on the images from this time are

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.020 
going on the images from this time are
very<00:01:16.520> very<00:01:16.990> simple<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.260> direct<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:19.030> millions

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
very very simple and direct and millions

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.060 
very very simple and direct and millions
of<00:01:20.180> children<00:01:20.540> are<00:01:20.630> dying<00:01:20.900> every<00:01:21.470> year<00:01:21.680> we're

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
of children are dying every year we're

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.420 
of children are dying every year we're
spending<00:01:22.310> more<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:22.790> more<00:01:23.150> on<00:01:23.860> weaponry<00:01:24.860> we

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
spending more and more on weaponry we

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.969 
spending more and more on weaponry we
know<00:01:25.610> those<00:01:25.790> things<00:01:26.090> are<00:01:26.300> happening<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.200> why

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
know those things are happening so why

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.770 
know those things are happening so why
not<00:01:28.190> just<00:01:28.400> put<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.729> two<00:01:28.880> together<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.600> make

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
not just put the two together and make

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.960 
not just put the two together and make
an<00:01:29.900> image<00:01:30.080> of<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.410> why<00:01:30.560> not<00:01:30.640> making<00:01:31.640> an<00:01:31.790> image

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
an image of it why not making an image

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.090 
an image of it why not making an image
what<00:01:32.300> we<00:01:32.450> know<00:01:32.930> in<00:01:33.110> our<00:01:33.229> heads<00:01:33.530> is<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.770> reality

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
what we know in our heads is the reality

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.190 
what we know in our heads is the reality
yeah<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:34.910> mean<00:01:35.180> I<00:01:35.270> don't<00:01:35.330> mind<00:01:35.720> if<00:01:35.869> it<00:01:35.990> looks

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
yeah I mean I don't mind if it looks

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.139 
yeah I mean I don't mind if it looks
simplistic<00:01:36.860> something<00:01:37.220> like<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:37.580> I'm<00:01:37.940> quite

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
simplistic something like that I'm quite

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.960 
simplistic something like that I'm quite
happy<00:01:38.330> about<00:01:38.570> that<00:01:38.899> I<00:01:39.399> was<00:01:40.399> doing<00:01:40.610> pictures

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
happy about that I was doing pictures

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.060 
happy about that I was doing pictures
about<00:01:41.149> cried<00:01:41.509> Trident<00:01:41.930> missiles<00:01:42.320> forty<00:01:42.830> years

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
about cried Trident missiles forty years

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.639 
about cried Trident missiles forty years
ago<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.610> now<00:01:43.790> this<00:01:44.000> country<00:01:44.479> is

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
ago and now this country is

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.600 
ago and now this country is
reconditioning<00:01:45.649> it's<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.920> same<00:01:46.190> Trident

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
reconditioning it's the same Trident

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.940 
reconditioning it's the same Trident
missiles<00:01:47.000> forty<00:01:47.690> years<00:01:47.899> later<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.649> images

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
missiles forty years later the images

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.950 
missiles forty years later the images
are<00:01:49.100> still<00:01:49.310> relevant<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.300> think<00:01:50.840> it's

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
are still relevant so I think it's

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.380 
are still relevant so I think it's
important<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:52.310> show<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.610> sort<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.030> history

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
important to show a sort of history

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.980 
important to show a sort of history
within<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.960> work<00:01:58.270> this<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.570> original<00:01:59.720> of

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
within the work this is the original of

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.320 
within the work this is the original of
one<00:02:00.170> of<00:02:00.260> the<00:02:00.350> images<00:02:00.680> that's<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.100> this<00:02:01.330> book

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
one of the images that's in this book

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.350 
one of the images that's in this book
and<00:02:02.990> again<00:02:03.350> it's<00:02:03.560> got<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.920> it's<00:02:04.909> got<00:02:05.120> the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
and again it's got the it's got the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.500 
and again it's got the it's got the
crosshairs<00:02:06.340> from<00:02:07.340> smart<00:02:07.729> bombs<00:02:07.970> what<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
crosshairs from smart bombs what the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.479 
crosshairs from smart bombs what the
image<00:02:08.810> shows<00:02:09.049> is<00:02:09.229> very<00:02:09.500> simply<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.190> what

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
image shows is very simply that what

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.740 
image shows is very simply that what
they<00:02:10.640> call<00:02:10.820> collateral<00:02:11.120> damage<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.930> people<00:02:12.470> I

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
they call collateral damage is people I

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.479 
they call collateral damage is people I
mean<00:02:14.750> I've<00:02:14.840> always<00:02:15.019> been<00:02:15.920> really<00:02:16.160> concerned

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
mean I've always been really concerned

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.030 
mean I've always been really concerned
with<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> materiality<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.660> images<00:02:18.560> not<00:02:18.769> just

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
with the materiality of images not just

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.400 
with the materiality of images not just
the<00:02:19.700> smoothness<00:02:20.269> of<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.540> photograph<00:02:21.049> but<00:02:21.230> at

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the smoothness of a photograph but at

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.160 
the smoothness of a photograph but at
the<00:02:21.530> actual<00:02:21.830> physicality<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:23.360> piece<00:02:24.140> of

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the actual physicality of a piece of

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.990 
the actual physicality of a piece of
paper<00:02:24.500> that's<00:02:24.890> been<00:02:24.950> scrunched<00:02:25.580> up<00:02:25.730> and

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
paper that's been scrunched up and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.300 
paper that's been scrunched up and
worked<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.750> here<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.470> an<00:02:27.920> image<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.250> the

pouring stuff on for them and then
photographing<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:39.580> if<00:02:40.580> it's<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.820> hand<00:02:41.110> breaking

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
photographing it if it's a hand breaking

photographing it if it's a hand breaking
a<00:02:42.170> missile<00:02:42.590> if<00:02:42.739> it's<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.100> earth<00:02:43.250> everyone

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
a missile if it's the earth everyone

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.699 
a missile if it's the earth everyone
knows<00:02:44.060> those<00:02:44.330> things<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:44.930> then<00:02:45.140> then<00:02:45.410> you<00:02:45.560> can

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
knows those things so then then you can

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.039 
knows those things so then then you can
start<00:02:45.980> mucking<00:02:46.850> around<00:02:47.120> with<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.720> start

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
start mucking around with it and start

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.990 
start mucking around with it and start
pushing<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.890> it's<00:02:49.340> always<00:02:49.549> going<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.820> be<00:02:49.970> a

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
pushing it it's always going to be a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.090 
pushing it it's always going to be a
trace<00:02:50.329> of<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.750> image<00:02:51.079> that's<00:02:51.590> why<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.829> books

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
trace of that image that's why the books

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.569 
trace of that image that's why the books
called

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
called

at<00:02:52.760> Earth<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.480> don't<00:02:53.720> need<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.019> word<00:02:54.170> earth

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
at Earth you don't need the word earth

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.070 
at Earth you don't need the word earth
on<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.829> cover<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.400> show<00:02:55.670> it

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.110 

I<00:03:01.140> mean<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.070> think<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.370> important<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.790> show<00:03:03.000> in

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
I mean I think it's important to show in

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.850 
I mean I think it's important to show in
galleries<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:03.900> also<00:03:04.050> important<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.560> get<00:03:04.740> it

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
galleries it's also important to get it

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.650 
galleries it's also important to get it
out<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.250> this<00:03:05.370> tree<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:05.910> can<00:03:06.030> be<00:03:06.120> used<00:03:06.360> as<00:03:06.630> a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
out in this tree so it can be used as a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:15.830 
out in this tree so it can be used as a
as<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.530> tool<00:03:07.650> by<00:03:08.160> people<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:08.700> are<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.660> struggle

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.090 

there<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:16.960> a<00:03:16.990> sense<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.560> there's<00:03:17.890> something

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
there is a sense that there's something

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.060 
there is a sense that there's something
happening<00:03:18.510> globally<00:03:19.650> which<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.800> why<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:20.980> think

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
happening globally which is why I think

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.460 
happening globally which is why I think
it's<00:03:21.340> important<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.940> try<00:03:22.210> and<00:03:22.240> develop<00:03:23.050> visual

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
it's important to try and develop visual

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.730 
it's important to try and develop visual
forms<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.190> are<00:03:24.330> global<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.630> will<00:03:25.840> actually

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
forms that are global that will actually

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.140 
forms that are global that will actually
affect<00:03:26.830> people<00:03:27.790> across<00:03:28.660> countries<00:03:30.150> about

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
affect people across countries about

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.120 
affect people across countries about
people<00:03:31.600> acting<00:03:32.080> in<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.320> world<00:03:32.530> rather<00:03:32.800> than

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
people acting in the world rather than

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.040 
people acting in the world rather than
sitting<00:03:33.430> back<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:33.970> thinking<00:03:34.480> they<00:03:34.630> can't<00:03:34.840> do

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
sitting back and thinking they can't do

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.470 
sitting back and thinking they can't do
anything
