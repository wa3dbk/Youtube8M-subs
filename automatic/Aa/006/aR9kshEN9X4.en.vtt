00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.200
 and what a fart breed they are here alba ave 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.499
 extend this min 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.870
 today I bring you a glitch a strategy 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:15.919
 of farming as you want to see it for 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:19.130
 form and get all good at 5 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.080
 this good ether keys the five 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.449
 treasure keys that we can have 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.250
 before the house of the wolves which 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.949
 they will be very important according to others 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.539
 other people say that they are going to be 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.720
 important to get rewards 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.610
 in the prison of helders and well this one 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.469
 that's why it's very important that right now 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.450
 that this is most likely what 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.680
 go to patch in a week because 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.530
 is very very father this because when 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.109
 are opening these chests with the mode 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.960
 The way I'm going to teach you is 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:55.100
 taking engrams of legend engrams 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.000
 blue this ammunition or pack of 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.530
 heavy or secondary ammunition 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.570
 and the famous and powerful keys to 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.930
 start this glitch what we need 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.240
 is to go to the part to venus to 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.310
 patrol and since we are on patrol 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.619
 we are going to address to the left of 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.780
 where we do exposes in the first area 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:22.300
 that is going to be called the cave of the masters 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.920
 of those answered something like that and already there 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.110
 let's wait we'll be a little while 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.260
 killing some missions in that same area 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.320
 without changing and when it comes out 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.050
 the bottom left is going to 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.259
 leave a little message that is going to say the 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.380
 wolves are patrolling or something like that and already 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.969
 when they go to see a is a skiff 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.430
 and they're going to see what comes down 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.539
 enemies and they start killing us and bring 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.600
 their guns and brad when they kill them go 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.680
 a timer will appear in 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.980
 the left part below 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.170
 was going to say ether key then you 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.360
 they're going to give a minute and a half to 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.180
 find a chest which leaves 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.570
 randomly in four positions that 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.360
 I'm going to show you this in this 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.490
 video I show you the way I say the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.400
 more efficient position than after leaving 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.440
 in this law is they can grab the chest 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.890
 three times instead of the others that 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.570
 they only see two they grab it and this is the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.120
 previous glyph that's how 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.730
 the chests answered well that's 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.190
 you're going to grab your chest you're going to 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.190
 grab your hummingbird you are going to approach the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.570
 nearest area transition zone or 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.550
 be it is that when you do so much 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.290
 hummingbird suddenly comes out a few words 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.690
 good the name of the area that just 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.160
 enter good as soon as you get to this 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.500
 zone 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.120
 you'll 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.079
 you will return t 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.209
 You see exactly the letters you give 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.249
 back and you come back now yes and go 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.069
 you come back through your chest and when you come back to 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:59.590
 see the chest is going to be closed and you're going to 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.609
 to be able to regain the light and only 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.650
 it can be three times 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.870
 then already after he has been given 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.790
 three laps or two laps depending 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.630
 from the chest that comes out are going to go 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.580
 running as fast as I can 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.160
 to the city of which is the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.620
 in the area that is to the right of 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.349
 where are they all 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.110
 what they are seeing on the screen and there 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.140
 let's wait 12 minutes for it to come out 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.269
 again the wolves are here and already the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.440
 we kill and again the chest and again 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:35.860
 the same repeat in this placement that 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.720
 it goes to the left below and is the 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.530
 more efficient in this we can grab the 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.870
 4 times and well they say that these five 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.450
 but planet four times you have left 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.959
 very fair but yes then 5 is that 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.680
 perfect and good there you can grab it 5 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.250
 times 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.140
 and now yes since you finished your second 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.569
 chest you will go back to the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.879
 cave of the answered and there you go to 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.319
 wait until it comes back out it's going to 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.540
 take about 10 minutes 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.519
 then when you get out the most important thing 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.620
 when you are there is that you do the 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.499
 event as quickly as possible the 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.480
 hong be pure bazooka whatever it is a 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:17.310
 squad of three the most efficient 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.280
 also to do everything faster 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.840
 so that you reach the second one that is in 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.599
 the citadel because there are times when it arrives 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.539
 that's it, it's over, you did not reach the time 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:30.320
 and then we'll pelaste what then for the 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:33.180
 joke is to do it as fast as possible 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.389
 good subscribe salfa beast denle like 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.509
 to this video so you never get lost 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:44.389
 not a story about alpha beast and no 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.389
 glitch and see you next time bye
