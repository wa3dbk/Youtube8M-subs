point<00:04:11.870> but<00:04:12.139> let's<00:04:12.650> just<00:04:12.739> trick<00:04:13.099> the<00:04:13.250> eye<00:04:13.280> so

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
point but let's just trick the eye so

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.170 
point but let's just trick the eye so
here's<00:04:15.799> the<00:04:16.070> spell<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:16.910> start<00:04:17.359> off<00:04:17.389> with<00:04:17.630> is

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.050 
here's the spell you start off with is
noticeably<00:04:20.180> weaker<00:04:21.640> as<00:04:22.640> you<00:04:22.729> can<00:04:22.849> see<00:04:22.940> the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
noticeably weaker as you can see the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.360 
noticeably weaker as you can see the
effects<00:04:23.450> are<00:04:23.599> very<00:04:24.169> different<00:04:24.530> as<00:04:24.590> well<00:04:24.740> one's

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.550 
app and this is a very rare item
basically<00:04:31.910> what<00:04:32.600> you<00:04:32.690> can<00:04:32.840> get<00:04:32.960> is<00:04:33.170> not<00:04:33.440> only

the priests version of air spell as you

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.660 
the priests version of air spell as you
see<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.580> gives<00:04:46.940> them<00:04:47.120> you<00:04:47.690> know<00:04:48.070> it's<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.520> bet

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
see it gives them you know it's a bet

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.000 
see it gives them you know it's a bet
he'll<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.900> gives<00:04:51.080> them<00:04:51.170> a<00:04:51.350> bonus<00:04:51.560> of<00:04:51.800> one

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.190 
he'll and it gives them a bonus of one
percent<00:04:52.220> that<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.430> fit<00:04:52.640> so<00:04:53.330> that's<00:04:53.780> probably

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
percent that I fit so that's probably

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.300 
percent that I fit so that's probably
may<00:04:55.070> be<00:04:55.130> worth<00:04:55.370> a<00:04:55.490> lot<00:04:55.640> I<00:04:55.910> don't<00:04:56.150> know<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:57.310> yeah

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
may be worth a lot I don't know and yeah

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.400 
may be worth a lot I don't know and yeah
so<00:04:58.640> basically<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.450> can<00:04:59.600> keep<00:04:59.810> picking<00:05:00.320> these

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
so basically you can keep picking these

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.740 
so basically you can keep picking these
things<00:05:00.680> up<00:05:00.890> basically<00:05:01.700> just<00:05:01.850> keep<00:05:02.150> yourself

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
things up basically just keep yourself

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.540 
things up basically just keep yourself
upgraded<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.890> know<00:05:03.980> eventually<00:05:04.070> you

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
upgraded and you know eventually you

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.400 
upgraded and you know eventually you
will<00:05:04.640> get<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:05.000> stick<00:05:05.270> where<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:05.990> are<00:05:06.170> pretty

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410

hard<00:05:10.730> to<00:05:10.880> kill<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.570> what<00:05:12.170> this<00:05:12.230> means<00:05:12.500> is<00:05:12.800> if

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
hard to kill and what this means is if

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.710 
hard to kill and what this means is if
you<00:05:13.190> do<00:05:13.340> run<00:05:13.520> out<00:05:13.670> of<00:05:13.700> like<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:14.300> know<00:05:14.330> items
