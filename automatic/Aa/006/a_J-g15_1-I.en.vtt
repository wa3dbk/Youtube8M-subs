is<00:00:39.019> a<00:00:39.080> cool<00:00:39.379> caterpillar<00:00:40.190> train<00:00:40.610> he<00:00:41.420> saw<00:00:41.720> it

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
is a cool caterpillar train he saw it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.710 
is a cool caterpillar train he saw it
yesterday<00:00:42.170> but<00:00:42.470> today<00:00:42.710> I<00:00:42.890> want<00:00:43.190> to<00:00:43.390> show<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:44.570> in

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
yesterday but today I want to show it in

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.280 
yesterday but today I want to show it in
better<00:00:44.989> ways<00:00:45.409> it<00:00:46.070> was<00:00:46.280> carrying<00:00:47.049> Thomas<00:00:48.049> it

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
better ways it was carrying Thomas it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.799 
better ways it was carrying Thomas it
was<00:00:48.320> also<00:00:48.559> carrying<00:00:48.949> Percy<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:50.119> I<00:00:50.360> change<00:00:50.690> the

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
was also carrying Percy and I change the

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.140 
was also carrying Percy and I change the
track<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.470> it<00:00:51.589> works<00:00:52.070> better<00:00:54.970> look<00:00:55.970> how

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
track so it works better look how

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.630 
track so it works better look how

beautiful the weather is lots of flowers
in<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.970> trees<00:00:59.680> and<00:01:00.680> here<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:01.040> can<00:01:01.159> see<00:01:01.369> I<00:01:01.400> have

in the trees and here you can see I have

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.060 
in the trees and here you can see I have
another<00:01:01.820> train<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.930> requires<00:01:03.379> two<00:01:03.559> batteries

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
another train it requires two batteries

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.789 
another train it requires two batteries
and<00:01:05.030> it's<00:01:05.210> commissioned<00:01:05.900> by<00:01:06.080> US<00:01:06.380> Army<00:01:06.500> it's

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
and it's commissioned by US Army it's

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.460 
and it's commissioned by US Army it's
written<00:01:07.040> here<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:07.340> it's<00:01:07.810> get<00:01:08.810> your<00:01:08.840> Express

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
written here so it's get your Express

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.219 
written here so it's get your Express
commissioned<00:01:09.920> by<00:01:10.070> US<00:01:10.400> Army<00:01:10.580> and<00:01:11.330> this<00:01:11.960> is<00:01:12.200> a

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
commissioned by US Army and this is a

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.660 
commissioned by US Army and this is a
realistic<00:01:12.859> looking<00:01:13.780> train<00:01:15.579> pretty<00:01:16.579> much

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
realistic looking train pretty much

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.099 
realistic looking train pretty much
looks<00:01:16.880> like<00:01:16.969> one<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.240> those<00:01:17.450> we<00:01:17.659> have<00:01:17.780> train

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 
looks like one of those we have train

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:21.550 
looks like one of those we have train
and<00:01:19.359> you<00:01:20.359> see<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.659> current<00:01:20.869> color<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.350> our

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
and you see the current color of our

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.859 
and you see the current color of our
being<00:01:21.829> here<00:01:22.100> as<00:01:22.219> well<00:01:25.420> so<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:26.509> goes<00:01:26.689> both

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
being here as well so it goes both

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.739 
being here as well so it goes both
forward<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.530> backward<00:01:27.939> we're<00:01:28.939> gonna<00:01:29.119> try<00:01:29.689> it

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
forward and backward we're gonna try it

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.959 
forward and backward we're gonna try it
on<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.140> caterpillar<00:01:30.590> tracks<00:01:30.979> all<00:01:31.820> right

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
on the caterpillar tracks all right

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:32.529 
on the caterpillar tracks all right
let's<00:01:32.149> go

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
let's go

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.080 
let's go
and<00:01:32.899> here<00:01:33.170> is<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.409> caterpillar<00:01:33.920> train<00:01:34.280> which

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
and here is the caterpillar train which

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.230 
and here is the caterpillar train which
is<00:01:35.119> huge<00:01:35.920> this<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.249> really<00:01:37.549> long<00:01:37.759> train<00:01:38.119> you

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
is huge this is a really long train you

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.859 
is huge this is a really long train you
can<00:01:38.270> see<00:01:38.600> Thomas<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:39.289> Percy<00:01:39.590> there<00:01:40.749> turn<00:01:41.749> it

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
can see Thomas and Percy there turn it

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.300 
can see Thomas and Percy there turn it
down<00:01:42.049> it<00:01:42.319> won't<00:01:42.499> work<00:01:42.590> here

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
down it won't work here

00:01:43.310 --> 00:02:13.630 
down it won't work here
but<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:43.999> gets<00:01:44.149> to<00:01:44.390> say<00:01:44.630> that<00:01:44.990> sound

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:31.440 

and<00:02:14.480> these<00:02:14.840> channels<00:02:15.290> who<00:02:15.470> goes<00:02:15.710> backward

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.700 

you're<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:32.660> challenged<00:02:33.050> you're<00:02:33.200> gonna<00:02:33.410> see

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
you're just challenged you're gonna see

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.650 
you're just challenged you're gonna see
how<00:02:34.010> to<00:02:34.070> set<00:02:34.340> up<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.580> latrine<00:02:36.010> far<00:02:37.010> from<00:02:37.660> tearing

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
how to set up a latrine far from tearing

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.350 
how to set up a latrine far from tearing
Thomas<00:02:39.110> at<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.500> top<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:40.100> put<00:02:40.520> Thomas<00:02:41.030> at<00:02:41.270> the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
Thomas at the top I put Thomas at the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.780 
Thomas at the top I put Thomas at the
top<00:02:41.570> I'm<00:02:41.750> not<00:02:41.780> gonna<00:02:42.230> start<00:02:42.590> Thomas<00:02:42.950> yeah<00:02:43.730> you

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
top I'm not gonna start Thomas yeah you

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.520 
top I'm not gonna start Thomas yeah you
can<00:02:44.000> see<00:02:44.180> forward<00:02:44.480> backwards<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.410> you're

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
can see forward backwards so you're

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.300 
can see forward backwards so you're
putting<00:02:45.770> it<00:02:45.830> forward

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
putting it forward

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.760 
putting it forward
and<00:02:46.520> we're<00:02:47.330> gonna<00:02:47.510> see<00:02:47.750> how<00:02:47.990> a<00:02:48.440> caterpillar

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
and we're gonna see how a caterpillar

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.180 
and we're gonna see how a caterpillar
train<00:02:50.200> performs<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:51.650> right

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.520 

that<00:02:55.190> was<00:02:55.489> awesome<00:02:55.810> performance<00:02:56.810> by

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
that was awesome performance by

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.280 
that was awesome performance by
caterpillar<00:02:57.950> trained<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.940> loved<00:02:59.290> we're

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
caterpillar trained and loved we're

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.140 
caterpillar trained and loved we're
gonna<00:03:00.500> put<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:01.130> backward<00:03:01.640> let's<00:03:01.850> see<00:03:02.000> how

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
gonna put it backward let's see how

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.840 
gonna put it backward let's see how
caterpillar<00:03:02.660> chain<00:03:02.690> works<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.489> time<00:03:04.730> is

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
caterpillar chain works and this time is

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:22.110 
caterpillar chain works and this time is
gonna<00:03:05.000> be<00:03:05.090> Percy<00:03:05.630> okay<00:03:06.560> three<00:03:06.980> two<00:03:07.989> three<00:03:08.989> one
