so<00:04:10.020> if<00:04:10.320> we<00:04:10.440> now<00:04:10.590> look<00:04:10.620> at<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.070> audio<00:04:12.060> I've

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
so if we now look at the audio I've

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.840 
so if we now look at the audio I've
captured<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.410> play<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.650> bit<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:13.890> that<00:04:14.040> back<00:04:14.870> and

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
captured and play a bit of that back and

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.670 
captured and play a bit of that back and
we<00:04:17.850> can<00:04:18.000> also<00:04:18.120> look<00:04:18.299> at<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.660> MIDI<00:04:18.810> data<00:04:18.900> so

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
we can also look at the MIDI data so

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.260 
we can also look at the MIDI data so
this<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:19.920> MIDI<00:04:20.100> data<00:04:20.280> that's<00:04:20.580> come<00:04:20.820> from<00:04:21.030> my

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
this is MIDI data that's come from my

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.660 
this is MIDI data that's come from my
iPad<00:04:21.690> from<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.080> cordilla<00:04:22.500> nap<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.370> it's<00:04:23.520> now

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
iPad from the cordilla nap and it's now

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.790 
iPad from the cordilla nap and it's now
been<00:04:23.820> recorded<00:04:24.480> into<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.960> MIDI<00:04:25.290> track<00:04:25.350> in

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
been recorded into a MIDI track in

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.110 
been recorded into a MIDI track in
Cubase<00:04:27.920> so<00:04:28.920> there<00:04:29.070> you<00:04:29.160> have<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.430> very<00:04:29.460> easy<00:04:29.850> to

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
Cubase so there you have it very easy to

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.790 
Cubase so there you have it very easy to
establish<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.630> wireless<00:04:31.080> MIDI<00:04:31.290> connection

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800

combination of Bonjour and RTP MIDI once

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.140 
combination of Bonjour and RTP MIDI once
you've<00:04:37.920> established<00:04:38.010> that<00:04:38.430> connection<00:04:39.000> you

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
you've established that connection you

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.150 
you've established that connection you
can<00:04:39.300> use<00:04:39.450> apps<00:04:39.660> like<00:04:39.810> Gordian<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.740> generate

desktop door V control Pro is a good

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.540 
desktop door V control Pro is a good
example<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.260> what<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:52.950> may<00:04:53.100> allows<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.460> to

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
example and what that may allows you to

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.070 
example and what that may allows you to
do<00:04:53.669> is<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:53.910> actually<00:04:54.150> be<00:04:54.270> away<00:04:54.570> from<00:04:54.630> your
