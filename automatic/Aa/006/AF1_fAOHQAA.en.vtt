situations<00:00:25.189> okay<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.369> let's<00:00:26.640> get<00:00:26.730> into<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
situations okay so let's get into a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.120 
situations okay so let's get into a
little<00:00:27.119> bit<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.510> moving<00:00:27.750> parts<00:00:27.779> as<00:00:28.260> usual

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
little bit of the moving parts as usual

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.980 
little bit of the moving parts as usual
we'll<00:00:29.310> start<00:00:29.609> from<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.210> front<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> go<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
we'll start from the front and go to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.600 
we'll start from the front and go to
back<00:00:31.820> so<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.390> other<00:00:33.420> kit<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:35.309> one

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
back so like the other kit and this one

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.380 
back so like the other kit and this one
the<00:00:35.820> cockpit<00:00:36.210> opens<00:00:37.160> no<00:00:38.160> little<00:00:38.610> guy<00:00:38.700> inside

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.340 

differently<00:00:42.390> from<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.690> other<00:00:42.870> ones<00:00:43.050> now<00:00:43.200> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
differently from the other ones now this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.700 
differently from the other ones now this
one<00:00:43.500> has<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> lot<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.250> moving<00:00:44.489> parts<00:00:45.410> on<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
one has a lot of moving parts on the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.150 
one has a lot of moving parts on the
head<00:00:46.920> as<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.670> see<00:00:48.289> first<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:49.620> these

slide out like so and what these
actually<00:01:36.720> all<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.909> believe<00:01:38.909> shield

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
actually all are I believe shield

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.520 
actually all are I believe shield
generators<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:41.159> when<00:01:41.340> those<00:01:41.520> extend<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:43.290> get

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
generators so when those extend you get

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.420 
generators so when those extend you get
a<00:01:43.799> shield<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> series<00:01:46.009> that<00:01:47.009> protects

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
a shield in the series that protects

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.039 
a shield in the series that protects
against<00:01:47.729> frontal<00:01:48.540> attacks<00:01:49.909> okay<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.659> now<00:01:51.869> on

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
against frontal attacks okay so now on

against frontal attacks okay so now on
to<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.229> blades<00:01:52.909> this<00:01:53.909> guy<00:01:54.149> has<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> total<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
to the blades this guy has a total of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:55.969 
to the blades this guy has a total of
seven<00:01:55.439> blades

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
that it uses for fighting five of which

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.030 
that it uses for fighting five of which
are<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> head<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.710> two<00:02:01.710> on<00:02:01.890> the

are on the head we have two on the
bottom<00:02:02.340> down<00:02:02.490> here<00:02:02.570> come<00:02:03.570> forward<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
bottom down here come forward like that

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.380 
bottom down here come forward like that
they<00:02:06.229> have<00:02:06.409> to<00:02:06.680> up<00:02:07.040> here<00:02:07.580> they<00:02:07.820> also<00:02:08.000> come

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
they have to up here they also come

they have to up here they also come
forward<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.789> then<00:02:10.789> we<00:02:10.910> have<00:02:11.060> one<00:02:11.209> on<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.450> top

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
forward and then we have one on the top

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.770 
forward and then we have one on the top
that<00:02:12.530> just<00:02:12.740> comes<00:02:12.980> up<00:02:13.130> around<00:02:13.520> like<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:13.819> and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
that just comes up around like that and

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.100 
that just comes up around like that and
you<00:02:15.350> get<00:02:15.560> what<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:15.860> called<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.970> series<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
you get what is called in the series the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.559 
you get what is called in the series the
buster<00:02:18.470> slash<00:02:18.860> which<00:02:19.819> is<00:02:20.060> an<00:02:20.239> attack

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
buster slash which is an attack

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.660 
buster slash which is an attack
consisting<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.560> all<00:02:21.709> five<00:02:21.980> frontal<00:02:22.400> blades

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
consisting of all five frontal blades

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.949 
consisting of all five frontal blades
like<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:25.600> return<00:02:26.600> those<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:28.600> moving<00:02:29.600> farther

right here that open and close those see

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.309 
right here that open and close those see
these<00:02:37.790> they're<00:02:38.630> different<00:02:38.870> from<00:02:39.200> the

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
these they're different from the

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.960 
these they're different from the
original<00:02:39.470> ligers<00:02:40.069> boosters<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.790> mean

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
original ligers boosters and I mean

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.690 
original ligers boosters and I mean
there's<00:02:41.180> nothing<00:02:41.480> inside<00:02:41.600> but<00:02:42.290> still<00:02:42.500> oh<00:02:42.830> and

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
there's nothing inside but still oh and

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.360 
there's nothing inside but still oh and
they're<00:02:43.790> smaller<00:02:44.060> too<00:02:44.890> they<00:02:45.890> come<00:02:46.100> up<00:02:46.250> and

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
they're smaller too they come up and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.170 
they're smaller too they come up and
down<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:49.370> now<00:02:49.670> for<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.480> main<00:02:50.989> blades<00:02:52.180> these

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
down and now for the main blades these

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.660 
down and now for the main blades these
guys<00:02:54.160> open<00:02:55.160> up<00:02:55.660> like<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.400> they<00:02:58.400> come

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
guys open up like so and they come

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.500 
guys open up like so and they come
forward<00:02:59.799> now<00:03:00.799> with<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:01.519> kit<00:03:01.819> unlike<00:03:02.269> in<00:03:02.480> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
forward now with this kit unlike in the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.039 
forward now with this kit unlike in the
anime<00:03:03.069> these<00:03:04.069> can't<00:03:04.489> really<00:03:04.730> come<00:03:04.970> forward<00:03:05.360> so

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
anime these can't really come forward so

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.229 
anime these can't really come forward so
they<00:03:06.470> just<00:03:07.090> stay<00:03:08.090> back<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:08.660> open<00:03:09.500> up<00:03:10.239> but

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
they just stay back and open up but

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.729 
they just stay back and open up but
there<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:11.600> trick<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.140> making<00:03:12.350> them<00:03:12.590> come

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
there is a trick to making them come

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.069 
there is a trick to making them come
forward<00:03:12.920> I'll<00:03:13.160> show<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.519> later<00:03:14.079> so

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
forward I'll show you that later so

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.319 
forward I'll show you that later so
that's<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.410> two<00:03:15.560> blades<00:03:15.799> there<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:17.090> then<00:03:17.239> you

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
that's the two blades there and then you

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.180 
that's the two blades there and then you
have<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.600> tail<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:18.799> moves<00:03:19.400> up<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.120> down<00:03:20.209> and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
have the tail that moves up and down and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.560 
have the tail that moves up and down and
the<00:03:22.190> tip<00:03:22.430> of<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.670> tail<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.120> really<00:03:23.359> cool

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
the tip of the tail is really cool

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.590 
the tip of the tail is really cool
because<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:24.140> has<00:03:24.829> these<00:03:25.040> little<00:03:25.100> blades<00:03:25.600> that

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
because it has these little blades that

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.710 
because it has these little blades that
you<00:03:26.720> can<00:03:26.900> open<00:03:27.049> and<00:03:27.260> close<00:03:27.350> like<00:03:28.310> so<00:03:28.720> that's

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
you can open and close like so that's

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.060 
you can open and close like so that's
pretty<00:03:29.930> cool

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:40.449 

okay<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:35.480> now<00:03:37.120> onto<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:39.160> attacks<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.310> I

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
blades like that and they come forward

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:16.620 
blades like that and they come forward
now<00:05:12.660> also<00:05:14.070> these<00:05:15.070> open<00:05:15.460> up<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:16.270> you<00:05:16.450> get<00:05:16.570> a

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
shield along with the blades so it makes

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.860 
shield along with the blades so it makes
the<00:05:19.120> lighter<00:05:19.300> look<00:05:19.539> like<00:05:19.690> it's<00:05:19.840> glowing<00:05:21.870> its

the lighter look like it's glowing its
bottom<00:05:23.260> one<00:05:23.410> too<00:05:25.410> so<00:05:26.410> that's<00:05:26.650> what<00:05:26.860> the

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
bottom one too so that's what the

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.339 
bottom one too so that's what the
flagger<00:05:28.240> looks<00:05:28.539> like<00:05:28.690> when<00:05:28.840> it's<00:05:28.990> doing<00:05:29.169> the

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
flagger looks like when it's doing the

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.460 
flagger looks like when it's doing the
seven<00:05:29.650> blade<00:05:29.830> attack<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:31.810> you<00:05:31.960> can<00:05:32.110> see<00:05:32.260> for

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
seven blade attack and you can see for

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:54.359 
seven blade attack and you can see for
yourself<00:05:32.770> how<00:05:32.919> it<00:05:33.039> moves

00:05:54.359 --> 00:05:54.369 

00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:58.510 

and<00:05:55.749> that's<00:05:56.749> basically<00:05:57.050> it<00:05:57.499> for<00:05:57.529> all<00:05:58.219> the

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
and that's basically it for all the

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.320 
and that's basically it for all the
moving<00:05:58.789> parts<00:05:59.119> I<00:05:59.300> mean<00:06:00.729> yeah<00:06:01.729> it's<00:06:01.999> not<00:06:02.179> as

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
moving parts I mean yeah it's not as

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.980 
moving parts I mean yeah it's not as
articulate<00:06:02.899> as<00:06:02.929> the<00:06:03.110> other<00:06:03.229> models<00:06:03.589> but<00:06:04.990> for

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
articulate as the other models but for

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.449 
articulate as the other models but for
it<00:06:06.110> being<00:06:06.349> something<00:06:06.800> as<00:06:06.889> simple<00:06:07.069> as<00:06:07.309> this

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:07.459 
it being something as simple as this

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:10.149 
it being something as simple as this
it's<00:06:07.639> really<00:06:07.879> cool<00:06:08.089> I<00:06:08.330> really<00:06:09.050> like<00:06:09.499> it<00:06:09.679> this
