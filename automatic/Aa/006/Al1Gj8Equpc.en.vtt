2013<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.750> then<00:00:22.260> obviously<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.279> go

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
2013 and then obviously here if you go

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.230 
2013 and then obviously here if you go
to<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:24.199> SDK<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:26.760> giant<00:00:26.970> said

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
to one SDK and you can see giant said

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.450 
to one SDK and you can see giant said
that<00:00:27.359> here<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:27.900> Windows<00:00:28.199> 32<00:00:28.980> you'll<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
that here for Windows 32 you'll see it

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.620 
that here for Windows 32 you'll see it
be<00:00:29.519> 64<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.179> your<00:00:30.330> 64<00:00:31.050> bit<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.189> if<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.630> open

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
be 64 of your 64 bit so if you just open

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.970 
be 64 of your 64 bit so if you just open
that<00:00:33.660> installer<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.350> then<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> stall

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that installer and then you have a stall

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.020 
that installer and then you have a stall
template<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.850> well<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:38.160> yeah<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.000> it's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
template here as well so yeah so it's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.900 
template here as well so yeah so it's
sample<00:00:39.540> model<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> open<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.910> believe

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
sample model if you open this I believe

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.170 
sample model if you open this I believe
that<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.920> just<00:00:43.920> an<00:00:44.100> empty<00:00:46.070> tractor

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
that this is just just an empty tractor

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.459 
that this is just just an empty tractor
nothing<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.660> looking<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> bit<00:00:49.260> weird

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
nothing on it just looking a bit weird

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.680 
nothing on it just looking a bit weird
for<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.079> use<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.129> mod<00:00:53.850> basically<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.600> you

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
for you to use as a mod basically so you

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.740 
for you to use as a mod basically so you
can<00:00:54.840> edit<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.469> giant<00:00:56.190> said<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.629> don't<00:00:57.629> know

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
can edit in giant said I don't know

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.650 
can edit in giant said I don't know
what's<00:00:57.899> taking<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.260> while<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> load<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.660> yeah

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
what's taking a while to load but yeah

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.619 
what's taking a while to load but yeah
that's<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.420> that

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that's what it is so you can get that

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.320 
that's what it is so you can get that
edit<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:04.650> post<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.400> search<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.119> for

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
edit it and then post it search this for

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.020 
edit it and then post it search this for
you<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.600> use<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.020> test<00:01:07.530> out<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.640> obviously<00:01:08.760> in

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
you to use to test out and obviously in

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.910 
you to use to test out and obviously in
the<00:01:09.150> textures<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.229> same<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.860> you

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the textures it's all the same so if you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.120 
the textures it's all the same so if you
go<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.070> Texas<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.820> open<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:13.130> can

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
go to Texas and you open this you can

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.310 
go to Texas and you open this you can
edit<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.700> which<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.450> change<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> color

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
of these to change the color of the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.789 
of these to change the color of the
tractor<00:01:18.479> which<00:01:18.659> I've<00:01:18.840> shown<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.049> video<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.590> it's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
tractor which I've shown a video on it's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.280 
tractor which I've shown a video on it's
exactly<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.430> same<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.140> yeah

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
exactly the same just do that but yeah

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.810 
exactly the same just do that but yeah
you<00:01:22.350> install<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.130> it'll<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> map

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you install that and it'll get the map

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.359 
you install that and it'll get the map
up<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.360> data<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> go

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
up if you go data and then if you go

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.840 
up if you go data and then if you go
Maps<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> obviously<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.829> es<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.490> open

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
Maps so obviously it's es so if we open

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.179 
Maps so obviously it's es so if we open
the<00:01:30.299> map<00:01:30.810> oh<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.229> little<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.740> far<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.100> can

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the map oh one little as far as you can

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.190 
the map oh one little as far as you can
get<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.210> open<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> map<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.049> is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
get if you open the map with one this is

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.300 
get if you open the map with one this is
the<00:01:34.380> original<00:01:35.340> map<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:37.100> obviously<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.220> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the original map so obviously if you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.530 
the original map so obviously if you
download<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> map<00:01:38.820> there'll<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.090> other<00:01:39.270> file

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
download a map there'll be other file

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.160 
download a map there'll be other file
formats<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> new<00:01:42.869> giant

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
formats here but this is the new giant

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.740 
formats here but this is the new giant
so<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.409> our<00:01:43.530> 5.0.1<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.540> why<00:01:45.689> it

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
so that our 5.0.1 and this is why it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.139 
so that our 5.0.1 and this is why it
looks<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.189> I'll<00:01:47.189> skip<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.000> fully

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
looks like I'll skip it when it's fully

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.319 
looks like I'll skip it when it's fully

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.560 
the new map I haven't really been on it
that<00:04:04.910> much<00:04:05.470> so<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.950> if<00:04:07.670> we<00:04:07.820> go<00:04:07.970> over<00:04:08.000> here

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
that much so and if we go over here

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.250 
that much so and if we go over here
obviously<00:04:09.050> there's<00:04:09.200> new<00:04:09.380> new<00:04:09.950> bits<00:04:10.959> like<00:04:11.959> the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
obviously there's new new bits like the

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.960 
obviously there's new new bits like the
the<00:04:12.739> Stalin<00:04:13.070> point<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.340> could<00:04:13.489> just<00:04:13.850> probably

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
the Stalin point I could just probably

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.550 
the Stalin point I could just probably
click<00:04:14.300> on<00:04:14.420> here<00:04:14.570> it<00:04:14.630> comes<00:04:14.870> up<00:04:15.019> with<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.200> box

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
click on here it comes up with a box

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.380 
click on here it comes up with a box
yeah<00:04:16.190> so<00:04:16.430> there's<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.700> silent<00:04:17.060> point<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:17.330> you

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
yeah so there's a silent point so you

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.330 
yeah so there's a silent point so you
can<00:04:17.540> move<00:04:18.080> that<00:04:18.290> over<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.709> map<00:04:18.890> if<00:04:19.040> you<00:04:19.160> want

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
can move that over the map if you want

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.580 
can move that over the map if you want
to<00:04:19.580> or<00:04:19.880> keep<00:04:20.540> it<00:04:20.690> there<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.109> then<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:21.350> bank

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
to or keep it there and then the bank

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.130 
to or keep it there and then the bank
you<00:04:21.859> just<00:04:22.040> send<00:04:22.190> an<00:04:22.310> icon<00:04:22.640> to<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:22.940> bank<00:04:23.950> and

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
you just send an icon to the bank and

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.110 
you just send an icon to the bank and
most<00:04:27.140> of<00:04:27.260> ain't<00:04:27.440> no<00:04:27.620> kid<00:04:27.860> yes<00:04:28.160> ATM<00:04:28.610> machine<00:04:28.940> and

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
most of ain't no kid yes ATM machine and

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.700 
most of ain't no kid yes ATM machine and
if<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.270> click<00:04:29.390> X<00:04:29.600> on<00:04:29.750> that<00:04:29.780> it's<00:04:30.050> just<00:04:30.229> the<00:04:30.350> ATM

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
if you click X on that it's just the ATM

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.890 
if you click X on that it's just the ATM
machine<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.520> then<00:04:31.640> it's<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.970> box<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:32.780> that's

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
machine and then it's the box so that's

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.990 
machine and then it's the box so that's
basically<00:04:33.290> does<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.680> trigger<00:04:33.950> in<00:04:34.130> an<00:04:34.250> image

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
basically does the trigger in an image

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.820 
basically does the trigger in an image
that's<00:04:35.720> all<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:35.930> is<00:04:36.020> so<00:04:36.200> you<00:04:36.260> can<00:04:36.440> add<00:04:36.560> them<00:04:36.710> any

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
that's all it is so you can add them any

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.130 
that's all it is so you can add them any
way<00:04:36.950> you<00:04:36.979> like

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
way you like

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.780 
way you like
so<00:04:39.140> and<00:04:39.650> obviously<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:40.160> flags<00:04:40.400> moves<00:04:40.640> now

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
so and obviously the flags moves now

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.670 
so and obviously the flags moves now
which<00:04:40.970> is<00:04:41.120> really<00:04:41.150> good<00:04:42.370> yes<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:45.050> submissions

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
which is really good yes of submissions

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.300 
which is really good yes of submissions
that's<00:04:45.950> going<00:04:46.100> to<00:04:46.160> be<00:04:46.310> difficult<00:04:46.940> because<00:04:47.090> I

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
that's going to be difficult because I

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.719 
that's going to be difficult because I
know

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
know

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.310 
know
