grind<00:02:48.650> fine<00:02:49.650> grind<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.100> like<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.820> finer<00:02:51.000> grind

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
grind fine grind I like the finer grind

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.210 
grind fine grind I like the finer grind
better<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.660> was<00:02:51.780> stronger<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.230> least<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.739> guess

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
better it was stronger at least I guess

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.310 
better it was stronger at least I guess
if<00:02:53.370> you're<00:02:53.459> like<00:02:54.060> doing<00:02:54.390> double<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.019> amount

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
if you're like doing double the amount

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.500 
if you're like doing double the amount
that<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.890> on<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.310> package<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.180> probably

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
that is on the package then it probably

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.030 
that is on the package then it probably
doesn't<00:02:57.780> matter<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.560> then<00:02:58.680> you're<00:02:58.769> gonna<00:02:58.890> be

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
doesn't matter and then you're gonna be

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.770 
doesn't matter and then you're gonna be
stuck<00:02:59.280> with<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.610> syrup<00:03:00.030> anyway<00:03:00.360> yeah<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
stuck with like a syrup anyway yeah I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.540 
stuck with like a syrup anyway yeah I
mean<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.200> think<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.680> really<00:03:01.860> biggest<00:03:02.100> impact

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
mean I think the really biggest impact

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.809 
mean I think the really biggest impact
is<00:03:02.790> how<00:03:03.030> long<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.540> steeps<00:03:03.870> up<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.319> a<00:03:04.350> point<00:03:04.819> I'm

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
is how long it steeps up to a point I'm

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.000 
is how long it steeps up to a point I'm
leaning<00:03:06.180> towards<00:03:06.390> 24<00:03:06.870> hours<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.470> month<00:03:07.709> this

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
leaning towards 24 hours this month this

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.650 
leaning towards 24 hours this month this
batch<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.250> only<00:03:08.550> on<00:03:08.730> 12<00:03:08.880> hours<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.420> it's<00:03:09.569> going

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
batch is only on 12 hours so it's going

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.110 
batch is only on 12 hours so it's going
to<00:03:09.780> be<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> tad<00:03:10.140> weaker<00:03:10.440> than<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.769> could<00:03:10.950> be<00:03:11.120> I

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
to be a tad weaker than it could be I

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.630 
to be a tad weaker than it could be I
think<00:03:12.959> we<00:03:13.110> should<00:03:13.350> drain<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.250> rest<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.550> this

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
think we should drain the rest of this

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.340 
think we should drain the rest of this
so<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.090> we<00:03:15.330> can<00:03:15.360> share<00:03:15.810> with<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.050> studio

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
so that we can share with the studio

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.740 
so that we can share with the studio
crew<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.799> think<00:03:17.220> you're<00:03:17.340> right<00:03:17.489> yeah

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
crew I think you're right yeah

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.560

actually<00:03:51.660> watching<00:03:51.989> coffee<00:03:52.200> filter<00:03:52.680> it's

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
actually watching coffee filter it's

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.770 
actually watching coffee filter it's
just<00:03:53.519> like<00:03:53.670> watching<00:03:53.820> paint<00:03:54.180> dry<00:03:54.269> but<00:03:54.600> better

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
just like watching paint dry but better

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.680 
just like watching paint dry but better
so<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:55.739> pretty<00:03:56.010> good<00:03:56.160> just<00:03:56.489> as<00:03:56.700> is<00:03:57.000> yeah<00:03:57.660> I

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
so this is pretty good just as is yeah I

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.910 
so this is pretty good just as is yeah I
think<00:03:57.900> it's<00:03:58.109> because<00:03:58.260> we<00:03:58.380> only<00:03:58.500> use<00:03:58.650> two

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
think it's because we only use two

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.830 
think it's because we only use two
tablespoons<00:03:59.579> per<00:03:59.850> cup<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.269> lot<00:04:00.390> of<00:04:00.510> recipes

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
tablespoons per cup a lot of recipes

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.509

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
maybe we just didn't use enough coffee

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.930 
maybe we just didn't use enough coffee
to<00:04:13.470> make<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.829> these<00:04:14.010> scary<00:04:14.400> stuff<00:04:14.730> that<00:04:14.880> we

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
to make it these scary stuff that we

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.699 
to make it these scary stuff that we
read<00:04:15.120> about<00:04:15.150> I've<00:04:15.510> tried<00:04:15.959> some<00:04:16.229> that<00:04:16.560> it

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
read about I've tried some that it

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.470 
read about I've tried some that it
literally<00:04:17.039> doubles<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.760> amount<00:04:17.910> of

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
literally doubles the amount of

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.810 
literally doubles the amount of
uh<00:04:18.600> coffee<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.740> put<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.070> there<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.520> that

uh coffee that you put in there and that

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.450 
uh coffee that you put in there and that
was<00:04:20.940> very<00:04:20.970> like<00:04:21.720> almost<00:04:21.870> syrupy<00:04:22.530> you've<00:04:23.190> also
