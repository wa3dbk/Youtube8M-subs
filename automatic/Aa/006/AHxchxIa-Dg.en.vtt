00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.309 

so<00:00:04.730> what<00:00:04.910> we'll<00:00:05.060> do<00:00:05.180> is<00:00:05.390> stabilize<00:00:05.600> this<00:00:06.050> four

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
so what we'll do is stabilize this four

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.050 
so what we'll do is stabilize this four
door<00:00:06.500> over<00:00:06.770> their<00:00:06.920> burgers<00:00:07.279> and<00:00:07.550> then<00:00:07.939> we'll

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.060 
door over their burgers and then we'll

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.690 
door over their burgers and then we'll
flip<00:00:08.240> it<00:00:08.390> upside<00:00:08.720> down<00:00:08.750> and<00:00:09.400> once<00:00:10.400> we've<00:00:10.580> done

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
flip it upside down and once we've done

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.460 
flip it upside down and once we've done
that<00:00:10.760> then<00:00:11.210> we'll<00:00:11.540> go<00:00:11.690> to<00:00:11.720> one<00:00:12.050> of<00:00:12.080> the<00:00:12.260> two

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:12.470 
that then we'll go to one of the two

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.460 
that then we'll go to one of the two
hatchbacks<00:00:12.980> over<00:00:13.220> here<00:00:13.460> will<00:00:14.230> stabilize<00:00:15.230> it

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
hatchbacks over here will stabilize it

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.689 
hatchbacks over here will stabilize it
we'll<00:00:15.680> just<00:00:15.830> put<00:00:15.980> it<00:00:16.189> upside<00:00:16.520> down<00:00:16.550> and

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
we'll just put it upside down and

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.490 
we'll just put it upside down and
stabilize<00:00:17.029> it<00:00:17.240> upside<00:00:17.720> down<00:00:17.930> now<00:00:18.439> stabilize

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
stabilize it upside down now stabilize

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.350 
stabilize it upside down now stabilize
them<00:00:19.070> on<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.279> sides<00:00:19.519> about<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:19.940> same<00:00:20.180> either

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
them on the sides about the same either

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.260 
them on the sides about the same either
way<00:00:20.560> so<00:00:21.560> what<00:00:21.740> I<00:00:21.770> could<00:00:22.160> do<00:00:22.250> on<00:00:22.400> this<00:00:22.520> one<00:00:23.000> is

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
way so what I could do on this one is

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.279 
way so what I could do on this one is
we'll<00:00:23.420> go<00:00:23.570> ahead<00:00:23.660> and<00:00:23.780> start<00:00:24.110> our

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
we'll go ahead and start our

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.200 
we'll go ahead and start our
stabilization<00:00:25.039> of<00:00:25.160> it<00:00:25.310> let's<00:00:25.730> take<00:00:25.910> a<00:00:25.940> quick

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
stabilization of it let's take a quick

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.640 
stabilization of it let's take a quick
look<00:00:26.390> at<00:00:26.660> it<00:00:26.810> and<00:00:26.840> see<00:00:27.050> what<00:00:27.230> we've<00:00:27.410> got<00:00:27.560> to

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
look at it and see what we've got to

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.260 
look at it and see what we've got to
deal<00:00:27.830> with<00:00:27.860> what<00:00:28.070> kind<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.490> problems<00:00:28.910> we<00:00:29.060> might

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
deal with what kind of problems we might

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.610 
deal with what kind of problems we might
encounter

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:32.620 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.569 

blitz<00:00:33.620> falling<00:00:34.039> off<00:00:34.190> of<00:00:34.219> it<00:00:36.250> still<00:00:37.250> attached

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
blitz falling off of it still attached

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.880 
blitz falling off of it still attached
on<00:00:37.820> one<00:00:37.850> means<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.420> looks<00:00:38.570> like<00:00:38.750> bottom<00:00:39.680> five

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
on one means it looks like bottom five

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.410 
on one means it looks like bottom five
pretty<00:00:40.190> clear<00:00:40.720> is<00:00:41.720> it<00:00:41.899> completely<00:00:42.320> loose<00:00:43.750> okay

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
pretty clear is it completely loose okay

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.020 
pretty clear is it completely loose okay
now<00:00:47.420> looking<00:00:48.079> at<00:00:48.200> this<00:00:48.320> car<00:00:48.620> which<00:00:49.610> way<00:00:49.820> would

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
now looking at this car which way would

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.610 
now looking at this car which way would
we<00:00:50.120> say<00:00:50.300> is<00:00:50.450> most<00:00:50.630> likely<00:00:50.930> that<00:00:51.260> it's<00:00:51.410> going<00:00:51.500> to

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
we say is most likely that it's going to

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.970 
we say is most likely that it's going to
roll

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.970 

towards<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.730> roof<00:00:59.260> yeah<00:01:00.260> probably<00:01:00.739> towards

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
towards the roof yeah probably towards

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.830 
towards the roof yeah probably towards
the<00:01:01.070> roof<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:01.820> in<00:01:01.940> this<00:01:02.090> case<00:01:02.360> we'd<00:01:02.630> probably

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
the roof so in this case we'd probably

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.729 
the roof so in this case we'd probably
want<00:01:03.079> to<00:01:03.200> set<00:01:03.350> up<00:01:03.380> your<00:01:03.500> initial

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
want to set up your initial

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.330 
want to set up your initial
stabilization<00:01:04.610> on<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.820> top<00:01:05.000> side<00:01:05.590> so<00:01:06.590> what

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
stabilization on the top side so what

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.719 
stabilization on the top side so what
we'll<00:01:07.460> do<00:01:07.580> is<00:01:07.700> grab<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:07.909> couple<00:01:08.210> of<00:01:08.360> wedges

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
we'll do is grab a couple of wedges

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.100 
we'll do is grab a couple of wedges
while<00:01:10.729> somebody's<00:01:11.119> getting<00:01:11.330> those<00:01:11.510> we'll

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
while somebody's getting those we'll

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.630 
while somebody's getting those we'll
have<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.260> safety<00:01:12.560> officer<00:01:12.770> get<00:01:13.100> hold<00:01:13.340> of<00:01:13.490> it

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
have a safety officer get hold of it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.249 
have a safety officer get hold of it
either<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.330> front<00:01:14.540> or<00:01:14.660> in<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.780> back<00:01:14.840> where

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
shovel are good because when we flip it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.940 
shovel are good because when we flip it
the<00:01:35.450> land<00:01:35.660> out<00:01:35.840> on<00:01:35.990> top<00:01:36.490> all<00:01:37.490> right<00:01:38.950> remember

we don't want to move it all we want
those<00:01:41.990> wedges<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.500> do<00:01:42.619> is<00:01:42.770> take<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.070> slack<00:01:43.310> out

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
those wedges to do is take the slack out

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.270 
those wedges to do is take the slack out
where<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:43.880> can't<00:01:44.119> move<00:01:44.300> this<00:01:44.660> way<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:45.229> I<00:01:45.979> put

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
where it can't move this way so I put

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.460 
where it can't move this way so I put
one<00:01:46.310> at<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.670> front<00:01:46.910> one<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.240> back<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:48.320> if

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
one at the front one in the back and if

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.919 
one at the front one in the back and if
you<00:01:48.500> can<00:01:48.649> get<00:01:48.770> them<00:01:48.860> under<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.190> fender<00:01:49.929> that's

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
you can get them under the fender that's

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.660 
you can get them under the fender that's
the<00:01:51.080> way<00:01:51.200> I<00:01:51.229> would<00:01:51.380> set<00:01:51.740> just<00:01:52.190> like<00:01:52.310> that

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
the way I would set just like that

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.669 
the way I would set just like that
because<00:01:53.270> all<00:01:53.479> of<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.690> able<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:54.110> read<00:01:54.560> that

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
because all of the able to read that

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:56.380 
because all of the able to read that
base<00:01:54.890> out<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:55.340> keep<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.610> from<00:01:55.729> coming<00:01:55.910> down<00:01:56.060> on

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
base out to keep it from coming down on

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.740 
base out to keep it from coming down on
us<00:01:56.420> you<00:01:57.050> got<00:01:57.259> into<00:01:57.530> it<00:01:58.030> okay<00:01:59.030> now<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.570> next

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
us you got into it okay now the next

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.450 
us you got into it okay now the next
thing<00:02:00.140> we'll<00:02:00.320> do<00:02:00.500> since<00:02:01.009> it's<00:02:01.160> most<00:02:01.340> likely

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
thing we'll do since it's most likely

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.370 
thing we'll do since it's most likely
that<00:02:01.820> it<00:02:02.030> will<00:02:02.119> roll<00:02:02.360> this<00:02:02.569> way<00:02:02.780> as<00:02:02.990> we'll<00:02:03.170> set

a post and we'll set another jack at the

since these windows were already broken

00:02:43.790 --> 00:03:05.320 
since these windows were already broken
it<00:02:44.150> makes<00:02:44.300> it<00:02:44.450> really

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:20.059

better<00:03:20.730> than<00:03:20.999> that<00:03:21.420> because<00:03:22.140> if<00:03:22.260> you

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
better than that because if you

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:34.229 
better than that because if you
I<00:03:24.500> was<00:03:25.310> there<00:03:25.519> I<00:03:25.550> hit<00:03:25.909> what<00:03:26.300> they're<00:03:26.659> already

okay that's one of the options we have
for<00:03:38.150> anchoring<00:03:38.480> this<00:03:38.599> where<00:03:38.810> we<00:03:38.900> couldn't<00:03:39.110> get

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
for anchoring this where we couldn't get

for anchoring this where we couldn't get
an<00:03:39.409> anchor<00:03:39.650> point<00:03:39.680> here<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:42.140> end<00:03:42.290> this<00:03:42.410> is

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
an anchor point here we end this is

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:58.780 
an anchor point here we end this is
fairly<00:03:56.590> now<00:03:57.590> let's<00:03:57.920> get<00:03:58.069> to<00:03:58.129> the<00:03:58.310> other<00:03:58.459> side

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
fairly now let's get to the other side

fairly now let's get to the other side
we've<00:03:59.030> got<00:03:59.150> an<00:03:59.269> anchored<00:03:59.690> pretty<00:04:00.110> solid<00:04:00.530> over
