your<00:00:41.690> thing<00:00:41.900> and<00:00:42.879> yeah<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:43.940> can<00:00:44.089> go<00:00:44.390> layer<00:00:44.930> by

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
your thing and yeah you can go layer by

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.920 
your thing and yeah you can go layer by
layer<00:00:45.219> starting<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:46.430> know<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:47.300> is<00:00:47.420> an<00:00:47.539> EXO

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
layer starting you know this is an EXO

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.330 
layer starting you know this is an EXO
skeleton<00:00:48.500> i'm<00:00:48.890> really<00:00:49.070> know<00:00:49.160> what<00:00:49.250> you're

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
skeleton i'm really know what you're

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.410 
skeleton i'm really know what you're
going<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.520> call<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.700> but<00:00:49.940> anyway<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:50.239> start

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
going to call that but anyway you start

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.299 
going to call that but anyway you start
with<00:00:50.510> skin<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.140> can<00:00:51.199> go<00:00:51.320> down<00:00:51.469> to<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.710> skeleton

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
with skin you can go down to a skeleton

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.080 
with skin you can go down to a skeleton
nerves<00:00:53.210> organs<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.890> can<00:00:55.039> really<00:00:55.370> zoom<00:00:55.399> in<00:00:55.910> and

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
nerves organs you can really zoom in and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.549 
nerves organs you can really zoom in and
get<00:00:56.210> close<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:56.809> you<00:00:56.870> can<00:00:56.930> view<00:00:57.199> her<00:00:57.260> from

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
get close so you can view her from

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.979 
get close so you can view her from
different<00:00:57.890> angles<00:00:58.449> see<00:00:59.449> that<00:00:59.600> i'm<00:00:59.690> on<00:00:59.780> doing

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
different angles see that i'm on doing

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.599 
different angles see that i'm on doing
that<00:01:00.079> all<00:01:00.289> with<00:01:00.469> just<00:01:00.500> my<00:01:00.770> finger<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.460> can

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
that all with just my finger you can

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.869 
that all with just my finger you can
zoom<00:01:01.879> in<00:01:02.149> by<00:01:02.300> pinching<00:01:02.780> and<00:01:02.930> zooming<00:01:03.759> you<00:01:04.759> can

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
zoom in by pinching and zooming you can

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.660 
zoom in by pinching and zooming you can
see<00:01:05.059> it<00:01:05.180> looks<00:01:05.330> a<00:01:05.449> little<00:01:05.660> buggy<00:01:06.050> actually<00:01:06.710> you

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
see it looks a little buggy actually you

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.950 
see it looks a little buggy actually you
can<00:01:07.820> see<00:01:07.910> i'm<00:01:08.000> basically<00:01:08.210> going<00:01:08.330> inside<00:01:08.810> her

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
can see i'm basically going inside her

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.380 
can see i'm basically going inside her
head<00:01:09.460> but<00:01:10.460> that's<00:01:10.640> not<00:01:10.759> actually<00:01:10.910> rendering

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
head but that's not actually rendering

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.139 
head but that's not actually rendering
anything<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.310> spin<00:01:13.310> around<00:01:13.429> you<00:01:13.789> know<00:01:13.910> you<00:01:14.000> can

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
anything so spin around you know you can

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.930 
anything so spin around you know you can
you<00:01:15.020> can<00:01:15.200> zoom<00:01:15.440> out<00:01:15.649> like<00:01:16.190> i<00:01:16.310> say<00:01:16.490> get<00:01:16.759> all

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
you can zoom out like i say get all

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.310 
you can zoom out like i say get all
these<00:01:17.000> different<00:01:17.180> angles<00:01:17.570> anyway<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.200> that's

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
these different angles anyway so that's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.550 
these different angles anyway so that's
basically<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.770> start<00:01:19.250> of<00:01:19.369> it<00:01:20.259> if<00:01:21.259> we<00:01:21.350> go<00:01:21.439> up

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
basically the start of it if we go up

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.990 
basically the start of it if we go up
top<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:22.009> can<00:01:22.130> see<00:01:22.220> there's<00:01:22.400> logos<00:01:22.850> up

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
top and you can see there's logos up

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.210 
top and you can see there's logos up
here<00:01:23.240> we<00:01:23.900> have<00:01:24.049> one<00:01:24.200> that's<00:01:24.320> basically<00:01:24.979> just

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
here we have one that's basically just

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.310 
here we have one that's basically just
the<00:01:25.369> human<00:01:25.640> version<00:01:26.119> of<00:01:26.420> her<00:01:26.570> with<00:01:26.750> skin<00:01:27.110> and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
the human version of her with skin and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.289 
the human version of her with skin and
clothes<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:27.830> all<00:01:27.890> that<00:01:27.920> stuff<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.670> next<00:01:29.119> one

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
clothes and all that stuff the next one

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.859 
clothes and all that stuff the next one
would<00:01:29.479> be<00:01:29.540> muscles<00:01:30.320> so<00:01:31.009> we<00:01:31.159> tap<00:01:31.430> on<00:01:31.670> that<00:01:31.869> we

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
would be muscles so we tap on that we

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.270 
would be muscles so we tap on that we
get<00:01:33.140> muscles<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:36.500> next<00:01:36.710> one<00:01:36.829> over<00:01:36.979> is

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
get muscles the next one over is

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.539 
get muscles the next one over is
actually<00:01:37.670> bones<00:01:38.619> so<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:39.710> can<00:01:39.860> see<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:40.220> can<00:01:40.250> get

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
actually bones so you can see we can get

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.950 
actually bones so you can see we can get
and<00:01:40.790> you<00:01:40.909> know<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.060> can<00:01:41.150> zoom<00:01:41.509> in<00:01:41.659> on<00:01:41.750> all

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
and you know you can zoom in on all

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.510 
and you know you can zoom in on all
these<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.409> get<00:01:42.500> different<00:01:42.619> angles<00:01:43.070> on<00:01:43.220> all<00:01:43.369> of

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
these and get different angles on all of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.240 
these and get different angles on all of
them<00:01:44.020> see<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.409> can<00:01:45.500> really<00:01:45.680> zoom<00:01:45.770> in

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
them see that so you can really zoom in

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.710 
them see that so you can really zoom in
on<00:01:47.560> scary<00:01:48.560> skull<00:01:49.149> so<00:01:50.149> that's<00:01:50.299> kind<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.540> cool

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
on scary skull so that's kind of cool

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.440 
on scary skull so that's kind of cool
you<00:01:51.710> also<00:01:51.829> have<00:01:52.159> this<00:01:52.549> one<00:01:52.880> which<00:01:52.909> looks<00:01:53.360> like

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
you also have this one which looks like
