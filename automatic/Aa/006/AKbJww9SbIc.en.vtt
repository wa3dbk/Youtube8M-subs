00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
straightforward pretty simple the big

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.940 
straightforward pretty simple the big
thing<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> said<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
thing that like I said that that kind of

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.949 
thing that like I said that that kind of
got<00:02:10.950> me<00:02:11.099> thinking<00:02:11.129> was<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.090> padding<00:02:12.629> on<00:02:12.720> here

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
got me thinking was the padding on here

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.370 
got me thinking was the padding on here
as<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.170> can

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
as you can

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.960 
as you can
see<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:14.040> lot<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.640> thick<00:02:14.850> padding<00:02:15.350> so

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
see it's it's a lot of thick padding so

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.340 
see it's it's a lot of thick padding so
now<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.210> probably<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.630> pretty<00:02:18.870> nice<00:02:19.110> and

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
now be probably a pretty nice and

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.770 
now be probably a pretty nice and
comfortable<00:02:19.680> touch<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.450> i'm<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.660> try

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
comfortable touch to it i'm going to try

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.630 
comfortable touch to it i'm going to try
