I<00:02:03.820> don't<00:02:04.509> always<00:02:04.780> throw<00:02:05.049> those<00:02:05.350> away<00:02:05.380> but<00:02:06.070> this

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
I don't always throw those away but this

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.229 
I don't always throw those away but this
part<00:02:07.240> here<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:08.020> rubber<00:02:08.590> seal<00:02:09.369> is<00:02:09.729> very<00:02:09.759> hard

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
part here the rubber seal is very hard

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.540 
part here the rubber seal is very hard
to<00:02:10.300> come<00:02:10.599> across<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.920> only<00:02:12.130> place<00:02:12.400> you

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
to come across but the only place you

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.540 
to come across but the only place you
can<00:02:12.670> get<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.510> kit<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.920> you

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
can get it as in this kit so you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.699 
can get it as in this kit so you
absolutely<00:02:15.819> want<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.870> replace<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.470> rubber

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
absolutely want to replace that rubber

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
seal and the valve itself now sometimes

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.020 
seal and the valve itself now sometimes
you<00:02:22.630> can<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.050> kind<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.440> screw<00:02:23.890> these<00:02:24.130> off<00:02:24.489> but

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
you can just kind of screw these off but

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.520 
you can just kind of screw these off but
normally<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.840> take<00:02:26.769> my<00:02:27.069> screwdriver<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:28.530> pop
