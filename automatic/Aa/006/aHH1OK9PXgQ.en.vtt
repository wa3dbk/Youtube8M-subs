00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
in this chapter really just setting

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.459 
in this chapter really just setting
things<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:01.110> thought<00:02:01.259> was<00:02:01.439> pretty

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
things up and I thought was pretty

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.050 
things up and I thought was pretty

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
understanding where there was these two

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.340 
understanding where there was these two
heroes<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:04.130> Genoa<00:02:05.130> since<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.490> tamas<00:02:06.060> town

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
heroes in Genoa since I tamas town

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.630 
heroes in Genoa since I tamas town
and<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.340> monster

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and then there was this monster

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.520 
and then there was this monster
approaching<00:02:09.330> general<00:02:09.810> sense<00:02:10.229> its<00:02:10.470> presence

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
approaching general sense its presence

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.699 
approaching general sense its presence
or<00:02:11.340> he<00:02:11.819> could<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.240> been<00:02:12.390> sensing<00:02:12.990> the

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
or he could have been sensing the

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.540 
or he could have been sensing the
presence<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.280> those<00:02:14.520> heroes<00:02:15.030> maybe<00:02:15.530> but<00:02:16.550> NASA

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
presence of those heroes maybe but NASA

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.970 
presence of those heroes maybe but NASA
Jenna's<00:02:18.090> senses<00:02:18.480> something<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.110> then<00:02:19.860> he

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
Jenna's senses something and then he

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.580 
Jenna's senses something and then he
says<00:02:20.280> oh<00:02:20.989> it<00:02:21.989> looks<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.470> wasn't

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
says oh it looks like it wasn't

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.080 
says oh it looks like it wasn't
interested<00:02:23.190> in<00:02:23.280> coming<00:02:23.489> here<00:02:23.700> or<00:02:23.819> something

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
interested in coming here or something

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.090 
interested in coming here or something
like<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.239> basically<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.470> presence<00:02:25.890> wasn't

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
like that basically the presence wasn't

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.940 
like that basically the presence wasn't
interested<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:27.030> coming<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.870> Jenna's<00:02:28.290> insight

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
interested in coming to Jenna's insight

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.600 
interested in coming to Jenna's insight
Thomas<00:02:29.640> what<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:29.970> looks<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:31.130> but<00:02:32.130> then<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
Thomas what it looks like but then the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.550 
Thomas what it looks like but then the
monster<00:02:32.819> shows<00:02:33.270> up<00:02:33.920> with<00:02:34.920> those<00:02:35.190> two<00:02:35.250> heroes

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
monster shows up with those two heroes

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.910 
monster shows up with those two heroes
so<00:02:38.060> could<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.090> mean<00:02:39.569> that<00:02:40.010> those<00:02:41.010> heroes<00:02:41.519> are

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
so could that mean that those heroes are

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.150 
so could that mean that those heroes are
stronger<00:02:44.000> than<00:02:45.000> Saitama<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.959> jenos<00:02:46.350> could

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
stronger than Saitama and jenos could

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.729 
stronger than Saitama and jenos could
that<00:02:47.400> monster<00:02:47.880> showed<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:48.360> because<00:02:49.200> those

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
that monster showed up because those

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.960 
that monster showed up because those
those<00:02:50.040> two<00:02:50.190> guys<00:02:50.340> are<00:02:50.519> stronger<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:50.940> know

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
those two guys are stronger you know

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.509 
those two guys are stronger you know
because<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:52.410> monster<00:02:52.769> wasn't<00:02:52.950> interested<00:02:53.430> in

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
because the monster wasn't interested in

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.780 
because the monster wasn't interested in
showing<00:02:53.700> up<00:02:53.970> at<00:02:54.180> Genesis<00:02:54.780> place<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.430> it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.970 
showing up at Genesis place so and it
was<00:02:57.030> interested<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.690> showing<00:02:57.900> up<00:02:58.140> where<00:02:58.830> those

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
was interested in showing up where those

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.009 
was interested in showing up where those

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
could it be that these heroes are really

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.289 
could it be that these heroes are really
damn<00:03:03.630> strong<00:03:04.489> but<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.519> don't<00:03:05.760> know<00:03:05.880> because<00:03:06.090> of
