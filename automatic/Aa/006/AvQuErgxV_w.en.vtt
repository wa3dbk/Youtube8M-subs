00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.480
 tapas has a very clear goal that is 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.670
 highlight 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.340
 and make available to the public two 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.980
 very creative Spanish disciplines 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.759
 interesting and thriving gastronomy 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.070
 what is the food and the design as 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.920
 It makes it through objects and 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.010
 instruments that serve to prepare or 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.350
 serve the food the losses is called 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:46.690
 tapas because we give a small 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.579
 tasting everything that surrounds the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.370
 world of food from the point of 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.010
 view of something design from the kitchen something 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.239
 from the table something from the wineries the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:02.430
 wine labels some products 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:05.910
 We have searched three spaces 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.640
 the kitchen that is a little preparation 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.050
 all the instruments to prepare the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.600
 food 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:18.110
 2 the table is to say all the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.180
 instruments tasting objects 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.950
 of that food 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.030
 and 3rd 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:33.460
 point the very design of the food the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:37.840
 Extradition gathers only designed objects 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.069
 and manufactured in Spain is centered on 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.340
 all in recent years and the last 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:48.490
 I would say 20 25 years although there are some 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.950
 winks at the tradition goes through the typical 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.929
 Spanish paella with the boot to the botijo 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.390
 of the porrÃ³n some object 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:59.900
 let's say classic but the expedition 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.500
 wants to give an aspect of modernity and 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.290
 between the objects of tapas there are very 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.460
 funny 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.860
 for example a machine to make 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.210
 a product hot and cold at the same time 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.750
 kind of pancake but with the side 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:21.440
 in also for example something ironic 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.990
 as a board for cutting bread and 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.280
 crumbs through a feed pipe 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.700
 little birds 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.260
 after serious products of trays 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.560
 cutlery etc. so we have 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.690
 selected 100 bottles not only because 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.410
 the wine is good that also but for the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.680
 graphic design and then they will be 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.850
 exhibiting all the ingenious ideas 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.670
 to get the customer's attention in 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.760
 the bottles objectively the design does not 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.650
 has done more than grow and I dare 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.650
 predict that it will continue to grow
