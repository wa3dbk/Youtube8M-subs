00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
thing about it is is it groups

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.679 
thing about it is is it groups
everything<00:03:05.739> together<00:03:06.069> by<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.459> type<00:03:07.329> of<00:03:07.359> file

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689

everything together by the type of file
that<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.859> in<00:03:08.980> this<00:03:09.129> case<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.459> can<00:03:09.609> see

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
that it is so in this case you can see

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.729 
that it is so in this case you can see
the<00:03:09.849> first<00:03:10.000> one<00:03:10.239> is<00:03:10.359> documents<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.109> then

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
the first one is documents and then

the first one is documents and then
audio<00:03:12.159> video<00:03:12.489> files<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.000> obviously<00:03:13.359> that's

audio video files and obviously that's

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.319 
audio video files and obviously that's
what<00:03:13.780> we're<00:03:13.959> looking<00:03:14.230> for<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.769> in<00:03:15.069> this

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329
