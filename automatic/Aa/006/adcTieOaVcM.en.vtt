 we are already in 2014 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.290
 and then for that reason I decided to make a challenge 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.350
 challenge in which I put that all raquel 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.030

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.680

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.989
 portland for notebooks and from what 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.080
 I saw what I have to do what I put 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.300
 you will have here and then we are going to do it 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.700
 here with the help of my sister Carmen 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.930
 the Hobbit 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.560
 we want to help a little to tell me the 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.900
 words the questions to look for them and 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.240
 this is about that in a minute and 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.540
 you have to look for what they say 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.600
 in the questions so filled in on 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.880
 questions from in your book the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.960
 books and after having come together in 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.479
 that minute and a half those you've 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.270
 found you have to put another minute 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.420
 and a half to sort the ones you reached 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.390
 grab in alphabetical order then 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.670
 Well, let's start here, I have my 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.670
 extra timer a minute and a half 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:36.570
 Nervous very short time to run 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.570
 Well, we give this series 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.390
 it's a book with the cover 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.810
 7 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.460
 6 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.900
 7 vettel is a page of the book 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.900
 consider the cover 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.860
 h 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.980
 in a classic 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:27.210
 I do not have a book with four colors 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.210
 with crisis 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.230
 one 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.519
 this says 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.900
 then there is the name 20 the type that 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.900

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.860

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.840

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.640
 and a half 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.840
 to order them is also half as 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.540
