00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.920
 it's late and welcome to our video 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.870
 today I'm going to talk about this 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.350
 Geneva of the Jean Marc is about a 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.869
 premium gin design 42 with 7 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.840
 degrees of alcohol has almost 43 degrees 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.210
 of alcohol this gin has in 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.060
 particular that apart from being distilled 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.280
 as always of wheat as it has been 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.890
 usual as the rest of the and black 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.199
 classic these black design 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.610
 we call design by the bottle and by 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.500
 the ingredients that they have apart from 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.780
 the usual botanists as it can be 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.650
 the juniper case this gin 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:50.540
 also incorporates distillations of 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.519
 thyme rosemary basil and also 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.159
 has a distillation a maceration of 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.530
 Arbequina olives is manufactured in 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.839
 barcelona is made on the golden coast 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.909
 It is a very aromatic gin in a 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.100
 very sensual gin from a gin that 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.370
 you will like it very much and to prepare 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.000
 this gin we will use 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:14.480
 the rosemary we are going to use the basil 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.870
 fresh and we will also use a 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.520
 classic gin that although there will be people 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.890
 that does not look like the ain strand anymore 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.380
 suitable for the time since 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.120
 there are other new ones 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.220
 having tried several recipes and several 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.900
 different techniques to elaborate this 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.090
 gin tonics I opted for fever 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.620
 classic tree the normal although there will be 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.020
 people who prepare it also with the 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.090
 streamed and earthy fiber but this is 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.000
 for a little more powerful palates 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.160
 because the Mediterranean directive is a 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.290
 tonic as you well know you have the 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.750
 more pronounced bubbles and a little 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.270
 stronger then what we want 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.550
 it is always that apart from that the tonic 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.260
 give him that flavor that he has to give and 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.090
 that half hoop you have to give him 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.470
 What we want is that you stop in Geneva 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.590
 at the gin tónic that we are taking and 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.780
 especially to the botanists that goes that 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.550
 we are going to use then we are going to use 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.680
 the classic cyber tree therefore 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.960
 we started with these first cantes that 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.870
 let's do for this gin tonic is 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.950
 join the cup and as we will umar by 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.080
 We're going to take it with rosemary 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.840
 we could use fresh rosemary but 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.290
 let's use dried rosemary then 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.290
 with a blowtorch or at home if you have a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.290
 lighter 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.190
 ok we turn on the rosemary 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.069
 and this smoke that is letting go 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.180
 we love the cup 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:52.240
 and we leave it still a little 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.160
 we see that there was not enough 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.160
 we will go back to the sea a little bit 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.810
 and we cover very well what I'm going to do 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.810
 between phases again the same 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.280
 I'm watching you 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:26.489
 ensuring that we not let us burn it 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.489
 Well we have it smoked and now 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.500
 in another without ton I would say that it would be 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.450
 cool the cup and I eat what I want 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.030
 is that he knows rosemary and that he smells rosemary 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.850
 I'm not going to cool it, I 'm going to add the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.740
 very cold ice and the tonic I've 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.510
 had in the freezer and that not 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.210
 it will freeze but it is very very cold 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.500
 so that the red does not lose anything of cold 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.470
 nor because you already know that he always has 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.540
 to be very cold then we are the 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.640
 ice you see 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:59.130
 as loose made 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.130
 the smoke we throw the ice 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:08.230
 we are not going to move very much 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.230
 but we directly throw the ice 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.510
 neither does lexington need 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.459
 cover the whole cup since the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.060
 We have cooled it well, well 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.580
 it's good ice this 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.240
 with ice it smells like rosemary I can 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:31.039
 secure and now we add 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.979
 a sprig of basil and you are 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:37.390
 watching a sprig of basil the 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.900
 we add in agreement 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.900
 and now 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.330
 the way to pour the gin 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.880
 you can do the mental account as 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.070
 We have always done with other gins or 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.680
 you can use the plug cited to mode 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.199
 of Hitler as we have no money and the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.699
 manufacturer recommends us that 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.220
 let's use this amount of gin 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.289
 although we can take it stronger we go 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.289
 to use the plug as a hitler 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:14.389
 according quantity and we pour it 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:17.409
 gently that you do not miss anything 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.409
 it has fallen a little bit but good 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.480
 gently 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.090
 Well, we already have it and now we are going to 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:32.080
 add a tool you have here 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:36.020
 under a sprig of rosemary according 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:40.920
 here we have it added rosemary we have 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.440
 added to the basil and we have added 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.280
 the gin and the ice and now 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.470
 Then with the spoon 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.440
 we move a little bit so that 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.670
 ingredients mix well 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.670
 ingredients mix well 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.300
 and now 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.300
 we open the tonic 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:10.110
 and gently spill the fever 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.110
 tree we are going to do it at half height 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.220
 so that nothing is lost for nothing 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.930
 this tonic link you are already seeing that 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.930
 it is gently falling by the teaspoon 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.710
 can you also tell us that there are people who 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:29.400
 what it does is click on the tonic and 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.110
 vote them although this fashion I already believe that 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.139
 a little bit has to be poured very 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.530
 gently as we are doing when 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.940
 let's see that it is practically poured 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.759
 the last touch we do against the 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.889
 spoon but never like that but with the 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:47.719
 spoon upside down 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:47.719
 so that it falls gently 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.039
 we pour it 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.230
 and we give it 1 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.560
 and two taps 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.970
 to this environment is the ding tonic 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.630
 mediterranean in the dim tonic of jean 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:13.020
 marc with fever tree let's try it out 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.020
 see how 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.130
 has a very particular taste 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:28.590
 what we have been knows a lot 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:31.600
 very much to rosemary pérez that also 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.580
 has a tad of aftertaste to one's own 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.730
 olive to the distillate itself of the 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.870
 olive of the gin is a 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.510
 very sensual gin and tonic you will like it 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.830
 very much and I would not recommend it on 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.070
 everything for the afternoon is not a 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.570
 gin and tonic to take before eating 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.150
 it's a red or aperitifs rather a 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.370
 gin tonics of london a drink for 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:54.100
 Take it calmly and peacefully because 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.630
 it's a little bit powerful, I hope that 

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.880
 I like it I will enjoy it and 

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.780
 remind you that very soon we will have more 

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.780
 new recipe video
