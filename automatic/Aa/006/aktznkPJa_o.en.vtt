00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 now we have everything here's eaves 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.550
 what 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.639
 hanging outside the walls this is the version 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.370
 here it is a battle of eyes from lets wall here 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.720
 this body will be called torture and now 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.630
 we first bofill with turkey wall version 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.150
 for this here is this shell and on this 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.300
 wand we stick 2 enough 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.439
 narrow down 25 That's the way 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.160
 attach to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.570
 lowered this distance from all this food 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.450
 in the bottom surface 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.629
 the flour must be fifty miles you weight 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.410
 here is the nose . 25 cross sticking 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.329
 attach sit down will be trimming 25 in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.770
 this distance should be 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.930
 fifty and to these home army 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.770
 we attach a diameter of half a meter 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.030
 cross there is a table board 25 further to 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.879
 this diameter 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.510
 we attach the surplus that we have 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.790
 25 and we get everything exactly 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.549
 have flush with bottom surface 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.240
 It is for the extreme beams desirable of course 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.040
 about planing these holes as well as 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.159
 and where are the edges 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.909
 here is this beam with the help or lie of the bank 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.630
 eg 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.850
 so you can varnish them 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 or paint like this very much 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.310
 we just made a binder 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.280
 the overhang of the front of the stage is the same jesus 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.530
 the back side of the house is now sheathed 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.079
 means true to the free part of the scene he 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.770
 I had to do it, we do not need it 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.610
 points straight to the bottom and in 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.880
 the side of the floor beams here 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.380
 so here it is installed here 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.040
 one . 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.689
 and there are three d . Blimey . 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.770
 seventy on 25 and here are these three tables 25 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.719
 this is the distance from here 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.090
 . 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:09.390
 320 millimeters 3 Sasha 100 World 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.930
 dead it will be three o'clock and on the excitement and 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.340
 Remains 20 in half 10 billing 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.730
 that's what these clearances are for 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.409
 walls are made in the form 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.060
 ventilate the facade that is here for this 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:28.049
 hilke directly from the air base 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.500
 continuously circulating 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:34.019
 and gets into the roof zones and these strength 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.150
 additionally creating 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.370
 air and we still have 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.700
 ventilated roof how 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.220
 carried out I stood out of course after 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.200
 Fitting purlin roof and a roof 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.540
 corrugated corrugated board contributed to the world 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.370
 for you corrugation height is 20 millimeters 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.459
 on these here is a member butyl gets passes 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.530
 across the roof here along these slots roof 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.799
 methylate 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.439
 besides the air still coming in or 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:11.129
 coming out or coming here for this 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:13.799
 a film about two sides of the roof or there 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.609
 pribatsal enter the land of his problem 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.129
 here we have full ventilation of course 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:23.129
 here these are desirable with one 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.900
 sides at least just the horns and these 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.180
 diodes about lines are short 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.959
 touch for everything to be 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.340
 nice and so we made a connection we 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:39.019
 will share the overhang of the roof also 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.019
 iran on the other side roof
