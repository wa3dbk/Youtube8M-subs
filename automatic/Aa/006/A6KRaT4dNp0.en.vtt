00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.380 

so<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:36.679> needed<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.159> way<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.369> connect<00:01:37.969> these<00:01:38.119> two

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
so I needed a way to connect these two

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.539 
so I needed a way to connect these two
pontoons<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.409> know<00:01:39.530> with<00:01:39.890> pieces<00:01:40.340> going

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
pontoons you know with pieces going

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.880 
pontoons you know with pieces going
across<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:40.850> way<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:42.140> I<00:01:42.350> wanted<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.619> come<00:01:42.799> up

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
across that way and I wanted to come up

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.319 
across that way and I wanted to come up
with<00:01:42.979> something<00:01:43.280> really<00:01:43.310> good<00:01:43.909> because<00:01:44.119> I'm

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
with something really good because I'm

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.679 
with something really good because I'm
trying<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:44.600> make<00:01:44.689> this<00:01:44.929> boat<00:01:45.380> pretty<00:01:45.799> refined

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
trying to make this boat pretty refined

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.779 
trying to make this boat pretty refined
like<00:01:47.689> something<00:01:48.049> sleek<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.799> aerodynamic<00:01:48.920> and

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
like something sleek and aerodynamic and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.630 
like something sleek and aerodynamic and
super<00:01:50.119> strong<00:01:50.420> and<00:01:50.450> blah<00:01:50.990> blah<00:01:51.200> blah<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:52.520> I

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
super strong and blah blah blah and I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.529 
super strong and blah blah blah and I
found<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:53.299> if<00:01:53.479> I<00:01:53.630> use<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.789> mold<00:01:55.789> for<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.299> top

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
found that if I use the mold for the top

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.899 
found that if I use the mold for the top
of<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.750> pontoons<00:01:57.350> but<00:01:57.530> just<00:01:57.709> a<00:01:57.799> section<00:01:58.789> of

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
of the pontoons but just a section of

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.260 
of the pontoons but just a section of
the<00:01:59.000> mold<00:01:59.209> and<00:02:00.610> attach<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.789> piece<00:02:01.939> of<00:02:02.090> sheet

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
the mold and attach the piece of sheet

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.960 
the mold and attach the piece of sheet
metal<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:02.659> this<00:02:02.689> or<00:02:03.229> in<00:02:03.649> there<00:02:03.920> we're<00:02:04.670> just

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
metal like this or in there we're just

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.050 
metal like this or in there we're just
kind<00:02:05.179> of<00:02:05.299> tacked<00:02:05.899> in<00:02:06.110> with<00:02:06.259> screws<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:07.329> can<00:02:08.329> make

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
kind of tacked in with screws I can make

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.660 
kind of tacked in with screws I can make
these<00:02:13.630> which<00:02:14.630> turns<00:02:14.930> into<00:02:15.079> this<00:02:15.980> when<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.489> put

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
these which turns into this when you put

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.729 
these which turns into this when you put
two<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.599> them<00:02:17.660> together<00:02:17.780> obviously<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
two of them together obviously the

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:26.699 
two of them together obviously the
bottom<00:02:19.069> piece<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.430> smaller<00:02:25.090> that's<00:02:26.090> gonna<00:02:26.299> be

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
bottom piece is smaller that's gonna be

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:35.009 
bottom piece is smaller that's gonna be
what<00:02:27.709> goes<00:02:27.890> across<00:02:29.769> I'm<00:02:30.769> also<00:02:30.980> making<00:02:31.190> these

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.809 

tilt<00:02:36.019> toward<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> Sun<00:02:36.829> and<00:02:37.130> also<00:02:37.400> will<00:02:37.639> be

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
tilt toward the Sun and also will be

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.410 
tilt toward the Sun and also will be
used<00:02:38.060> as<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.299> sail<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:39.799> I<00:02:40.160> made<00:02:40.459> some<00:02:41.209> big

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
used as a sail so I made some big

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.349 
used as a sail so I made some big
circles<00:02:42.340> just<00:02:43.340> molding<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.880> bottom<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.269> the

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
circles just molding the bottom of the

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.259 
circles just molding the bottom of the
bucket<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.470> then<00:02:47.079> possibly<00:02:48.079> us<00:02:48.260> inside<00:02:48.650> that

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
bucket and then possibly us inside that

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.460 
bucket and then possibly us inside that
let<00:02:50.269> me<00:02:50.299> try<00:02:50.569> it<00:02:50.600> washed<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:51.109> really<00:02:51.319> well

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
let me try it washed it really well

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.920 
let me try it washed it really well
first<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:51.980> then<00:02:52.100> smack<00:02:52.400> them<00:02:52.720> stuff<00:02:53.720> out<00:02:53.900> of

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
first and then smack them stuff out of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.840 
first and then smack them stuff out of
it<00:02:54.109> to<00:02:54.260> get<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.440> apart<00:02:54.709> but<00:02:55.250> anyway<00:02:55.549> I've

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
it to get it apart but anyway I've

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.039 
it to get it apart but anyway I've
guessed<00:02:56.120> like<00:02:56.299> concentric<00:02:57.170> circle<00:02:59.049> hinges

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
guessed like concentric circle hinges

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.039 
guessed like concentric circle hinges
now<00:03:00.940> which<00:03:01.940> have<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> fair<00:03:02.630> amount<00:03:02.750> of

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
now which have a fair amount of

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.710 
now which have a fair amount of
resistance<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:04.670> which<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.209> good<00:03:05.420> because<00:03:05.599> I

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
resistance so which is good because I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.390 
resistance so which is good because I
don't<00:03:05.900> want<00:03:06.019> my<00:03:06.109> solar<00:03:06.349> panels<00:03:06.829> to<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.220> like

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
don't want my solar panels to just like

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.000 
don't want my solar panels to just like
thump<00:03:07.849> down<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.389> fault<00:03:08.660> I<00:03:08.989> want<00:03:09.560> them<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.709> have

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
thump down and fault I want them to have

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.670 
thump down and fault I want them to have
a<00:03:10.069> bit<00:03:10.609> of<00:03:10.730> stickiness<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.480> keep<00:03:12.349> them<00:03:12.500> from

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
a bit of stickiness to keep them from

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.520 
a bit of stickiness to keep them from
moving<00:03:12.829> too<00:03:13.130> fast<00:03:13.900> but<00:03:14.900> they<00:03:14.989> should<00:03:15.169> be<00:03:15.260> super

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
moving too fast but they should be super

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.280 
moving too fast but they should be super
strong<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:16.519> I'm<00:03:16.639> wondering<00:03:17.030> how<00:03:17.930> easy<00:03:18.200> would

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
strong and I'm wondering how easy would

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.110 
strong and I'm wondering how easy would
it<00:03:18.349> be<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.530> build<00:03:18.739> with<00:03:18.919> ball<00:03:19.099> bearings<00:03:19.459> ball

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
it be to build with ball bearings ball

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.819 
it be to build with ball bearings ball
bearings<00:03:20.540> would<00:03:20.840> not<00:03:21.019> be<00:03:21.139> useful<00:03:21.260> for<00:03:21.500> this

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
bearings would not be useful for this

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:32.059 
bearings would not be useful for this
but

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.040 

it's<00:03:33.069> like<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.220> Star<00:03:33.879> Trek<00:03:33.910> torpedo<00:03:34.750> or

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
it's like a Star Trek torpedo or

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.610 
it's like a Star Trek torpedo or
something

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
something

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.650 
something
I<00:03:41.190> may<00:03:42.190> be<00:03:42.250> building<00:03:42.519> surfboards<00:03:43.269> in<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.480> near

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
I may be building surfboards in the near

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.839 
I may be building surfboards in the near
future<00:03:45.660> all<00:03:46.660> right<00:03:47.010> what's<00:03:48.010> this<00:03:48.190> nuclear

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
future all right what's this nuclear

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.350 
future all right what's this nuclear
device<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.510> guests<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:49.989> here<00:03:51.090> well<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.120> wanted

device of guests in here well I wanted

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:20.190 
device of guests in here well I wanted
to<00:03:52.480> make<00:03:52.569> some<00:03:52.750> fiberglass<00:03:53.170> tubes<00:04:18.959> these<00:04:19.959> are

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
to make some fiberglass tubes these are

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.430 
to make some fiberglass tubes these are
huge<00:04:20.500> pain<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.250> cut<00:04:21.430> out<00:04:21.579> cuz<00:04:21.880> my<00:04:22.260> cheeks<00:04:23.260> I

huge pain to cut out cuz my cheeks I

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.400 
huge pain to cut out cuz my cheeks I
didn't<00:04:23.710> have<00:04:23.800> enough<00:04:23.979> electricity<00:04:24.340> oh<00:04:25.410> man

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
didn't have enough electricity oh man

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:36.830 
didn't have enough electricity oh man
that<00:04:26.650> looks<00:04:26.680> great<00:04:33.389> it's<00:04:34.389> perfect

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.659 

and<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:37.900> wanted<00:04:38.169> to<00:04:38.289> have<00:04:38.470> this<00:04:38.650> lip<00:04:38.950> here<00:04:39.250> so

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
and I wanted to have this lip here so

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.420 
and I wanted to have this lip here so
that<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:41.110> could<00:04:41.289> drill<00:04:41.590> holes<00:04:41.889> into<00:04:42.130> it<00:04:42.310> and

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
that it could drill holes into it and

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.860 
that it could drill holes into it and
attach<00:04:42.700> things<00:04:42.970> you<00:04:43.270> know<00:04:43.360> it's<00:04:43.450> just<00:04:43.570> in<00:04:43.690> case

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.540 
attach things you know it's just in case
I<00:04:44.020> want<00:04:44.169> to<00:04:44.229> attach<00:04:44.530> something<00:04:44.830> to<00:04:45.160> this<00:04:45.280> piece

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
I want to attach something to this piece

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.150 
I want to attach something to this piece
which<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.270> might<00:04:46.450> want<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.690> do<00:04:48.090> but<00:04:49.090> inside<00:04:49.450> it

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
which I might want to do but inside it

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.740 
which I might want to do but inside it
it's<00:04:51.160> not<00:04:51.280> like<00:04:51.460> this<00:04:51.639> is<00:04:51.729> where<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.330> connects

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
it's not like this is where it connects

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.250 
it's not like this is where it connects
it<00:04:53.470> actually<00:04:53.860> goes<00:04:54.220> right<00:04:55.000> through<00:04:55.389> there<00:04:55.660> the

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
it actually goes right through there the

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.070 
it actually goes right through there the
fiberglass<00:04:56.820> so<00:04:57.820> it's<00:04:57.970> super<00:04:58.240> strong<00:04:58.450> and<00:04:58.780> has

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
fiberglass so it's super strong and has

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:08.220 
fiberglass so it's super strong and has
to<00:04:59.229> live<00:05:03.539> that's<00:05:04.539> good

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.810 

any<00:05:09.230> actual<00:05:09.500> mold<00:05:09.860> is<00:05:10.250> a<00:05:10.280> piece<00:05:10.460> of<00:05:10.640> sheet

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
any actual mold is a piece of sheet

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.720 
any actual mold is a piece of sheet
metal<00:05:10.850> that<00:05:11.150> I<00:05:11.360> very<00:05:11.420> gracefully<00:05:12.320> formed<00:05:12.890> you

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
metal that I very gracefully formed you

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.430 
metal that I very gracefully formed you
know<00:05:13.760> vise<00:05:14.860> stuffing<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:16.010> in<00:05:16.730> a<00:05:17.230> pile<00:05:18.230> of

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
know vise stuffing it in a pile of

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.280 
know vise stuffing it in a pile of
plywood<00:05:18.770> so<00:05:19.670> it<00:05:19.820> hold<00:05:20.030> here<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.330> then<00:05:20.450> bending

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
plywood so it hold here and then bending

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.900 
plywood so it hold here and then bending
this<00:05:21.470> corner<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:21.980> then<00:05:22.070> bending<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.580> corner

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
this corner and then bending that corner

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.630 
this corner and then bending that corner
and<00:05:23.030> then<00:05:23.120> just<00:05:23.360> using<00:05:23.690> caveman<00:05:24.650> action<00:05:25.370> to

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
and then just using caveman action to

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.750 
and then just using caveman action to
make<00:05:26.540> sort<00:05:26.900> of<00:05:27.020> a<00:05:27.170> kind<00:05:27.500> of<00:05:27.620> curve<00:05:30.640> and<00:05:31.640> it's

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
make sort of a kind of curve and it's

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.860 
make sort of a kind of curve and it's
nice<00:05:31.910> that<00:05:31.940> it<00:05:32.180> stays<00:05:32.360> open<00:05:32.630> like<00:05:32.750> this

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
nice that it stays open like this

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.030 
nice that it stays open like this
because<00:05:33.110> it's<00:05:33.260> easy<00:05:33.410> to<00:05:33.530> put<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.740> fiberglass

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
because it's easy to put the fiberglass

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.790 
because it's easy to put the fiberglass
in<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:34.670> then<00:05:35.180> close<00:05:35.450> it<00:05:35.510> and<00:05:36.170> stuff<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.590> in<00:05:36.740> the

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
in and then close it and stuff it in the

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.890 
in and then close it and stuff it in the
surface<00:05:40.510> my<00:05:41.510> huge<00:05:41.810> to<00:05:42.190> keep<00:05:43.190> up<00:05:43.370> wait<00:05:43.550> a<00:05:43.610> minute

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
surface my huge to keep up wait a minute

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.150 
surface my huge to keep up wait a minute
that's<00:05:44.900> not<00:05:45.050> a<00:05:45.140> totally<00:05:45.560> different<00:05:45.860> before<00:05:45.980> I

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
that's not a totally different before I

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:53.020 
that's not a totally different before I
said<00:05:46.400> it<00:05:46.430> out<00:05:46.550> loud<00:05:46.610> I<00:05:51.160> recently<00:05:52.160> had<00:05:52.640> a<00:05:52.670> dream

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
said it out loud I recently had a dream

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.360 
said it out loud I recently had a dream
that<00:05:54.010> this<00:05:55.010> entire<00:05:55.460> like<00:05:56.060> roof<00:05:57.130> section<00:05:58.130> of

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
that this entire like roof section of

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.990 
that this entire like roof section of
the<00:05:58.670> boat<00:05:58.850> just<00:05:59.180> blew<00:05:59.630> off<00:05:59.900> in<00:05:59.930> a<00:06:00.320> huge<00:06:00.590> storm

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
the boat just blew off in a huge storm

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.130 
the boat just blew off in a huge storm
so<00:06:02.000> I<00:06:02.330> kind<00:06:02.690> of<00:06:02.750> promptly<00:06:03.170> came<00:06:03.470> out<00:06:03.650> here<00:06:03.980> and

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
so I kind of promptly came out here and

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.200 
so I kind of promptly came out here and
put<00:06:06.140> big<00:06:06.410> fiberglass<00:06:07.100> patches<00:06:07.610> here<00:06:07.850> that<00:06:08.090> go

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
put big fiberglass patches here that go

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.400 
put big fiberglass patches here that go
all<00:06:08.390> the<00:06:08.480> way<00:06:08.510> up<00:06:08.660> there<00:06:08.900> and<00:06:09.110> all<00:06:09.230> the<00:06:09.350> way

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
all the way up there and all the way

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.510 
all the way up there and all the way
down<00:06:09.440> here<00:06:09.980> and<00:06:10.190> there

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
down here and there

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.370 
down here and there
there's<00:06:10.940> one<00:06:11.120> there<00:06:11.360> and<00:06:11.390> one<00:06:11.690> there<00:06:11.810> so<00:06:12.110> that

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
there's one there and one there so that

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.370 
there's one there and one there so that
thing<00:06:12.560> should<00:06:12.740> be<00:06:12.890> really<00:06:13.730> current<00:06:14.660> stuck<00:06:15.200> now

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
thing should be really current stuck now

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.320 
thing should be really current stuck now
which<00:06:16.370> is<00:06:16.520> a<00:06:16.550> good<00:06:16.730> thing<00:06:16.760> because<00:06:17.150> I<00:06:17.300> really

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
which is a good thing because I really

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.430 
which is a good thing because I really
don't<00:06:17.750> want<00:06:17.990> that<00:06:18.080> huge<00:06:18.410> thing<00:06:18.680> blowing<00:06:18.890> off

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
don't want that huge thing blowing off

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.870 
don't want that huge thing blowing off

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
not that the wind has anything to catch

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.760 
not that the wind has anything to catch
right<00:06:23.180> now<00:06:23.360> but<00:06:23.720> pretty<00:06:24.290> soon<00:06:24.350> I'm<00:06:24.620> gonna

that I'm just cranking out more pieces
I'm<00:06:32.840> also<00:06:33.020> staying<00:06:33.410> slightly<00:06:34.040> ahead<00:06:34.160> of<00:06:34.310> boat

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
I'm also staying slightly ahead of boat

I'm also staying slightly ahead of boat
progress<00:06:35.090> with<00:06:35.780> model<00:06:36.169> progress<00:06:36.650> I<00:06:36.950> like<00:06:37.790> to

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:37.970 
progress with model progress I like to

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.140 
progress with model progress I like to
have<00:06:38.660> a<00:06:38.690> little<00:06:38.930> mock<00:06:39.230> a<00:06:39.470> little<00:06:39.740> model<00:06:40.150> you

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
have a little mock a little model you

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.310 
have a little mock a little model you
know<00:06:41.240> a<00:06:41.270> little<00:06:41.540> bit<00:06:41.720> ahead<00:06:41.930> of<00:06:42.050> where<00:06:42.230> I'm

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
know a little bit ahead of where I'm

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.230 
know a little bit ahead of where I'm
building<00:06:42.470> the<00:06:42.710> real<00:06:42.830> thing<00:06:43.100> just<00:06:43.820> to<00:06:43.910> work<00:06:44.060> out

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
building the real thing just to work out

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.780 
building the real thing just to work out
possible<00:06:44.810> issues<00:06:45.200> before<00:06:45.650> I<00:06:45.680> get<00:06:45.890> there<00:06:46.100> and

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
possible issues before I get there and

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.450 
possible issues before I get there and
this<00:06:47.630> is<00:06:47.690> where<00:06:48.140> the<00:06:48.350> round<00:06:48.530> tube<00:06:48.919> parts<00:06:49.250> gonna

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
this is where the round tube parts gonna

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.690 
this is where the round tube parts gonna
go<00:06:49.700> and<00:06:50.660> I'm<00:06:51.200> gonna<00:06:51.320> use<00:06:51.590> the<00:06:52.130> round<00:06:52.310> tubes

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.700 
go and I'm gonna use the round tubes

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
go and I'm gonna use the round tubes
here<00:06:53.090> and<00:06:53.270> there<00:06:53.390> too<00:06:54.550> and<00:06:55.550> then<00:06:55.730> here<00:06:56.180> it's

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 
here and there too and then here it's

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.090 
here and there too and then here it's
going<00:06:56.840> to<00:06:56.900> be<00:06:56.990> some<00:06:57.169> batteries<00:06:57.590> and<00:06:57.770> storage

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
going to be some batteries and storage
