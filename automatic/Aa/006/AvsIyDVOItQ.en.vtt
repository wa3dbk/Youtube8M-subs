00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
so we had a sir and here you are showing

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.450 
so we had a sir and here you are showing
the<00:00:02.760> new<00:00:03.380> android<00:00:04.380> really<00:00:05.009> cool<00:00:05.190> looking

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
the new android really cool looking

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.020 
the new android really cool looking
acquire<00:00:06.060> based<00:00:06.600> android<00:00:06.990> phone<00:00:07.670> this<00:00:08.670> is<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
acquire based android phone this is the

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.600 
acquire based android phone this is the
detached<00:00:09.800> 400<00:00:11.389> exactly<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.929> he<00:00:13.110> has<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.769> 3.2

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
detached 400 exactly so he has a 3.2

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:24.230 
detached 400 exactly so he has a 3.2
inch<00:00:15.470> hvga<00:00:16.940> screen<00:00:18.859> hvga<00:00:20.300> so<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.420> has<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:23.240> new

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
inch hvga screen hvga so it has the new

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.460 
inch hvga screen hvga so it has the new
Eclair<00:00:24.840> version<00:00:25.250> which<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.460> called<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> 2.1

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
Eclair version which is called the 2.1

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.589 
Eclair version which is called the 2.1
so<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.769> see<00:00:29.039> again<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> ISA

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
movies I just click on the movie tub so

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.050 
movies I just click on the movie tub so
this<00:01:10.149> is<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.299> resistant<00:01:10.920> screen<00:01:11.920> right<00:01:12.100> it's<00:01:12.759> a

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
this is a resistant screen right it's a

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.690 
this is a resistant screen right it's a
resistive<00:01:13.630> screen<00:01:13.630> yeah<00:01:14.409> but<00:01:15.159> that<00:01:15.490> means

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
resistive screen yeah but that means

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.429 
resistive screen yeah but that means
that<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.119> film<00:01:16.390> can<00:01:16.539> be<00:01:16.570> pretty<00:01:16.930> pretty<00:01:17.200> cheap

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
that the film can be pretty pretty cheap

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.940 
that the film can be pretty pretty cheap
as<00:01:17.799> well<00:01:18.039> or<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:19.390> can<00:01:19.570> be<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.720> pro<00:01:20.259> it<00:01:20.710> can<00:01:20.829> be<00:01:20.920> a

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
as well or it can be a pro it can be a

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.910 
as well or it can be a pro it can be a
competitive<00:01:21.430> well<00:01:22.240> it's<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.750> there's<00:01:23.710> been<00:01:23.890> a

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
competitive well it's a there's been a

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.210 
competitive well it's a there's been a
lot<00:01:24.189> of<00:01:24.220> improvements<00:01:24.880> on<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.030> resistive<00:01:26.220> you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
lot of improvements on the resistive you

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.980 
lot of improvements on the resistive you
don't<00:01:27.399> have<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.700> press<00:01:27.939> that<00:01:28.149> party<00:01:28.630> as

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
don't have to press that party as

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.270 
don't have to press that party as
opposed<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.560> what<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.920> did<00:01:30.100> before<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:33.159> is

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
opposed to what you did before and it is

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.480 
opposed to what you did before and it is
true<00:01:33.460> that<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.850> know<00:01:33.970> when<00:01:34.149> you<00:01:34.270> want<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.600> have

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
true that you know when you want to have

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.550 
true that you know when you want to have
to<00:01:36.490> achieve<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:37.329> pretty<00:01:37.720> affordable<00:01:37.990> price

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
to achieve a pretty affordable price

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.740 
to achieve a pretty affordable price
then<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:39.179> resistive<00:01:40.179> is<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.390> good<00:01:40.659> alternative

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
then a resistive is a good alternative

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.109 
then a resistive is a good alternative
to<00:01:41.229> the<00:01:41.740> facility<00:01:43.350> doesn't<00:01:44.350> have<00:01:44.439> a<00:01:44.530> speaker

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
to the facility doesn't have a speaker

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.359 
to the facility doesn't have a speaker
has<00:01:46.119> a<00:01:46.149> speaker<00:01:46.450> maybe<00:01:46.929> its<00:01:47.350> volume<00:01:50.369> people

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
has a speaker maybe its volume people

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.529 
has a speaker maybe its volume people
similar<00:01:51.640> here<00:01:51.849> maybe<00:01:52.810> depends<00:01:53.170> in<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.380> video

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
similar here maybe depends in the video

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.839 
similar here maybe depends in the video
there<00:01:55.539> is<00:01:55.659> playing<00:01:55.929> some<00:01:56.140> formats<00:01:56.530> of<00:01:56.649> video

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
are using this is the work of week seven

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.139 
are using this is the work of week seven
seven<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.259> do<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.640> how's<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.819> different<00:02:06.880> from

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
seven to do so how's it different from

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.900 
seven to do so how's it different from
the<00:02:08.700> 110<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.269> one<00:02:10.570> is<00:02:10.869> quoted<00:02:11.910> 624

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910
