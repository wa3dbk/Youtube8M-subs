00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 period towards cellular respiration 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.700
 one of the most biochemical topics 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.890
 important cellular inspirations 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.269
 come in three basic steps in the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.460
 first phase we have the production of 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.500
 city ​​with ze but in the second phase lucy 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.089
 Latium of the cyclic intimate and in the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.070
 third phase we have the transfer 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.810
 Direct in the photo report will be active 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.760
 so this video we will try to understand 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.680
 the main features of each one 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.039
 of these phases and the relationships between 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.140
 their 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.849
 in the first phase what happens then 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.519
 happens that the molecules of nutrients 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.289
 they are oxidized performing in molecules of 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.730
 carbon that will make up the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.770
 there is a group of the city and therefore 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.510
 but so here it is very first of all 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.100
 It is important to understand the structure 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.570
 of the city on the 15th but the thing 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.550
 fundamental that you must remember is 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.800
 this is the city so how can you 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 see formed by two components 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.300
 acilic group as I have seen in two 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.250
 carbon atoms and then but then the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.960
 city begin is formed from the consummate 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.820
 the ethyl group that will be supplied 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.250
 as we have seen from the nutrients in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.109
 this case is the classic example of 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.859
 pyruvate which is transformed into acids 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.180
 15 May 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.699
 so let's figure out what they are 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 these substrates that provide these 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.200
 actv groups there are some glucose 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.960
 amino acids and fatty acids such as 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.640
 we saw in the video on Greek lisi 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.439
 through this metabolic path it comes 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.869
 transformed into two pyruvate molecules 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.000
 to between Sunday arbonia in the video on 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.770
 right of the private we saw that in 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.320
 the absence of extra oxygen I will suffer 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.420
 fermentation and among these we have 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.759
 the very important lactic alcohol 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.200
 to remember if it is present instead 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.350
 oxygen will come cellular respiration 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.409
 cellular respiration in fact 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.970
 feature as we have seen that 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.310
 determines the synthesis of acids then but 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.960
 then glucose through the plus 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.180
 I boast amino acids and fatty acids 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.369
 out of damage in cyclic cup farm have 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.380
 just the city so but then we have 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.360
 what we have the situation of 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.759
 city ​​together through the cycle of 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.770
 grace the second phase of breathing 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.079
 finally we will have the transfer 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.460
 of electrons and phosphorylation 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.049
 oxidative 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.700
 so let's understand now what 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.650
 comes in the second phase 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.810
 in the second phase I like ethyl 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.970
 we understood that alone and therefore 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.400
 basically the cd together enters the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.679
 clubs where they are challenged on two 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.209
 the energy produced will be stored 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.980
 in electron transporters in the def 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.630
 to this I'll say the two 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.260
 important features you need 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.290
 remember then we have the form is the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.450
 reduction of electron transporters 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.910
 how to provide in this scheme that 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.080
 precisely it is the crabs cycle scheme 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.390
 we have as we said the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.980
 co2 production to see which one here and 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.550
 the formation essentially of 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.100
 reduced electron transporters 15 that 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.870
 the nat and the fab are drawn up 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.730
 they will become damned as a hairpin 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.780
 reduced and made yes given to do 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.310
 reduced 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.350
 once this came what 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.580
 happens it practically happens 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.950
 transfer of rights one 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.720
 oxidative uplift then before 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.150
 all electron transporters 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.819
 they will then be oxidized again 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.220
 reduced will arrive in the chain 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.600
 Respiratory where data will be successful e 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.920
 will therefore free the genius in ed 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.540
 electrons therefore essentially the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.880
 electrons and are very important to 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.250
 remember these will be transferred 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.200
 to the oxygen that reducing itself 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.860
 transforms into water 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.079
 so this is the characteristic 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.630
 important to remember the transporters 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.970
 reduced yes the oxygen is sedated 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.310
 It reduces turning into water then 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.560
 transporters oxidize the oxygen yes 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.570
 it also reduces during this 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.150
 electron transfer in the chain 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.680
 respiratory what happens that you 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.420
 accumulates a lot of energy to come 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.400
 used for the synthesis of the tb 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.870
 let's see a pattern as you can 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.820
 seeing this is precisely the mitochondria 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.690
 we have the outer membrane la 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.910
 inner membrane 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.310
 and this is the space of the two membranes 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.540
 here we have the kelis cycle like 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.310
 we said the club cycle yes 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.500
 provides the electron transporters 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.240
 reduced electron transporters 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.250
 reduced as you can see it ursida 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.860
 so in this case we take how 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.780
 example the north and madrid 8 becomes nada 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.360
 oxidized and through the chain 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.980
 respiratory reduces the oxygen that is 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.990
 it will then turn into water 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.180
 conveyor oxidizes to oxygen yes 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.580
 reduce water as you can all see 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.920
 these items are worn outside 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.930
 in this space it is fundamentally 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.600
 what happens then returning 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.180
 through precisely this complex that 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.760
 it is called types synthetase we have the 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.269
 synthesis from adp and phosphates in the organic of 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.310
 atp then when the just happens 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.930
 electron transfer yes 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.330
 will clarify this gradient then 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.460
 allows the absence of ratp through the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.200
 then these oxidative phosphorylation 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.580
 are the key features from 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.560
 to remember 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.720
 on cellular respiration that is 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.130
 let's recap briefly as we have 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.780
 seen we have the production of the c5 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.760
 so together they are very important 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.560
 tv agi groups of the city ​​e 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.850
 therefore of mars we have seen that 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.250
 we have the situation through the 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.440
 club cycle with the formation of co2 and 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.300
 the formation of reduced transporters 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.030
 once these transporters there 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.520
 will be formed we will have that one 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.830
 which will be oxidative phosphorylation 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.390
 as you can see here is precisely the 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.350
 electron transfer 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.960
 so these are the features 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.669
 fundamental to know also for 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.930
