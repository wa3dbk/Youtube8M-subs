 saints overcame the humble cells that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.949
 had years ago 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.810
 he matured and literally grew 1 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.900
 in three they were 1 cent and a half 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.539
 totaling 2 meters and 70 in length 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.840
 by a further 15 centimeters totaling 46 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.230
 62 to between us seems to grow more 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.540
 these new forms more fluidly and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.219
 between the lines plus a colant always 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.719
 society that when you grow up 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.340
 sad looking 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.070
 not to mention that before he was still more 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.899
 pronounced and the dynamic for the luck of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.680
 all utilize what else tried to keep 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.750
 in chrome 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.960
 now it has a more trimmed set 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.789
 refined and accurate detail is now not 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.969
 game was when the difference 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.559
 she has an independent orange repair 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.329
 only in this framework of instruments does it not 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.129
 It's more of a lego made from those blocks. 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.510
 Give a place 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.330
 these more natural but pleasant forms 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.159
 it looks like a more refined car really 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.840
 And look at this match up here. 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.330
 her totally rubbery 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.640
 it makes a difference and hitch 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.409
 fittings are good the assembly is good at 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.840
 visibility of the instrument cluster is 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.729
 great and still has regulation 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.979
 height and depth of the steering wheel 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.110
 although it is of this type cocaine having to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.259
 turns against good and has no regulation 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.210
 height of the seat and a radio in the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.299
 series has a colored screen 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.070
 4.3 inches has a browser that does not 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.909
 why not send one 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.409
 car without the map has radio fm cineplay 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.170
 auxiliary input 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.940
 can also be used for usb that is 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.480
 saved here on the console 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.450
 the rear camera when you engage the reverse 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.920
 units or rear detail is that the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.790
 group if it is only for calls 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.740
 it is not for streaming music 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:10.930
 lsl or dual zone digital air conditioning 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.270
 side but it has no rear exit 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.040
 I start at 82 and a space to spare that 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.950
 even goes to the head because there is a 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.390
 rebound 10 would only take back here 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.330
 nobody has to be exclusive 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.820
 conditioned to the small trunk door but 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.150
 I can not have a police officer 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.950
 meanwhile someone always side will have to 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.310
 layout the three-point belt 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.930
 headrest and plenty left over 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.000
 space in the trunk 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.010
 it grew 60 liters in relation to 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.690
 previous generation, now passing these 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.690
 banks 19 books 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.620
 the sl version like this 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.489
 the center has start closed the car 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.129
 silver gucci sclavi all handsome but 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.990
 Is it something so modern for me? 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:09.990
 so does face tiozão 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.420
 God's face, he 's thinking of it. 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.560
 knows in them by the front piece mec 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.320
 and creche twist on the second rear 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.530
 night regulation in court suspension 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.340
 that changed staff got much softer 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.350
 much quieter it absorbs 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.300
 completely stressed the lack in the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.010
 However, when an imported car does not 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.160
 has that adaptation that the soil 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.410
 Brazil what would that it does not 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.740
 absorbs very well hole in hole is 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:45.090
 sure of beats and those who think 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:47.250
 two meters and so the engine is that 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.700
 pc version in all core versions 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.130
 is the same as the past is a 2.0 of 140 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.680
 horses and that the stock be with 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.920
 alcohol or gasoline because the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.700
 nissan does not vary increases the rate of 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.580
 compression when born to something 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.060
 so there is no power gain with 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.000
 vegetable fuel and the other 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.710
 particularity is that with alcohol this 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.180
 engine and is extremely be with this 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.840
 confrontation some customers already feeling 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.270
 which does not exist now when you're with 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.650
 the car fueled with alcohol 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:32.150
 the winding stretch here is good to note the 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:36.409
 that this direction is light and direct 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.959
 as on most nissan 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:44.919
 so she 's more direct 

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:49.279
 comfortable and she need not transmit 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:52.189
 as much as the vibration of the asphalt 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:53.869
 in this version, let me tell you in passing 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.069
 costs of seventy-three thousand four hundred 

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:58.219
 it's ninety 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:03.129
 the exchange rate is always cmt the second generation 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:07.580
 of 1 500m tecktonik and has a number of 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:10.129
 different components it is there more 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.519
 more agile comfort. 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.659
 smart what happens he has no gear 

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:19.879
 preset 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:21.379
 it's just you see what's white in the hour 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:25.159
 do you think of overtaking more 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:27.589
 fluffy a pattern the overdrive function is 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.229
 always active in the legislature to tighten 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:32.599
 button here on the land of exchange what goes 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.509
 do is tighten delegate overdrive 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.529
 and you feel a motor brake feel 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:40.069
 in the car 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:42.139
 that's how you're eating done 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.789
 if you take your foot off the accelerator 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.139
 it will maintain that speed by 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.389
 a long time you will not realize the 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:51.050
 falling speed and the engine will spin 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:55.909
 always with one thousand rpm and 250 rpm is 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:06:00.979
 sensational is the best system for 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:06.949
 In case you want comfort comfort 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:09.350
 it's silence our people want the focus of 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:12.640
 transphobia with a car 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:15.530
 with almost one meter and eighty of nature 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:18.920
 They're arriving in Santa Teresa. 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:22.790
 be careful with the boni 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.960
 but that's when you step on the center 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.440
 accelerate with the subway 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:31.310
 they play always Giruá 2,500 rpm and 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.320
 police cvt the movement 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.360
 which will increase the acceleration of the 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.120
 car it keep turning 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.730
 you can maintain a certain economy 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.660
 but without fuel efficiency using 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.150
 like the economic one on a computer of 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.370
 board 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.280
 the soft and silent singing 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.650
 there is still position l of the field that is 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.600
 high on this side of saw 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.010
 you put it in the position it's like 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.130
 was the engine brake 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.840
 it will throw the brake or acceleration on 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.510
 up like the first to the second 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:09.320
 march of a normal car and will hold 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:11.900
 your car is a second book of the day 

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.670
 egg and drive off because you do not 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.860
 has no change in the sequence in that 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.320
 to control the acceleration 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.950
 from annie martin 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:25.570
 then we're needed as you pick up 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.570
 the road did not give a certain 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.590
 The ideal even is you get used to it 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.110
 This field is fine, he 's more annoying. 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:37.370
 than an automatic gearbox but also 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.370
 much quieter and more comfortable 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.849
 we can say that if they are used it is in 

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:49.849
 your best shape
