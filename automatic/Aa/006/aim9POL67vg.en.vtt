00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.509
 hi everybody today i will show you how 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.319
 prepare a mask that strengthens 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.780
 hair roots 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.559
 and also quickly restores dry 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.940
 hair for this we need 1 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.699
 a teaspoon of brandy 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.740
 we use it to heat the skin 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.609
 heads and maintaining her in such 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.039
 temperature for one hour 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.349
 then add 1 teaspoon of honey it 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.119
 provide our hair with trace elements and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.630
 will improve blood flow to the hair 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.630
 bulbs 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.040
 since our skin has a subacid 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.010
 the reaction and all the shampoos and soap is alkali 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.899
 and we have to use lemon juice 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.930
 to restore a weakly acidic environment 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.030
 for this we add skin no more than one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.940
 a teaspoon of lemon juice and a little hubble 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.710
 it is a regenerating hair oil 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.080
 it's very easy low-fat 1 teaspoon 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.170
 enough 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.950
 if you don't have light oils you can 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.200
 replace it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.100
 olive following oil burdock one 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.180
 teaspoon 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.830
 she will make our hair thick with 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.330
 time and for now only lush 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.360
 then add 1 yolk without a shell it 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.820
 fill the skin with vitamins and by the way the yolk 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.000
 it dissolves fat well so if you take 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.710
 in this mask 2 yolks then shampoo is not 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.170
 need a mask applied to the scalp 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.390
 we stack with a film and a towel through 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.250
 hour wash off preferably 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.880
 cool water to avoid here 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.130
 this unpleasant smell from the yolk 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.990
 I use this mask for hair roots 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.479
 and to give hair shine and 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.210
 smoothness I usually apply the entire length 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.620
 hair Indian oil 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.170
 taking advantage of indian since they are very 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.080
 lightweight and easy to rinse off 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.510
 yolk mask and oils composition I will point out 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.990
 description thank you for your attention to 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:10.990
