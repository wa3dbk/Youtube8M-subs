the I believe those are the liberal

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:13.190 
the I believe those are the liberal
cargo<00:01:09.470> trailers<00:01:10.670> inside<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:12.149> are<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:13.020> is

one little kind of pentagon shape object
and<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:17.459> only<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.360> mission<00:01:18.929> and<00:01:19.280> it's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and it's only in this mission and it's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.809 
and it's only in this mission and it's
in<00:01:20.399> the<00:01:20.490> shape<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:21.209> hexagon<00:01:21.690> I'm<00:01:21.959> sorry<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:22.819 
in the shape of a hexagon I'm sorry and

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.760 
in the shape of a hexagon I'm sorry and
what<00:01:23.819> it<00:01:23.940> is<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.360> has<00:01:24.569> a<00:01:24.600> number<00:01:24.990> six<00:01:25.440> on<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
what it is it has a number six on it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.059 
what it is it has a number six on it
with<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.520> lock<00:01:26.849> and<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.869> lock<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.440> broken<00:01:28.649> and

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:29.069 
with a lock and the lock is broken and

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.919 
with a lock and the lock is broken and
it<00:01:29.849> also<00:01:30.090> seems<00:01:30.690> to<00:01:30.869> indicate<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
it also seems to indicate that it is

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.839 
it also seems to indicate that it is
foreshadowing<00:01:33.929> for<00:01:34.050> possibly<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.709> GTA<00:01:35.160> 6<00:01:35.220> in

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:35.849 
foreshadowing for possibly a GTA 6 in

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.120 
foreshadowing for possibly a GTA 6 in
the<00:01:35.970> horizon<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.690> it's<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:37.649> hidden

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the horizon and it's actually hidden

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.699 
the horizon and it's actually hidden
really<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.819> well<00:01:39.080> who<00:01:40.080> knows<00:01:40.259> exactly

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
really really well who knows exactly

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.249 
really really well who knows exactly
what<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.340> means<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.080> can

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
what it means but for what we can

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.199 
what it means but for what we can
believe<00:01:43.410> we<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.160> go<00:01:44.429> ahead<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:44.819> say<00:01:45.000> that

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
believe we can go ahead and say that

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.880 
believe we can go ahead and say that
maybe<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.720> means<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.140> there<00:01:46.229> will<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.470> GTA

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
maybe it means that there will be a GTA

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.520 
maybe it means that there will be a GTA
6<00:01:47.119> but<00:01:48.119> who<00:01:48.479> knows<00:01:48.630> because<00:01:48.959> Rockstar

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
6 but who knows because Rockstar

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.930 
6 but who knows because Rockstar
probably<00:01:50.039> wouldn't<00:01:50.340> leave<00:01:50.490> stuff<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.880> like

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
probably wouldn't leave stuff out like

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.749 
probably wouldn't leave stuff out like
this<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.539> GTA<00:01:52.110> 6<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.800> it<00:01:52.920> does<00:01:53.130> give<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.550> that

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
this for GTA 6 but it does give you that

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.240 
this for GTA 6 but it does give you that
hope<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.300> perhaps<00:01:54.869> there<00:01:55.349> will<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.679> a<00:01:55.709> GTA<00:01:56.130> 6

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
hope that perhaps there will be a GTA 6

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.059 
hope that perhaps there will be a GTA 6
in<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.239> future<00:01:57.630> who<00:01:58.110> knows<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:58.950> at

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069
