 I did with the uranium mode with the pump 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.020
 nuclear that after installing 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.190
 by fire god fire everywhere 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 guys then what are we going to do 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.410
 boys is that we will find ourselves as 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.030
 I told them with an infinite amount or is 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.590
 the infinite but this also al vÃ©lez 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.300
 exaggerate that you have it in difficult mode 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.950
 well with a lot of creepers 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.840
 new that the truth as I told you is going to 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.370
 greatly improve the way you play the game 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.870
 let's look for more clippers but 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.550
 let's put it at night because if it's not it's not going to 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.040
 serve and we will not find the truth 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.060
 much out there or looking very 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.230

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.350
 another one remembers that I'm changing 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.230

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.560
 we have internet 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.730
 I'm finally going to my house just 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.890
 where they can make all the videos that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.840
 We want boys and the house says 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.760

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.940
 below this and as you can see that it is 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.590
 a is the deceptive clipper guys are 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.820
 double I think in six in six 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 creepers and what it does is that we have 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.900
 than to find what is the true 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.489

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.530
