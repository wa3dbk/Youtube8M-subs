00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.120
 a video of seeing the son of 4 for you and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.250
 today bringing another video of the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.410
 my child's dictionary series as 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.660
 expressions and words there you will see 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.279
 a lot here my videos for you 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.410
 Also use when they play was 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.750
 son of both the public and the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.449
 in competitive expressions that you use 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.650
 It 's in the day to day playing beauty, I already 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.539
 I did part 1 with some other 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.460
 pressures go to part 2 also with 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.500
 expressions related to the competitive 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.090
 that you see many matches 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.370
 the idea of ​​listening very 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.790
 these expressions and see also the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.860
 staff sometimes write so let's go 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.770
 it's often you see a guy pulling 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.300
 so not an enemy and he speaks without power 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.270
 be the face to fado 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.670
 let the meek face leave the face 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.890
 I do not know, but I understand. 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.410
 It means the guy is short on life. 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.780
 understood then fado comes from you 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.539
 leave the guy with one with half the life 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.189
 is that ralf would be half meowed I know that 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.380
 you love me so much, dude, it was painted 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.030
 for example, then everything is 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.560
 when you give too much shot in the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.229
 car and they ended up killing you. 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 Let's talk, man. This guy's pissed. 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.159
 Russia, nor is it so much the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.770
 time to help the team at the time of 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.140
 to develop a ranch of a flag 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.540
 so these pressures are a bit 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 different but have the same meaning 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.380
 many things you will see the staff 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.259
 typing in competitive matches in 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.600
 live swiss which are the following when the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.939
 Time is ready to start the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.700
 round he type in the chat he types 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.860
 What do you call it? 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.240
 they are seeing nothing so far is prevention 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.590
 live or restart, which is basically a 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.970
 brief, it is the same thing that is harry 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.220
 the same thing that we are prepared 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.259
 kind of because our team is 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.479
 prepared and from rr 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.340
 The game will be going, let's say 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.350
 Time is so well understood as 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.280
 were one we are basically prepared 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.290
 that's what i said there mean live on 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.860
 restart is when the team is not 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.830
 prepared he said nl meaning not 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.170
 live give if for example the team gave the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.500
 loló the car admitted it was there to subtract 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.320
 on here 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.360
 invited to start the game only 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.340
 In the meantime a guy from the team fell 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.520
 so what you go there in the chat type 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.020
 nl meaning to write live or not 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.450
 I was watching the game because obviously 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.040
 something happened there the team in the case 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.740
 which was now may have been a player 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.320
 What did you do then nl write live? 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.670
 basically is not valid and other 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.030
 expressions like gegê and gh gh means 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.320
 godeau union would be good half when 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.330
 you play a game of 105 x 10 x 10 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.190
 nets x 5 x 10 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.350
 and you obviously have two rounds to 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.100
 play when you play a round only if 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.830
 Speak house stutter that would be good 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.170
 Good half game is because only played half 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.530
 then the gh when you play 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.270
 half of the game reveals the gh gg ego of 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.520
 game or when you finish the game 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.190
 So you finished the two rounds or longer 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.330
 if they are two maps or finally three years 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.739
 edit in gg 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.959
 the game that is when the game ends 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.410
 If you have already won the order 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.360
 the game togo there is to yourself 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.580
 you won the proto time you need 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.330
 also who may have played a good 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.870
 part of having won then it's cgh we talked 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.820
 do nld do is a live is also that 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.860
 when the match was reading, right? 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.900
 you spoke O mean you're 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.000
 prepared to admire the restart one 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.010
 server given to lazio who to whom 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.590
 edit more to confirm by another team 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.209
 What are you ready for and the round? 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.850
 now it's worth so when you type 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.549
 live chat means that where it was 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.590
 reading the round guys will only be worth 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.880
 fact that both teams should light if the 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.530
 team live and one of nl is the irl 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.019
 time he will have to wait 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.930
 It's another team that is not ready. 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.820
 darling too or else give dar propose to 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.150
 adin is starting again 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.970
 beauty is commands that I admire uses is the 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.010
 gol life which means the onlive is what 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.900
 It's to redeem the rounds. 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.030
 only that there are two commanders who are so 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.250
 where I play the movie by the air with 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.800
 that the goal life and the start 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.020
 restart and gives you a restart in the round 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.300
 only changes the next teams then 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.819
 Do you have your clan's name tava df? 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.520
 I admire the restart in the next round and 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:35.759
 Go to Chinese on top of me. 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.650
 live or his clan that was of s 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.449
 will remain just round the west also 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.669
 then it is because it is the only difference that 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.620
 exists between google live in stat this 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.780
 the restart it gives the last times go 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.849
 live not paste keeps the teams the way 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.919
 that they are and another command that the 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:51.750
 people are very competitive is that the 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.840
 admitted what is the stop life that 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.190
 simply to prepare the game, right? 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.259
 Stop it it will not stop the game 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.599
 frozen understood but he simply 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.460
 a command for you to finish the match 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.680
 And when it's time to start over, it 's a 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.409
 goalkeeper again then this is some 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.610
 people living in very competitive is 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.039
 competitive also nice guys 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.750
 many places not only this 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.270
 move five years did also have 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.849
 much denomination of a place to call is 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.440
 a little house with a name or a passage 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.419
 the map with the name then you can see 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.020
 it's often the guy on the road 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:27.360
 guy is on the street is the guy is at school 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.150
 guy is there in the new Batman is an okay guy 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.279
 in metal all this with denominations that 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.409
 all the clans use to talk to it 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.870
 communicate and speak where the enemy is 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:39.270
 understood then you can if you can 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.830
 understand why this school goal that the 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.139
 Guys are talking, I'm sure. 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.650
 some small house because some 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:45.090
 someone 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.490
 normally the school that staff 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.620
 know is a house that has a twin 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.930
 house that two-story house 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.240
 What's up, bravo? 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.400
 so this is not very personal either 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.169
 using only you can be clear that you use the 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.819
 name for a house can have with the kodo 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.729
 this same name to another house then 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.770
 That's it, it does not interfere much with this. 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.870
 something that varies a bit 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.490
 So that's it , I think it's more or less 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.889
 this runs and talked about some 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.740
 denominations some client slang 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.479
 using was a field is as I said 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.099
 some had already had the staff 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.169
 quoted in the video to make this 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.659
 video here and if there's any more 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.000
 expression and you do not know how to 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:27.000
 I want to comment to ask who 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.800
 knows a part 3 I do not know if it's going to go 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.349
 have enough name to be part 3 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.849
 but if you have no problem 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.190
 so that's it then, I'll wait 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:36.870
 that you liked is remembering the 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.300
 our chat partnership was a thread of 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.909
 annoying is already rolling 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.669
 and that tomorrow on Thursday we will have 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:46.610
 live stream of a match of these 10 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:48.310
 between mw and uranus on the map of a play that 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.340

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.919

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:00.940
