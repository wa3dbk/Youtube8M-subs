00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
standard in this model which i think is

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.870

a<00:01:18.240> bit<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> first<00:01:18.840> for<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> segment<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.880> very

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
a bit of a first for the segment a very

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.370 
a bit of a first for the segment a very
torquey<00:01:21.240> engine<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> major

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
torquey engine and one of the major

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.710 
torquey engine and one of the major
problems<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.369> had<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.180> car<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.659> the

problems I had with this car with the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749 
problems I had with this car with the
previous<00:01:25.080> model<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:26.130> there<00:01:26.310> was<00:01:26.400> no<00:01:26.580> air

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
previous model was that there was no air

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.550 
previous model was that there was no air
conditioning<00:01:27.390> vent<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.780> back<00:01:27.960> now

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
conditioning vent in the back now

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.340 
conditioning vent in the back now
however<00:01:28.829> they<00:01:29.670> are<00:01:29.700> show<00:01:30.000> me<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
however they are show me that there is I

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.310 
however they are show me that there is I
don't<00:01:31.950> actually<00:01:32.640> see<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.200> know

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
don't actually see one here but you know

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.570

what

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
what

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.330 
what
it's<00:01:36.240> kind<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.480> tighten<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.110> which<00:01:37.740> again<00:01:38.280> is

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
it's kind of tighten here which again is

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.790 
it's kind of tighten here which again is
surprising<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.420> must<00:01:39.810> say<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.410> car<00:01:40.620> this

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
surprising I must say for a car this

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.210
