00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.390
 hello everyone today i would like you 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.870
 show how to adjust the vibrations 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.090
 that's how you saw split now 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 I have another 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.520
 plug and she is the current field of the game that is on 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.439
 drive fortifications no but wheels oz wheels 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.859
 shoot you see 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:31.050
 I didnâ€™t mean the point is that I have 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.170
 like it was on the back wheel that i 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910
 wrong side and breaks and they have 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.520
 me in the end I had eight more 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.010
 in addition, and wiped my wheel shorter 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 before the camera to zero come down and still happens 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.770
 also 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.600
 that the pad is worth the curve that is 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.170
 for example on this part she is strong 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.949
 erased 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.160
 in this part she is practically new here 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.629
 that is, in this regard, too, need 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.449
 regulate but basically everything is pretty 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.890
 it's just that, but often 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.350
 really regulate especially 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.479
 in front because they are very fast 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.670
 are erased and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.119
 the load is big actually why 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.310
 drive went because I have the scheme well 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.470
 here but now while this plug can 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.150
 be them 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.979
 back back on the disk for you can 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:26.009
 we'll see another plug in between 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:31.700
 I want to show you three bought new ones 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.890
 Shifters here such here to be honest 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.960
 old because 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.970
 There is now for example on a big star on 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.430
 front shift i.e. meet 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.380
 once for 2 this was all there was 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.200
 neither the first nor the second is the third that is she 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.640
 was like so marked and clicked 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.229
 you can manually say every time on 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.500
 the grass here is some kind of rubber so full and 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:57.350
 not some strange thing and I know well 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.330
 everything seems to be switched clearly for now 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:08.270
 there we look replaced all shirts before 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:15.440
 I am here pylon Schumann and original all 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:21.440
 This business Of course these coins I here such 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:27.260
 Here I do not like is not convenient and not with this 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:30.110
 somehow it's easier for me just need to somehow 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.550
 faster much more convenient but so 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.840
 own boy and breaks 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:43.700
 so but here's the essence unscrew the old 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:45.350
 I will show the pads with a hex key 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.610
 only from this side from the back side 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.610
 was not because of course symmetrically 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.610
 here 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.620
 then it's pretty simple 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.870
 I think who often does a lot 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:11.049
 drive there and so often have to 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:14.500
 do this that's what i think people already 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.769
 there is a certain skill in this plan 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:24.329
 but for those who are not with this or just 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:28.410
 rarely come across this here i will show 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.410
 there is nothing complicated about it 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:56.050
 then we put such songs than Lenka 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:58.740
 it sort of allows you to rotate the pads in 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:04.090
 different directions 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:08.260
 that is, but as it allows to regulate 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.080
 and depending on the puff it will 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:16.390
 keep that is here it rotates here 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:23.230
 upside down then calmly walks over here but the essence 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:26.620
 what is the problem so that it stands exactly to 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:32.410
 she is not a heat chamber 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:35.640
 press down so strongly certainly stretch 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:40.540
 chk and here these Monica flew 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:46.080
 force does not need to hit a little bit 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:53.880
 baby hold down then hold and 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.880
 twist to the end to the end 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:11.110
 quite tolerable she's a little cave 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:15.130
 tighten up a little bit for sure with 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.250
 it is better not to play the brakes 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.460
 adjoins everywhere equally 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.650
 Well, here's an example of how are you with us 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.350
 it turns out but on the reverse side too 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.980
 most now I'll tell you a little about 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:33.790
 the other point is that on all backpacks 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:37.150
 there are spring springs hips well here it is 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:46.230
 there it is spring on here so i can 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:46.230
 think up loosen that's you and not comfortable and 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.560
 the tension of these springs is adjustable here 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:56.380
 these cogs that is the deeper 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.450
 cog wrap the stronger spring so 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:05.800
 say we breaks aside then 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:08.160
 there is often there is a rub pad and then 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.400
 have get rid of it your 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.169
 curve so here is somehow not know and 3 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.450
 decks ie they come back 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.360
 uneven and here with these screws then 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.310
 there is regulated ie for example this 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.290
 little comes back you just him 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.510
 harder to open it will close 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.940
 better but of course everything is desirable there 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.060
 of course blurred clean up and so on 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.340
 that it was all soft 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.540
 brakes handle there should never 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:39.790
 to be here 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.139
 The actual adjustment system is extremely 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.870
 simple comfortable 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.960
 changing all quickly regulated 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:52.169
 agree used to do it often already 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:55.590
 but to someone, I think this video was 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:59.850
 someone useful who is not often this 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:03.720
 is engaged here and so basically on this 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.630
 all like like subscribe write 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:09.919
 comments ask questions to everyone 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.919
 thanks for watching everyone
