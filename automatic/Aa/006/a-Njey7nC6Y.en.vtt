00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.950
 gizmodo I'm with her on here 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.040
 the ces in las vegas for you on the way 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.509
 and found your product 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.429
 I retracted probably quite 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.529
 be exciting and that from 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.060
 the ipad 2 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.880
 there it is already that is actually a 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.920
 have normal iphone 6 and down here 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.380
 then we have a small keyboard so 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.859
 a cover that goes completely around rome 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.199
 except matte yes plastic and down here 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.800
 This keyboard reminds you very much 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.809
 actually an old blackberry 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.520
 keyboard 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.140
 so i can remember many of my 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.420
 friends now is a little less 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.070
 did not want to be on smartphones 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.840
 Change because you have this keyboard 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.520
 miss the physical keyboard 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 I think most of them have 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.449
 probably by now 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.730
 completely on the touch screen keyboard 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.520
 accustomed but if not than that because 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.079
 quite a good solution 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.149
 What is particularly chic here is this 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.550
 whole is also illuminated background 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.870
 so if I'm tipping right now this is 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.939
 the film was great , especially at night 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.780
 important simply does not look keys then 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.950
 you really need one 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.710
 backlight 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.960
 the whole is currently only for that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.560
 of course, then, too, iphone 5 and 5 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.850
 and for the iphone 6 6 plus is still 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.290
 not supported but you mean it 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.369
 work on it will probably come soon 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.200
 they actually want to go in anyway 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.020
 support even more mobile phones in the future 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.400
 I showed how to do that too 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.430
 You can do it here in the back 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.229
 pull up and then has two parts here 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.079
 and here you can pull out the whole thing 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.810
 that's what it looks like here we have 180 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.880
 billion hours of battery in it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.130
 this can be loaded with micro usb port 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.020
 here at the side the lady just said 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.159
 That would be about seven days 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.140
 keep regular use 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.159
 that should cost $ 99 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:57.060
 this model for the iphone 5 79 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.970
 dollar so far already 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.259
 pre-order for the iphone 6 and should 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.149
 very soon the other models will arrive 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.060
 iPhone 5 is already available online 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.489
 buy so you are planning now 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.720
 to act in europe relatively soon 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.900
 come we have discussions with 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.519
 different retailers, however, is 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.080
 not all positive so now 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.220
 has some disadvantages has been the part 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.680
 already noticed 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.049
 one of them would be one you can see one 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.360
 but before that is the body is 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.090
 unfortunately completely hidden that means here 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.000
 is this fingerprint version 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.620
 unfortunately not usable but good 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.180
 Mine with a few minor deaths must 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.590
 you probably die if you have one 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.209
 physical keyboard wants 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.970
 how do you see that we would do something like that 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.319
 use if now people buy if he 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.030
 the expensive one is now complete 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.690
 superfluous, your opinion becomes real 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.370
 interest 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.739
 otherwise I like the video 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.329
 gave us the thumbs up and 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.430
 we still have our channel subscribed 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.440
 lots of other news could be 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.890
 thank goodness that was matthias from you 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.890
 it
