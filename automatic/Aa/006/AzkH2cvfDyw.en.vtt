00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.669
 the paper cutting machine for 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.590
 sublimation was developed to cut 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.640
 from sublimation to tyco after 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.129
 printed 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 This equipment cuts both the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.079
 cross-sectional and horizontal 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.659
 the machine pulls the paper through the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.790
 and cuts horizontally 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.650
 without highlighting the same possibility 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.440
 highlighted by the operator 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.659
 the machine has ten cutting knives that 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:04.710
 adjustable according to the size of the 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:07.830
 The drawing for each drawing interval is 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.470
 necessary to print a card where 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.619
 the sensor will read and cut on top of the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.140
 same when cutting the paper the rate also 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.840
 will be cut off without transferring 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.270
 then to part for printed drawings 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.060
 printing is not necessary 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.520
 because you can also program 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.539
 the cut by compliance ignoring the use 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.310
 of the fee 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.069
 this equipment has a screen 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.310
 touchscreen allowing 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.440
 make schedules such as 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.509
 quantity of pieces to be sized 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.479
 of the horizontal cut according to size 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.789
 two rolls waiting time after cut 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.440
 among others 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.720
 also has counter parts 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.330
 allowing operator to know the quantity 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.200
 cut parts after the end of the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.530
 operation 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.340
 supports rolls up to 1.95 meters 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.319
 width 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.780
 the paper cutting machine for 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.239
 sublimation is an important ally in 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.670
 because it eliminates manual labor 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:09.830
 making production more efficient and 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.830
 eliminating material waste
