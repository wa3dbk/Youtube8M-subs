I<00:00:10.740> think<00:00:11.570> for<00:00:12.570> me<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:13.139> guess<00:00:13.530> is<00:00:13.950> it's<00:00:14.490> not<00:00:14.670> all

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
I think for me I guess is it's not all

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.390 
I think for me I guess is it's not all
about<00:00:14.849> accolades<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.719> things<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.109> us
