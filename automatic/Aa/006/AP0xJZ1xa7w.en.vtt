which I'm going to actually explain now

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.350 
which I'm going to actually explain now
in<00:00:47.960> a<00:00:48.079> second<00:00:48.620> but<00:00:49.040> first<00:00:49.100> of<00:00:49.430> all<00:00:49.489> guys<00:00:49.700> or<00:00:49.970> did

in a second but first of all guys or did

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.530 
in a second but first of all guys or did
I<00:00:50.510> have<00:00:51.050> went<00:00:51.500> into<00:00:51.860> six<00:00:52.160> individual<00:00:52.760> sees

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
I have went into six individual sees

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.340 
I have went into six individual sees
using<00:00:54.170> six<00:00:54.710> individual<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:56.050> extreme<00:00:57.050> Hills

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
using six individual and extreme Hills

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.889 
using six individual and extreme Hills
that<00:00:57.590> binds<00:00:58.070> getting<00:00:58.700> one<00:00:59.030> chunk<00:00:59.329> from<00:00:59.600> each

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
that binds getting one chunk from each

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.080 
that binds getting one chunk from each
using<00:01:00.350> mcedit<00:01:00.950> bringing<00:01:01.430> it<00:01:01.520> here<00:01:01.640> into<00:01:01.880> this

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
using mcedit bringing it here into this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.420 
using mcedit bringing it here into this
a<00:01:02.149> flat<00:01:02.510> ward<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:03.079> I<00:01:03.350> could<00:01:03.530> just<00:01:03.680> analyze<00:01:04.159> it

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
a flat ward so I could just analyze it

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.340 
a flat ward so I could just analyze it
you<00:01:04.549> know<00:01:04.670> easily<00:01:05.150> and<00:01:05.390> know<00:01:05.750> exactly<00:01:05.900> what's

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
you know easily and know exactly what's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.960 
you know easily and know exactly what's
going<00:01:06.470> on<00:01:06.560> with<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.799> chunk<00:01:07.070> so<00:01:07.250> each<00:01:07.640> one<00:01:07.670> of

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
going on with a chunk so each one of

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.580 
going on with a chunk so each one of
those<00:01:08.180> giant<00:01:08.659> chunks<00:01:09.140> as<00:01:09.260> you<00:01:09.380> can<00:01:09.500> see<00:01:09.560> right

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
those giant chunks as you can see right

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.020 
those giant chunks as you can see right
in<00:01:09.830> front<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:10.159> now<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.460> actually<00:01:10.610> made<00:01:10.850> out

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
in front of you now is actually made out

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.690 
in front of you now is actually made out
of<00:01:11.270> four<00:01:11.570> small<00:01:12.470> minecraft<00:01:12.950> chunks<00:01:13.340> which<00:01:13.520> as

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
of four small minecraft chunks which as

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.460 
of four small minecraft chunks which as
you<00:01:13.850> guys<00:01:14.030> probably<00:01:14.060> know<00:01:14.420> each<00:01:14.900> chunk<00:01:15.260> is

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
you guys probably know each chunk is

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.740 
you guys probably know each chunk is
usually<00:01:15.799> 16<00:01:16.190> by<00:01:16.310> 16<00:01:16.369> but<00:01:17.180> these<00:01:17.299> ones<00:01:17.600> they

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
usually 16 by 16 but these ones they

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.289 
usually 16 by 16 but these ones they
like<00:01:17.990> four<00:01:18.440> times<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:18.799> size<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.159> those<00:01:19.369> are<00:01:19.640> 64

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
like four times the size so those are 64

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.570 
like four times the size so those are 64
by<00:01:20.479> six<00:01:20.720> for<00:01:20.930> each<00:01:21.140> one<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.350> those<00:01:21.530> huge<00:01:21.890> chunks

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
by six for each one of those huge chunks

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.770 
by six for each one of those huge chunks
that<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.790> see<00:01:22.970> in<00:01:23.030> front<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:23.360> right<00:01:23.570> now

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
that you see in front of you right now

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.260 
that you see in front of you right now
so<00:01:24.110> what<00:01:24.320> are<00:01:24.350> they<00:01:24.530> then<00:01:24.560> i<00:01:25.010> use<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.700> mcedit

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
so what are they then i use the mcedit

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.969 
so what are they then i use the mcedit
to<00:01:26.390> kind<00:01:26.659> of<00:01:26.720> analyze<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:27.440> these<00:01:27.590> are<00:01:27.619> giant

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
to kind of analyze it these are giant

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.620 
to kind of analyze it these are giant
chunks<00:01:28.580> otherwise<00:01:28.939> it<00:01:29.119> would<00:01:29.210> take<00:01:29.330> me<00:01:29.450> like

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
chunks otherwise it would take me like

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.830 
chunks otherwise it would take me like
years<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.710> know<00:01:30.830> exactly<00:01:31.460> how<00:01:31.700> many<00:01:31.840> emeralds

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
years to know exactly how many emeralds

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.840 
years to know exactly how many emeralds
and<00:01:32.900> these<00:01:33.110> six<00:01:33.470> individual<00:01:34.040> giant<00:01:34.400> chunks<00:01:34.760> in

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
and these six individual giant chunks in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.670 
and these six individual giant chunks in
front<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.150> you<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.720> i<00:01:35.750> use<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.290> analyzing

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
front of you so i use the analyzing

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.460 
front of you so i use the analyzing
option<00:01:37.310> in<00:01:37.659> mcedit<00:01:38.659> which<00:01:38.840> i<00:01:39.049> probably

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
option in mcedit which i probably

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.399 
option in mcedit which i probably
explain<00:01:40.040> more<00:01:40.369> about<00:01:40.580> in<00:01:41.150> my<00:01:41.479> second<00:01:42.080> channel

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
explain more about in my second channel

this<00:02:02.270> subject<00:02:02.780> sorry<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:03.320> wanted<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.009> know

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
this subject sorry I wanted to know

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.950 
this subject sorry I wanted to know
exactly<00:02:04.250> where<00:02:04.880> is<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.210> best<00:02:05.390> place<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.930> find

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
exactly where is the best place to find

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.960 
exactly where is the best place to find
emeralds<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:06.829> I<00:02:07.070> started<00:02:07.549> looking<00:02:07.670> between

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
emeralds so I started looking between

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.089 
emeralds so I started looking between
the<00:02:08.509> levels<00:02:08.660> where<00:02:09.080> usually<00:02:09.259> find<00:02:09.739> emerge

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
the levels where usually find emerge

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.370 
the levels where usually find emerge
which<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.489> between<00:02:10.819> 4<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.660> 32<00:02:12.110> another

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
which is between 4 and the 32 another

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.420 
which is between 4 and the 32 another
reason<00:02:12.680> why<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.800> just<00:02:13.040> like

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
reason why I just like

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.860 
reason why I just like
in<00:02:13.549> those<00:02:13.760> levels<00:02:14.180> because<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:14.629> is<00:02:14.719> the<00:02:14.840> only

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
in those levels because this is the only

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.709 
in those levels because this is the only
places<00:02:15.409> where<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:16.189> can<00:02:16.340> only<00:02:16.519> find<00:02:16.969> you<00:02:17.629> know

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719 
places where you can only find you know

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.539 
places where you can only find you know
emeralds<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:18.799> could<00:02:18.950> only<00:02:19.099> find<00:02:19.370> them<00:02:19.430> in

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
emeralds and you could only find them in

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.610 
emeralds and you could only find them in
extreme<00:02:19.879> Hills<00:02:20.090> no<00:02:20.329> other<00:02:20.540> biomes<00:02:20.989> because

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
extreme Hills no other biomes because

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.869 
extreme Hills no other biomes because
they<00:02:21.739> don't<00:02:21.890> actually<00:02:22.010> support<00:02:22.219> in<00:02:22.430> any<00:02:22.549> other

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
they don't actually support in any other

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.819 
they don't actually support in any other
biomes<00:02:23.269> sorry<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.629> just<00:02:23.989> wanted<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.319> kind<00:02:24.469> of<00:02:24.590> go

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
biomes sorry I just wanted to kind of go

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.699 
biomes sorry I just wanted to kind of go
in<00:02:24.950> details<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.609> know<00:02:25.760> exactly<00:02:25.909> which<00:02:26.709> levels

which<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:09.980> good<00:03:10.310> good<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:10.700> then<00:03:11.540> between<00:03:12.109> six

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
which is good good and then between six

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.099 
which is good good and then between six
and<00:03:12.620> nine<00:03:12.709> forty-five<00:03:13.370> improving<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.419> then<00:03:14.870> I

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
and nine forty-five improving and then I

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.920 
and nine forty-five improving and then I
was<00:03:15.590> like<00:03:15.620> what<00:03:16.129> a<00:03:16.479> comedy<00:03:17.479> we<00:03:17.540> actually<00:03:17.810> went

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
was like what a comedy we actually went

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.110 
was like what a comedy we actually went
down<00:03:18.109> so<00:03:18.319> between<00:03:18.560> six<00:03:18.919> and<00:03:19.069> sorry<00:03:19.819> between

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
down so between six and sorry between

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.280 
down so between six and sorry between
nine<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.299> twelve<00:03:20.629> just<00:03:20.810> kind<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:20.989> went<00:03:21.139> down

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
nine and twelve just kind of went down

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.129 
nine and twelve just kind of went down
to<00:03:21.440> 41<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:22.159> was<00:03:22.579> not<00:03:22.699> expecting<00:03:22.909> this<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.629> then

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
to 41 I was not expecting this and then

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.039 
to 41 I was not expecting this and then
it<00:03:24.290> goes<00:03:24.470> back<00:03:24.590> up<00:03:24.949> between<00:03:25.250> 12<00:03:25.639> and<00:03:25.760> 15<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.449> 44

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
it goes back up between 12 and 15 to 44

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.439 
it goes back up between 12 and 15 to 44
so<00:03:27.319> it's<00:03:28.010> just<00:03:28.400> really<00:03:28.669> weird<00:03:28.909> you<00:03:29.090> like<00:03:29.269> it

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:29.449 
so it's just really weird you like it

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.539 
so it's just really weird you like it
goes<00:03:29.659> up<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.109> down<00:03:30.199> in<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.590> way<00:03:30.769> is<00:03:30.979> it<00:03:31.220> just<00:03:31.370> it

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
goes up and down in a way is it just it

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.339 
goes up and down in a way is it just it
does<00:03:31.849> not<00:03:31.970> make<00:03:32.209> much<00:03:32.599> sense<00:03:32.659> because<00:03:33.079> you

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
does not make much sense because you

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.929 
does not make much sense because you
expect<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.739> kind<00:03:33.859> of<00:03:33.949> find<00:03:34.129> them<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.699> know<00:03:34.819> the

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
expect to kind of find them you know the

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.520 
expect to kind of find them you know the
hi<00:03:35.060> girly<00:03:35.510> they're<00:03:35.840> gonna<00:03:35.930> find<00:03:36.169> more<00:03:36.409> are<00:03:36.500> you

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
hi girly they're gonna find more are you

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.649 
hi girly they're gonna find more are you
going<00:03:36.709> to<00:03:36.769> find<00:03:36.919> lesser<00:03:37.220> space<00:03:37.579> so<00:03:37.909> in<00:03:38.180> here<00:03:38.629> we

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
going to find lesser space so in here we

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.140 
going to find lesser space so in here we
have<00:03:38.930> between<00:03:39.079> 15<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:39.739> 18<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.549> goes<00:03:40.669> back<00:03:40.909> down

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
have between 15 and 18 it goes back down

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.449 
have between 15 and 18 it goes back down
so<00:03:41.569> as<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:41.989> see<00:03:42.229> up<00:03:42.439> down<00:03:42.829> up<00:03:43.009> and<00:03:43.159> it's<00:03:43.310> like<00:03:43.400> a

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
so as you see up down up and it's like a

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.580 
so as you see up down up and it's like a
little<00:03:43.729> wave<00:03:43.909> and<00:03:44.150> then<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.930> best<00:03:45.139> place<00:03:45.379> is

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
little wave and then the best place is

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.869 
little wave and then the best place is
pretty<00:03:45.739> much<00:03:45.919> going<00:03:46.159> to<00:03:46.220> be<00:03:46.310> able<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.699> find

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
pretty much going to be able to find

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.899 
pretty much going to be able to find
emeralds<00:03:47.180> is<00:03:47.359> between<00:03:47.720> 18<00:03:48.379> and<00:03:48.560> 21<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:49.699> these

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
emeralds is between 18 and 21 so these

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.240 
emeralds is between 18 and 21 so these
are<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.569> best<00:03:51.079> levels<00:03:51.530> they<00:03:51.590> kind<00:03:51.769> of<00:03:51.829> look<00:03:52.009> in

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
are the best levels they kind of look in

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.189 
are the best levels they kind of look in
between<00:03:52.639> to<00:03:52.849> find<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.180> most<00:03:53.419> emeralds<00:03:54.109> and

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
between to find the most emeralds and

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.360 
between to find the most emeralds and
then<00:03:54.769> you<00:03:54.919> go<00:03:55.129> from<00:03:55.970> this<00:03:56.349> back<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.560> 43<00:03:58.220> so

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
then you go from this back to 43 so

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.509 
then you go from this back to 43 so
between<00:03:58.669> 21<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.239> 24<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.379> could<00:04:00.530> only<00:04:00.650> find<00:04:00.949> 43

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
between 21 and 24 you could only find 43

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.580 
between 21 and 24 you could only find 43
and<00:04:01.669> then<00:04:01.790> it<00:04:01.879> goes<00:04:02.000> back<00:04:02.030> up<00:04:02.389> so<00:04:02.750> another

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
and then it goes back up so another

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.909 
and then it goes back up so another
crazy<00:04:03.979> wave<00:04:04.340> between<00:04:04.639> you<00:04:05.030> know<00:04:05.150> 57<00:04:05.930> 255<00:04:06.650> and

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
crazy wave between you know 57 255 and

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.670 
crazy wave between you know 57 255 and
then<00:04:07.069> between<00:04:07.489> 43<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:08.269> it's<00:04:08.959> also<00:04:09.229> up<00:04:09.409> and<00:04:09.560> down

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
then between 43 so it's also up and down

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.199 
then between 43 so it's also up and down
up<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:09.979> down<00:04:10.099> when<00:04:10.609> you<00:04:10.669> actually<00:04:10.819> looking

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
up and down when you actually looking

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.050 
up and down when you actually looking
for<00:04:11.509> MS<00:04:11.810> and<00:04:11.840> then<00:04:12.079> it<00:04:12.229> goes<00:04:12.409> from<00:04:12.859> 27<00:04:13.729> to<00:04:13.759> 30

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
for MS and then it goes from 27 to 30

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.490 
for MS and then it goes from 27 to 30
get<00:04:14.449> 40<00:04:14.900> 1<00:04:15.259> and<00:04:15.500> then<00:04:15.709> from<00:04:15.889> 32<00:04:16.280> 32<00:04:16.669> 32<00:04:17.500> emeralds

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
get 40 1 and then from 32 32 32 emeralds

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.620 
get 40 1 and then from 32 32 32 emeralds
so<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.889> goes<00:04:19.099> back<00:04:19.340> down<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.849> high<00:04:20.030> kind<00:04:20.419> of<00:04:20.509> go

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
so it goes back down the high kind of go

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.510 
so it goes back down the high kind of go
up<00:04:20.659> I<00:04:20.930> suppose<00:04:21.229> but<00:04:21.560> as<00:04:21.739> you<00:04:21.859> guys<00:04:22.010> know<00:04:22.039> now
