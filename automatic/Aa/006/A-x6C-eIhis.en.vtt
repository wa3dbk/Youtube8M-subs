00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.660
 a little over a year ago google decided 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.010
 joining forces with asus for release of 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.870
 head to the pool of the cables 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.230
 manageable and the play and it came out 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.230
 round 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.580
 the nexus 7 your will get to show that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.690
 a low cost device does not have 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.910
 why give up some benefits 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.090
 minimum nor did it open it without 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.090
 Grace 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.700
 however, he was not exempt from any 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.560
 that another section that needs improvement 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.370
 a little bit so here comes into play 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.780
 your new generation 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.850
 ah 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.770
 this year's edition has raised its 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.660
 price tag some integers but 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.780
 in return, it has some benefits 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.579
 the most desirable 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.870
 one of its main signs of 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.399
 identity is the inclusion of a 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.059
 screen with much more resolution 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.589
 specifically 1920 x 1200 pixels at 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.750
 that then you also have to add high 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.510
 shine natural colors and wide 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.159
 angles of vision in short one of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.720
 the best screens we've seen in 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.720
 this size and for this profile 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.240
 ah 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.310
 the 2013 model is also thinner 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.320
 something narrower and a little bit taller 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.720
 than the previous one what they get it to be 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.550
 Easy to hold with one hand and if 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.170
 you are not wearing very tight clothes such 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.619
 Once you can even get to save it in 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.619
 a pocket 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.350
 unfortunately not all changes are 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.240
 favorable and is that its creators have 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.130
 opted to lengthen the frame a bit with 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.020
 the excuse of giving the user more space 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.930
 to place the hands and that the sound 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.610
 is distributed better yes to us in 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.840
 the end result has been looking 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.840
 a little disproportionate 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.470
 since we are facing a device of the 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.540
 nexus family and therefore an android 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.100
 pure strain our protagonist has not 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.660
 taken to savor the honeys of the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.260
 new version of the operating system of 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.120
 the 50,000 the 4.4 or kat kit if you prefer 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.420
 stick to the bags denominations of 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.420
 Google 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.670
 beyond giving a boost to your 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.110
 performance is chocolate 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.150
 update gives you a good wash 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.680
 facing their icons and transitions to 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.980
 time that clarifies some of your funds 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.480
 to get a more luminous effect the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.920
 repertoire of changes goes through 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.380
 provide you with a new graphic editor 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.810
 non-destructive renews its applications 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.190
 mail the clock and even takes care 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.200
 to add new printing options 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.940
 wireless or give solutions 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.540
 productivity with the pre-installed 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.540
 quick office suite 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.360
 how 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.950
 as you can imagine we could not 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.930
 leave us in the inkwell the section of 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.909
 games that benefit this version of 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.860
 better graphics to show you more 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.900
 level of detail as well as speakers 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.940
 in stereo so you can get in 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.409
 more in history and ultimately that 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.409
 the experience is more entertaining 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.549
 even though the new nexus is 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.590
 abandoned in the emblematic texture 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.239
 dotted on his back the great novelty 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.819
 is the arrival of a 5 camera 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.680
 megapixels the results that this 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.030
 offers maybe not reach in the note of 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.129
 court imposed by the big 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.510
 smartphones this season but to 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.280
 good insurance will get you out of a 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.969
 I squeeze if you do not carry your phone 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.969
 at that moment 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.200
 as you see the nexus 7 2013 has so much 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.240
 points in favor as one or another 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.590
 find details by which maybe 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.319
 is not the perfect equipment for 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.120
 certain users still so to day of 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.590
 today can boast without problems of being 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.270
 one of the most complete androids 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.270
 within your precious strip
