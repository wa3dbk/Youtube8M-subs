00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.310 

now<00:01:19.840> when<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.110> get<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.700> end<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.450> your<00:01:22.930> dart

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
now when you get to the end of your dart

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.910 
now when you get to the end of your dart
I<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.909> say<00:01:25.090> about<00:01:25.479> maybe<00:01:26.170> a<00:01:26.290> quarter<00:01:26.619> inch

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
I would say about maybe a quarter inch

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.289 
I would say about maybe a quarter inch
or<00:01:27.040> so<00:01:27.430> from<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:28.240> end<00:01:28.630> I<00:01:29.369> normally<00:01:30.369> changed<00:01:31.119> my

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
or so from the end I normally changed my

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.249 
or so from the end I normally changed my
stitch<00:01:31.930> length<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.740> 1.5<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.180> that<00:01:34.840> gives<00:01:35.140> me

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
stitch length to a 1.5 and that gives me

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.510 
stitch length to a 1.5 and that gives me
a<00:01:35.290> nice<00:01:35.530> point<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:37.630> like<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.470> little<00:01:38.979> dot

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
a nice point and not like a little dot

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.520 
a nice point and not like a little dot
at<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.909> end<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.240> my<00:01:40.450> dart<00:01:40.750> so<00:01:41.049> it<00:01:41.110> looks<00:01:41.320> nice

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
at the end of my dart so it looks nice

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.520 
at the end of my dart so it looks nice
and<00:01:41.560> smooth<00:01:42.509> when<00:01:43.509> you<00:01:43.540> have<00:01:43.780> your<00:01:43.990> skirt<00:01:44.259> on

Petersham because you have a curve when
you<00:02:49.220> have<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.610> dark<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.870> Petersham<00:02:51.320> has

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
you have the dark and the Petersham has

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.480 
you have the dark and the Petersham has
its<00:02:52.550> own<00:02:52.760> curve<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.420> will<00:02:53.600> go<00:02:53.750> with<00:02:53.900> euchre

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
its own curve that will go with euchre

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.990
