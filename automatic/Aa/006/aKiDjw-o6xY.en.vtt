order<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> connect<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.400> because<00:01:35.640> if<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> try

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
order to connect it because if you try

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.730 
order to connect it because if you try
to<00:01:36.150> connect<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.780> ask<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> pain<00:01:37.439> which

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
to connect this can ask for a pain which

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.950 
to connect this can ask for a pain which
none<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.189> really<00:01:38.490> exists<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> use

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
none it really exists you have to use

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.050 
none it really exists you have to use
the<00:01:40.140> cable<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> often<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
the cable to for the often I think a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.649 
the cable to for the often I think a
authentication<00:01:45.060> part<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.350 

now<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.280> thought<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.490> would<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.850> needed<00:01:51.060> an

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
now I thought you would have needed an

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.560 
now I thought you would have needed an
app<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.530> kind<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.939> it's<00:01:53.939> no

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
app to do this but it's kind of it's no

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.389 
app to do this but it's kind of it's no
worries<00:01:54.840> built<00:01:55.229> into<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> Android<00:01:56.100> system

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
worries built into the Android system

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.910 
worries built into the Android system
which<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> great<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.420> don't<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.380> exactly<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
which is great I don't know exactly a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.160 
which is great I don't know exactly a
full<00:01:59.189> list<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.579> tablets<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.630> supports

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
full list of tablets that this supports

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.910 
full list of tablets that this supports
so<00:02:01.790> you<00:02:02.790> may<00:02:03.149> need<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.570> maybe<00:02:04.229> our<00:02:04.469> trial<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
so you may need to maybe our trial and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.029 
so you may need to maybe our trial and
error<00:02:05.100> thing<00:02:05.490> for<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.780> would<00:02:07.469> say<00:02:07.890> it's

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
error thing for you I would say it's

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.640 
error thing for you I would say it's
probably<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.369> safe<00:02:08.550> bet<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:09.090> any<00:02:09.979> Nvidia<00:02:10.979> based

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
probably a safe bet to any Nvidia based

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.580 
probably a safe bet to any Nvidia based
tablet<00:02:13.580> would<00:02:13.790> be<00:02:13.970> able<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.239> do<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.900> got

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
tablet would be able to do this I got

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.059 
tablet would be able to do this I got
this<00:02:15.770> procedure<00:02:16.250> off<00:02:16.520> of<00:02:16.790> Nvidia's<00:02:17.450> little

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
this procedure off of Nvidia's little

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.839 
this procedure off of Nvidia's little
app<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.640> it's<00:02:20.120> pretty<00:02:20.360> neat<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:21.610> I'm<00:02:22.610> going<00:02:22.760> to

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
app and it's pretty neat I I'm going to

think<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.460> figured<00:05:20.789> out<00:05:20.999> any<00:05:21.389> buttons<00:05:21.810> that

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
think I figured out any buttons that

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.159 
think I figured out any buttons that
work<00:05:22.199> for<00:05:22.499> that<00:05:22.530> part<00:05:22.979> of<00:05:23.039> it<00:05:23.219> but<00:05:23.749> from<00:05:24.749> now<00:05:24.930> on

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
work for that part of it but from now on

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.309 
work for that part of it but from now on
like<00:05:26.069> right<00:05:26.430> now<00:05:26.460> I'm<00:05:26.659> using<00:05:27.659> the<00:05:27.900> controller

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
like right now I'm using the controller

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:38.749

I<00:05:29.689> can<00:05:30.689> zoom<00:05:36.499> actually<00:05:37.499> I<00:05:37.529> think<00:05:37.800> square<00:05:38.460> is

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
I can zoom actually I think square is

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.749 
I can zoom actually I think square is
actually<00:05:39.270> like<00:05:39.900> what<00:05:40.229> you<00:05:40.349> would<00:05:40.439> use<00:05:40.680> x4<00:05:41.550> in

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
actually like what you would use x4 in

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.959 
actually like what you would use x4 in
most<00:05:41.969> instances<00:05:42.419> like<00:05:42.960> on<00:05:43.139> the<00:05:43.289> playstation

00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:43.969 
most instances like on the playstation

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:54.050 
most instances like on the playstation
so<00:05:45.199> it's<00:05:46.199> kind<00:05:46.439> of<00:05:46.499> neat

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.240
