00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.010 

all<00:01:40.659> right<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:41.229> anyway<00:01:42.000> I'm<00:01:43.000> gonna<00:01:43.119> hop<00:01:43.360> up<00:01:43.390> go

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020

all<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.440> way<00:01:44.530> down<00:01:44.740> follow<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.580> block

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.090 

now<00:01:55.390> I<00:01:55.750> know<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.200> looks<00:01:56.380> like<00:01:56.470> it's<00:01:56.710> gonna<00:01:56.830> take

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
now I know it looks like it's gonna take

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.010 
now I know it looks like it's gonna take
longer<00:01:57.370> than<00:01:57.520> building<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.150> but<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.810> so

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
longer than building it but this is so

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.240 
longer than building it but this is so
much<00:01:59.080> easier<00:01:59.620> and<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:02.110> amazing<00:02:02.620> how<00:02:02.740> easy<00:02:03.190> it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
much easier and it's amazing how easy it

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.360 
much easier and it's amazing how easy it
is<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:03.910> then<00:02:04.540> you<00:02:04.780> just<00:02:04.860> don't<00:02:05.860> use<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.130> wand

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
is so then you just don't use the wand

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.320 
is so then you just don't use the wand
to<00:02:06.490> delete<00:02:06.880> because<00:02:07.120> it'll<00:02:07.330> reselect<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:09.330> spot

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
to delete because it'll reselect a spot

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.120 
to delete because it'll reselect a spot
so<00:02:10.780> then<00:02:10.960> you're<00:02:11.110> gonna<00:02:11.170> go<00:02:11.410> in<00:02:11.530> here<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:11.950> you

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
so then you're gonna go in here and you

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.340 
so then you're gonna go in here and you
just<00:02:12.340> go<00:02:12.460> tight<00:02:12.730> you're<00:02:13.450> gonna<00:02:13.570> right-click

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
just go tight you're gonna right-click

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.340 
just go tight you're gonna right-click
your<00:02:14.770> second<00:02:15.100> position<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:16.050> if<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.170> don't

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
your second position and if you don't

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.350 
your second position and if you don't
know<00:02:17.500> already<00:02:17.740> every<00:02:18.190> block<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.640> ID'd<00:02:19.000> with<00:02:19.270> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
know already every block is ID'd with a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.560 
know already every block is ID'd with a
number<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.160> what<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.670> want<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:21.970> use<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.270> smooth

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
number so what I want to use is smooth

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.650 
number so what I want to use is smooth
sandstone<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.740> see<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.070> number<00:02:24.400> is

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
sandstone and you can see the number is

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:33.990 
sandstone and you can see the number is
24<00:02:26.790> -<00:02:28.320> Collins<00:02:29.320> -<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:32.340> we're<00:02:33.340> gonna<00:02:33.459> type<00:02:33.760> that

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
24 - Collins - so we're gonna type that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.590 
24 - Collins - so we're gonna type that
in<00:02:34.150> we're<00:02:34.420> going<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.630> type<00:02:37.440> T<00:02:39.120> back<00:02:40.120> soft<00:02:40.390> back

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
in we're going to type T back soft back

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:49.320 
in we're going to type T back soft back
so<00:02:40.810> I've<00:02:40.900> set<00:02:42.690> 24<00:02:43.690> edge<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:47.310> enter<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.489> as<00:02:49.150> you

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
so I've set 24 edge to enter and as you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.890 
so I've set 24 edge to enter and as you
can<00:02:49.510> see<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:50.200> whole<00:02:50.410> spot<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.510> filled<00:02:52.510> it

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
can see the whole spot that I filled it

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.770 
can see the whole spot that I filled it
was<00:02:53.350> now<00:02:53.500> covered<00:02:53.950> with<00:02:54.190> sandstone<00:02:54.910> which<00:02:55.600> is

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
was now covered with sandstone which is

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.880 
was now covered with sandstone which is
exactly<00:02:56.320> what<00:02:56.500> we<00:02:56.590> wanted<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:58.170> now<00:02:59.170> let's<00:02:59.650> try
