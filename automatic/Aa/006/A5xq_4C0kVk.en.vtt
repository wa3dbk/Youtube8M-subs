play the cut shot on the balls back of a

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.880 
play the cut shot on the balls back of a
length<00:00:16.090> and<00:00:16.599> slightly<00:00:17.109> wide<00:00:17.289> on<00:00:17.470> the<00:00:17.500> channel

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
length and slightly wide on the channel

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.679 
length and slightly wide on the channel
you<00:00:18.099> use<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.489> pace<00:00:18.669> of<00:00:18.880> the<00:00:18.939> ball<00:00:19.150> looking

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
you use the pace of the ball looking

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.329 
you use the pace of the ball looking
either<00:00:19.960> a<00:00:20.140> back<00:00:20.380> good<00:00:20.529> point<00:00:20.800> or<00:00:20.980> just<00:00:21.220> in

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:21.339 
either a back good point or just in

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.099 
either a back good point or just in
front<00:00:21.579> or<00:00:21.699> just<00:00:21.730> behind<00:00:22.269> it's<00:00:22.689> a<00:00:22.810> really

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
front or just behind it's a really

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.929 
front or just behind it's a really
valuable<00:00:23.349> scoring<00:00:23.980> shot<00:00:24.189> so<00:00:24.669> you<00:00:24.699> play<00:00:24.909> the

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
valuable scoring shot so you play the

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.120 
valuable scoring shot so you play the
cut<00:00:25.210> shot<00:00:25.480> -<00:00:25.779> pretty<00:00:26.230> bad<00:00:26.409> delivery<00:00:26.649> -<00:00:27.009> if

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
cut shot - pretty bad delivery - if

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.219 
cut shot - pretty bad delivery - if
we're<00:00:27.310> honest<00:00:27.579> the<00:00:27.970> bowlers<00:00:28.390> strayed<00:00:28.869> in<00:00:29.050> line

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:29.229 
we're honest the bowlers strayed in line

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.899 
we're honest the bowlers strayed in line
in<00:00:29.409> length<00:00:29.619> so<00:00:29.829> it's<00:00:30.189> probably<00:00:30.489> pitching

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:30.909 
in length so it's probably pitching

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.299 
in length so it's probably pitching
around<00:00:31.179> here<00:00:31.449> as<00:00:32.140> you<00:00:32.290> see<00:00:32.410> that's<00:00:32.590> pretty<00:00:33.040> bad

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
around here as you see that's pretty bad

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
you lean back and you have no control so

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.890 
you lean back and you have no control so
the<00:00:54.250> practice<00:00:54.670> we'll<00:00:54.850> be<00:00:54.910> doing<00:00:55.120> today<00:00:55.240> we're

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.060 
the practice we'll be doing today we're
making<00:00:56.020> sure<00:00:56.290> we're<00:00:56.440> getting<00:00:56.500> right<00:00:56.740> on<00:00:56.890> top

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
making sure we're getting right on top

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.980 
making sure we're getting right on top
of<00:00:57.100> it<00:00:57.340> maybe<00:00:57.760> going<00:00:58.120> on<00:00:58.210> your<00:00:58.360> tiptoes<00:00:58.750> when

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
of it maybe going on your tiptoes when

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.750 
of it maybe going on your tiptoes when
you're<00:00:59.110> back<00:00:59.260> in<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.500> crease<00:00:59.739> and<00:01:00.010> really

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
you're back in the crease and really

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.700 
you're back in the crease and really
controlling<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.420> shot<00:01:01.660> with<00:01:02.110> your<00:01:02.230> eyes<00:01:02.380> and

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
controlling the shot with your eyes and

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.289 
controlling the shot with your eyes and
your<00:01:02.770> head<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.220> your<00:01:03.310> hands<00:01:03.520> all<00:01:03.760> in<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.119> same

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
your head and your hands all in the same

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.330 
your head and your hands all in the same
area<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.500> we<00:01:05.590> still<00:01:05.770> up<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:05.950> bowling<00:01:06.189> machine

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
area so we still up a bowling machine

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.730 
area so we still up a bowling machine
standing<00:01:06.819> bowling<00:01:07.329> exactly<00:01:08.079> the<00:01:08.170> right<00:01:08.319> area

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
standing bowling exactly the right area

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.679 
standing bowling exactly the right area
slightly<00:01:09.310> back<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.609> a<00:01:09.640> length<00:01:09.850> when<00:01:10.509> as<00:01:10.600> the

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
slightly back of a length when as the

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.239 
slightly back of a length when as the
bowler<00:01:10.899> gives<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.409> bit<00:01:11.679> more<00:01:11.710> width<00:01:12.069> to

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249 
bowler gives you a bit more width to

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:13.980 
bowler gives you a bit more width to
score<00:01:12.549> so<00:01:12.729> it's<00:01:12.850> just<00:01:12.999> outside<00:01:13.479> of<00:01:13.539> channel

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
score so it's just outside of channel

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.690 
score so it's just outside of channel
your<00:01:14.409> first<00:01:14.649> move<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:15.039> obviously<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.549> play

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
your first move is obviously to play
