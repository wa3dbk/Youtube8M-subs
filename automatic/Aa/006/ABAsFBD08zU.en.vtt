00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.169
 and this time we will show how 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:20.120
 make the break the samsung galaxy s 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:24.080
 plus after having done so more 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.620
 of the equipment that is installed 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.050
 also the cwm drip type of things and 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.110
 anyway from the same process 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.240
 serve with dry or 7 and return to the state 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.160
 original that I think in this case is 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.110
 of the third or else it's simply going to be 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.059
 Sants has tools 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.989
 they need good as the order is visited 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.370
 1.85 and the official rome of samsung 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.680
 galaxy of these and then the model is the s 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.500
 7500 l I think I understand that 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 there are several models for this 6 without 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.690
 But as you mentioned that is the s 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.280
 7500 that the problem has is the 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.079
 problem that you know wants to undertake the 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.269
 team 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.580
 as it apparently starts right 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.280
 but throw them directly at what is 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.140
 the recovery mode and it does not let us do 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.299
 nothing more if we give it to restart I'm going to 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.320
 start what the copper motor is for 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.090
 So what we have to do 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.030
 conventions times flashing it with the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.430
 new stop route so that everything 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.619
 it had been done and now it's like new 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.180
 How is this done? Well , first thing 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.340
 that they have to have install in their 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.560
 team is the samsung keys here is how 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.179
 want to call him since all the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.950
 necessary drivers 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:36.319
 samsung split your species can 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.720
 recognize them without any problem once 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.890
 that is off in the team then 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.140
 we proceed to put in what is the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.789
 model the pain mode is set with volume 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.789
 or down power and like the same time 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.310
 in a cup instead I was entering what is 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.710
 the third hour module is to tighten 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.689
 volume up the equipment enter mode 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.630
 therefore that's it for the phone 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.579
 the moment we do it aside and since 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.979
 we are here on the computer in the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.600
 link to download videos from 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.759
 comments but I will not leave there the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.129
 download link so you can see them 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.120
 here when we win the odin we have it 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.280
 to run as administrators 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.150
 here we give to execute as 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.640
 administrator we give to you that if here already 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.489
 start in the same way you have to look at 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.240
 the option that waits we go to where 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.190
 let's have what is the 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.440
 the download file that in this 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.750
 occasion I have it on the desk 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.810
 and I have the name of galaxies 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.190
 plus we enter here again we enter and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.360
 He says that I'm going to show him at the beginning 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.970
 the video is the e75 lv jlh with 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.970
 completion as here you can see it with 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.920
 points give point of thousands five equal 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.240
 real about let's open and we 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.070
 we assure that the boxes of 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.750
 distribution and flash what are not 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.210
 checked 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.640
 now for what follows is to connect the 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.270
 phone to the computer using the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.270
 sweet cable 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.319
 we connect and it must recognize the 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.659
 computer on top in a 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.659
 yellow square here as you can see 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.790
 It has a yellow square and nothing else 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.790
 what follows is to give star 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.640
 here as you can see is in here 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.750
 start working what the team is and 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.770
 in the team it looks like a blue bar 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.130
 working and is giving all the 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.130
 advances 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.800
 It is very important not to move to 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.420
 nothing the team on this occasion so that 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.730
 not going to be seen to be disconnected 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.980
 since I just put it back in a brick 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.500
 that can be said to be worse than 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.820
 state in which you are currently pausing 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.290
 the video what the process ends 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.080
 it really is a process that is a 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.340
 running about five minutes and 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.260
 Well back to pawns 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.060
 finished good as you can see the 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.990
 determined process as I mentioned them is 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.960
 a process that lasts approximately 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.220
 five minutes and a half up in part 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.990
 superior will know that he did well with tell 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.270
 peace in the same way the team will 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.720
 will restart and will have on this screen in 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.250
 doubt is staying with the new this 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.530
 navarro without any problem again 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.209
 it will be done here what you already 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.670
 can close once I say peace without 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.380
 no worry and the team should already 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.790
 restart without any problem like 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.080
 can see here is already starting 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.550
 again like the people of 7500 l 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.230
 here is starting as you 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.270
 I mentioned on this occasion well then only 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.790
 It was the rom of samsung 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.210
 in a lane you gave him applications 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.920
 more, and that's how the 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.720
 team really how to know when it 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.450
 they started the barrÃ³n, well, it's a 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.910
 start somewhat late we expected to enter 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.530
 start without any problem and here 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.720
 We decided to wait so they can see 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.170
 that your phone starts without any 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.170
 problem 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.220
 they can no longer disconnect 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.720
 nothing happens 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.730
 here as you can see that it is going well 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.520
 the start because the buttons 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.960
 Capacitive has already been undertaken and this 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.670
 good that as you can see has started 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.990
 we can alternate the language we are going to 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.660
 look for our language that should be 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.160
 Spanish must be here in Spanish 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.750
 Spanish Spanish 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.780
 here is spanish usa 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.870
 and we press android to start 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.790
 in this case we will admit the most 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.700
 simply next 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.120
 we wait for everything to be well 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.110
 conscious also again 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.690
 let's wait until the start is finishing 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.190
 and ready then I think this is going to be 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.710
 first start as you can know then 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.640
 It is always late because because 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.840
 this is the most original round and so 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.300
 well here as you can see they are already 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.310
 all the widgets we can do a side 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.920
 and as you can see it is nothing more than 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.200
 the original rome without any problem 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:08.250
 as it should be if I'm not wrong is android 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.660
 2.3 points 6 but good if it is 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.330
 perceived as you can see then the 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.800
 phone has revived I know that I 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.800
 dismissal god
