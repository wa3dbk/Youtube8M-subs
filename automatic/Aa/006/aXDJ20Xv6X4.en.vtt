00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
don't this is like it says speed trials

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.250 
don't this is like it says speed trials
on<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.820> kind<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.840> speed<00:01:13.080> you're

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.600 

one<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.630> thing<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.250> helps<00:01:29.399> to

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
one of the thing is I think it helps to

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.399

not<00:01:29.820> tell<00:01:30.210> people<00:01:30.509> their<00:01:30.689> yardage<00:01:31.049> because

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
not tell people their yardage because

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.929 
not tell people their yardage because

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
they start trying to swing harder and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.249 
they start trying to swing harder and
you<00:01:33.060> guys<00:01:33.179> know<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.570> stuff<00:01:33.810> better<00:01:33.929> than<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
you guys know this stuff better than I

you guys know this stuff better than I
do<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.619> that's<00:01:35.220> one<00:01:35.429> a<00:01:35.460> little<00:01:35.909> tip<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.390> kind

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
do but that's one a little tip we kind

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.300 
do but that's one a little tip we kind
of<00:01:36.689> got<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> fitting<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.439> let<00:01:38.100> them<00:01:38.189> see

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
of got of the fitting is let them see

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.679 
of got of the fitting is let them see
the<00:01:38.399> yardage<00:01:38.729> at<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> end<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.360> show<00:01:39.569> them

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the yardage at the end you can show them

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:57.290 
the yardage at the end you can show them
on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> screen<00:01:40.079> but

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.910 

wow<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.940> soliton<00:01:59.960> still<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.410> hottest<00:02:01.560> doe

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
wow that soliton still the hottest doe

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.980 
wow that soliton still the hottest doe
averaged<00:02:02.660> but<00:02:03.660> if<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.050> can<00:02:05.900> didn't<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:06.960> just

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
averaged but if you can didn't you just

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.260 
averaged but if you can didn't you just
hit<00:02:07.350> my<00:02:07.530> breath<00:02:07.770> or<00:02:07.920> nothing<00:02:14.000> that's<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> most

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
hit my breath or nothing that's the most

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.800 
hit my breath or nothing that's the most
action<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.780> average<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.500> two<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.710> 253<00:02:17.810> 255

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
action the average of the two is 253 255

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.690 
action the average of the two is 253 255
so<00:02:19.260> again<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.070> wouldn't<00:02:20.220> be<00:02:20.340> telling<00:02:20.550> this

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
so again you wouldn't be telling this

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.340 
so again you wouldn't be telling this
along<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> ways<00:02:21.210> but<00:02:21.390> that's<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.660> 2-yard<00:02:22.110> game

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
along the ways but that's a 2-yard game

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.050 
along the ways but that's a 2-yard game
with<00:02:22.530> driver<00:02:24.380> um<00:02:25.380> one<00:02:25.980> thing<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.280> found<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.790> just

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
with driver um one thing I found to just

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.310 
with driver um one thing I found to just
again<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> little<00:02:27.600> point<00:02:27.870> whether<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:28.200> our

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
again a little point whether it's our
