00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
now you can see that it looks almost

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.450

like<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.720> stained<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:34.979> were<00:01:35.070> wondering

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
like it's stained and we were wondering

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.980 
like it's stained and we were wondering
about<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.820> at<00:01:35.970> first<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.540> does<00:01:36.840> have

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
about that at first because it does have

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.380 
about that at first because it does have
this<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.350> variation<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.220> color<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.820> don't

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
this little variation of color I don't

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.760 
this little variation of color I don't
know<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.380> there<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
know if you can see it on there but I

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.440 
know if you can see it on there but I
think<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.579> make<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.759> look<00:01:41.880> wet<00:01:42.210> it's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
think it's just to make it look wet it's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.179 
think it's just to make it look wet it's
just<00:01:42.899> adding<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.439> bit<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.649> dimension

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
just adding a little bit of dimension

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.260 
just adding a little bit of dimension
it's<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.520> actually<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.060> stain<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:48.000> kind<00:01:48.210> of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it's not actually a stain so it kind of

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.670 
it's not actually a stain so it kind of
looks<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.630> she<00:01:48.810> drooled<00:01:49.079> on<00:01:49.170> herself<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
looks like she drooled on herself a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.760 
looks like she drooled on herself a
little<00:01:49.799> bit<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:50.250> alright<00:01:51.500> anyway<00:01:52.500> there<00:01:52.680> are

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
little bit here alright anyway there are

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.710 
little bit here alright anyway there are
three<00:01:52.950> colors<00:01:53.280> there<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.939> orange<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
three colors there was the orange the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.780 
three colors there was the orange the
blue<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.860> was<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.070> blue<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.520> green

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
blue I think it was like blue and green

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.740 
blue I think it was like blue and green

you could probably find this on Amazon I

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.720 
you could probably find this on Amazon I

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
changes to green this one does and then

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.449
