00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:22.470
 Hello, Director of Life Studies 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.950
 Kim, Jong - Soo is in this time titled Bo asks hot temperatures life course 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.910
 I'll tell you. 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:33.290
 Etnal severe gastrointestinal disease in etnal 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:40.220
 A psalmist is trying to fix gastrointestinal diseases 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:46.550
 I've spent my time in a room, I've lost all my property and my contract is free. 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:52.640
 I could not solve it , so I went into the mountain to die while I was suffering. 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:59.030
 As I entered the mountains, the day darkened and I was lost. 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:05.360
 I have lost my way, and I have fallen, and I have been wounded, thirsty, 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:09.650
 I ran into the hot springs while searching for water 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:16.340
 So I drank the hot water and took a bath in the hot water. 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.990
 Legend tells about each source of gastrointestinal and skin care 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.960
 We are 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.350
 What does this mean? 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.979
 And Yang Ji-seop Once Today 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.210
 I pay for the effects of the ingredients on the whole , 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:40.000
 I want to talk about hot water. 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:44.890
 Everyone watches, hears, hears, moves, sends out energy in his belly. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:51.070
 When I was young, I could spend a long time with a strong book. 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:56.680
 The fatness and the stress that accumulates in the bowels, 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:03.130
 So when I spend a lot of time on my stomach, 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:08.140
 This occurred while trying to write in a car luggage stand this pain is caused gastrointestinal diseases 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:12.370
 When I was young, my mother expressed 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:18.760
 My son is so nervous that my head is coming up. 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:24.630
 As the icicles opportunities going belly is written in the book value of living in the country 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:31.980
 It is natural that you can look for good health 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:37.350
 The things that are attributed to it are cumulative and disguised. 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.640
 And I do not have that aura belly garage As such, if the sheet is bent standing Meridian 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.090
 In a kick 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:48.780
 And there is no energy difference between the cycle again while the advent of the disease lives in the stomach and a cold Gin 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:55.050
 The energy of the two pushing the heat in the body 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:03:01.200
 It is not possible to go up because the meridian of the iron is clogged up. 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:07.500
 It is the nature of nature to have 10 skin lesions on the site . 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:11.190
 This rotting in godalpeum insaenggil as the cumulative dwaeseo L 1 internal injuries to the stomach itself 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:18.420
 Ttaenga can come plain field will not only 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:25.010
 However, the cold and dying body is bathed in the hot spring water and the source water 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:27.510
 As you get cold, your stomach becomes warm and your circulation becomes warm. 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.840
 The gastrointestinal tract is gone. 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:36.900
 It is a circulation that the ubiquitous warmth becomes warm . 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.980
 It was delivered to the skin, and the skin was clean and the wound was restored . 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.410
 It is. 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:50.910
 So the car was caused by cold stomach books on stomach and skin diseases. 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:53.620
 Because hot springs supplement the life temperature, gastrointestinal diseases and 12 bottles 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:04:00.099
 I think it's solved. 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:02.760
 This is not a life of world knowledge of today's theory but a reality that solves real problems 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.760
 It will be the world 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:14.470
 For a while, the boiled water in Korea is good for death water 1 morning drinking water 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:19.880
 Good water hexagonal water is good brain, good tea 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:24.050
 Media broadcasting scholars have made a choice. 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:29.270
 Then I cried alone 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.949
 To derive life temperature, drink hot tea alone to get hot 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.710
 I cried 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:39.199
 The result is that people who drink cold water 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:46.070
 Neck books are cool, but afterwards chill As the circulation in the stomach 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:51.350
 Pour doedaga obesity include subscription and eventually your body going cold. 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:52.700

 Oh continue to drink your hot water in the boat fell swelling tummy tuck this in a class 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:04.100
 Swallowing and falling 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:09.110
 I feel warm and comfortable in my stomach. 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.180
 Before the Fourth Lecture, there was a lecture at the University of Sungkyunkwan University 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:17.720
 In front of the mobile tanks 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:20.960
 I went to the bath and a lady at the counter noticed me. 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:26.139
 Lift up the spring bottle under the counter 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:32.439
 I am comfortable with rewriting and say hello to my nose . 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:35.110
 Also , since I am a college student, I have been in the mountain for 40 years 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:40.360
 I went to the mountain. 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:46.810
 There are three meetings while living in the mountains 20 years, much effort has to Bukhansan cares 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:52.060
 Once upon a time ... and it was what people come to the mountains and the flat coverage mandeogunyo 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:57.660
 There are a lot of floss like this, but apart from reality, I solve 7 problems. 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:05.020
 It's not a theory that can not be done, but if a lot of people live and cool in my warmth 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:06.280
 Life of Mother Nature to die I have people who believe in Hondoichi 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.880
 That's right. 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.880
