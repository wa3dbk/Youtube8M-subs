mentos and the four inch size works
really<00:00:41.479> well<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.900> only<00:00:41.989> problem<00:00:42.440> is<00:00:42.559> because

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
really well the only problem is because

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:44.560 
really well the only problem is because
the<00:00:43.280> water<00:00:43.519> temperature<00:00:43.879> is<00:00:44.030> cold<00:00:44.330> for

the water temperature is cold for

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.060 
the water temperature is cold for
example<00:00:44.930> today<00:00:45.049> the<00:00:45.290> water<00:00:45.470> temperature<00:00:45.799> was

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
example today the water temperature was

example today the water temperature was
52<00:00:46.610> degrees<00:00:46.760> Fahrenheit<00:00:47.570> which<00:00:47.989> is<00:00:48.199> pretty

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
52 degrees Fahrenheit which is pretty

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.560 
52 degrees Fahrenheit which is pretty
cold<00:00:48.739> a<00:00:49.040> lot<00:00:49.489> of<00:00:49.519> the<00:00:49.670> walleyes<00:00:50.059> will<00:00:50.239> grab<00:00:50.420> the

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
cold a lot of the walleyes will grab the

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.030 
cold a lot of the walleyes will grab the
back<00:00:50.720> of<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:50.989> grub<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:51.320> you<00:00:51.440> actually<00:00:51.559> feel

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
back of the grub and you actually feel

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.799 
back of the grub and you actually feel
them<00:00:52.309> on<00:00:52.489> for<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.820> split<00:00:53.000> second<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:53.659> either

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
them on for a split second and either

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.410

my rubber tubing and my hook so all I

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.599 
my rubber tubing and my hook so all I
would<00:02:05.179> do<00:02:05.329> is<00:02:05.359> take<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.319> would<00:02:07.009> peer<00:02:07.310> set

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
would do is take that I would peer set

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.460 
would do is take that I would peer set
through<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.270> hook<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.810> rubber<00:02:08.959> tubing

through the hook the rubber tubing

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.840 
through the hook the rubber tubing
stretches<00:02:10.100> so<00:02:10.190> it's<00:02:10.340> not<00:02:10.490> going<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.729> go

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
stretches so it's not going to go

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.250 
stretches so it's not going to go
anywhere<00:02:11.120> see<00:02:11.569> how<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.750> stays<00:02:11.959> right<00:02:12.200> there

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
anywhere see how it stays right there

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.950 
anywhere see how it stays right there

real if I take my finger off my real

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.470 
real if I take my finger off my real
would<00:05:04.710> fall<00:05:04.919> off<00:05:04.950> so<00:05:05.310> I'm<00:05:05.370> just<00:05:05.520> going<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:05.730> move

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
would fall off so I'm just going to move

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.230 
would fall off so I'm just going to move
that<00:05:06.720> back<00:05:06.960> down<00:05:07.200> when<00:05:07.889> I<00:05:07.919> have<00:05:08.280> my<00:05:08.580> hand<00:05:09.030> on

monofilament<00:05:30.650> diameter<00:05:31.650> I've<00:05:32.310> got<00:05:32.580> a<00:05:32.610> couple

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
monofilament diameter I've got a couple

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.700 
monofilament diameter I've got a couple
of<00:05:33.150> rods<00:05:33.360> here<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:33.840> are<00:05:33.960> split<00:05:34.290> grip<00:05:34.440> and

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
of rods here that are split grip and

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.409 
of rods here that are split grip and
I'll<00:05:34.770> just<00:05:34.950> show<00:05:35.130> you<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.340> difference<00:05:35.760> this

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
I'll just show you the difference this

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.050 
I'll just show you the difference this
is<00:05:36.479> my<00:05:36.810> bait<00:05:37.050> caster<00:05:37.650> that's<00:05:38.310> right<00:05:38.520> here<00:05:38.880> and

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
is my bait caster that's right here and

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.600 
is my bait caster that's right here and
you<00:05:39.600> can<00:05:39.750> see<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:39.930> it's<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.470> split<00:05:40.800> grip<00:05:40.979> these

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
you can see that it's a split grip these

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.480 
you can see that it's a split grip these
particular<00:05:42.120> ones<00:05:42.150> are<00:05:42.660> called<00:05:42.870> X<00:05:43.290> grip<00:05:44.190> and

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
particular ones are called X grip and

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.400 
particular ones are called X grip and
then<00:05:45.180> I've<00:05:45.300> got<00:05:45.330> another<00:05:45.750> one<00:05:45.990> which<00:05:46.200> is<00:05:46.229> a

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
then I've got another one which is a

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.740 
then I've got another one which is a
little<00:05:46.620> bit<00:05:46.860> higher<00:05:47.190> end<00:05:47.580> it's<00:05:47.940> more<00:05:48.180> modulus

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
little bit higher end it's more modulus

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.230 
little bit higher end it's more modulus
it's<00:05:48.930> called<00:05:49.140> a<00:05:49.260> TS<00:05:49.740> two<00:05:50.160> and<00:05:50.700> you<00:05:50.940> can<00:05:51.120> see

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
it's called a TS two and you can see

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.570 
it's called a TS two and you can see
that<00:05:51.390> it's<00:05:51.539> also<00:05:51.750> split<00:05:52.260> grip<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:53.010> if<00:05:53.130> I<00:05:53.280> turn

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
that it's also split grip and if I turn

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.580 
that it's also split grip and if I turn
to<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:53.910> front<00:05:54.060> of<00:05:54.300> it<00:05:54.419> you<00:05:54.450> can<00:05:54.780> see<00:05:55.020> that<00:05:55.260> even

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
to the front of it you can see that even

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.130 
to the front of it you can see that even
where<00:05:56.520> you<00:05:56.669> have<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.240> front<00:05:57.479> that's<00:05:57.720> a<00:05:57.870> cork

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
where you have the front that's a cork

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.529 
where you have the front that's a cork
handle<00:05:58.620> notice<00:05:59.250> how<00:05:59.370> they've<00:05:59.580> taken<00:05:59.820> out<00:06:00.150> some

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
handle notice how they've taken out some

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.150 
handle notice how they've taken out some
of<00:06:00.660> the<00:06:00.720> metal<00:06:01.080> so<00:06:01.470> it<00:06:01.530> almost<00:06:01.710> looks<00:06:01.979> like<00:06:02.070> a

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
of the metal so it almost looks like a

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.469 
of the metal so it almost looks like a
gear<00:06:02.520> in<00:06:02.640> there<00:06:02.880> that's<00:06:03.090> just<00:06:03.270> to<00:06:03.360> increase

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
gear in there that's just to increase

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.900 
gear in there that's just to increase
the<00:06:03.780> sensitivity<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.919> the<00:06:04.950> same<00:06:05.310> thing<00:06:05.640> the

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
the sensitivity and the same thing the

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.820 
the sensitivity and the same thing the
blank<00:06:06.180> is<00:06:06.419> right<00:06:06.630> under<00:06:06.960> here<00:06:07.200> and<00:06:07.350> then<00:06:07.680> it's

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
blank is right under here and then it's

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.250 
blank is right under here and then it's
of<00:06:08.039> course<00:06:08.280> it's<00:06:08.490> split<00:06:08.760> grip<00:06:08.850> at<00:06:09.090> the<00:06:09.180> back<00:06:09.360> so

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
of course it's split grip at the back so

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.540 
of course it's split grip at the back so
if<00:06:10.320> you<00:06:10.410> look<00:06:10.500> at<00:06:10.650> all<00:06:10.770> three<00:06:10.950> of<00:06:11.039> these<00:06:11.250> split

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
if you look at all three of these split

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.340 
if you look at all three of these split
grip<00:06:11.729> rods<00:06:12.090> you'll<00:06:12.479> notice<00:06:12.810> that<00:06:12.840> some<00:06:13.200> are<00:06:13.229> a

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
grip rods you'll notice that some are a

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.469 
grip rods you'll notice that some are a
little<00:06:13.380> bit<00:06:13.710> longer<00:06:13.950> the<00:06:14.760> back<00:06:14.970> here<00:06:15.300> so<00:06:15.419> you

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
little bit longer the back here so you

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:16.730 
little bit longer the back here so you
got<00:06:15.570> a<00:06:15.600> little<00:06:15.690> bit<00:06:15.870> more<00:06:15.990> of<00:06:16.139> a<00:06:16.229> fighting<00:06:16.470> but

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
got a little bit more of a fighting but

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.650 
got a little bit more of a fighting but
some<00:06:17.250> a<00:06:17.280> little<00:06:17.490> bit<00:06:17.729> shorter<00:06:18.150> so<00:06:18.330> this<00:06:18.479> one's

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
some a little bit shorter so this one's

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.770 
some a little bit shorter so this one's
the<00:06:18.780> shortest<00:06:19.289> medium<00:06:20.160> length<00:06:20.430> longer<00:06:21.060> okay

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
the shortest medium length longer okay

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.870 
the shortest medium length longer okay
the<00:06:22.229> longer<00:06:22.590> it<00:06:22.620> is<00:06:22.770> the<00:06:22.830> more<00:06:23.130> you<00:06:23.340> can<00:06:23.580> put<00:06:23.789> it

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
the longer it is the more you can put it

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.550 
the longer it is the more you can put it
on<00:06:24.000> your<00:06:24.150> arm<00:06:24.210> when<00:06:24.600> it<00:06:24.750> comes<00:06:24.960> to<00:06:25.139> setting<00:06:25.470> the

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
on your arm when it comes to setting the

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.890 
on your arm when it comes to setting the
hook

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:29.900 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.480 

so<00:06:30.900> the<00:06:31.020> first<00:06:31.290> thing<00:06:31.410> I<00:06:31.620> tell<00:06:31.830> parents<00:06:32.250> is

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
so the first thing I tell parents is

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.820 
so the first thing I tell parents is
that<00:06:32.550> when<00:06:32.940> they<00:06:33.060> buy<00:06:33.270> a<00:06:33.540> fishing<00:06:33.930> outfit<00:06:34.500> for

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
that when they buy a fishing outfit for

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.580 
that when they buy a fishing outfit for
kids<00:06:35.100> they<00:06:35.910> should<00:06:36.150> consider<00:06:36.630> how<00:06:36.930> tall<00:06:37.320> the

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
kids they should consider how tall the

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.920 
kids they should consider how tall the

just a minute okay for example for a
girl<00:06:43.590> your<00:06:44.130> size<00:06:44.630> this<00:06:45.630> would<00:06:45.840> be<00:06:46.020> the<00:06:46.320> longest

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
girl your size this would be the longest

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.950 
girl your size this would be the longest
rod<00:06:47.040> you<00:06:47.220> should<00:06:47.460> be<00:06:47.580> using<00:06:47.820> not<00:06:48.330> longer<00:06:48.840> and

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
rod you should be using not longer and

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.750 
rod you should be using not longer and
this<00:06:49.080> rod<00:06:49.320> is<00:06:49.350> probably<00:06:49.919> about<00:06:50.190> five<00:06:50.490> feet

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760

this rod is probably about five feet
long<00:06:50.840> this<00:06:51.840> rod<00:06:52.110> is<00:06:52.139> a<00:06:52.290> little<00:06:52.620> bit<00:06:52.740> shorter

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540 
kids that they should get rods that are

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.689 
kids that they should get rods that are
about<00:06:57.900> their<00:06:58.229> height<00:06:58.500> is<00:06:59.070> because<00:06:59.520> when

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699 
about their height is because when

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:01.430 
about their height is because when
you're<00:06:59.880> fishing<00:07:00.150> with<00:07:00.449> the<00:07:00.600> fishing<00:07:00.960> rod<00:07:00.990> like
