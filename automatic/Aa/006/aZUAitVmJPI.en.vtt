I<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:52.770> installing<00:01:53.340> these<00:01:53.460> cases

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I don't like installing these cases

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.880 
I don't like installing these cases
there's<00:01:54.240> such<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.540> pain<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.229> terms<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.649> build

there's such a pain in terms of build
quality<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.729> both<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.090> these<00:01:57.149> cases<00:01:57.450> again

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
quality so both of these cases again

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.020 
quality so both of these cases again
skipped<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> rock<00:01:59.100> through<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.000> a

and<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> screen<00:02:44.580> protector<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.570> piece

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
and the screen protector is just a piece

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.150 
and the screen protector is just a piece
of<00:02:45.780> plastic<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.350> when<00:02:46.590> compared<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
extreme comes out on top now the only

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.730 
extreme comes out on top now the only
score<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.090> ce1180<00:02:51.390> did<00:02:52.080> better<00:02:52.290> was<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
score that the ce1180 did better was the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.040 
score that the ce1180 did better was the
environmental<00:02:53.459> resistance<00:02:53.760> test<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.510> both<00:02:55.020> of

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
environmental resistance test so both of

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.870 
environmental resistance test so both of
these<00:02:55.260> things<00:02:55.709> suck<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.070> water<00:02:56.280> like<00:02:56.459> nobody's

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
these things suck in water like nobody's

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.160 
these things suck in water like nobody's
business<00:02:57.060> but<00:02:57.240> this<00:02:57.540> one<00:02:57.690> keeps<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.020> water

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
business but this one keeps the water

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.560 
business but this one keeps the water
out<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.860> little<00:02:59.130> longer<00:02:59.370> now<00:02:59.970> as<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.209> side

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
out just a little longer now as a side

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.960 
out just a little longer now as a side
note<00:03:00.600> if<00:03:01.080> your<00:03:01.560> device<00:03:01.709> was<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.250> get<00:03:02.430> wet<00:03:02.640> wad

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
note if your device was to get wet wad

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.660 
note if your device was to get wet wad
and<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.510> have<00:03:03.660> water<00:03:03.840> inside<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:05.459> one

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and you have water inside of it this one

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.699 
and you have water inside of it this one
would<00:03:05.820> be<00:03:05.850> slightly<00:03:06.570> easier<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.380> take<00:03:07.530> out

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
would be slightly easier to take out

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.199 
would be slightly easier to take out
only<00:03:07.860> because<00:03:08.190> there's<00:03:08.370> four<00:03:08.820> screws<00:03:09.180> and

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
only because there's four screws and

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.680 
only because there's four screws and
this<00:03:09.540> one<00:03:09.720> has<00:03:09.930> six<00:03:10.580> not<00:03:11.580> quite<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.120> huge<00:03:12.420> one

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
this one has six not quite a huge one

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.990 
this one has six not quite a huge one
but<00:03:12.900> again<00:03:13.020> water<00:03:13.860> resistance<00:03:14.370> environmental

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
but again water resistance environmental

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.990 
but again water resistance environmental
resistance<00:03:15.209> goes<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.020> pelican<00:03:16.500> ce1180

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
resistance goes to the pelican ce1180

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.910 
resistance goes to the pelican ce1180
now<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.060> last<00:03:18.300> category<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.170> handling

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
now the last category is the handling

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.040 
now the last category is the handling
and<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.190> lunatic<00:03:20.910> tactic<00:03:21.269> extreme<00:03:21.660> comes<00:03:21.930> out

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
and the lunatic tactic extreme comes out

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.290 
and the lunatic tactic extreme comes out
on<00:03:22.140> top<00:03:22.380> if<00:03:22.650> you're<00:03:22.860> an<00:03:22.980> iPhone<00:03:23.220> gamer<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:24.150> is

on top if you're an iPhone gamer this is

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.780 
on top if you're an iPhone gamer this is
a<00:03:24.330> really<00:03:24.660> nice<00:03:24.840> case<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.440> use<00:03:25.650> because<00:03:25.860> it's<00:03:26.700> a

a really nice case to use because it's a

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.040 
a really nice case to use because it's a
little<00:03:27.030> larger<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:27.600> got<00:03:27.720> all<00:03:27.900> these

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
little larger and it's got all these

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.720 
little larger and it's got all these
ridges<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.739> materials<00:03:29.220> kind<00:03:29.400> of<00:03:29.459> rubbery

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
ridges and the materials kind of rubbery

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.550 
ridges and the materials kind of rubbery
so<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.090> can<00:03:30.209> hold<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.810> little<00:03:30.930> longer<00:03:31.350> and

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
so you can hold it a little longer and

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.949 
so you can hold it a little longer and
for<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.860> pelican<00:03:32.280> ce1180<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.360> handling

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
for the pelican ce1180 the handling

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.530 
for the pelican ce1180 the handling
isn't<00:03:34.800> awful<00:03:35.459> but<00:03:35.820> it's<00:03:35.940> definitely<00:03:36.090> not<00:03:36.360> as

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
isn't awful but it's definitely not as

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.870 
isn't awful but it's definitely not as
good<00:03:36.750> as<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.930> lunatic<00:03:37.350> tactic<00:03:37.739> extreme<00:03:38.190> again
