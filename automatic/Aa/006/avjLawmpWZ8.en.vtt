on or log off virus it's basically a

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.010

virus that logs you you log on to your

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.170 
virus that logs you you log on to your
splash<00:00:34.440> screen<00:00:34.829> as<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.160> go<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> log<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
splash screen as you go to log in and it

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.580 
splash screen as you go to log in and it
will<00:00:36.329> look<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> straight<00:00:36.630> off<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.290> shut<00:00:37.500> your

will look you straight off and shut your
PC<00:00:38.070> down<00:00:38.309> now<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.329> may<00:00:39.540> think<00:00:39.570> going<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
PC down now you may think going in the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
PC down now you may think going in the
safe<00:00:40.500> mode<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> save<00:00:41.399> your<00:00:41.550> bacon

safe mode is going to save your bacon

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.030 
safe mode is going to save your bacon
but<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.629> ain't<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.440> forward<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:43.950> as

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
but it ain't because they forward out as

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.440 
but it ain't because they forward out as
well<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.610> will<00:00:44.730> lock<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.000> straight<00:00:45.270> off

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
well and it will lock you straight off

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.260 
well and it will lock you straight off
same<00:00:46.350> as<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> administration<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.789> try<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> log

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270

same as a administration you try to log
in<00:00:48.390> administration<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.860> won't<00:00:50.070> let<00:00:50.460> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
in administration and it won't let you

to do it administrator I should say no

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.770 
to do it administrator I should say no
administration<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.480> lock<00:00:54.600> you

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
administration and it will lock you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.420 
administration and it will lock you

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.479 
straight off I want to show you a quick
video<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.180> found<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.600> YouTube<00:00:58.100> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.309> log

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
video what I found on YouTube of the log

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.750 
video what I found on YouTube of the log
on<00:01:00.230> log<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.410> logoff<00:01:01.710> virus<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.460> basically

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
on log on logoff virus and basically

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.429 
on log on logoff virus and basically
this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:05.450> as<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.840> clicked<00:01:07.290> on

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
this is it here as you see clicked on

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
this is it here as you see clicked on
the<00:01:07.560> login<00:01:07.920> part<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:09.020> it's<00:01:10.020> logged<00:01:10.260> in

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the login part and it's logged in

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.200 
the login part and it's logged in
straight<00:01:10.740> off<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.600> will<00:01:12.780> constantly

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
straight off and that will constantly

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.340 
straight off and that will constantly
constantly<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.080> not<00:01:16.200> be<00:01:16.290> able

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
constantly do that you will not be able

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.710 
constantly do that you will not be able
to<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.460> log<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.850> log<00:01:18.509> off

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
to get in that is the log in log off

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
to get in that is the log in log off
virus<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.780> address<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.259> how<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.500> get

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
virus so and we address it how do we get

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800 
virus so and we address it how do we get
how<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.340> get<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.610> fixed<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.420> there's<00:01:24.600> two

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
how do we get that fixed so there's two

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.380 
how do we get that fixed so there's two
approaches<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.860> take<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:27.119> first

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
approaches that you can take the first

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.960 
approaches that you can take the first
one<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.740> take<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> hard<00:01:29.340> drive<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
one is to take the hard drive out the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.010 
one is to take the hard drive out the
machine<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:32.060> scan<00:01:33.060> put<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> into<00:01:33.930> another

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
machine and to scan put it into another

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.950 
machine and to scan put it into another
machine<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.060> actually<00:01:36.060> scan<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.780> PC<00:01:38.960> our

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
machine and actually scan that PC our

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.100 
machine and actually scan that PC our
drive<00:01:40.350> with<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.909> malwarebytes<00:01:42.049> now<00:01:43.049> you

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
drive with the malwarebytes now you

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.870 
drive with the malwarebytes now you
don't<00:01:43.320> need<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.500> scan<00:01:43.860> your<00:01:44.189> hard<00:01:44.220> drive<00:01:44.759> you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
don't need to scan your hard drive you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.370 
don't need to scan your hard drive you
need<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.149> scan<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.600> yard<00:01:45.780> drive<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.290> is

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
need to scan the yard drive that is

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.170 
need to scan the yard drive that is
infected<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.399> worry<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.850> not<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.119> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
infected don't worry it's not going to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.999 
infected don't worry it's not going to
copy<00:01:48.390> itself<00:01:48.750> across<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.290> your<00:01:49.409> hard<00:01:49.710> drive

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
copy itself across to your hard drive

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.310 
copy itself across to your hard drive
you<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.780> running

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
you just because it's it's not running

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.130 
you just because it's it's not running
it's<00:01:52.530> basically<00:01:53.009> sitting<00:01:53.549> there<00:01:54.140> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it's basically sitting there the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.899 
it's basically sitting there the
operating<00:01:55.680> systems<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.219> running<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.880> you

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
operating systems not running so you

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.789 
operating systems not running so you
just<00:01:57.180> scan<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.810> clean<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.140> that's<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
just scan it and clean it that's the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560 
just scan it and clean it that's the
best<00:01:59.009> way<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.219> get<00:01:59.579> rid<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.210> actual

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
best way to get rid of it the actual

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.200 
best way to get rid of it the actual
thing<00:02:00.829> now<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.890> may<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.310> another<00:02:02.670> PC<00:02:03.119> at

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
thing now you may not have another PC at

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.310 
thing now you may not have another PC at
your<00:02:03.329> disposal<00:02:04.520> so<00:02:05.719> that<00:02:06.719> leads<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.200> bit

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
you can use superantispyware so you can

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.449 
you can use superantispyware so you can

out and to try and find a plug-in that's
working<00:03:01.500> properly<00:03:01.709> with<00:03:02.670> this<00:03:02.910> another

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
working properly with this another

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.890 
working properly with this another
option<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.440> if<00:03:04.620> you've<00:03:04.980> got<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.310> USB<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.690> pre

option is if you've got the USB of a pre

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.120 
option is if you've got the USB of a pre

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
people I heard say yep just change just

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.300 
people I heard say yep just change just
fix<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.060> user<00:03:24.269> init<00:03:24.630> file<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.290> that's<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.829> but

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
fix the user init file and that's it but

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.740 
fix the user init file and that's it but
I<00:03:26.400> haven't<00:03:26.579> got<00:03:26.760> rid<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.060> actual<00:03:27.390> virus

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
I haven't got rid of the actual virus

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.210 
I haven't got rid of the actual virus
now<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.079> could<00:03:28.260> actually<00:03:28.410> copy<00:03:28.799> itself

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
now that could actually copy itself

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.800 
now that could actually copy itself
across<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:29.880> fact<00:03:30.090> that<00:03:30.269> file<00:03:30.510> straight

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
across and in fact that file straight

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.330 
across and in fact that file straight
again<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.350> could<00:03:31.470> began<00:03:31.709> ran<00:03:31.920> around<00:03:32.070> in

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
again and it could began ran around in

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.050 
again and it could began ran around in
circles<00:03:32.730> that's<00:03:33.269> why<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.510> say<00:03:33.810> cleaner<00:03:34.110> for

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
circles that's why I say cleaner for

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.520 
circles that's why I say cleaner for
infection<00:03:36.060> first<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.660> then<00:03:36.840> do<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.200> actual

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
infection first and then do the actual

how<00:04:09.000> do<00:04:09.060> we<00:04:09.299> fix<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.720> once<00:04:09.989> we've<00:04:10.260> got<00:04:10.500> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
how do we fix it once we've got the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.030 
how do we fix it once we've got the
actual<00:04:11.420> PC<00:04:12.420> cleaned

what<00:04:14.549> we<00:04:14.670> do<00:04:14.819> now<00:04:15.440> should<00:04:16.440> take<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> our<00:04:16.829> drive

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
what we do now should take the our drive

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.620 
what we do now should take the our drive
back<00:04:17.310> out<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.699> put<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:17.970> back<00:04:18.120> into<00:04:18.359> the
