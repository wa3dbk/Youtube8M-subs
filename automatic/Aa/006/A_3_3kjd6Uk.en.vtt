I'm<00:00:28.460> picking<00:00:28.790> up<00:00:29.000> multiple<00:00:29.180> maverick<00:00:29.810> signals

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
I'm picking up multiple maverick signals

I'm picking up multiple maverick signals
on<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:30.350> moon's<00:00:30.619> surface<00:00:30.890> what<00:00:31.730> is<00:00:32.000> this<00:00:32.300> I

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
on the moon's surface what is this I

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.639 
on the moon's surface what is this I
think<00:00:34.040> it's<00:00:34.190> Sigma

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
think it's Sigma

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.750 
think it's Sigma
how<00:00:36.190> can<00:00:36.370> you<00:00:36.460> tell<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:36.969> can<00:00:37.750> sense<00:00:37.989> it<00:00:38.110> soon<00:00:38.760> its

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
how can you tell I can sense it soon its

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.479 
how can you tell I can sense it soon its
