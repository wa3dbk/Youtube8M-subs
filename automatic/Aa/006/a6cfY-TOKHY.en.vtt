so<00:01:30.009> when<00:01:30.100> you<00:01:30.159> grind<00:01:30.340> an<00:01:30.520> attire<00:01:30.960> you've<00:01:31.960> got

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
so when you grind an attire you've got

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.480 
so when you grind an attire you've got
to<00:01:32.170> remember<00:01:32.380> which<00:01:32.680> edges<00:01:33.130> your<00:01:33.310> you

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
to remember which edges your you

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.090 
to remember which edges your you
actually<00:01:33.700> using<00:01:34.299> so<00:01:35.079> this<00:01:35.259> is<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.500> right<00:01:35.710> rear

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
actually using so this is the right rear

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.330 
actually using so this is the right rear
and<00:01:37.469> this<00:01:38.469> is<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.740> know<00:01:38.860> you<00:01:38.920> got<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.219> think

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
and this is you know you got to think

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.289 
and this is you know you got to think
about<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.729> way<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:39.909> spins<00:01:40.360> so<00:01:41.020> we<00:01:41.229> know<00:01:41.380> that

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
about the way it spins so we know that

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.859 
about the way it spins so we know that
this<00:01:43.299> edge<00:01:43.630> here<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:45.280> being<00:01:45.640> used<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.299> when

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
this edge here is being used and when

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.260 
this edge here is being used and when
you're<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:47.049> a<00:01:47.110> slide<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:48.009> edge<00:01:48.340> here<00:01:48.819> is

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
you're in a slide this edge here is

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.240 
you're in a slide this edge here is
being<00:01:50.049> used<00:01:51.149> alright<00:01:52.149> so<00:01:52.840> when<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.229> grind<00:01:53.530> you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
being used alright so when you grind you

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.370 
being used alright so when you grind you
want<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.460> ground<00:01:54.610> away<00:01:54.909> from<00:01:55.390> these<00:01:55.509> edges<00:01:55.869> you

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
want to ground away from these edges you

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.840 
want to ground away from these edges you
want<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.590> make<00:01:56.710> sure<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:57.039> your<00:01:57.219> grinder<00:01:57.670> is

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850

rotating in such a manner that's not

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.399 
rotating in such a manner that's not
going<00:02:01.509> against<00:02:01.750> these<00:02:01.929> edges<00:02:02.200> because<00:02:02.349> you

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
going against these edges because you

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.870 
going against these edges because you
don't<00:02:02.530> always<00:02:02.590> want<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.950> keep<00:02:03.069> these<00:02:03.280> squares

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
don't always want to keep these squares

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
grip in your tire all right so here I've

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.400 
grip in your tire all right so here I've
got<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.890> 1350<00:02:23.890> right<00:02:24.099> rear<00:02:24.310> narrow<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:25.410> 1300

right<00:02:26.769> rear<00:02:26.950> narrow<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.579> you<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.849> see<00:02:28.150> that

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
right rear narrow and you can see that

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.140 
right rear narrow and you can see that
the<00:02:28.569> group<00:02:28.810> very<00:02:29.019> similar<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:29.790> nature<00:02:30.790> like

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
the group very similar in nature like

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.920 
the group very similar in nature like
I've<00:02:31.930> got<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.140> 3<00:02:32.470> or<00:02:32.620> 2<00:02:32.769> and<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.010> 3<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.549> 3<00:02:33.970> 2<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> 3

I've got a 3 or 2 and a 3 a 3 2 and a 3
a<00:02:35.430> narrow<00:02:36.430> 3<00:02:36.790> I'll<00:02:36.970> say<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.329> this<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.660> wounded

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
a narrow 3 I'll say that this is wounded

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.199 
a narrow 3 I'll say that this is wounded
up<00:02:38.049> modified<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:39.190> it's<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.549> between<00:02:39.880> like<00:02:40.180> a

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
up modified just it's in between like a

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.860 
up modified just it's in between like a
2<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.660> 3<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.340> what<00:02:43.060> I've<00:02:43.150> done<00:02:43.299> here<00:02:43.359> is<00:02:43.660> I've

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
2 and a 3 so what I've done here is I've

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.860 
2 and a 3 so what I've done here is I've
sized<00:02:44.200> across<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.980> between<00:02:45.730> my<00:02:45.910> broken<00:02:46.630> blocks

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
sized across in between my broken blocks

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.420 
sized across in between my broken blocks
here<00:02:47.139> or<00:02:47.440> broke<00:02:47.709> them<00:02:47.859> in<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.040> middle<00:02:48.250> enough

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
here or broke them in the middle enough

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.970 
here or broke them in the middle enough
siped<00:02:48.730> in<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:48.970> middle<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.299> them<00:02:49.420> here<00:02:49.600> so<00:02:49.980> that

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
siped in the middle of them here so that

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.680 
siped in the middle of them here so that
way<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.430> can<00:02:51.670> try<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:51.940> generate<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.329> little<00:02:52.540> bit

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
way I can try to generate a little bit

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.390 
way I can try to generate a little bit
of<00:02:52.780> heat<00:02:52.959> because<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.799> tire<00:02:54.010> right<00:02:54.040> here

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
of heat because this tire right here

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.210 
of heat because this tire right here
where<00:02:55.180> we're<00:02:55.329> going<00:02:55.540> we<00:02:55.720> can't<00:02:55.930> run<00:02:56.079> a<00:02:56.109> 1300<00:02:56.799> so

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
where we're going we can't run a 1300 so

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.170 
where we're going we can't run a 1300 so
I<00:02:57.280> need<00:02:57.430> something<00:02:57.609> that's<00:02:57.850> going<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.060> be<00:02:58.150> a

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
I need something that's going to be a

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.759 
I need something that's going to be a
little<00:02:58.510> more<00:02:58.630> aggressive<00:02:58.750> in<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.350> water<00:02:59.560> you

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
little more aggressive in the water you

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.250 
little more aggressive in the water you
got<00:02:59.980> your<00:03:00.160> grooves<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:01.480> more<00:03:01.720> aggressive<00:03:02.170> it

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
got your grooves the more aggressive it

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.129 
got your grooves the more aggressive it
is<00:03:02.440> you<00:03:03.040> know<00:03:03.160> because<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.609> want<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.030> tire<00:03:04.269> to

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
is you know because you want the tire to

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.750 
is you know because you want the tire to
wear<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.440> little<00:03:05.920> bit<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.609> don't<00:03:06.670> want

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
wear a little bit you don't want

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.520 
wear a little bit you don't want
excessive<00:03:07.299> wear<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.480> you<00:03:07.690> don't<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:08.380> know

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
excessive wear and you don't you know

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.920 
excessive wear and you don't you know
it's<00:03:09.430> we're<00:03:09.730> minimums<00:03:10.389> where<00:03:10.630> you're<00:03:10.810> not

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
it's we're minimums where you're not

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.150 
it's we're minimums where you're not
generating<00:03:11.139> enough<00:03:11.530> heat<00:03:11.739> if<00:03:11.950> you're<00:03:12.040> not

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
generating enough heat if you're not

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.140 
generating enough heat if you're not
generating<00:03:12.280> enough<00:03:12.549> heat<00:03:12.819> in<00:03:12.910> your<00:03:12.940> tire

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150
