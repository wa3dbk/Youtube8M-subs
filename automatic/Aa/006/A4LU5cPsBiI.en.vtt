you never know I think I think that this

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.890 
you never know I think I think that this
is<00:02:42.440> gonna<00:02:42.680> be<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:42.980> more<00:02:43.400> realistic<00:02:43.940> approach<00:02:44.600> to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
is gonna be a more realistic approach to

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.990 
is gonna be a more realistic approach to
zombies<00:02:45.350> as<00:02:45.590> opposed<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.130> Trey<00:02:46.430> arcs<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:46.850> know

zombies as opposed to Trey arcs you know
mythical<00:02:47.600> or<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:48.170> have<00:02:48.740> a<00:02:48.830> feeling<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.220> it's

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
mythical or I have a feeling that it's

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.760 
mythical or I have a feeling that it's
gonna<00:02:49.550> be<00:02:49.670> more<00:02:49.970> realistic<00:02:50.480> than<00:02:50.960> you<00:02:51.470> know<00:02:51.590> we

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770

just<00:02:51.950> it's<00:02:52.340> as<00:02:52.490> simple<00:02:52.520> as<00:02:52.910> finding<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.510> cure

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
just it's as simple as finding the cure

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.070 
just it's as simple as finding the cure
and<00:02:54.110> it's<00:02:54.620> these<00:02:54.860> cure<00:02:55.610> ideas<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.840> are<00:02:56.960> gonna

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
and it's these cure ideas that are gonna

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.710 
and it's these cure ideas that are gonna
be<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:58.160> Easter<00:02:58.610> eggs<00:02:58.730> hopefully

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
thought if they have Easter eggs that's

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.490 
thought if they have Easter eggs that's
what<00:03:01.460> this<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.820> gonna<00:03:02.030> revolve<00:03:02.540> around<00:03:02.720> you

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
know finding parts doing things doing

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.770 
know finding parts doing things doing
tasks<00:03:06.530> killing<00:03:07.220> zombies<00:03:07.730> maybe<00:03:08.060> even<00:03:08.300> taking

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
tasks killing zombies maybe even taking

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.690 
tasks killing zombies maybe even taking
their<00:03:08.960> souls<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.590> don't<00:03:09.860> really<00:03:10.130> know<00:03:10.430> we'll

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
their souls I don't really know we'll

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.790 
their souls I don't really know we'll
just<00:03:10.910> have<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.180> find<00:03:11.210> out<00:03:11.630> but<00:03:12.230> I<00:03:12.260> think<00:03:12.380> that's

the<00:03:13.010> basic<00:03:13.730> gist<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.330> what<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.630> storyline<00:03:15.230> is

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
the basic gist of what the storyline is

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.630 
the basic gist of what the storyline is
going<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.590> be<00:03:15.740> I<00:03:15.950> think<00:03:16.280> we're<00:03:16.460> just<00:03:16.550> gonna

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640
