did a really really good job down the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.889 
did a really really good job down the
pace<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.590> really<00:02:04.890> good<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:06.299> hunting<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
pace is really good the hunting and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.690 
pace is really good the hunting and
everything<00:02:07.470> of<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> car<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.369> way<00:02:08.519> that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
everything of the car and the way that

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.089 
everything of the car and the way that
they<00:02:08.819> are<00:02:08.940> driving<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.479> seems<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.289> be<00:02:10.440> better

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
they are driving is seems to be better

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.680 
they are driving is seems to be better
and<00:02:11.340> better<00:02:11.550> now<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.090> think<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.510> it's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
and better now and I think that it's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:21.729 
and better now and I think that it's
really<00:02:12.780> good<00:02:13.170> for<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> future<00:02:20.390> very<00:02:21.390> happy

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
really good for the future very happy

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.620 
really good for the future very happy
why<00:02:22.739> podium<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.489> very<00:02:23.700> satisfying<00:02:23.910> but<00:02:24.480> when

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
why podium is very satisfying but when

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.479 
why podium is very satisfying but when
you<00:02:24.720> look<00:02:24.930> at<00:02:25.049> your<00:02:25.140> performance<00:02:25.799> against<00:02:26.400> the

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
you look at your performance against the

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.340 
you look at your performance against the
other<00:02:26.670> top<00:02:26.970> drivers<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.540> some<00:02:27.959> ways<00:02:28.140> maybe

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
other top drivers in some ways maybe

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.559 
other top drivers in some ways maybe
that's<00:02:28.620> more<00:02:28.980> satisfying<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:29.970> you're

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
that's more satisfying because you're

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.420 
that's more satisfying because you're
right<00:02:30.900> up<00:02:31.170> there<00:02:31.200> now<00:02:31.560> with<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.069> time<00:02:32.280> is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
right up there now with the time is

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.039 
right up there now with the time is
being<00:02:32.580> set<00:02:32.880> by<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.090> top<00:02:33.360> boys<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> silver

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.080 
being set by the top boys in the silver
2,000<00:02:34.590> cars<00:02:34.709> yeah<00:02:35.130> it's<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.489> very<00:02:35.670> good<00:02:35.880> time

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
2,000 cars yeah it's a very good time

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.580
