 already gamer work of equals 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.690
 the time frame and we will not read the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.790
 comment that we are very people 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.250
 exactly we were writing for 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.000
 nothing from many however we talk about 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.000
 circuit 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 if basically we are gods 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.039
 beach now i kind of would never be in a 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.960
 game however had a phase in which 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.300
 nasa really all children give themselves 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.880
 everyone sues the samp yes 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.730
 study tta exact gta is a piece of the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.750
 center put together to chase the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.570
 yesterday that was another, but I never have 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.280
 used cto sio notice I did it and 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.050
 they do to make you notice it's justin 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.430
 this is something I am ashamed of 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.110
 exact that the writer was a phase 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 gamer i put it 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.180
 and they bought me insights between them 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.329
 this was the mythical gamesource trigilia 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.329
 status of bb shark free thing 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.330
 I remember that among other things we are also 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.549
 busy because as if the problem 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.040
 that could not put the ds limited 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.320
 on ruby and then vanni answer 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.369
 we would move if I remember these things 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.630
 and then the moment of the action arrived 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.030
 sad replay 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.860
 the ex replay until i lost i am still 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.659
 if it was, it was my subconscious 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.820
 ganso tv episode thrown away and face us 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.140
 change the cartridge and the question which 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.360
 I don't know, he feels a certain satisfaction 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.090
 in being more immortal and win though 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.280
 then this thing passed if all then 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.640
 Mormon science bat was a kind of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.460
 power 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.409
 obviously we pokemon attempts that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.860
 now they are just real we also have 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:55.979
 passed a phase dr that by 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.130
 most secret secrets of the secrets of the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130
 lit 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.860
 those who are not as ever because the supermario 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.810
 supermoney city site from dwell on 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.869
 supermario but strange because that was 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.200
 for nothing new new super mario bros for 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.060
 ds new news for me when our nuts 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.130
 memories of a game of tenna neighbors and 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 it works because i'm something i don't know 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.730
 I think it is a considerable city from 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.370
 definitely the virtual console for i 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.980
 instant saves and news news 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.290
 damn not much, but I use them 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.700
 first in the first of the one for nes a 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.170
 we will be the truth consul because a 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.420
 beginning I entrusted myself remained thesis of 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.470
 play then when twice twice 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.140
 iwata 2 pro so 22 times look I have 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.400
 suffered sees of data deleted by themselves 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.080
 I decided that maybe not to use i 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.480
 Rescue Data resonance 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.950
 but then one thing leads to another and will like 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.750
 so now save the climate of the boss 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.030
 so were these kinds of things 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.750
 I 've never really finished the first z for 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.100
 nes 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.600
 also because I think it's impossible without it 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.270
 save because yes yes from zena is not 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.459

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.489
 I told him to go back to Sanremo via c 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.600
 suppose I remember we were there 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.880

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.600
 that surely from fashions 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:25.350
 this is also a birarda type thing 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.920
