00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.230
 Today we make soft cheese like 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.270
 recode why exactly like the thing in 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.299
 that the real river is 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.059
 well how to say a byproduct when 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.880
 the production of mozart ie italians 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.580
 first take the milk they add it all 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.680
 black enzyme get with motors and already 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.929
 serum based here's the remaining 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.710
 whey after mozzarella production 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:36.150
 they paint over lemon juice and they have 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.640
 it turns out a record because we have no 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.440
 we don't make mozzarella 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.790
 and black enzyme when it appears and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.070
 I will definitely try to do this 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.410
 interesting sir we make this one 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.900
 soft cheese based on regular milk 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.300
 Today I brought the milk will carry 2 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.830
 liter of milk in a saucepan morning milking 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.290
 it must be heated to 85 degrees and 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.060
 so we 'll need here two with 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.250
 half a liter of milk 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.760
 who brought me today from the village 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.300
 in fact it is morning milk 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:13.020
 must be heated to 80 to 85 degrees in 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.550
 milk add salt a teaspoon with 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.290
 small slide and mix well 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.640
 it should be noted that milk is necessary 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.410
 heat slowly 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.950
 that is, in this case, I have a stove 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.060
 costs average temperature 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.940
 and there will be a slow slow heat 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.970
 next we need lemon juice here 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.580
 so I took the juice of the four medium-sized 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.310
 lemons and need another saucepan 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.380
 and sieve grease gauze fold 2 times 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.520
 through this gauze hangs and we will 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.640
 filter our thickened milk and 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.300
 need another thermometer to measure 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.940
 milk temperature reached 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.300
 eighty seven degrees of this 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.450
 just turn off the stove and start 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.050
 pour lemon juice pouring in thin 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:17.209
 trickle 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:19.610
 and shuffle now begin 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.739
 turn away milk and now we 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:27.530
 remove from the stove so that it is no longer 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:32.260
 warmed we cover with a towel and we cover 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:37.390
 lid and now the milk should cool and 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:41.060
 Here it is time to start paying 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.040
 take the soft cheese estimates 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:49.820
 skimmer sieve and gauze folded in half and 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:56.959
 get out carefully get the resulting 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:59.150
 cheese and laid at all that is 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.530
 milk is good 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.799
 This amount of cheese and now need to give 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.950
 water will flow but one important point 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.360
 too much water is not allowed glass 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.150
 here is the main thing to catch such a moment 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:19.370
 because if a lot of water goes through 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:21.260
 cheesecloth will be dry too 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.650
 to control a little bit of taste 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.940
 to suit your own taste after 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.340
 after the water runs out 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.400
 cheese must be shifted to the cup 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.959
 cool it 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.500
 for temperature and put in 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.599
 refrigerator yesterday we started the process 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.340
 production of home soft 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.689
 today it ended got out 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.650
 refrigerator son may have turned 350 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:49.319
 grams of such a wonderful cheese and 2 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.030
 liter serum 40 can be used 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.170
 for cooking some pancakes 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.909
 principle dilute it as if the case 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.099
 today we have a breakfast here 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:05.420
 wonderful 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:07.109
 try what came out very tasty and 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.450
 now this wonderful 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:13.200
 natural homemade soft cheese which 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.280
 we prepared ourselves can eat just 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.010
 so you can add here like greens 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.690
 you can add here honey sulfur well that is 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.210
 how do you cook some dish 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.729
 which will be to your taste or will it be 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.169
 dessert or will it be like something 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.169
