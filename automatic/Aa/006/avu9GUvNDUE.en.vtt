00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.140
 supporting the eternal ice in motion light 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.060
 move on the Heckertux Glacier 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.220
 glaciers move mankind already 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.710
 for centuries at the backertuxer 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.320
 Glaciers are about 60 feet high 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.290
 on details the ice masses are moving 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.390
 with about 5 to 15 meters per year 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.689
 we only see the two in the background 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.599
 drag lifts price and 2 we are there 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:33.460
 dig up the seats again 19 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.060
 to set up and the whole with 2 million 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.340
 do 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.400
 due to the glacier hike we 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.969
 yes, yes, all glacier moves 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.739
 props stand on ice and have to 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.829
 Of course, readjusted again and again 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.829
 become 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.149
 while propping up with the guests 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.339
 The first thing you need is the piste equipment 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.110
 push the bulk of the snow away and 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.710
 then the dredge came and did that 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.439
 feinschliff 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.700
 So say a good level so that 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.700
 Pieces are perfect again 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.900
 the lift will be supported by 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.810
 trained cable car employees 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.220
 both the optimal horizontal as well 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.220
 nati bald position brought 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.210
 due to the location and precipitation 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.240
 the bases are different deep 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.119
 in the deep depends entirely on it running 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.770
 on precipitation so what snow there 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.770
 they can it she shuttles them 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.090
 between two meters and even five times 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.030
 meters of fresh snow 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.399
 then you have to give it away with mine 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.780
 get support free and then you can 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.200
 lace on top of it again 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.200
 new snow 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.970
 on the one hand, measuring supports used 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.750
 one of the elite that is the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.870
 Optical measuring device will differ 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.880
 can detect lateral deviation 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.840
 and afterwards the straightforwardness of the 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.840
 restore rope 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.950
 the lift will be based on the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.020
 correct measurement again with snow 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.150
 showered and the plant came the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.150
 resume regular operation
