this device for if swelling applications
store<00:00:51.519> in<00:00:51.670> picture<00:00:51.940> we'll<00:00:52.120> use<00:00:52.239> another<00:00:52.360> data

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
store in picture we'll use another data

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.689 
store in picture we'll use another data
there<00:00:53.320> is<00:00:53.350> no<00:00:53.470> other<00:00:53.830> partition<00:00:54.280> for<00:00:54.430> all<00:00:54.549> the

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
device is very good so sound wise I can

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.280 
device is very good so sound wise I can
say<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:12.970> this<00:03:13.090> device<00:03:13.389> has<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.780> best<00:03:13.989> effect

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
say that this device has the best effect

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.780 
say that this device has the best effect
because<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.920> loudspeaker<00:03:15.310> is<00:03:15.400> actually<00:03:15.700> on

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
because the loudspeaker is actually on

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.030 
because the loudspeaker is actually on
the<00:03:15.909> front<00:03:16.090> grille<00:03:16.389> which<00:03:16.959> makes<00:03:17.349> them<00:03:17.590> pretty

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
the front grille which makes them pretty

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.129 
the front grille which makes them pretty
good<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.940> use<00:03:19.150> in<00:03:19.599> terms<00:03:19.780> of<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.019> sound

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
good to use in terms of the sound

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.140 
good to use in terms of the sound
