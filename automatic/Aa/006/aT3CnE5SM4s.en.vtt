00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.939
 Around 1900 fans prepared the perfect 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.310
 framework for a good football game 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.250

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.960
 the guests the the game in lübeck the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.880
 preference to the Lower Saxony derby in 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.739
 wolfsburg had given both 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.739
 Fan groups came before the party 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.050
 in mood then the little 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.239
 startup time already needed in the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.280
 sixth minute, there was the first 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.739
 big chance for the vfb ball of 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.379
 thiel and then it is stefan richter 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.000
 he heads over the gate for four meters 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.270
 should have almost been 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.920
 the guide for the vfb the guests 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.750
 but did not hid here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.589
 on the right side a ball 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:09.180
 and that is kicked by 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:11.930
 and is on net 1 0 for hanover 96 in 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.970
 the 16 minute past friend and foe 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.310
 the ball hits the net and jonas 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.500
 toboll in the vfb box makes no 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.630
 good figure 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.180
 the vfb managed this residue but 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.820
 very good had a lot of good 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.829
 opportunities but often too hesitant as 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.159
 here dennis fonds after the submission of 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.110
 andré saver 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.060
 instead of the shot tried but the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.330
 cross pass which is blocked then so 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.049
 it goes with 0 1 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.770
 present the chance of the second half 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.600
 then the guest from Hannover would have been 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.720
 here the ball takes place but is 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.930
 empty passes this lopachin over the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.659
 box it stayed at 1 0 75 minute then 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.060
 the one to one after a free kick of 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.340
 marcello meyer spring sven theißen am 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.560
 highest and beheads with the help of 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.040
 post the ball into the net 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:09.420
 even then the vfb certainly with opportunities 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:14.430
 to decide the lot as here in 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.410
 The 87 minute initially can Hanover 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.250
 free themselves but then comes the second 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.280
 ball from the defense theissen is available 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.580
 but leaves for stefan richter but the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.380
 just hit the outside post and forgive 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.970
 the last lübecker chance the guests 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.069
 would almost have the game on the head 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.250
 provided with this opportunity forward here 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.380
 per capita in the last minute but that 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.800
 It was at one to one what the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.120
 protagonist of this game say 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.600
 her straight sven theißen and 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.910
 commercial operation black 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.910
 yes I think it was very difficult to get in 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.670
 today, many look first 54 head 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.390
 have brought forth 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.390
 at balakov 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.020
 tactical error 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.380
 get through the second half was then 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.380
 brügger 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.129
 is working 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.820
 have in mind and standards 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.750
 generally also advised to 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.750
 march again calla 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.400
 yes I think so 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.400
 there 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.610
 read well with the game 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.600
 I can 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.600
 well done 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.740
 were 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.840
 We are not 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.489
 Focus 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.959
 because you are even more ambitious 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.319
 have over theirs 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.319
 Yes and
