00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.969 
then you go ahead a flare slows down and
you<00:02:05.400> can<00:02:05.580> step<00:02:05.820> down<00:02:05.850> nice<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.450> easily<00:02:06.979> all

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
you can step down nice and easily all

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.889 
you can step down nice and easily all
sounds<00:02:08.250> simple<00:02:08.490> enough<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.450> small<00:02:09.690> matter

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
sounds simple enough just a small matter

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.780 
sounds simple enough just a small matter
of<00:02:10.080> getting<00:02:10.350> airborne<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> short<00:02:17.370> run<00:02:17.580> down

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
of getting airborne so a short run down

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.580 
of getting airborne so a short run down
the<00:02:17.940> slope<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.840> up<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.380> away

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.199 

well<00:02:22.590> perhaps<00:02:23.040> not<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:26.580> after<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.880> few<00:02:27.060> more

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
well perhaps not but after a few more

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:40.780 
well perhaps not but after a few more
goes<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.750> start<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.350> get<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> hang<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.770> it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.259 

oh<00:02:45.099> that<00:02:46.099> was<00:02:46.220> just<00:02:46.250> great<00:02:46.640> off<00:02:46.909> the<00:02:47.030> ground

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
oh that was just great off the ground

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.770 
oh that was just great off the ground
not<00:02:48.049> far<00:02:48.430> took<00:02:49.430> off<00:02:49.579> like<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.879> beautiful

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
not far took off like a beautiful

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.780

conditions<00:02:56.299> have<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.689> be<00:02:56.720> right<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.440> fly<00:02:57.590> off

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
conditions have to be right to fly off

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
the top of long wind if it's more than

the top of long wind if it's more than
15<00:03:00.110> miles<00:03:00.349> an<00:03:00.530> hour<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:01.129> not<00:03:01.250> safe<00:03:01.640> for<00:03:01.670> us<00:03:01.879> to

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
15 miles an hour it's not safe for us to

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:08.800 
15 miles an hour it's not safe for us to
fly<00:03:06.609> it<00:03:07.609> doesn't<00:03:07.760> look<00:03:08.060> like<00:03:08.239> I'll<00:03:08.510> get<00:03:08.690> to
