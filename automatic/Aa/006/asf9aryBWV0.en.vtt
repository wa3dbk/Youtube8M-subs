whoa okay that's it

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.640 
whoa okay that's it
and<00:03:45.720> another<00:03:46.720> command<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:47.260> can<00:03:47.380> use<00:03:47.530> in

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
and another command you can use in

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.060 
and another command you can use in
tactical<00:03:48.270> is<00:03:49.270> kill<00:03:50.160> aliens<00:03:52.110> boom<00:03:53.110> as<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.920> see

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
tactical is kill aliens boom as you see

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.040 
tactical is kill aliens boom as you see
you<00:03:54.640> can<00:03:54.700> probably<00:03:55.060> hear<00:03:55.360> that<00:03:55.420> sound<00:03:55.750> in<00:03:55.960> the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
you can probably hear that sound in the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.140 
you can probably hear that sound in the
background<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.530> was<00:03:56.650> all<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.150> exact

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
background that was all the exact

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.430 
background that was all the exact
troopers<00:03:58.740> dying<00:03:59.740> and<00:04:00.990> the<00:04:01.990> only<00:04:02.140> reason<00:04:02.380> the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
troopers dying and the only reason the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.930 
troopers dying and the only reason the
mission<00:04:02.680> didn't<00:04:02.950> end<00:04:03.160> in<00:04:03.310> this<00:04:03.460> case<00:04:03.700> is

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
mission didn't end in this case is

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.600 
mission didn't end in this case is
because<00:04:04.150> there<00:04:04.960> is<00:04:05.200> going<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.620> be<00:04:05.740> more<00:04:06.040> aliens

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
because there is going to be more aliens

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.630 
because there is going to be more aliens
coming<00:04:07.180> in<00:04:08.520> so<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:11.680> mission<00:04:12.070> did<00:04:12.220> not<00:04:12.400> end

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
coming in so the mission did not end

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.330 
coming in so the mission did not end
because<00:04:12.880> if<00:04:13.630> we<00:04:13.900> understand<00:04:14.410> eventually<00:04:15.040> they

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
because if we understand eventually they

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.979 
because if we understand eventually they
are<00:04:15.430> going<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.880> be<00:04:16.000> reinforcements<00:04:16.690> I'm<00:04:16.780> just

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
are going to be reinforcements I'm just

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.830 
are going to be reinforcements I'm just
walking<00:04:17.170> to<00:04:17.350> show<00:04:17.620> you<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.890> corpses<00:04:18.660> which<00:04:19.660> we

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
walking to show you the corpses which we

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.570 
walking to show you the corpses which we
should<00:04:20.170> find<00:04:20.680> now<00:04:22.140> now<00:04:23.140> see<00:04:23.350> there<00:04:23.590> you<00:04:23.680> go<00:04:23.710> all

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
should find now now see there you go all

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.730 
should find now now see there you go all
the<00:04:24.910> exalt<00:04:25.300> are<00:04:25.510> dead<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.260> mission<00:04:26.530> didn't

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
the exalt are dead the mission didn't

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.930 
the exalt are dead the mission didn't
end<00:04:26.860> because<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.220> reinforcements<00:04:27.850> are

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
end because the reinforcements are

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.150 
end because the reinforcements are
coming<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.390> so<00:04:29.140> yeah<00:04:29.290> I<00:04:29.470> guess<00:04:29.770> that's<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.130> for

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
coming and so yeah I guess that's it for
