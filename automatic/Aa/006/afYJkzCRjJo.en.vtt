00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hi everyone , everything is good, I 'm recording. 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.450
 this video here again on these 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.590
 relatives 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.730
 the amplifier and emit high power 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.230
 today I'm recording it on a pallet 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.180
 600 deaths 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.840
 ok a pallet that uses mrf r 6 mi p 56 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.380
 00 it produces up to 600 watts broadband 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.470
 in FM and the great differential of this father and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.350
 is that it does not produce harmonics like 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.290
 other politicians that we see around 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.840
 produce or with the harmonics with level 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.920
 very tall 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.040
 usually when he was a circuit to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.829
 He looks at you and brows them up. 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.579
 harmonics get too loud 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.270
 oh it there for the output filter is a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.010
 error, right? 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.390
 the movie is going to have to take these hills 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.920
 ups and ends up getting much is a lot 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.109
 power above the wire causing 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.119
 heating up to burning many times 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.340
 is developing circuit here and he 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.840
 It was very good hit 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.710
 n on average works with 82 83% of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.409
 efficiency and with the level of 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.299
 very low even if you 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.400
 do not have a visa like this 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.220
 I'll start by demonstrating here the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.439
 roller 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:36.240
 this boy there he uses that mf s &amp; p 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:39.650
 500 I already told this test here I 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.650
 I am using this source team 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.810
 fps 50 48 thousand for me the chain you 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.840
 already know the team of the river and street of 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.890
 ass or even improve his vision here 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.130
 here ready for what you call current 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.880
 and a meter is very accurate only it is well 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.850
 need 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.110
 in this test I will also use this 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:14.709
 shares that a thousand votes 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:20.220
 in my opinion, 43 ac harmonics in 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.220
 spectrum analyzer and let's see what 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:29.680
 power starting here with 88 is 88 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:37.150
 macaÃ© is the attention of the source to know if 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:39.300
 they get 44 and something is the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:46.200
 chain 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:49.370
 while I am 15.5 perez and the power of 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.370
 signal to catch right 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.670
 arrived is giving around some 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.950
 five hundred and seventy-five hours more 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:07.210
 or less close to the main player 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:12.490
 harmonics the harmonics is there i am 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:15.210
 of the boy the main power agent of the 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.780
 out there that's a little 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:22.630
 because in 88 megafesta he is more gbm 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.950
 the right-hand man is giving the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:30.360
 less 24 or so the 2nd harmonic is 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.480
 giving less 31 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:39.430
 I'm ready now to change the frequency for 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:43.000
 98 mega is the center of the band and we'll see 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:49.570
 How does he support you? 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:54.319
 let's walk the power that has increased 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:59.120
 A little bit and I went to 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:03.829
 six hundred right side 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.840
 the current increased by 16 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.109
 old conception 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.650
 the voltage remains the same 44 some 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:18.500
 thing and let's now see the harmonics 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:21.579
 it's here it's 91 1 mhz it 's 6.3 dm 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.579
 practically the same power 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.630
 now the first second amorim is in 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:33.770
 minus 32 gdm then -32 plus six already 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.860
 38 mm of attenuation of the 2nd 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.800
 ammonium the third the monica is giving 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.530
 here - 32 addition should also give more 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:48.380
 or less - 38 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:50.720
 I'm going to talk to 108 better now, it's 108 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:57.940
 megahair already pothed power let's see the 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.940
 power is giving the 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:07.319
 580 and about 500 and something 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:16.830
 580 1570 is practically the same as 88 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:20.520
 rita run 15.5 perry same attention 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.819
 good care and we will see many use here 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:31.439
 at 108 mega I get it here 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:33.300
 right 108 mega pixels - 6.5 dbm 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:36.689
 practically the same power 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:47.669
 we'll see next the monique is the 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:53.250
 according to the automaker - 30 - 31 - 33 of 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:57.120
 I recorded this video for you guys. 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.919
 see this palette that working and 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.469
 It's very interesting because you can 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:04.110
 put his hand on top of it and not 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:07.620
 I'm not going to put my hand here 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.830
 efficiency of around 82 and 83 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.550
 with a very high air level. 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:18.029
 low to reach 600 votes and 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.250
 increases the voltage of the source and 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:21.719
 stay cool 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.969
 For those who liked the jewelry there 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:27.469
 can stay at home will leave 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.469
 You here with more pictures here 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:33.839
 quite attenuated thing that 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.639
 I did not see it yet, okay? 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.639
 thanks.
