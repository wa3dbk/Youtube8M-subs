00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.189
 Let's practice how to use additive synergies 

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:17.880
 Will officially confirm the Is-phase pressure synergistic 1 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:22.070
 In the first official I use and not the two of both + Dyna = to root Ku 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.730
 That will be the main thing to write by myself 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.500
 When it sees, it is not worth it 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.780
 I think that a and b are equal that integration holds in 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.690
 Well this is official 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:45.050
 So how do you see the shape of the reciprocal side of how to use character I 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:51.949
 Even if I could see the shape of the white reciprocal of the 10-day series I had words with this in mind 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.800
 If you can see the inverse of the letter, you 're right there, so let's actually see the problem 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.440
 Product 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.900
 Not 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.910
 Or problem 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:05.470
 When your Oita x is Prince Tsutsumi times now 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:13.570
 Hey x first x first of -1 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:17.229
 Seek value also seek the value of x, which gives the minimum value of the net I mean is the problem 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.900
 The inverse of the character at this time is 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.940
 I do n't think it's weird and I'll store everything 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:29.170
 Tei was 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:33.860
 I'm not transmit First so where do so in 2x plus x -1/1 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.490
 There is nothing to think about without being a sum of divisors of letters 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:44.770
 Well then let's see for a moment 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:46.899
 Now it is 2x plus x -1/1 It is the first time I see this ink once 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.820
 There is a possibility of doing 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:56.740
 Dynaly-Oudshoch 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:00.009
 Neem- 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.630
 I'm troubled here and I can not translate 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:08.860
 The inverse of the letter is not in the form of 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.490
 So to make Katatsu of the teeth of the reciprocal of the character I wonder how should I 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:22.430
 Yes 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:28.650
 Every so often I make a little patty that f 3-1 booby Aksu now to coercive 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:36.040
 Click here 12 to do 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:41.100
 Then I can not reverse this and see the shape of this x1 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.550
 It's not equal now if I mess around here like this 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.980
 Let's expand a little now dx 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:56.030
 The fact that there is no makkun-3 here 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:58.330
 It is said that these three parks are equal if you 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.380
 Four seasons Deus Belia 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:08.840
 Waiting is 2x I's fault anymore delicious 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:13.080
 You can take it off with Linus Plus, it's Plus x -1 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.220
 I'll wear it to see if I can do this 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.880
 Oh 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:23.319
 It is written back in from box 1 in Then problem statement 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:27.410
 If you migrate 1 x 1 class ne- 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:32.830
 It is early this France This is a plus 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:37.330
 It seems that you can use additive synergies . This formula will go from now on 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:41.260
 Hey With so or so written to the here and now 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.800
 Greater than or equal to = 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:51.290
 View is Kore, and arrays lock Ieyama 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:54.410
 Braces x- 1-9 x Width 1/1 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.530
 Because in there is this + two to sign 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.780
 And also to do-way unless wearing a glass 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.630
 It is an honor 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.150
 Putsu 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:09.290
 A go again 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:12.310
 Here and now character reciprocal effect Monographs first made later against here Nde I saw the teeth of 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:32.400
 It is a reform of pheasant 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:35.680
 If you add from 4 pearls booboo Iki Ma ssu 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:42.760
 Well Table matter in this integration consists 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:46.300
 Is this that we are against is the true conditions now mind I is sputum using the Soka at that time, and arrays 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:51.220
 I but 1 seat 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:56.630
 Well fraction hate in Come over by x -1 Masu denominator fireworks 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:05:02.449
 If you do evil it is x-1-6 yuan 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:07.980
 It does not move even if this is wrong 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:12.720
 X is I once Yay times now to this is absolutely a plus 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:16.270
 Here is a good edge square root pot that will take the square root 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:20.740
 x -1 press eh 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:23.050
 It is 1 because of 2 minutes is not a this I think was there Well is the difference between this look 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:30.699
 One's own right now 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:39.819
 Yes fraction clean a minute even paying is not divided by 2 taking Ryo English plus 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:43.040
 I have put a route 1/2 battery in -1 transition and X is 2 routes 2 +1 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.150
 At this time the minimum value 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.430
 th 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:51.400
 I will fall down I will go again 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:54.820
 I want a minimum now 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:06:02.380
 Here in the form of the inverse of the character tooth Poi 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:06.360
 First of all, I think the first step is the reciprocal of x-1 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:13.349
 I tried to make a length x -1 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:16.240
 In order to make it equal in this way, it is necessary to add oneself to make it not equal 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:26.150
 I maximum points 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:28.260
 Because x is it the city or the migration Once x1 + is the I ++ So it does so in not big than 1 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:32.510
 This overwritten 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:36.210
 Since the additive synergistic you can use to work with in this square 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:39.449
 The result = say taken dialysance 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.180
 Well by adding a girl pungency to sign 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:45.940
 Can translate 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:50.720
 Root 2+ responded as the minimum value 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:56.390
 The condition for integration is the same as voice and that 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:07:03.230
 I hate the fraction and pay the denominator and divide it by 2 so I'll take a visit to the annex 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:06.890
 I'm not going to expand now that X is back on Sunday is x -1 + why n 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:10.710
 Standing advantageous But taking is no square root 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:14.300
 -1 transition first at this time 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:16.760
 Do you do Come all right there eh 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.930
 Please be sure to open it over and over again 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.930
 Yes you are
