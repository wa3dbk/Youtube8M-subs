00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.610

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.810
 Moreover no longer I say goodnight 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.450
 they are good night who is of the other 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.450
 Aunt Almagro's side as we are here 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.320
 how do you date for the fuck 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.950
 say I'm like the ortho to shit 17 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.950
 years is coming 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.730
 shit I'm going to cry one 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.730
 we listen to you we hope we can serve you 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.789
 at least health and it's crap 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.860
 17 years that we are not arriving at the same time 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.050
 because he wants to tell me the stories of 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.989
 independent champion and now this 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.899
 and I pass me something I have not 21 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.489
 I am so far away and it is difficult not one 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.220
 listen to stories read books 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.750
 be educated in all this and perhaps live 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.360
 some championships not at the same height 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.500
 that other people but I have to live this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.500
 the truth that is difficult 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.960
 now we will have to wait for everything to happen 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:03.030
 this now we are already at the same time 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 and expect this year of shit to happen and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.490
 go back quickly start moving now 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.110
 it's a difficult time apart it's already a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.930
 agony that although it is throwing itself quite 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.430
 one while I had hope because I did not 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.080
 let's say I had no hope 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.700
 to this day 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.120
 in which we could get to keep the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.010
 category did not leave us one and we also 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.570
 we agreed late that it could be reversed 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.520
 this I think we remember late 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.170
 we let a lot more time pass than 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.910
 you want to say friends I hear you between 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.310
 tears I hear you bad we are all 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.350
 that's what we have to do 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.480
 we have to put up with only the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.120
 fans that sometimes we are wrong what 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.890
 talked about me a while ago but we have 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.720
 that bank between us pass the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.060
 players pass the technicians going on 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.480
 leaders and I say that is and the same 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.910
 who suffers is the fan 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.910
 management for the time endurance 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:02.930
 that are for the truth endure ratito 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.930
 although I love it
