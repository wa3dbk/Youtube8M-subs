00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.040
 welcome to live 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.750
 Here I bring you another tutorial this time 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.420
 let's see a tutorial on how 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.670
 handle the water currents with 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.880
 red stone circuits without using 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.220
 pistons since I started some time ago I did 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 that controlled the water but with pistons 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.210
 so good that we're going to need 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.090
 red stone a bucket of water and a 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.590
 lever nothing more so good as you 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.419
 I say it is made with red stone and good 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.750
 let's see the trick the trick is 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.579
 in making a hole drop water and already 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.909
 You see how it works if we connect 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.579
 red stone to the water and we put a 

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:46.370
 palanquita as you see there and if we do 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.690
 more holes on the other side the water does not 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.690
 is going to move vale is going to stay in the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.519
 same position and when we press our 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.499
 red stone circuit 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.839
 there you see how it has on whether 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:59.929
 will fall on the other side is worth so good 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.760
 with this utility of this control of 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.610
 water flows we can make a 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.170
 number of incredible inventions 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.870
 so it was very interesting to me 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.280
 show you this trick here I'll do it 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.110
 in another way so you can see it too 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.090
 there you see how I make the hole loose 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.550
 water and I'm going to connect the red stone 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.980
 so you can see how it works 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.750
 I'm going to put the lever and here I go 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.520
 to make a kind of conduit like 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.590
 down as if it were a channel worth 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.460
 so you can see how it works and how it works 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.930
 can restart this type of circuits 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.290
 and good the truth is that it is very 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.549
 interesting very colorful as you see I was going to 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.140
 serve for a lot of things I'm going to 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.570
 activate the lever and see how the water 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.630
 is falling and good simply to 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.990
 able to restart a water control of 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.700
 this style and we would have to put 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.950
 land on that side is worth what I 'm going to 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.619
 do is turn off the circuit first I'm going 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.659
 to put two blocks of sand there for 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.700
 that you see and well the water is plugged 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.470
 and being connected to the red stone 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.750
 We will serve as a control not 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.880
 fall back there you see it as it does not fall 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.970
 agreement and simply when we go back to 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.170
 pressing the lever will fall back there 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.440
 You see in principle it's quite difficult 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.290
 see you utilities well directly worth 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.420
 but as I say this utility of 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.250
 water control will serve us for a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.320
 lots of things that I will be bringing 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.300
 and that's why I wanted to show you this trick 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.269
 first of all, it's worth it for you to see it 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.209
 well the operation and so be able to upload 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.040
 the other tutorials and I have planned 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.410
 upload enough tutorials with this theme 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.090
 because I find it very interesting and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.100
 can serve us for example for things 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.890
 how to make automatic collections of 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.890
 crops that I plan to upload very 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.590
 soon and good, I just hope that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.989
 this trick is pretty clear at least 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.910
 the performance so good if not already 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.549
 you know you can leave me any kind 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.049
 of comment on the video putting 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.900
 your doubts or simply 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.370
 try it to see if it works for you and if 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.350
 you have some problem you already know that 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.690
 can you tell me anything so 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.030
 good as I say is a very tutorial 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.739
 interesting I hope you share this 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.390
 video with your friends so that 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.549
 can learn how to control the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.450
 water without pistons only with red stone 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.670
 as 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.010
 and well just give him a video 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.450
 if you liked it and if you like more, you know 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.269
 nothing soon I will keep going up more 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.550
 tutorials on this topic I hope and nothing 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.170
 with this I'm going to go saying goodbye 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.170
 I welcome you and see you later
