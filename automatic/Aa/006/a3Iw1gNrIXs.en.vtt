00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 with available and for this the most 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.080
 simple is to use in that country we are going to 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.580
 pray with something easy like for example a 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.470
 contact so we can see 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.850
 as he is able to search the 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.070
 different compartments of 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.029
 device in everything related to 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.180
 the word we would not have a calendar 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.010
 web history contacts 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.110
 we would have messages 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.570
 anywhere on the team where the 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.570
 word appears in some way 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.260
 and another of the functionalities that I 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 like to show you today is the multi 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.270
 multitasking is able to develop 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.360
 we meet 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.640
 for a long time let's choose two 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.800
 applications we can use in a 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.800
 combined 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 Y 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.690
 for example a page to which we are 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.000
 spreading the information that we 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.980
 interesting we open a note 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.290
 and with this little interface that we see 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.290
 here we press the blue color button 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.970
 and we have several options available 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:15.210
 this would be to change your application in 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.909
 any other window 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.560
 because it is up and vice versa 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.020
 drag and drop I'll show you 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.130
 some moment and finally close the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.659
 application 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.659
 with the selection to the reason 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.259
 this text we could cut it copy it 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.620
 eliminate it or just examine the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.360
 properties 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.400
 and what we want is to do it again 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:52.650
 but with an image 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:54.330
 in the upper part 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.860
 now that we already have the information of 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.670
 the page that we want to save in this 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.200
 note 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.200
 we just close 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.299
 browser application and we work 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.360
 literally with the text and the image 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.509
 that we have that we have collected from this 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.509
 page
