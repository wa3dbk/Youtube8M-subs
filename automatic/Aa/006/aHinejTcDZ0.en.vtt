00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
This was not an act of destruction or vandalism.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.200
This is about art.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.040
This is eNtR Berlin On The Beat

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.480
outside the Babylon cinema in Mitte.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.040
Today is the premiere,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.880
or rather second premiere,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.200
of a graffiti film called Unlike U.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.080
The film documents the Berlin graffiti scene

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.360
over seven years, particularly the train writers,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.200
until Berlin Public Transport filed a suit.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.560
"This is illegal graffiti." That's true,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.680
but the documentary wasn't,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.120
so they won the case

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.760
and tonight is the second premiere.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.600
I have two tickets. Follow me.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.240
They are the filmmakers. Film them, dude.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.120
Unlike U doesn't mean I don't like you,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.920
it means being different.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.840
The protagonists of our film are different.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.760
FILMMAKER

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.680
We are also different in the way

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.080
we approach projects. Hence the name.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.280
Have you ever painted graffitis?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.320
No.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.960
What's your connection with the scene?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.080
We were interested in the scene

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.400
because we liked the subject itself,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.480
FILMMAKER

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.440
that is train writing and everything involved.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.800
We had a few people in our circle of friends

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.040
who had contacts within the scene

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.280
so that we were able to get in touch

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.440
with those guys.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.760
We wanted to portray the best

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.240
of the best of the train writers

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.640
and we succeeded in doing so after a while.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.720
How long was it until they trusted you enough

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.960
to say, you can have our material

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.520
and then you went along

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.520
and filmed them yourselves?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.800
Seven years sounds like a long time

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.080
for a documentary, but I have to say

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.000
that we didn't spent our entire time on this.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.360
The sprayers were very suspicious

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.120
as they gain nothing from talking about

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.120
what they do. First of all, we posed a threat.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.840
You asked if we went along

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.320
and sure, that's an attractive idea,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.480
but would we have had the guts

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.160
is another question.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.800
But we didn't get the chance to go along.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.640
The good thing is it's a very transient art.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.600
People might see it for a few days or not at all.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.040
Then you only have a picture or video.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.040
So the scene documents itself. We profited

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.080
from this coz we were given great material.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.320
Here is one of the film's protagonists.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.480
His name is Skim.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.760
Your verdict? Is the film any good?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.400
At first I was worried the film would be

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.040
a standard thing like the rest of them.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.040
The rest is a documentation at the most.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.880
But they did a really good job.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.840
They say in the film that Berlin

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.080
is the European capital of graffiti

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.560
or train writing, the New York of Europe.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.440
What's special about Berlin?

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.960
Berlin is special

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.800
because it has an amazing number of facets,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.880
there are so many different people

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.920
showing so many different styles

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.640
you can only be inspired.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.440
What would you do when in 15, 13, 17 years

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.040
your son comes up to you and tells you,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.960
Dad, I'm off spraying now.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.080
Will you say, look, steal your spray can here

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.760
or watch out there or will you stop him?

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.720
I would never stop him.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.120
I was banned from doing it when I was young.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.040
That's exactly what young people

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.360
in puberty rebel against.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.080
I'd say, do it.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.240
Do what you feel like, but if you get caught,

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.960
I'll give you hell. I wouldn't stop him.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.080
But I wouldn't encourage him, either.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.040
Coz I know it's dangerous

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.240
and if it was my son standing near

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.600
an electrical track and he could potentially die,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.480
I wouldn't encourage that.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.040
So Berlin Public Transport, the BVG, sued you

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.320
coz they said it's illegal, they're our trains.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.320
Legally speaking

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.880
it was about us using recordings

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.440
which were made on BVG property

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.360
and showed BVG property.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.520
We made a film about a subculture

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.000
which sprays trains.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.440
It's a media that can be painted on,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.400
and you could say that there is

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.120
a public interest in this,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.840
so it's not just about art,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.400
but about freedom of opinion and press.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.760
We're glad that they can't censor you

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.440
for reporting on a subject

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.840
which may not be to everyone's taste.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.120
You're in the film, you saw it,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.040
a graffiti legend in Berlin.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.800
What's so special about Berlin's graffiti?

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.480
That the wall is gone,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.480
but instead something else

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.000
has blossomed here, it's amazing.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.960
Graffiti always moves on.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.360
You can't put cameras

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.280
in underground train ducts

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.760
and think they would stop people.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.080
Thank you for this conversation.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.400
