accomplish<00:02:40.390> well<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.689> I<00:02:42.409> might<00:02:42.680> say<00:02:42.950> that<00:02:43.430> a

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
accomplish well and I might say that a

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.599 
accomplish well and I might say that a
Garrett<00:02:43.940> case<00:02:44.090> alone<00:02:44.510> is<00:02:44.870> not<00:02:45.680> my<00:02:45.920> protocol

there<00:02:46.970> are<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:47.390> many<00:02:47.599> steps<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.379> working<00:02:49.010> with

there are so many steps to working with

there are so many steps to working with
cancer<00:02:49.840> just<00:02:50.840> talking<00:02:51.319> about<00:02:51.440> agaricus<00:02:52.190> the

cancer just talking about agaricus the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.740 
cancer just talking about agaricus the
way<00:02:52.639> it<00:02:52.849> works<00:02:53.409> is<00:02:54.409> it<00:02:54.769> stimulates<00:02:55.579> your<00:02:56.359> bone

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
way it works is it stimulates your bone

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.030 
way it works is it stimulates your bone

you<00:03:20.209> don't<00:03:20.449> produce<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:21.079> many<00:03:21.500> macrophages

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
you don't produce that many macrophages

you don't produce that many macrophages
this<00:03:23.239> agaricus<00:03:23.900> can<00:03:24.169> double<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.799> macrophage

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
this agaricus can double the macrophage

this agaricus can double the macrophage

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
increased more than three fourfold so

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.470 
increased more than three fourfold so
this<00:03:33.829> is<00:03:34.069> why<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.370> helps<00:03:34.639> people<00:03:34.970> reverse

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
this is why it helps people reverse

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.839 
this is why it helps people reverse
cancer<00:03:35.989> we<00:03:36.139> know<00:03:36.169> how<00:03:36.680> it's<00:03:36.980> helping<00:03:37.430> people

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
cancer we know how it's helping people

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.640 
cancer we know how it's helping people
it's<00:03:37.970> not<00:03:38.180> well<00:03:38.480> how<00:03:38.629> come<00:03:38.870> in<00:03:39.079> from<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:39.319> Alps

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
it's not well how come in from the Alps

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.559 
it's not well how come in from the Alps
or<00:03:39.709> people<00:03:39.949> reverse<00:03:40.220> cancer<00:03:40.489> because<00:03:41.419> it

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
or people reverse cancer because it

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.960 
or people reverse cancer because it
turns<00:03:41.900> on<00:03:42.169> people's<00:03:42.709> immune<00:03:42.949> system<00:03:43.430> would

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
turns on people's immune system would

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.240 
turns on people's immune system would
you<00:03:44.150> want<00:03:44.389> to<00:03:44.480> do<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:44.840> all<00:03:45.109> the<00:03:45.319> time<00:03:45.590> if<00:03:45.980> you

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
you want to do that all the time if you

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.110 
you want to do that all the time if you
didn't<00:03:46.579> have<00:03:46.699> a<00:03:46.730> disease<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.239> needed<00:03:48.169> it<00:03:48.319> no

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
didn't have a disease that needed it no

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.050 
didn't have a disease that needed it no
no<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:50.959> Garrett<00:03:51.620> case<00:03:51.799> is<00:03:52.040> for<00:03:52.310> when<00:03:52.519> someone

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
no so a Garrett case is for when someone

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.080 
no so a Garrett case is for when someone
needs<00:03:53.359> it<00:03:53.720> for<00:03:54.019> either<00:03:54.199> cancer<00:03:54.859> or<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.790> have

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
needs it for either cancer or you have

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.409 
needs it for either cancer or you have
the<00:03:56.239> flu<00:03:56.569> or<00:03:57.109> you<00:03:57.709> have<00:03:57.980> some<00:03:58.579> kind<00:03:58.879> of<00:03:59.030> disease

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
the flu or you have some kind of disease

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.780 
the flu or you have some kind of disease
where<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.109> want<00:04:00.379> to<00:04:00.560> boost<00:04:00.919> up<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.519> immune
