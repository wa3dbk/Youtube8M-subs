weird though fuel tanks there we put

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
weird though fuel tanks there we put
your<00:01:00.629> fuel<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.260> goes<00:01:01.680> down<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
your fuel in there so it goes down the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.280 
your fuel in there so it goes down the
frame<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.140> bit<00:01:04.260> strange<00:01:05.750> but<00:01:06.750> even<00:01:07.170> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
frame it's a bit strange but even that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.910 
frame it's a bit strange but even that
it's<00:01:07.500> quite<00:01:07.710> reliable<00:01:08.010> white<00:01:08.250> top<00:01:08.670> speed

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
it's quite reliable white top speed

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.380 
it's quite reliable white top speed
about<00:01:11.659> 65<00:01:12.659> 70<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:14.720> would<00:01:15.720> say<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.890> quite<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
about 65 70 I would say it's quite a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.840 
about 65 70 I would say it's quite a
quite<00:01:18.390> heavy<00:01:19.110> bike

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
quite heavy bike

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.990 
quite heavy bike
consider<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:22.189> quite<00:01:23.189> late<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.580> well<00:01:23.759> as<00:01:23.850> quite

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
consider it quite late as well as quite

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.719 
consider it quite late as well as quite
beefy<00:01:27.290> try<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.439> start<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.829> now

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.890 

electric<00:01:34.729> start<00:01:34.940> on<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.090> kick<00:01:35.270> style<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:35.780> your

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
electric start on the kick style so your

00:01:35.900 --> 00:02:03.399 
electric start on the kick style so your
kick<00:01:36.049> start<00:01:36.290> is<00:01:36.440> quite<00:01:36.619> hard<00:01:36.830> there<00:02:02.320> see<00:02:03.320> it

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
kick start is quite hard there see it

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.199
