 the recipe 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.820
 even knew so 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.840
 the first generation comes to the host country and builds an existence in one 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.360
 small-scale trade 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.139
 any financial support 

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:02.940
 because given the family in the home country 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.910
 This trade serves as the primary sell-off activity for the first 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.860
 generation 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.500
 a liberal profession for the next generation 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.820
 The choice for liberal professions as doctors' premises as a lawyer is dictated by it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.900
 fact pandit offers the largest guarantee for financial security 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.010
 the possession of land was often forbidden for Chinese and often Jewish 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.000
 migrants 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.229
 and if you had property the state treasury could always expropriate 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.430
 in the average chinese jin restaurant state nowadays one 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.250
 ever colder for the family 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.179
 behind the bar 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.640
 and in the kitchen 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.260
 the children are still a bonus help in the matter while the study books 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.700
 medicine like getting up 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.299
 how long will it take before the last minutes hit 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.299
 and it will flare up when the case is summoned 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.329
 the story so far always worth buying with the average image 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.230
 the Dutchman has Chinese 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.770
 even the peanuts 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.579
 immortalized in the hague statue, noctis india was used as the money name 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.890
 as a child many people are surprised 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.460
 I am so good with Dutch and the parents don't like a restaurant 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.209
 to have 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.000
 the Chinese as well with me that used to fit well in the social 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:14.579
 tradition of Dutch society 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.279
 Chinese are breeding integration 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.749
 however, they have adapted so well to the new arrival country that 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.569
 the focus on the home country 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.439
 hello is exaggerated 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.289
 the dialect was spoken 

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:31.049
 Integration Chinese were often coastal peoples who had the opportunity to 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.849
 let customers out with a boat 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.849
 other variants of the chinese language 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:43.389
 the children of the first generation rest of chinese also the local 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:44.749
 dialect 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.190
 and speaking to men Rijndijk is a major task for them 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.069
 like before 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.539
 and ingrid 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:54.420
 it is true that written chinese is universal in the uniform of china 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.169
 but most children 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.449
 have already learned to speak Chinese 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.029
 do not write 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.879
 so you can also integrate too much 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.370
 in fact it is china it is expected that in chimay the habit speaks 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.959
 kemet cetera 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.789
 the average Dutchman has an advantage over me here if you choose nowhere 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.749
 100 years of Chinese in the Netherlands a good lesson for other migrants such as 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.969
 exemplary example of optimal adjustments to the new one 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:22.639
 norms and values ​​in the country of origin 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.089
 ethnic background 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:28.079
 is mainly economic policy such as a red card couture shadows 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.160
 four fascism years after the party 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.819
 and chinese gates 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.289
 it's mostly on the outside 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:39.069
 just like bounty is a swear word for sparta, the black out zuid holland insight 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.169
 so the Asian equivalent is taking it 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.529
 telling 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:46.529
 unfortunately from light insight 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.499
 the 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:53.169
