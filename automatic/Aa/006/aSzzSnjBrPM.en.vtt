you that big pop in that flash and up
here<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:49.880> kind<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.270> lighting<00:02:50.780> sensor<00:02:51.110> to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
here it's kind of the lighting sensor to

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.780 
here it's kind of the lighting sensor to
tie<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:51.410> when<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.680> flash<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.100> ready<00:02:52.340> and

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
here's the back of the unit here's the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.290 
here's the back of the unit here's the
plug<00:02:55.490> in<00:02:56.200> each<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.440> them<00:02:57.590> come<00:02:57.830> with<00:02:57.860> the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
plug in each of them come with the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.390 
plug in each of them come with the
13-foot<00:02:59.300> plug<00:02:59.720> so<00:02:59.990> some<00:03:00.800> conditions<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.280> only

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
13-foot plug so some conditions you only

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.400 
13-foot plug so some conditions you only
an<00:03:01.550> extension<00:03:01.970> cord<00:03:02.000> can<00:03:02.450> use<00:03:03.200> on<00:03:03.320> the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
an extension cord can use on the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.970 
an extension cord can use on the
different<00:03:03.770> shutter<00:03:03.980> speed<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:05.740> here's<00:03:06.740> just

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
different shutter speed and here's just

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.180 
different shutter speed and here's just
your<00:03:07.130> main<00:03:07.280> power<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:08.420> then<00:03:08.570> also<00:03:08.800> this<00:03:09.800> is<00:03:10.040> if

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
your main power and then also this is if

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.280 
your main power and then also this is if
you<00:03:10.280> want<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.550> flash<00:03:10.820> on<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.120> rock<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.720> mean<00:03:12.200> you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
you want the flash on a rock I mean you

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.650 
you want the flash on a rock I mean you
can<00:03:12.410> do<00:03:12.560> some<00:03:12.770> of<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:12.950> tests<00:03:13.190> then<00:03:14.090> here<00:03:14.390> is

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
can do some of the tests then here is

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
can do some of the tests then here is
the<00:03:14.690> few<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:15.650> it's<00:03:16.010> got<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> lot<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.400> detail<00:03:17.680> like

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
the few so it's got a lot of detail like

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.890 
the few so it's got a lot of detail like
I<00:03:18.830> was<00:03:18.950> saying<00:03:19.010> it's<00:03:19.850> all<00:03:20.000> plastic<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:20.780> then

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
I was saying it's all plastic and then

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.080 
I was saying it's all plastic and then
the<00:03:20.989> softbox<00:03:21.520> doesn't<00:03:22.520> really<00:03:22.640> have<00:03:22.880> any

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
the softbox doesn't really have any

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.000 
the softbox doesn't really have any
detailed<00:03:23.660> clip<00:03:23.930> on<00:03:24.110> word<00:03:24.260> with<00:03:24.470> fit<00:03:24.680> but<00:03:24.920> you

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
detailed clip on word with fit but you

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.890 
detailed clip on word with fit but you
would<00:03:25.160> just<00:03:25.310> slide<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.610> on<00:03:25.730> here<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.690> just

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
would just slide it on here you just

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.720 
would just slide it on here you just
hide<00:03:27.050> all<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.350> ends<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.130> make<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.430> fit<00:03:28.550> on
