up<00:00:15.360> completely<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.839> symbols<00:00:16.279> if<00:00:17.279> we

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
up completely of symbols if we

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.830 
up completely of symbols if we
double-click<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.910> go<00:00:18.029> into<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> symbol<00:00:18.570> and

the<00:01:49.259> answer<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.610> have

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the answer that is because if we have

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.359 
the answer that is because if we have
more<00:01:50.970> than<00:01:51.030> one<00:01:51.500> symbol<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.710> layer<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.280> you

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
more than one symbol on a layer and you

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.800 
more than one symbol on a layer and you
try<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.549> motion<00:01:53.909> tween<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.390> not<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.720> to

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
try to motion tween it it's not going to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.130 
try to motion tween it it's not going to
work<00:01:55.430> one<00:01:56.430> symbol<00:01:57.030> per<00:01:57.240> layer<00:01:57.420> for<00:01:57.869> motion

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
work one symbol per layer for motion

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.530 
work one symbol per layer for motion
tweeting<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.070> what<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.299> first

tweeting so what I'm going to do first
is<00:02:00.810> I'm<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> go<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.439> here<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.860> then

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
is I'm going to go in here and then

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.060 
is I'm going to go in here and then
check<00:02:03.119> out<00:02:03.210> where<00:02:03.420> my<00:02:03.450> pivot<00:02:03.750> points<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.290> with

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
check out where my pivot points are with

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.119 
check out where my pivot points are with
the<00:02:05.219> Select<00:02:05.549> I'm<00:02:05.729> hit<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.299> hotkey<00:02:06.689> Q<00:02:07.079> which<00:02:07.979> is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the Select I'm hit the hotkey Q which is

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.160 
the Select I'm hit the hotkey Q which is
the<00:02:08.220> free<00:02:08.429> transform<00:02:08.849> tool<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.569> i'll<00:02:09.899> see<00:02:10.080> if

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the free transform tool and i'll see if

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.950 
the free transform tool and i'll see if
i<00:02:10.259> were<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.470> pivot<00:02:10.979> now<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.610> going<00:02:11.790> to

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
i were to pivot now it's going to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.960 
i were to pivot now it's going to
pivot<00:02:12.650> around<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:13.130> center<00:02:13.430> of<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> hand<00:02:13.790> we

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
pivot around the center of the hand we

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.060 
pivot around the center of the hand we
actually<00:02:14.300> want<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.600> pivot<00:02:14.990> down<00:02:15.140> from<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
actually want it to pivot down from the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.270 
actually want it to pivot down from the
wrist<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.090> okay<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.230> we'll<00:02:18.920> check<00:02:19.100> out

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
wrist like that okay and we'll check out

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.700 
wrist like that okay and we'll check out
the<00:02:19.310> lower<00:02:19.850> arm<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.570> one<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:20.900> fine<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.440> the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
the lower arm that one is fine and the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.710 
the lower arm that one is fine and the
upper<00:02:22.070> arm<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:22.760> want<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.090> pivot<00:02:23.450> from<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
upper arm we want it to pivot from the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.650 
upper arm we want it to pivot from the
shoulder<00:02:24.340> okay<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:25.670> now<00:02:25.820> he's<00:02:26.030> ready<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.480> go

shoulder okay so now he's ready to go
with<00:02:26.870> his<00:02:26.990> pivot<00:02:27.290> points<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.490> going<00:02:28.610> to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
with his pivot points this is going to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.880 
with his pivot points this is going to
be<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.820> first<00:02:29.150> key<00:02:29.630> frame<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.410> i<00:02:30.440> think<00:02:30.620> i<00:02:30.860> just

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
be the first key frame so i think i just

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.740 
be the first key frame so i think i just
want<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.310> bend<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.790> wrist<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.330> little<00:02:32.360> bit

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
want to bend this wrist a little bit

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.490 
want to bend this wrist a little bit
back<00:02:33.620> like<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.190> okay<00:02:34.820> now<00:02:35.360> if<00:02:35.510> i<00:02:35.600> go<00:02:35.630> up<00:02:35.810> here

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
back like that okay now if i go up here

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.700 
back like that okay now if i go up here
i<00:02:36.790> can<00:02:37.790> add<00:02:38.180> frames<00:02:38.810> by<00:02:39.080> selecting<00:02:39.590> and

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
i can add frames by selecting and

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.060 
i can add frames by selecting and
hitting<00:02:39.920> f5<00:02:40.480> add<00:02:41.480> keyframes<00:02:42.140> or<00:02:42.380> sorry<00:02:42.860> add

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
right-click and do copy frames then

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.820 
right-click and do copy frames then
select<00:03:44.300> over<00:03:44.540> here<00:03:44.720> where<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.260> want<00:03:45.470> them<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.710> be

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
select over here where I want them to be

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.220 
select over here where I want them to be
pasted<00:03:46.280> right<00:03:46.520> click<00:03:46.820> and<00:03:47.480> go<00:03:47.510> paste<00:03:47.930> frames

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
pasted right click and go paste frames

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.680 
pasted right click and go paste frames
and<00:03:48.530> there<00:03:48.710> they<00:03:48.830> are<00:03:48.880> okay<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:52.150> now<00:03:53.150> i<00:03:53.510> can

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
and there they are okay so now i can

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.840 
and there they are okay so now i can
motion<00:03:54.290> tween<00:03:54.500> them<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.770> i<00:03:54.800> can<00:03:54.980> motion

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
motion tween them and i can motion

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.790 
motion tween them and i can motion
between<00:03:55.940> them<00:03:56.150> all<00:03:56.240> at<00:03:56.330> the<00:03:56.390> same<00:03:56.510> time<00:03:56.570> i<00:03:57.020> can

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
between them all at the same time i can

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.460 
between them all at the same time i can
select<00:03:58.010> here<00:03:58.540> from<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.690> tween<00:03:59.930> menu<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.320> can

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
select here from the tween menu I can

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.970 
select here from the tween menu I can
choose<00:04:00.890> motion<00:04:01.460> and<00:04:02.470> clicking<00:04:03.470> anywhere<00:04:03.830> in

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
choose motion and clicking anywhere in

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.410 
choose motion and clicking anywhere in
between<00:04:04.070> these<00:04:04.400> keyframes<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:05.120> can<00:04:05.270> do<00:04:05.360> it

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
between these keyframes I can do it

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.030 
between these keyframes I can do it
again<00:04:05.480> over<00:04:05.750> here<00:04:05.990> between<00:04:06.880> motion<00:04:07.880> okay<00:04:09.040> now

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
again over here between motion okay now

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.530 
again over here between motion okay now
if<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.190> want<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.400> keep<00:04:10.520> it<00:04:10.640> even<00:04:10.820> I<00:04:11.150> have<00:04:11.330> more

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
if I want to keep it even I have more

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.710 
if I want to keep it even I have more
space<00:04:11.990> I<00:04:12.380> have<00:04:13.280> an<00:04:13.430> extra<00:04:13.730> frame<00:04:14.030> here<00:04:14.420> so<00:04:14.690> I

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
space I have an extra frame here so I

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.510 
space I have an extra frame here so I
can<00:04:14.810> just<00:04:14.960> select<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.650> hit<00:04:15.860> shift<00:04:16.190> f5

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
can just select that and hit shift f5

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.539 
can just select that and hit shift f5
which<00:04:17.120> will<00:04:17.299> remove<00:04:17.600> frames<00:04:18.100> okay<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:19.160> i<00:04:19.340> can

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
which will remove frames okay so i can

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.450 
which will remove frames okay so i can
make<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.670> movie<00:04:20.000> see<00:04:20.900> what<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.049> looks<00:04:21.230> like

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
make a movie see what it looks like

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.209 
make a movie see what it looks like
so<00:04:23.460> there<00:04:23.639> is<00:04:23.669> waving<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.800> it's<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.860> little<00:04:26.099> bit

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:26.219 
so there is waving and it's a little bit

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:28.159 
so there is waving and it's a little bit
robotic<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.969> because<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.509> timing<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:28.050> really

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
robotic and because the timing is really

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.980 
robotic and because the timing is really
even<00:04:28.819> so<00:04:29.819> what<00:04:30.030> i<00:04:30.060> can<00:04:30.270> do<00:04:30.360> is<00:04:30.389> i<00:04:30.569> can<00:04:30.599> actually

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
even so what i can do is i can actually

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.929 
even so what i can do is i can actually
play<00:04:31.139> with<00:04:31.259> the<00:04:31.349> timing<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.889> ease<00:04:32.370> in<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.849> out

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:32.939 
play with the timing the ease in and out

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.309 
play with the timing the ease in and out
i<00:04:33.120> select<00:04:33.659> again<00:04:34.289> all<00:04:34.499> three<00:04:34.830> in<00:04:35.069> between<00:04:35.400> I

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:36.319 
i select again all three in between I

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.629 
i select again all three in between I
can<00:04:37.319> use<00:04:37.469> this<00:04:37.729> easing<00:04:38.729> slider<00:04:40.370> let's<00:04:41.370> say<00:04:41.550> I'm

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
can use this easing slider let's say I'm

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.879 
can use this easing slider let's say I'm
going<00:04:41.789> to<00:04:42.889> sly<00:04:43.889> I<00:04:44.219> want<00:04:44.460> to<00:04:44.520> ease<00:04:44.699> in<00:04:44.969> I<00:04:45.830> want<00:04:46.830> to

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
going to sly I want to ease in I want to

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.209 
going to sly I want to ease in I want to
ease<00:04:47.069> into<00:04:47.310> this<00:04:47.789> middle<00:04:48.360> pose<00:04:48.539> here<00:04:48.870> that's

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:49.219 
ease into this middle pose here that's

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:53.899 
ease into this middle pose here that's
it's<00:04:50.219> kind<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.639> a<00:04:51.860> backwards<00:04:52.860> ruin<00:04:53.460> real

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
it's kind of a backwards ruin real

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.610 
it's kind of a backwards ruin real
animation<00:04:54.389> terms<00:04:54.599> you<00:04:54.779> would<00:04:54.870> say<00:04:55.909> ease<00:04:56.909> in

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
animation terms you would say ease in

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.230 
animation terms you would say ease in
but<00:04:58.620> here<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:58.919> have<00:04:58.979> to<00:04:59.159> set<00:04:59.340> it<00:04:59.370> out<00:04:59.669> flashes

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
but here you have to set it out flashes

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.240 
but here you have to set it out flashes
a<00:05:00.270> little<00:05:00.360> bit<00:05:00.599> backwards<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.139> then<00:05:01.919> here

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
a little bit backwards and then here

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.450 
a little bit backwards and then here
we're<00:05:02.340> going<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.520> do<00:05:02.789> the<00:05:02.909> reverse<00:05:03.889> to<00:05:04.889> n<00:05:05.039> so<00:05:05.370> we

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
we're going to do the reverse to n so we

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.249 
we're going to do the reverse to n so we
have<00:05:05.699> out<00:05:06.569> and<00:05:07.550> in<00:05:08.550> ok<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:09.659> let's<00:05:09.719> see<00:05:10.020> what<00:05:10.169> we

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
have out and in ok and let's see what we

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.610 
have out and in ok and let's see what we
got<00:05:10.379> make<00:05:11.279> our<00:05:11.430> movie<00:05:12.349> we've<00:05:13.349> got<00:05:13.469> a<00:05:13.500> little

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
got make our movie we've got a little

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.610 
got make our movie we've got a little
more<00:05:14.689> variation<00:05:15.689> on<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.900> timing<00:05:16.110> which<00:05:16.469> is

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
more variation on the timing which is

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.890 
more variation on the timing which is
good<00:05:16.800> makes<00:05:17.129> it<00:05:17.250> feel<00:05:17.400> more<00:05:17.430> natural<00:05:17.900> problem

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
good makes it feel more natural problem

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.749 
good makes it feel more natural problem
is<00:05:18.990> is<00:05:19.229> it's<00:05:19.589> kind<00:05:19.889> of<00:05:19.919> sticking<00:05:20.310> right<00:05:20.550> now

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
is is it's kind of sticking right now

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.670 
is is it's kind of sticking right now
when<00:05:21.539> it<00:05:21.629> hits<00:05:21.749> the<00:05:21.930> top<00:05:22.139> of<00:05:22.319> his<00:05:22.469> head<00:05:22.939> because

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
when it hits the top of his head because

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.700 
when it hits the top of his head because
frame<00:05:25.680> one<00:05:25.949> here<00:05:26.339> this<00:05:27.120> these<00:05:28.080> keyframes<00:05:28.319> are

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
frame one here this these keyframes are

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.189 
frame one here this these keyframes are
also<00:05:28.889> over<00:05:29.639> here<00:05:29.879> on<00:05:30.029> frame<00:05:30.300> nine<00:05:30.569> so

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
also over here on frame nine so

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.800 
also over here on frame nine so
essentially<00:05:31.620> we're<00:05:31.889> seeing<00:05:32.129> them<00:05:32.419> twice<00:05:33.419> and

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
essentially we're seeing them twice and

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.659 
essentially we're seeing them twice and
they're<00:05:34.409> not<00:05:34.469> moving<00:05:34.650> so<00:05:34.979> we<00:05:35.129> can<00:05:35.159> cheat<00:05:35.520> it

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
they're not moving so we can cheat it

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.629 
they're not moving so we can cheat it
here<00:05:35.849> we<00:05:35.969> can<00:05:36.089> select<00:05:36.270> this<00:05:36.629> hit<00:05:37.560> f6<00:05:38.009> make<00:05:38.460> new

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
here we can select this hit f6 make new

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.450 
here we can select this hit f6 make new
key<00:05:38.819> frames<00:05:39.060> right<00:05:39.270> there<00:05:39.919> we<00:05:40.919> can<00:05:41.129> select

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
key frames right there we can select

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.939 
key frames right there we can select
this<00:05:41.879> back<00:05:42.330> part<00:05:42.599> here<00:05:42.719> and<00:05:43.080> hit<00:05:43.169> shift<00:05:43.439> f5<00:05:43.710> and

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
this back part here and hit shift f5 and

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.559 
this back part here and hit shift f5 and
just<00:05:44.250> get<00:05:44.430> rid<00:05:44.520> of<00:05:44.610> them<00:05:45.020> see<00:05:46.020> how<00:05:46.050> that<00:05:46.409> looks

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
just get rid of them see how that looks

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.809 
just get rid of them see how that looks
so<00:05:48.569> there<00:05:48.779> it's<00:05:48.930> not<00:05:49.080> sticking<00:05:49.379> anymore<00:05:49.860> it
