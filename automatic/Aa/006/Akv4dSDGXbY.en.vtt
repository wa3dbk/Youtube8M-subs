00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:30.869 

so<00:05:29.529> Skylanders<00:05:30.099> aren't<00:05:30.460> like<00:05:30.610> famous

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:30.879 
so Skylanders aren't like famous

work<00:05:35.139> in<00:05:35.259> the<00:05:35.349> game<00:05:35.499> how<00:05:35.800> is<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:36.009> different

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.179

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
with them so you don't fight as them so

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.749
