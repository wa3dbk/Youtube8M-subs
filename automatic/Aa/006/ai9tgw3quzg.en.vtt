00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.110 
jurors may be thinking that too and this
is<00:02:15.380> a<00:02:15.410> very<00:02:15.650> socially<00:02:16.040> conscious<00:02:16.430> film<00:02:16.700> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
is a very socially conscious film and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.520 
is a very socially conscious film and
it's<00:02:17.240> very<00:02:17.390> careful<00:02:17.840> about<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.050> story<00:02:18.380> or

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
it's very careful about a story or

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.890 
it's very careful about a story or
telling<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.370> actually<00:02:19.970> has<00:02:20.360> garnered<00:02:20.660> some

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
telling it's actually has garnered some

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.740 
telling it's actually has garnered some
controversy<00:02:21.500> in<00:02:21.710> Japan<00:02:22.250> because<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.720> a

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
controversy in Japan because this is a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.590 
controversy in Japan because this is a
fictional<00:02:24.050> story<00:02:24.410> but<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.400> rooted<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.030> real

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
fictional story but it's rooted in real

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.230 
fictional story but it's rooted in real
life<00:02:26.810> there<00:02:27.170> actually<00:02:27.590> was<00:02:27.770> this<00:02:27.980> man<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.580> he

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
life there actually was this man and he

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.060 
life there actually was this man and he
actually<00:02:29.480> did<00:02:29.750> create<00:02:29.900> airplanes<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.680> ended

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
actually did create airplanes that ended

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.400 
actually did create airplanes that ended
up<00:02:31.130> being<00:02:31.430> used<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:31.880> World<00:02:32.360> War<00:02:32.420> two<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.020> we're

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
up being used in World War two and we're

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.870 
up being used in World War two and we're
killing<00:02:33.710> us<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:33.860> we're<00:02:34.160> killing<00:02:34.430> Japanese

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
killing us and we're killing Japanese

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.330 
killing us and we're killing Japanese
and<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:35.440> there's<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.530> bit<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.950> controversy

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
and so there's a bit of a controversy

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.850 
and so there's a bit of a controversy
around<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.610> but<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.820> found<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.630> film<00:02:38.860> was

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
around that but I found the film was

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.140 
around that but I found the film was
very<00:02:39.920> careful<00:02:40.430> about<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.760> way<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:40.940> approach

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
very careful about the way it approach

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.450 
very careful about the way it approach
that<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.570> approached<00:02:42.470> in<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.650> sincere<00:02:43.070> way<00:02:43.250> it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
that and approached in a sincere way it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.120 
that and approached in a sincere way it
did<00:02:43.640> talk<00:02:43.880> about<00:02:43.930> it's<00:02:44.930> not<00:02:45.140> about<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.740> usage

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
did talk about it's not about the usage

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.490 
did talk about it's not about the usage

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
it's about the design don't let the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.070 
it's about the design don't let the

you're<00:03:42.799> gonna<00:03:42.920> see<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.280> any<00:03:43.610> movie<00:03:44.060> whether

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
you're gonna see in any movie whether

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.649 
you're gonna see in any movie whether
it's<00:03:45.019> animated<00:03:45.560> or<00:03:45.680> not<00:03:45.920> he<00:03:46.489> just<00:03:46.730> handles<00:03:47.420> all

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
it's animated or not he just handles all

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.990 
it's animated or not he just handles all
of<00:03:47.840> that<00:03:47.959> extremely<00:03:48.500> well<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:49.280> love<00:03:49.849> the

of that extremely well I love the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.699 
of that extremely well I love the
details<00:03:50.329> which<00:03:50.450> it's<00:03:50.629> partly<00:03:50.959> a<00:03:51.110> graphical

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
details which it's partly a graphical

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.930 
details which it's partly a graphical
thing<00:03:51.829> but<00:03:51.950> it's<00:03:52.040> partly<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.400> way<00:03:52.489> he<00:03:52.700> writes

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
thing but it's partly the way he writes

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.309 
thing but it's partly the way he writes
he's<00:03:53.209> got<00:03:53.420> like<00:03:53.629> you<00:03:53.810> know<00:03:53.900> these<00:03:54.019> things<00:03:54.200> to

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
he's got like you know these things to

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.390 
he's got like you know these things to
be<00:03:54.349> watching<00:03:54.650> like<00:03:54.769> their<00:03:54.890> little<00:03:55.129> wooden

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
be watching like their little wooden

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.309 
be watching like their little wooden
shoes<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.030> stuff<00:03:56.180> like<00:03:56.450> oh<00:03:56.720> that's<00:03:57.079> different

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
shoes and stuff like oh that's different

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.440 
shoes and stuff like oh that's different
and<00:03:57.709> you<00:03:58.340> know<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.640> then<00:03:58.760> later<00:03:58.940> on<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.299> same

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
and you know and then later on the same

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.000 
and you know and then later on the same
character<00:03:59.870> has<00:04:00.019> these<00:04:00.170> fancy<00:04:00.620> shoes<00:04:00.890> and

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
character has these fancy shoes and

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.069 
character has these fancy shoes and
you're<00:04:01.099> like<00:04:01.220> oh<00:04:01.370> he's<00:04:01.579> changed<00:04:02.150> you<00:04:02.870> know<00:04:02.959> and

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
you're like oh he's changed you know and

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.059 
you're like oh he's changed you know and
then<00:04:03.170> there's<00:04:03.349> places<00:04:03.590> where<00:04:03.799> they're

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
then there's places where they're

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.259 
then there's places where they're
showing<00:04:04.370> like<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.640> different<00:04:04.910> engineering

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
showing like the different engineering

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.390 
showing like the different engineering
instruments<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.260> they're<00:04:06.590> using<00:04:06.950> technical

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
instruments and they're using technical

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.949 
instruments and they're using technical
terms<00:04:07.549> which<00:04:08.030> is<00:04:08.150> something<00:04:08.359> that<00:04:08.629> I<00:04:08.660> think<00:04:08.720> a

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
terms which is something that I think a

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.270 
terms which is something that I think a
lot<00:04:09.079> of<00:04:09.109> American<00:04:09.500> films<00:04:09.799> shy<00:04:09.980> away<00:04:10.129> from

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
lot of American films shy away from

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.410 
lot of American films shy away from
because<00:04:10.640> we<00:04:10.700> don't<00:04:10.819> want<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.030> scare<00:04:11.359> people

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
because we don't want to scare people

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.770 
because we don't want to scare people
off<00:04:12.040> it's<00:04:13.040> not<00:04:13.280> an<00:04:13.459> alienated<00:04:14.120> audience<00:04:14.510> but

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
off it's not an alienated audience but

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.650 
off it's not an alienated audience but
it<00:04:15.260> helps<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.709> become<00:04:15.890> more<00:04:16.340> authentic<00:04:16.660> script

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
it helps it become more authentic script

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.569 
it helps it become more authentic script
in<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.870> storyline<00:04:18.139> if<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.250> talk<00:04:19.400> about

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
in the storyline if you talk about

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.860 
in the storyline if you talk about
details<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.150> mean<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.419> details<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.810> the

details I mean the details of the

just gorgeous picturesque animation but

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.570 
just gorgeous picturesque animation but
specifically<00:04:27.020> it's<00:04:27.740> like<00:04:28.010> it's<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.340> film

but you have the reflections of the
plane<00:04:37.880> which<00:04:38.210> are<00:04:38.360> gorgeous<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.229> just<00:04:39.440> these

plane which are gorgeous and just these
little<00:04:40.220> details<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:41.240> animation<00:04:41.630> that<00:04:41.750> makes

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
little details the animation that makes

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.570 
little details the animation that makes
you<00:04:41.990> think<00:04:42.200> oh<00:04:42.380> it<00:04:42.740> just<00:04:42.770> draws<00:04:43.099> you<00:04:43.250> in<00:04:43.370> even

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
you think oh it just draws you in even

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.100 
you think oh it just draws you in even
more<00:04:43.729> I<00:04:43.940> love<00:04:44.240> every<00:04:44.570> time<00:04:44.780> that<00:04:44.990> they're

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
more I love every time that they're

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.500 
more I love every time that they're
showing<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.410> painter<00:04:45.860> or<00:04:46.099> someone<00:04:46.940> drawing<00:04:47.270> and

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
showing a painter or someone drawing and

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.790 
showing a painter or someone drawing and
you<00:04:47.660> like<00:04:47.780> you're<00:04:47.930> zooming<00:04:48.200> into<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.500> paint

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
you like you're zooming into the paint

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.170 
you like you're zooming into the paint
and<00:04:48.889> you<00:04:48.950> can<00:04:49.099> see<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:49.340> texture<00:04:49.729> on<00:04:50.000> this

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
and you can see the texture on this

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.370 
and you can see the texture on this
person's<00:04:50.539> paintbrush

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
person's paintbrush

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.170 
person's paintbrush
you<00:04:51.530> know<00:04:51.620> when<00:04:51.740> Jiro<00:04:51.950> is<00:04:52.070> writing<00:04:52.520> out<00:04:53.120> his

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
you know when Jiro is writing out his

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.089 
you know when Jiro is writing out his
engineering<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.380> different<00:04:54.680> mathematical

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
engineering the different mathematical

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.440 
engineering the different mathematical
equations<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:55.550> zoom<00:04:55.789> in<00:04:55.940> you're<00:04:56.090> seeing<00:04:56.300> like

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
equations you zoom in you're seeing like

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.360 
equations you zoom in you're seeing like
the<00:04:56.479> lead<00:04:56.900> like<00:04:57.139> the<00:04:57.260> graphite<00:04:57.740> on<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.130> paper

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
the lead like the graphite on the paper

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.430 
the lead like the graphite on the paper
which<00:04:58.910> is<00:04:59.060> just<00:04:59.389> details<00:04:59.810> we<00:05:00.110> don't<00:05:00.139> always

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
which is just details we don't always

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.670 
which is just details we don't always
see<00:05:00.590> in<00:05:01.070> some<00:05:01.430> ways<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:02.030> human<00:05:02.450> drawings<00:05:03.169> the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
see in some ways the human drawings the

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
see in some ways the human drawings the
drawings<00:05:04.220> of<00:05:04.430> human<00:05:04.849> people<00:05:05.180> almost<00:05:06.610> when<00:05:07.610> you

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
drawings of human people almost when you

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.920 
drawings of human people almost when you
have<00:05:07.849> to<00:05:07.940> tell<00:05:08.090> a<00:05:08.150> story<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.570> have<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.780> have

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
have to tell a story you have to have

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.650 
have to tell a story you have to have
human<00:05:09.200> characters<00:05:09.950> and<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:10.820> of<00:05:11.180> course<00:05:11.240> I'm

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
human characters and so of course I'm

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.360 
human characters and so of course I'm
absolutely<00:05:12.169> fine<00:05:12.530> with<00:05:12.560> that<00:05:12.740> but<00:05:13.070> they<00:05:13.340> look

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
absolutely fine with that but they look

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.550 
absolutely fine with that but they look
so<00:05:13.550> cartoon<00:05:14.180> they<00:05:14.389> look<00:05:14.599> so<00:05:14.780> hard<00:05:15.020> compared<00:05:15.500> to

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
so cartoon they look so hard compared to
