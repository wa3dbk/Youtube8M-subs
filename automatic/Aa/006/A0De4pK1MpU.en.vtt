at<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.539> fuckin<00:00:21.900> hiding<00:00:22.170> spot<00:00:22.439> I'm<00:00:22.619> sure<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
at this fuckin hiding spot I'm sure a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.170 
at this fuckin hiding spot I'm sure a
lot<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.070> people<00:00:23.189> are<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> look<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.060> that

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
lot of people are going to look for that

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.750 
lot of people are going to look for that
though<00:00:24.420> anyways<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.340> best<00:00:26.519> way<00:00:26.699> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
though anyways so the best way to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.509 
though anyways so the best way to
describe<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.359> map<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.840> think<00:00:28.410> using<00:00:29.160> other

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
describe this map I think using other

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.880 
describe this map I think using other
maps<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.689> compare<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.850> Quarry

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
maps is to compare it to Quarry

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.130 
maps is to compare it to Quarry
underpass<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.340> rust<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
underpass and rust I think it's a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.869 
underpass and rust I think it's a
combination<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.800> all<00:00:38.010> three<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.370> those<00:00:38.520> maps

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
combination of all three of those maps

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.470 
combination of all three of those maps
it's<00:00:39.660> kind<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.840> got<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.110> dreary<00:00:40.680> kind<00:00:41.129> of

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
it's kind of got this dreary kind of

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.990 
it's kind of got this dreary kind of
drizzling<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:43.200> know<00:00:43.320> kind<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.770> overcast<00:00:44.399> kind

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
drizzling you know kind of overcast kind

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
drizzling you know kind of overcast kind
of<00:00:45.090> sky<00:00:45.360> setting<00:00:46.110> kind<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.410> thing<00:00:46.590> that's<00:00:47.219> got

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
this kind of you know verticality that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.430 
this kind of you know verticality that
quarry<00:00:50.850> has<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.660> got<00:00:51.780> some<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.050> those<00:00:52.140> cement

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
me of that it's also kind of like fuel

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.760 
me of that it's also kind of like fuel
which<00:00:56.520> was<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> DLC<00:00:57.239> map<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.660> modern<00:00:58.350> warfare<00:00:58.500> 2

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
which was a DLC map in modern warfare 2

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.029 
which was a DLC map in modern warfare 2
and<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.579> rust<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.390> got<00:01:00.750> an<00:01:00.989> awesome<00:01:01.440> kind

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and then rust it's got an awesome kind

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.910 
and then rust it's got an awesome kind
of<00:01:02.190> trick<00:01:02.489> shot<00:01:02.789> high<00:01:03.660> jumping<00:01:04.229> off<00:01:04.409> spot<00:01:04.619> I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
of trick shot high jumping off spot I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.230 
of trick shot high jumping off spot I
don't<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.400> show<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> video<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.210> I

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
there oh my god like it would make the

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.509 
there oh my god like it would make the
map<00:04:09.060> so<00:04:09.300> much<00:04:09.450> better<00:04:09.720> in<00:04:09.989> my<00:04:10.500> opinion<00:04:10.530> there's

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
map so much better in my opinion there's

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.820 
map so much better in my opinion there's
just<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:12.330> increase<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.660> lot<00:04:13.350> of<00:04:13.440> people<00:04:13.650> say

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
just you increase a lot of people say

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.410 
just you increase a lot of people say
you<00:04:13.890> increase<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.489> verticality<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.209> map

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
you increase the verticality of a map

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.229 
you increase the verticality of a map
and<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.780> promotes<00:04:16.320> camping<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.190> that's<00:04:18.030> not

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
and it promotes camping and that's not

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.300 
and it promotes camping and that's not
always<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.600> truth<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.440> think<00:04:19.709> if<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:20.100> have

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
always the truth and I think if you have

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.890 
always the truth and I think if you have
just<00:04:20.609> this<00:04:20.700> level<00:04:21.120> playing<00:04:21.390> fields<00:04:21.720> can<00:04:21.870> be

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
just this level playing fields can be

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.650 
just this level playing fields can be
boring<00:04:22.350> as<00:04:22.590> hell<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.640> like<00:04:23.880> Infinity<00:04:24.450> Ward

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
boring as hell and I like Infinity Ward

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.440 
boring as hell and I like Infinity Ward
