00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.159 
Tabitha Zuma for approaching
a<00:04:15.600> sensitive<00:04:16.600> topic<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.859> such<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.880> good<00:04:19.180> way<00:04:19.480> and

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
a sensitive topic in such a good way and

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.980 
a sensitive topic in such a good way and
I<00:04:20.230> think<00:04:20.290> as<00:04:20.769> well<00:04:21.040> everyone<00:04:21.850> is<00:04:22.150> focusing<00:04:22.810> on

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
I think as well everyone is focusing on

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.189 
I think as well everyone is focusing on
the<00:04:23.199> interest<00:04:23.650> part<00:04:23.949> but<00:04:24.310> I<00:04:24.580> mean<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.540> way<00:04:25.750> she

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
the interest part but I mean the way she

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.900 
the interest part but I mean the way she
showed<00:04:27.100> how<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:29.740> situation<00:04:30.010> they<00:04:30.729> were<00:04:30.790> in

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
showed how this situation they were in

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.090 
showed how this situation they were in
effect<00:04:31.270> them<00:04:31.870> not<00:04:32.380> just<00:04:32.680> because<00:04:32.800> they'd

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
effect them not just because they'd

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.950 
effect them not just because they'd
ended<00:04:33.430> up<00:04:33.550> turning<00:04:33.729> to<00:04:34.030> each<00:04:34.150> other<00:04:34.330> Bush<00:04:34.660> how

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
ended up turning to each other Bush how

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.810 
ended up turning to each other Bush how
not<00:04:35.350> having<00:04:35.830> an<00:04:36.010> active<00:04:36.550> parent<00:04:37.360> being<00:04:37.720> there

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
not having an active parent being there

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.610 
not having an active parent being there
