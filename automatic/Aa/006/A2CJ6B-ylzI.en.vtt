00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.650
 lala and galera ray think the sampa 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.049
 you two another video game play commented 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.460
 and those of today is again about the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.980
 jury goals 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.900
 Look, I was just going to talk about office 2, Carol. 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.670
 it's the damn custom custom black 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.380
 two but not where the video over covers 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.470
 goals could not be different from yesterday 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.510
 May 21 we had the revelation 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.279
 of the first trailer with gameplay of the game 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.510
 together also contributed 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.650
 told a little more about the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.140
 development of the game some 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.969
 news and also had is a third 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 trailer showing the graphical comparison 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.140
 of the way a plate 3 with 14 goals 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.610
 trailer and incidentally that I posted today in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.440
 subtitle channel for you to give 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.180
 conferred by its part on the time 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 Did not you see the link for you? 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.390
 watch will have here in the description yesterday 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.820
 the resource of a minute and a half more or 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.590
 less and today or in Brazilian Portuguese 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.170
 there you can see the difference well 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.210
 graphic code of the goals for the code acts 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.059
 by the current charts it follows that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.859
 is not the same in boo w3 since then 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.359
 There is not much difference and there for you. 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.700
 see the improvements that this new 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.010
 India will bring in the right graphic part 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.500
 but then we go to the subject of the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.049
 video of today that is about the weapons of the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.760
 cob goals the weapons that have been confirmed 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.770
 or at least partially confirmed 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.049
 for people through systems 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.939
 shown to us yesterday right 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.080
 both passed as drills 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.270
 I spoke of some scenes of gameplay 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.979
 some development scenes and with that 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.439
 We can go and see some of the areas 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.640
 that appeared to try to identify the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.119
 weapons with real - life guessing 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.680
 with the weapons that are ok it 's not like the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.509
 people know if these weapons you are 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.909
 here are now appearing multiplayer or 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.979
 it's not initially it should be scenes 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.500
 almost all of the campaign does not have much 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.750
 The multiplayer scene has another 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.970
 multiplayer scene but neither is it 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.220
 because he did not appear naked in a scene of 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.229
 multiplayer is that it also means that 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.549
 she's going to continue in multiplayer 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.720
 when the game was released it could be that 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.219
 She does not appear very well, you know. 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.079
 who always has several weapons in the campaign 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.670
 that do not appear in multiplayer mode 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.960
 game but anyway 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.430
 the first thing you have to know 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.740
 Which I think is very well in doubt is 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.390
 when what will happen the safe goals 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.149
 nor in what year 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.800
 for those who do not know the fashion saga marcela 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.170
 if passed in the future engine was 3 if not 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.940
 I'm mistaken if it happened in 2017 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.430
 It's the backoffice, as you know. 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.530
 space in 2025 and the code goes out yes 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.569
 if it does not happen in the future, 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.849
 a specific year but it was said that in 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.550
 some years is in the future not much points 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.739
 should not be more than 2021 I believe and 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.599
 the future will not be as 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.379
 influential as black box 2 for example 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.760
 huh 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.530
 the black the two if you go see no 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.260
 it passes in a future so distant so are 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.090
 12 years is quite right but at both 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.060
 technology or may be placed 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.400
 little but the focus of the game is not 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.050
 the future is the code can not like it 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.170
 You will spend a few years in front but 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.599
 the future is not the premise and move on 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.160
 front of a premise for no reason is 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.750
 For you of so much technology like that is 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.910
 simply in the future nothing more than 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.110
 That's right, the weapons will be very 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.540
 probably very current 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.040
 Okay, that 's good, so let's go to the list of 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.870
 We do not have guns but we already have 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.489
 some already gives to us has a one 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.290
 the notion that credits go to the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.940
 website and intel that did this 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.980
 was able to do this research to 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.409
 find out what years are the people 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.140
 starts with rage really 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.370
 all are almost all the weapons that people 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.530
 already had confirmed was the assault the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.540
 iphone we only have two mg and the rest are 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.360
 all the first buses from there 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.810
 which is a 300 call assembly phone 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.269
 bÃ©dier she seems more like a good asset 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.220
 hybrid means it reminds me of just one 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.620
 No one shows up but the light troika and she 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.750
 appeared there in a campaign 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.420
 that happened in gave to realize later the 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.640
 people have one and another 105 great 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.530
 highlight is how tall it reminds me of 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.690
 little chicken a little shorter than 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.459
 Galileo is also a task 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.480
 very interesting also appeared on the scene 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.030
 from single player 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.830
 our dear ak-47 also scored 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.140
 presence as you can see there then 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.569
 suddenly leave the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.769
 47 return in code is not small 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.349
 but we know that we do not 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.489
 had her at least in multiplayer mode 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:08.370
 then we have the r 160 that reminds us 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.569
 much more expensive but it is not a weapon it is 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.680
 a different way but I think 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.959
 no code ever appeared 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.760
 also seems to be a good job. 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.330
 powerful of those that without recourse and 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.829
 such 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.530
 we also had the afternoon presence 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.329
 21 Okay so the image of the disclosure of the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.800
 Activision was neither delivered nor 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.760
 nothing as you can see is an image 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
 with white background 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.120
 and it also marked such 21 presence already 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.610
 appeared in other courts 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.400
 then we also had the lack of sw 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.100
 which is also known as False 58 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.920
 But I do not think it's the same 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.140
 lack we have in block 2 is okay today is 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.630
 the other one that we also have to aps 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.060
 under water assault in the neighborhood that everything 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.400
 indicates that it is an underwater weapon because it is 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.470
 So we should have yes, it's moments of 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.240
 underwater actually this has already been 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.180
 confirmed by interviews 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.270
 subsequent to the right event are they 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.220
 They said yes, we 'll have a guy. 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.230
 some phases or even a few hours from the 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.120
 campaign too again makes them whole 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.190
 where are we going to have not only gameplay 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.980
 underwater as well as a physics of 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.530
 when you are underwater and also 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.850
 right weapons for you to use underwater 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.430
 it is not yet known if this will be 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.870
 brought pro multiplayer they are already 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.640
 considering the possibility not 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.320
 probably should not be maps 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.090
 underwater because it gets 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.800
 strange but at least some parts 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.150
 that goes under the water and that only 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.910
 I gave it to you but I used it inside. 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.650
 using a gun is underwater 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.990
 I do not know if it would be an interesting point 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.060
 would be an additional plus neither 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.790
 multiplayer mode and lastly in question 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.010
 of assault aifu right we have the emi 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.200
 41 m four looks identical to the one 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.150
 people already had in the way a three 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.220
 this has already appeared in a scene that 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.200
 appears to be multiplayer as well as 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.850
 also the fao's appearance appears to be a scene 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.070
 of multiplayer that appeared both in the 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.290
 court, then perhaps already 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.210
 you can expect m4 and at least 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.920
 ready there for the right multiplayer 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.460
 also we had as I said two 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.080
 smg being the mp it resembles 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.790
 enough over 45 I believe that 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.070
 Be a variation I do not understand much 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.020
 but I know it has several variations of the 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.450
 weapons that exist out there as well as 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.670
 example of the victor cross that was the other is 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.480
 the weapon confirmed there through training 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.420
 actually through the images 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.940
 also be binding 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.710
 21 and it must also be one or the other 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.320
 variation of the vector that we have 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.030
 copy of your name wins vector k-10 this 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.200
 in the case would be curious to see if I 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.420
 The same mistake you had in 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.040
 I'm not sure if I confirm 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.440
 mine correct me if I am 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.970
 wrong but it is no longer to listen to these 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.620
 information and wanted to bring in the 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.270
 today for you before it's over 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.230
 two more things to infinity ward 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.600
 activision 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.910
 They said yes to Raven Software and 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.100
 neversoft are helping endless ice in 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.690
 development of caliber certain goal 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.160
 to slide income that helped in the 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.020
 development of fw31 together with 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.870
 also angry and she's not software 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.790
 huh helping the development age 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.760
 real is working on a project from her 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.770
 okay and avoid playing yes to 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.350
 local currency is dangerous this year so 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.840
 like jono w3 and now neversoft 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.970
 also helping neversoft is the 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.280
 same developer of the guitar gil series
