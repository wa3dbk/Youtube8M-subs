00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello everyone today the new video all e 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.910
 as I had anticipated on instagram is 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.920
 on facebook I was from ubs because it is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.969
 the new collection has arrived here from me 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.679
 of s 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.039
 the summer collection called 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.109
 weight bold codest wood I wouldn't want 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.240
 pronounce it wrong so then you will find 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.519
 the name as usual of the info box 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.619
 however a collection that attracted me 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.019
 a lot already from the site especially for 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.210
 two or three little products and then I do 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.740
 see what I decided to buy the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.260
 first thing i took and that is what 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.469
 I was more attracted by this spray for i 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.850
 hair called beach and the wave 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.430
 so spray should be 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.980
 practically a spray that serves to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.250
 recreate the effect on the hair a little 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.100
 moved a little disheveled hair 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.010
 in fact when you are on the beach here 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.170
 there is really written about this spray dr 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.940
 a feeling of dryness the effect 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.539
 wavy for a perfect look from 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.850
 beach 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.350
 actually I had caught it hoping to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.110
 can use it on my hair 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.390
 super super smooth to go create a 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.510
 some of the waves make him a little moved though 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.729
 honestly I tried it yesterday because you 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.130
 these organic hills took about three 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.900
 four days ago, however, I tried it 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.520
 yesterday and I must say that I had to wash the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.549
 hair after using it because 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.159
 the effect I don't know was tremendous they were 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.590
 they were all very sticky 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.509
 if any of you have it or anyway a 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.299
 a similar product and can explain me 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.829
 how to use it in my opinion is better indeed 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.720
 I also wanted to make a video where it was 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.000
 I tried with you but seeing that I didn't 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.920
 I am able or have said better to avoid 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.110
 and we ask them for advice 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.840
 better than hair things 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.700
 so if you feel like letting me know I see it 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.500
 the hour of carlo is to succeed perhaps 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.990
 have the result I was hoping for 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.470
 second thing i took is this blush 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.770
 which is the blush skint has only one color 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.210
 of 0 July 1 heart attack 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.240
 however, this molds to those who love 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.700
 very much from the site because practically 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.690
 a blush with a consistency totally 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.430
 jealous, he almost seems to be a genius who 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.640
 it almost looks like it's a consistency 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.620
 gel only that after taking it read 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.110
 some comments yours under the photo 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.060
 that I brought you and in many me 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.220
 you did not recommend it then oh well now 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.830
 I see it I'll show you and then 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.050
 however I will try it and I will reserve of 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.970
 tell you something more as always for i 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.220
 prices for it I repeat every time though 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.140
 I don't remember them every time 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.730
 then I put them then in the Info box 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.980
 near the product name 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.720
 other thing surprised she was liner 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.450
 this is what he has on one side 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.390
 the thinnest tip then just the 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.180
 pen tip and tip to the other 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.940
 instead tilted these eyeliner to me 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.420
 they like them very much in the sense that they are 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.770
 a 2 in 1 so I find them very comfortable 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.790
 usually they are not 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.310
 fantastic 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.860
 or rather I just like to start ad 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.410
 then use them after a bit of opening e 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.450
 closing some uses tend to 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.000
 however, the color makes me mad 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.040
 because it is a beautiful brucino 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.930
 so at least I wanted to take this 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.480
 since there is also in black and in a 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.030
 very very light blue a like 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.709
 in short, the color of my necklace 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.300
 that no less inspired me 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.060
 particularly for which I am 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.040
 oriented only on this I will try and 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.959
 also in this case I will let you know 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.940
 enamels also came out with 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.190
 this collection that are very nice 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.230
 as colors I tried to contain myself 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.030
 despite beli among the priests all because 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.920
 I liked them a lot 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.080
 I only got one and I like it 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.540
 I also find the packaging a lot 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.550
 cute a little innovative I took 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.380
 this here that blue euro and yes 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.570
 calls 03 and Jews and is practically a 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.660
 simple blue enamel but has inside 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.940
 of the micro for the silver sciences 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.130
 blue is lighter than darker blue 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.130
 so it should give a lot of effect 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.980
 very cute on light face nails 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.260
 reflective therefore in short a one thing 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.090
 slightly different from the usual and all the colors 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.590
 anyway 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.480
 they came out with this collection mi 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.129
 they really attracted the last thing I had 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.069
 taken and were two eye shadows in 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:17.190
 these are called soft touch mousses 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.900
 eyeshadow i took this which is a color 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.690
 salmon among other things the beautiful thing 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.540
 which are still closed so I open them 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.479
 here with you is practically this is a 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.850
 very beautiful salmon color very much 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.610
 simple in reality but in my opinion 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.330
 it remains very very illuminating indeed it is 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.000
 full super full of glitter in i 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.100
 colorful on gold or silver and 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.110
 so this here i want to use it 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.450
 I want to try using it right 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.810
 like eye shadow on the whole eyelid for 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.400
 give light and just a touch of color 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.800
 also because being so orange is 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.630
 very similar to my starting color 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.510
 of the eyelids and other that I have taken is 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.310
 the blue one was more or less the same 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.979
 the color is the same as the enamel that 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.979
 I took it and this too is closed a 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:09.260
 miracle we practically open it now 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:12.000
 together and this is what this is also 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.950
 contains a bit of bettarini therefore also 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.590
 he has a lot of micro for science 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.139
 this inspired me a lot to try 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.910
 use it as an eyeliner then go 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.530
 to take it being in cream with the 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.599
 angled brush and try 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.000
 spread it as an eyeliner because second 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.610
 me having all these micro for the 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.080
 sciences and all these glitter can be 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.479
 make a beautiful effect especially 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.250
 for the evening it was very nice too 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.289
 the illuminant that came out of this 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.270
 collection, however, avoided losing it 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.330
 because lately I'm always using 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.099
 always always illuminating present in the 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.260
 my bulletin to bonjour soleil then 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:49.440
 it seemed true to me it feels useless anyway 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.660
 if you do not have illuminating ones of s 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.820
 usually they are very valid and this is 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.070
 this collection really attracted me 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.320
 so so if you happen maybe 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.000
 veil blossomed so these were 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.160
 anyway all purchases now 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.210
 to do with this new with the stories 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.460
 of s 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.289
 now I'm waiting for you to scale hotel roses by 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.970
 which there are already little things that me 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.550
 they are doing as early as the title 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.320
 but precisely I want to wait to see them 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.360
 live and we hope it arrives 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.400
 in hurry I hope this video is there 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.860
 it was useful if you like a comment 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.650
 let me know if you found this 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.960
 collection if you like something and me 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.810

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.780

 Hello
