them<00:03:24.590> and<00:03:25.190> you<00:03:25.550> want<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:26.120> mix<00:03:26.650> all<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.710> this

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
them and you want to mix all of this

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.970 
them and you want to mix all of this
together<00:03:28.400> mix<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.180> all<00:03:29.380> together<00:03:30.430> very<00:03:31.430> well

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
together mix it all together very well

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.230 
together mix it all together very well
it<00:03:33.980> all<00:03:34.100> should<00:03:34.370> look<00:03:34.960> very<00:03:35.960> well<00:03:36.320> blended<00:03:37.240> you

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
it all should look very well blended you

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.410 
it all should look very well blended you
know<00:03:38.360> there<00:03:38.570> shouldn't<00:03:38.900> be<00:03:38.930> any<00:03:39.200> clumps<00:03:39.890> of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
know there shouldn't be any clumps of

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.070 
know there shouldn't be any clumps of
garlic<00:03:41.420> powder<00:03:41.450> or<00:03:42.170> any<00:03:42.350> clumps<00:03:42.770> of<00:03:42.890> anything

just<00:03:45.080> stir<00:03:45.740> it<00:03:45.770> around<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.400> bit<00:03:48.790> like<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.210> I<00:03:53.650> hope

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
just stir it around a bit like so I hope

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.160 
just stir it around a bit like so I hope
you<00:03:54.800> can<00:03:54.950> quite<00:03:55.250> see<00:03:55.280> it<00:03:55.640> but<00:03:56.060> I'm<00:03:56.870> stirring

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
you can quite see it but I'm stirring

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.640 
you can quite see it but I'm stirring
everything<00:03:59.140> very<00:04:00.140> carefully<00:04:02.470> trying<00:04:03.470> to

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
everything very carefully trying to

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.740 
everything very carefully trying to
break<00:04:03.920> up<00:04:04.100> all<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:04.370> clones<00:04:04.820> especially<00:04:05.570> the

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
break up all the clones especially the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.400 
break up all the clones especially the
garlic<00:04:06.170> powder<00:04:06.820> tends<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:08.330> bump<00:04:08.720> up<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.320> you

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
garlic powder tends to bump up so you

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.310 
garlic powder tends to bump up so you
want<00:04:09.590> to<00:04:09.650> make<00:04:09.680> sure<00:04:10.180> just<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.480> break<00:04:11.900> up<00:04:12.110> those

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
want to make sure just to break up those

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:21.840 
want to make sure just to break up those
clumps<00:04:15.130> just<00:04:16.130> like<00:04:16.310> stirring<00:04:16.730> it<00:04:17.030> very<00:04:17.390> well

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.820 

now<00:04:22.850> let<00:04:23.120> me<00:04:23.150> see<00:04:23.510> if<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.780> can<00:04:24.050> move<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.560> camera

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
now let me see if I can move the camera

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.620 
now let me see if I can move the camera
screen<00:04:25.310> as<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:25.520> can<00:04:25.900> get<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.930> better<00:04:27.350> idea<00:04:27.590> of

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
screen as you can get a better idea of

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.550 
screen as you can get a better idea of
how<00:04:29.630> long<00:04:29.870> did<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.380> should<00:04:30.650> be<00:04:30.890> i<00:04:32.470> don't<00:04:33.470> know

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
how long did it should be i don't know

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.660 
how long did it should be i don't know
if<00:04:33.650> i<00:04:33.770> can<00:04:34.240> get<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.300> so<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:35.690> can<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:35.990> see<00:04:36.170> it

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
if i can get it so you can you see it

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.700 
if i can get it so you can you see it
right<00:04:37.670> and<00:04:38.180> there<00:04:39.080> I<00:04:39.910> be<00:04:40.910> blended<00:04:41.420> very<00:04:42.410> well

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
right and there I be blended very well

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.970 
right and there I be blended very well
so<00:04:43.070> let's<00:04:43.220> just<00:04:43.460> smooth<00:04:44.180> with<00:04:44.570> no<00:04:44.780> class<00:04:47.980> and

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
so let's just smooth with no class and

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.210 
so let's just smooth with no class and
then<00:04:49.190> after<00:04:49.640> you've<00:04:49.820> done<00:04:50.060> that<00:04:50.120> take<00:04:51.220> a

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
then after you've done that take a

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.150 
then after you've done that take a
bigger<00:04:52.580> size<00:04:52.940> bowl<00:04:53.330> that<00:04:53.570> will<00:04:53.750> fit<00:04:54.080> your<00:04:54.160> one

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
bigger size bowl that will fit your one

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:02.350 
bigger size bowl that will fit your one

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.589 

and<00:05:09.870> now<00:05:10.099> once<00:05:11.099> you<00:05:11.370> think<00:05:11.699> that<00:05:12.000> your<00:05:12.270> sauce

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599

and now once you think that your sauce
is<00:05:13.050> scared<00:05:13.680> well<00:05:14.310> enough<00:05:15.169> you<00:05:16.169> simply<00:05:16.710> take

is scared well enough you simply take

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.869 
is scared well enough you simply take
the<00:05:17.490> sauce<00:05:17.969> and<00:05:19.639> pour<00:05:20.639> it<00:05:20.939> over<00:05:22.009> the<00:05:23.009> tops<00:05:23.460> of

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
the broccoli I'll try and get you know a

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.270 

try<00:05:35.909> and<00:05:36.030> get<00:05:36.150> all<00:05:36.300> of<00:05:36.479> the<00:05:36.599> out<00:05:36.780> you<00:05:37.319> know<00:05:37.379> like

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.700 
try and get all of the out you know like
i<00:05:38.430> said<00:05:38.460> if<00:05:38.849> you<00:05:39.060> pour<00:05:39.599> it<00:05:39.780> and<00:05:39.990> you<00:05:40.169> think<00:05:40.199> that

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
i said if you pour it and you think that

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.820 
i said if you pour it and you think that
this<00:05:41.009> is<00:05:41.069> not<00:05:41.250> enough<00:05:41.759> size<00:05:42.289> to<00:05:43.289> cover<00:05:43.560> the

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
this is not enough size to cover the

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.129 
this is not enough size to cover the
broccoli<00:05:44.340> and<00:05:45.030> most<00:05:45.270> likely<00:05:45.479> if<00:05:45.840> you<00:05:45.960> use<00:05:46.110> a

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
broccoli and most likely if you use a

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.260 
broccoli and most likely if you use a
pound<00:05:46.530> or<00:05:46.919> more<00:05:47.460> than<00:05:47.639> a<00:05:47.669> pound<00:05:47.909> you're

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
pound or more than a pound you're

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.689 
pound or more than a pound you're
definitely<00:05:48.479> going<00:05:48.840> to<00:05:48.930> need<00:05:49.020> more<00:05:49.430> just<00:05:50.430> so<00:05:50.550> it

gets<00:05:50.849> the<00:05:51.090> full<00:05:51.300> flavor<00:05:51.569> and<00:05:52.460> now<00:05:53.460> once<00:05:53.729> you've

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
gets the full flavor and now once you've
