00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
existing donor hive can't get up to that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.800 
existing donor hive can't get up to that
top<00:01:34.010> double<00:01:34.430> nuke<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.150> that<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.300> make<00:01:35.510> up<00:01:35.540> think

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
top double nuke and that I make up think

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.850 
top double nuke and that I make up think
they're<00:01:35.930> tweeting<00:01:36.170> this<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.530> I'll<00:01:36.620> start

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
they're tweeting this and I'll start

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.050 
they're tweeting this and I'll start
building<00:01:37.010> clean<00:01:37.370> cells<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.230> then<00:01:40.060> eventually

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
building clean cells and then eventually

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.410 
building clean cells and then eventually
I'll<00:01:41.330> pull<00:01:41.570> out<00:01:41.690> those<00:01:41.950> boards<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.430> this

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
I'll pull out those boards and this

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.590 
I'll pull out those boards and this
whole<00:01:44.630> hive<00:01:44.870> will<00:01:45.110> finish<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:47.060> Queen<00:01:47.330> cells

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
whole hive will finish the Queen cells

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.570 
whole hive will finish the Queen cells
and<00:01:48.230> once<00:01:48.410> they're<00:01:48.590> capped<00:01:48.860> I<00:01:49.100> can<00:01:49.310> pull<00:01:49.460> this

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
and once they're capped I can pull this

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.030 
and once they're capped I can pull this
double<00:01:49.910> new<00:01:50.030> drop<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.740> probably<00:01:51.740> gonna<00:01:51.830> put

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
double new drop and probably gonna put

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.940 
double new drop and probably gonna put
it<00:01:52.130> over<00:01:52.250> there<00:01:52.430> in<00:01:52.520> that<00:01:52.550> corner<00:01:52.750> and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
it over there in that corner and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.520 
it over there in that corner and
that<00:01:55.430> way<00:01:55.750> they'll<00:01:56.750> make<00:01:56.960> their<00:01:57.170> own<00:01:57.200> Queens

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530

that way they'll make their own Queens
and<00:01:57.830> I'll<00:01:57.920> have<00:01:58.100> my<00:01:58.250> double<00:01:58.310> nuke<00:01:58.670> starting<00:01:59.090> so

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
and I'll have my double nuke starting so

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.330 
and I'll have my double nuke starting so
it<00:02:05.170> looks<00:02:06.170> like<00:02:06.229> a<00:02:06.350> couple<00:02:06.680> were<00:02:06.830> checking<00:02:07.100> it

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
it looks like a couple were checking it

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.020 
it looks like a couple were checking it
out<00:02:07.460> huh<00:02:07.700> oh<00:02:12.130> yeah<00:02:13.130> then<00:02:13.370> when<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.490> block<00:02:13.790> off

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
that quote forward tomorrow I want to

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.550 
that quote forward tomorrow I want to
pull<00:02:17.630> out<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:18.160> original<00:02:19.160> entrance<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:21.440> way

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
pull out that original entrance that way

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.270 
pull out that original entrance that way
they<00:02:21.950> can<00:02:22.100> still<00:02:22.280> get<00:02:22.400> in<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.580> bottom<00:02:22.850> hole

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
they can still get in the bottom hole

they can still get in the bottom hole
this<00:02:25.280> one's<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.640> board<00:02:25.940> doing<00:02:26.209> this

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
this one's the board doing this

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.030 
this one's the board doing this
hopefully<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.989> backs<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.470> off<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.920> they'll

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
hopefully that backs it off and they'll

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.910 
Italians that I'm trying to do the
double<00:03:05.329> nuke<00:03:07.269> split<00:03:08.269> I<00:03:08.480> think<00:03:08.840> both<00:03:09.709> were

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
double nuke split I think both were

split<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:11.180> they're<00:03:11.600> off<00:03:11.750> awesomely

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.850 
split and they're off awesomely

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
populated because you can see all the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.500 
populated because you can see all the
bees<00:03:16.010> coming<00:03:16.310> back<00:03:16.519> for<00:03:16.850> doing<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.239> can't

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
bees coming back for doing that can't

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.590

find these their entrances anyway we'll

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.940 
find these their entrances anyway we'll
get<00:03:20.720> away<00:03:20.810> from<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:21.140> height<00:03:21.320> a<00:03:21.350> minute
