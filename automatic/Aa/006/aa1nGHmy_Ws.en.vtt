00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
little bit of bubbles just a tiny bit

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.320 
little bit of bubbles just a tiny bit
but<00:00:24.410> they're<00:00:25.410> all<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.769> links<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.150> can

then there's coming up here and i have

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.510 
then there's coming up here and i have
reservoir<00:00:33.960> opened<00:00:34.320> up<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.710> all<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.370> bubbles

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
reservoir opened up so all the bubbles

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.979 
reservoir opened up so all the bubbles
like<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> caught<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.600> well<00:00:37.460> disappear<00:00:38.989> on

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
like it caught up here well disappear on

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.950 
like it caught up here well disappear on

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
water too to top close the top while I

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.740 
water too to top close the top while I
was<00:01:20.549> running<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.630> turned<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> off<00:01:22.229> no<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
was running and I turned it off no that

bubbles<00:01:24.750> over<00:01:24.990> suck<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:25.830> pushed

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
bubbles over suck in here we get pushed

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.880 
bubbles over suck in here we get pushed
out<00:01:26.909> through<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.590> pressure

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
out through here because of the pressure

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.160 
out through here because of the pressure
and<00:01:29.280> get<00:01:29.400> stuck<00:01:29.700> up<00:01:29.790> here<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.720> opened<00:01:30.960> up

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and get stuck up here then I opened up

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.050 
and get stuck up here then I opened up
the<00:01:31.229> top<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.159> whole<00:01:32.310> bunch<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.579> precious

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the top and a whole bunch of precious

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.580 
the top and a whole bunch of precious
comes<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> bubbles<00:01:34.020> come<00:01:34.470> out

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
comes up and all the bubbles come out

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.280 
comes up and all the bubbles come out
and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.750> clean<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.049> all<00:01:37.200> those

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and then the out to clean up all those

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.910 
and then the out to clean up all those
bubbles<00:01:37.710> close<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> top<00:01:38.340> or<00:01:38.970> put<00:01:39.600> more

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
bubbles close the top or put more

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
bubbles close the top or put more
coolant<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.070> close<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.670> top<00:01:42.030> renda<00:01:42.720> machine

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
coolant in close the top renda machine

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.859 
coolant in close the top renda machine
again<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.610> lot<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.729> pressure<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.240> pull<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
again a lot of pressure is pull the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.359 
again a lot of pressure is pull the
boats<00:01:46.049> come<00:01:46.290> off<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> lot<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.189> pressure

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
boats come off it's a lot of pressure

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.030 
boats come off it's a lot of pressure
here<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.759> open<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.329> more<00:01:48.570> boom<00:01:49.560> comes<00:01:49.770> out

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
here you open it and more boom comes out

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.730 
here you open it and more boom comes out
the<00:01:51.000> way<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> got<00:01:51.420> it

our foam is out I got his little bubbles

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.710 
our foam is out I got his little bubbles
but<00:02:07.730> that's<00:02:07.850> gonna<00:02:07.940> be<00:02:08.090> no<00:02:08.180> problem<00:02:08.570> because
