her<00:01:12.720> season<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.439> badly<00:01:13.770> disrupted<00:01:14.250> in

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
her season was badly disrupted in

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.730 
her season was badly disrupted in
November<00:01:15.299> when<00:01:15.509> she<00:01:15.659> broke<00:01:15.900> her<00:01:16.080> ankle<00:01:16.110> during

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
November when she broke her ankle during

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.859 
November when she broke her ankle during
training<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.520> Canada<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.570> what<00:01:18.720> are<00:01:18.840> our

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
training in Canada so what are our

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.350 
training in Canada so what are our
chances<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.650> success<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.939> if<00:01:21.240> you'd

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
chances of success I think if you'd

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.780 
chances of success I think if you'd
asked<00:01:21.570> me<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.049> same<00:01:22.080> question<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:23.040> October<00:01:23.610> I

asked me the same question in October I
was<00:01:24.299> far<00:01:24.600> more<00:01:24.630> optimistic<00:01:25.549> you<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.580> coming

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
was far more optimistic you know coming

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.999 
was far more optimistic you know coming
off<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> back<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.570> win<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:28.080> World<00:01:28.350> Cup<00:01:28.680> being
