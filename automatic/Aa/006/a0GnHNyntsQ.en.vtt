put<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.100> there's<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.060> flaw<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.659> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
put it in and there's not a flaw with it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.319 
put it in and there's not a flaw with it
take<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> look<00:01:56.219> at<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.729> think<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
take a look at this I think this is a

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.450 
take a look at this I think this is a
real<00:01:57.810> strong<00:01:58.200> contender<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> backyard

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
real strong contender for a backyard

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.030 
real strong contender for a backyard
batting<00:02:00.090> cage<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.540> spend<00:02:01.079> more<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.560> some

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
batting cage you can spend more and some

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.160 
batting cage you can spend more and some
people<00:02:02.340> need<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.659> entry<00:02:04.140> level

without<00:02:05.040> being<00:02:05.219> junk<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> very<00:02:07.740> very

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
without being junk this is a very very

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.270 
without being junk this is a very very
good<00:02:08.789> option<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:09.959> one<00:02:10.530> thing<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.800> want<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.099> show

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
good option now one thing I want to show

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.369 
good option now one thing I want to show
you<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.390> way<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.930> built<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
you is that the way this is built and

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.890 
you is that the way this is built and
again

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
again

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.410 
again
realizing<00:02:14.439> how<00:02:14.560> short<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.010> cage<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.519> is<00:02:15.730> we

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
realizing how short a cage this is we

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.970 
realizing how short a cage this is we
actually<00:02:16.450> take<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.319> put<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.620> pitching

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
actually take and put the pitching

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.149 
actually take and put the pitching
machine<00:02:18.099> outside<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.269> cage<00:02:19.590> by<00:02:20.590> doing<00:02:20.980> that

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
machine outside the cage by doing that

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.100 
machine outside the cage by doing that
we<00:02:21.370> don't<00:02:21.400> eat<00:02:21.819> up<00:02:21.970> room<00:02:22.209> inside<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.900> cage

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
we don't eat up room inside the cage

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.220 
we don't eat up room inside the cage
making<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:24.129> hitter<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.819> pitcher<00:02:25.269> area<00:02:25.599> even

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
making the hitter to pitcher area even

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.640 
making the hitter to pitcher area even
shorter<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:27.189> bottom<00:02:27.970> line<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:29.049> take<00:02:29.290> this

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
shorter so bottom line is we take this

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.449 
shorter so bottom line is we take this
cage<00:02:29.950> here<00:02:30.989> add<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.409> with<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> heater<00:02:33.010> Junior

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
cage here add this with a heater Junior
