00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.460
 Hello dear friends, this is another 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.230
 Guide on forestry and in this video I 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.949
 I will tell about what was added in the new 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.269
 versions of forestry for minecraft 1.5.2 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.429
 So let's begin perhaps the most delicious and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.050
 an interesting introduction would be 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.649
 butterflies butterflies performs the function 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.239
 tree pollination and they are in fact on 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.700
 description they must understand trees could 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.489
 faster than the bee character and butterflies on 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.160
 just throw out a little wait here and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.469
 they started flying 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.590
 catch them on the net also like kul and but 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.930
 We still get them to a point and you have it 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:01.350
 you can catch a butterfly from 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.149
 trees forestry any tree who you are 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.850
 you will be able to withdraw forestry 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.159
 net sums foliage will be available 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.880
 a butterfly and so the next one collect it 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.330
 pollen or something like that there must be put 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.330
 us 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:26.210
 silky this here this silky 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.450
 figure then put and she will give 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.009
 us pollen 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.560
 on the face of the trees she will give and 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:38.560
 with the help of this pollen we can 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:43.130
 take any tree that is we will take 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:48.790
 Well welcome here we will plant 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.790
 any tree 3 wow 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.670
 take the bone meal say the tree doctors and 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:01.490
 and right click on the foliage 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:07.390
 voila foliage has become unusual now we 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.390
 we will cut them off and see the result 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:22.140
 that is, the publishing house has mutated it 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 like a notation with bees, something like this 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:31.630
 as get new trees 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:36.580
 when getting 1 fingers before 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:39.520
 silky stuff is spent so 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.670
 the next innovation is also 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.620
 refers to the butterfly this is the analyzer 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.260
 butterflies and butterfly chest analyze 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.720
 done like this in honey 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.450
 butterfly chests 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.900
 it has the same interface 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.380
 the most as with chelas now we will check 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:06.570
 what will put there any butterfly 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:10.050
 nothing especially analyzer same 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.050
 that's a little different 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.810
 here we see a bitch vovochku can 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.460
 spawn tutmos iii 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.310
 conditions like all with both with bees and 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:31.750
 a little description also over bawe 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:36.880
 two new blocks is a workbench which 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.830
 remembers recipes and manual engine 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.840
 if you don't respect the new mouse pad 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.970
 it will charge and give energy with 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.100
 middle mechanism so the next is n 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.430
 scripts 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:57.870
 this is something like a new mini-game introduced 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.870
 here we must guess 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.989
 what is here so we see here 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.989
 the bees are fine 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.660
 now we see nothing 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.370
 here we were given what kind of flower eden 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.370
 And you want to see what the computer 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:28.200
 it seems I understood what it is now we 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.200
 let's try 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.990
 I could and 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.260
 put 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.230
 food as you can see we are all that he has 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.660
 three of you one mutation we can we know 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.320
 that she can mutate in tropical 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:53.620
 bee virtually nothing to not 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:55.360
 It is not needed as this way when Crocs here 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.680
 in this way carpenters us 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:04.330
 need half a liter of oil and terem 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:07.200
 it turns out such here and so workbench 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.140
 russell toni tone book workbench chest 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.070
 Children in short from the brass stein not hours 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.820

 somewhere he takes us here no there 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:44.290
 So 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.240

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.730

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:47.490
 much bigger than normal and stronger 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:50.479
