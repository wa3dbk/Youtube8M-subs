00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.930 
this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
and<00:02:54.160> up<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.600> 15<00:02:56.100> now<00:02:57.100> I'm<00:02:57.220> sourced<00:02:57.519> angles

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
and up to 15 now I'm sourced angles

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.550 
and up to 15 now I'm sourced angles
because<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.650> different<00:03:00.390> feel<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.690> it

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
because it's a different feel and it

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.880 
because it's a different feel and it
hits<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.769> different<00:03:03.160> part<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.239> chest<00:03:04.890> one

hits a different part of the chest one

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.699 
hits a different part of the chest one
is<00:03:06.069> up<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.310> chest<00:03:06.549> one<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.660> lower<00:03:07.840> chance<00:03:08.140> okay

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
is up the chest one is lower chance okay

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.009 
is up the chest one is lower chance okay
now<00:03:09.549> we<00:03:09.670> take<00:03:09.819> this<00:03:10.000> chair<00:03:10.920> set<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.040> chair<00:03:13.019> to

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
now we take this chair set the chair to

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.030 
now we take this chair set the chair to
the<00:03:14.049> side<00:03:14.350> like<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:16.420> i'm<00:03:16.540> actually<00:03:16.980> at<00:03:17.980> a

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.900 
15
I<00:03:45.280> will<00:03:45.850> do<00:03:46.000> four<00:03:46.510> sets<00:03:46.540> of<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:47.020> okay<00:03:47.560> now<00:03:48.220> you

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
I will do four sets of that okay now you

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.900 
I will do four sets of that okay now you
probably<00:03:49.120> can<00:03:49.390> tell<00:03:49.600> that<00:03:49.840> I'm<00:03:50.880> starting<00:03:51.880> to

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
get out of breath that's because the

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.340 
get out of breath that's because the
blood<00:03:54.160> is<00:03:54.310> rushing<00:03:54.340> through<00:03:54.880> those<00:03:55.060> areas<00:03:55.480> and
