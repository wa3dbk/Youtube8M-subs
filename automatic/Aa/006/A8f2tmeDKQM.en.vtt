00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
just a little thing and of course it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.689 
just a little thing and of course it
could<00:00:51.719> change<00:00:51.750> going<00:00:52.620> into<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> future<00:00:53.250> but

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
layer of strategy I can see it in a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.600 
layer of strategy I can see it in a
competitive<00:01:40.619> environment<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.430> going<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
save my teammates tag if I do that could

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.460 
save my teammates tag if I do that could
risk<00:01:50.159> both<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.640> us<00:01:50.759> dying<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:52.259> there

risk both of us dying or if I get there
you<00:01:52.590> know<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.950> time<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.369> could<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.700> could<00:01:53.880> save

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
you know in time I could I could save

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.700 
you know in time I could I could save
him<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.750> could<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.020> two<00:01:55.200> players<00:01:55.470> up

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
him and then we could be two players up

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.219 
him and then we could be two players up
or<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.640> two<00:01:56.820> players<00:01:57.060> down<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.990> it's

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
or you do be two players down so it's

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.630 
or you do be two players down so it's
very<00:01:58.380> interesting<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> because<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> mean

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
very interesting in that because I mean

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.920 
very interesting in that because I mean
you<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> lot<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> decisions<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.750> in

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you get a lot of decisions like that in

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.139 
you get a lot of decisions like that in
game<00:02:01.140> anyway<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> rush<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.030> that

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
game anyway it's like do I rush for that

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.600 
game anyway it's like do I rush for that
or<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.540> leave<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.009> even<00:02:05.460> more

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
or do I leave it and then is even more

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.800 
or do I leave it and then is even more
important<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.600> could<00:02:06.719> be

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
important now because you could be

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.290 
important now because you could be
saving<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.229> teammate<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:07.940> anyway<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> skipped

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
saving a teammate so anyway I skipped

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.729 
saving a teammate so anyway I skipped

the first round now with two rounds up
and<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:11.220> decided<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.670> switch<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> snipers

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the full amount of aim assist so

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.610 
the full amount of aim assist so
hopefully<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.110> know<00:02:52.200> that's<00:02:52.380> going<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.560> be

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
hopefully you know that's going to be

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.680 
hopefully you know that's going to be
quite<00:02:52.800> good<00:02:52.920> for<00:02:53.070> snipers<00:02:53.519> in<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:54.180> full<00:02:54.390> game

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
quite good for snipers in the full game

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.470 
quite good for snipers in the full game

was<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> lot<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.870> fun<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.290> use<00:03:04.319> i<00:03:04.530> believe<00:03:04.739> thats

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
was a lot of fun to use i believe thats

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.840 
was a lot of fun to use i believe thats
a<00:03:05.040> sniper<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:06.150> we're<00:03:06.300> using<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:08.580> thing

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
a sniper that we're using and the thing

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.370 
a sniper that we're using and the thing
with<00:03:09.060> search<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.420> rescue<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.810> when<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.170> bomb

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
with search and rescue is when the bomb

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.100 
with search and rescue is when the bomb
is<00:03:10.590> planted<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.160> it's<00:03:11.340> 1v<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.300> know<00:03:12.450> three<00:03:12.989> or

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
is planted and it's 1v you know three or

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.500 
is planted and it's 1v you know three or
four<00:03:13.350> it's<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.950> much<00:03:14.220> more<00:03:14.459> difficult<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:15.330> pull

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
four it's so much more difficult to pull

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.970 
four it's so much more difficult to pull
off<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.660> cuts<00:03:16.080> you<00:03:16.230> really<00:03:16.560> need<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.769> play

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
off that cuts you really need to play

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.740 
off that cuts you really need to play
smart<00:03:17.670> because<00:03:17.790> you've<00:03:18.000> got<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> denied<00:03:18.450> enemy

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
smart because you've got a denied enemy

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.750 
smart because you've got a denied enemy
types<00:03:18.989> which<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.350> so<00:03:19.530> difficult<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:20.130> do<00:03:20.250> when

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
types which is so difficult to do when

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.580 
types which is so difficult to do when
there's<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.030> many<00:03:21.120> other<00:03:21.360> enemies<00:03:21.870> on<00:03:22.410> your

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
there's so many other enemies on your

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.090 
there's so many other enemies on your
case<00:03:22.829> not<00:03:23.760> quite<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.450> accurate<00:03:25.170> sniper<00:03:25.860> shots

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.470 
case not quite the accurate sniper shots
well<00:03:26.280> spectating<00:03:26.760> here<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:26.940> mean<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.239> could

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
well spectating here I mean this could

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.210 
well spectating here I mean this could
have<00:03:27.630> been<00:03:27.660> quite<00:03:28.170> good<00:03:28.200> just<00:03:28.410> pick<00:03:28.890> probably

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
have been quite good just pick probably

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.039 
have been quite good just pick probably
the<00:03:29.280> wrong<00:03:29.400> target<00:03:29.670> there<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.360> then<00:03:30.810> BAM

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
the wrong target there and then BAM

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.360 
the wrong target there and then BAM
straight<00:03:31.410> out<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.739> when<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:31.950> last<00:03:32.160> player

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
straight out so when the last player

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.710 
straight out so when the last player
does<00:03:32.610> die<00:03:32.790> obviously<00:03:33.180> there's<00:03:33.360> gonna<00:03:33.450> be<00:03:33.570> none

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
does die obviously there's gonna be none

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.240 
does die obviously there's gonna be none
to<00:03:33.810> pick<00:03:33.930> up<00:03:34.049> that<00:03:34.170> tag<00:03:34.410> so<00:03:34.890> that's<00:03:35.040> straight

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
to pick up that tag so that's straight

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.880 
to pick up that tag so that's straight
out<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.640> game<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:37.410> rest<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.620> my<00:03:37.680> team

didn't think I actually made this class
I<00:03:50.400> think<00:03:50.579> was<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.820> default<00:03:51.120> one<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.299> picked<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:52.049> I

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
I think was a default one I picked so I

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.479 
I think was a default one I picked so I
want<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.380> pick<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.799> last<00:03:52.980> one<00:03:53.190> ping

want to pick that and the last one ping

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:54.979 
want to pick that and the last one ping
when<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.329> kill<00:03:54.570> people

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
when you kill people

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.440 
when you kill people
it<00:03:55.170> puts<00:03:55.440> other<00:03:55.650> enemies<00:03:56.040> nearby<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.549> on<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
it puts other enemies nearby you on the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.150 
it puts other enemies nearby you on the
radar<00:03:57.870> like<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.140> little<00:03:58.410> bit<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.680> portable

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
radar like a little bit of a portable

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.789

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.590 
radar when you get a kill this guy back
here<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.400> felt<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:02.970> shot<00:04:03.299> should<00:04:03.480> of

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
here I felt that that shot should of

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.050 
here I felt that that shot should of
here<00:04:03.810> maybe<00:04:04.470> not<00:04:04.709> maybe<00:04:04.920> not<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:05.910> was<00:04:06.030> just

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
here maybe not maybe not but I was just

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.610

waiting<00:04:06.450> on<00:04:06.510> this<00:04:06.660> guy<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.230> think<00:04:07.410> someone

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
waiting on this guy and I think someone

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.440 
waiting on this guy and I think someone
