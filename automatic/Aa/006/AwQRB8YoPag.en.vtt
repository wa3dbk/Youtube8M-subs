00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.030 

this<00:03:22.909> is<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.090> firm<00:03:23.599> medium<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.200> fast<00:03:24.470> tempo

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
this is a firm medium to fast tempo

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.490 
this is a firm medium to fast tempo
whenever<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.580> can<00:03:25.760> play<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.239> fast<00:03:26.780> sixteenth

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
whenever you can play the fast sixteenth

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.820 
whenever you can play the fast sixteenth
notes<00:03:27.769> it's<00:03:28.519> a<00:03:28.909> prayer<00:03:29.299> it's<00:03:29.690> better<00:03:30.049> at<00:03:30.590> least

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
notes it's a prayer it's better at least

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.670 
notes it's a prayer it's better at least
that's<00:03:31.610> what<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.790> prefer<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.239> play<00:03:32.680> something

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
that's what I prefer to play something

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:46.890 
that's what I prefer to play something
like<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:42.489> Samba<00:03:43.900> but<00:03:44.900> with<00:03:45.110> all<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.410> six<00:03:45.680> things

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
like a Samba but with all the six things

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.369 
like a Samba but with all the six things
faster<00:03:47.900> than<00:03:48.049> that<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:50.540> pick<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.079> one<00:03:51.260> of

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
faster than that you you pick the one of

00:03:51.379 --> 00:04:30.529 
faster than that you you pick the one of
the<00:03:51.500> two<00:03:51.739> styles<00:03:52.510> mainly<00:03:53.510> prefer<00:03:54.140> this<00:03:54.500> one

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.059 

other<00:04:31.539> ways<00:04:31.840> that<00:04:32.080> you<00:04:32.139> can<00:04:32.319> play<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.710> some<00:04:32.919> of

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.069 
other ways that you can play the some of

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.960 
other ways that you can play the some of
the<00:04:33.160> drumset<00:04:33.750> we'll<00:04:34.750> be<00:04:34.870> using<00:04:35.080> that<00:04:35.970> pseudo

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
the drumset we'll be using that pseudo

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.960 
the drumset we'll be using that pseudo
pattern<00:04:37.690> on<00:04:38.080> -<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:39.069> can<00:04:39.280> use<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.639> photon

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.330 

today<00:04:42.970> I'm<00:04:43.090> using<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.810> Evans<00:04:44.440> g1<00:04:45.039> heads

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
today I'm using the Evans g1 heads

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.820 
today I'm using the Evans g1 heads
that's<00:04:45.669> what<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:45.910> like<00:04:46.150> to<00:04:46.180> use<00:04:47.139> here<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.740> I

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
that's what I like to use here and I

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.570 
that's what I like to use here and I
like<00:04:47.979> to<00:04:48.160> use<00:04:49.199> genera<00:04:50.199> dry<00:04:50.560> on<00:04:50.770> my<00:04:50.949> four<00:04:51.250> tone

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
like to use genera dry on my four tone

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.070 
like to use genera dry on my four tone
just<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:52.030> have<00:04:53.460> drier<00:04:54.460> sound<00:04:54.849> basically<00:04:55.630> short

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
just to have drier sound basically short

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.980 
just to have drier sound basically short
of<00:04:58.289> sound<00:04:59.759> so<00:05:00.759> the<00:05:01.060> technique<00:05:01.509> to<00:05:01.659> play<00:05:01.840> that

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
of sound so the technique to play that

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:10.309 
of sound so the technique to play that
sort<00:05:02.289> of<00:05:02.440> here<00:05:02.680> is<00:05:02.770> going<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:03.009> be<00:05:03.190> like<00:05:03.340> this

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:34.120 

and<00:05:11.319> you<00:05:11.380> apply<00:05:12.310> everything<00:05:12.610> else<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.539> say

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.999 

this<00:05:35.130> is<00:05:35.310> a<00:05:35.340> second<00:05:36.120> way<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:36.650> then<00:05:37.650> there<00:05:37.860> is

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
this is a second way and then there is

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.469 
this is a second way and then there is
the<00:05:38.400> butter<00:05:38.639> color<00:05:38.970> way<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.389> play<00:05:39.900> on<00:05:40.169> the<00:05:40.380> set

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
the butter color way to play on the set

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.710 
the butter color way to play on the set
where<00:05:42.479> you<00:05:42.509> try<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:42.960> get<00:05:43.259> the<00:05:43.530> sound<00:05:44.190> of<00:05:44.720> 300

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
where you try to get the sound of 300

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.600 
where you try to get the sound of 300
people<00:05:45.870> playing<00:05:46.530> those<00:05:46.740> instruments<00:05:47.069> on<00:05:47.460> the

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
people playing those instruments on the

00:05:47.610 --> 00:06:25.790 
people playing those instruments on the
drum<00:05:47.849> set<00:05:47.900> this<00:05:48.900> up<00:05:49.169> like<00:05:49.199> this

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.470 

all<00:06:26.800> right<00:06:27.010> so<00:06:27.190> that's<00:06:27.370> a<00:06:27.700> little<00:06:27.910> bit<00:06:28.060> of<00:06:28.210> some

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
all right so that's a little bit of some

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.350 
all right so that's a little bit of some
drum<00:06:28.900> set<00:06:29.170> and<00:06:29.410> I<00:06:30.100> hope<00:06:30.310> you<00:06:30.520> have<00:06:30.790> fun<00:06:31.030> doing
