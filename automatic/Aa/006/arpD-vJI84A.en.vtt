00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
background now the reason that those two

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.349 
background now the reason that those two
different<00:01:02.309> things<00:01:02.489> are<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.879> important<00:01:03.300> to

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
different things are really important to

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.899 
different things are really important to
understand<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.140> one<00:01:04.470> happens<00:01:05.159> from<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> lens

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
understand is one happens from the lens

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.340 
understand is one happens from the lens
you're<00:01:06.210> controlling<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> lens

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
you're controlling that from the lens

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
you're controlling that from the lens
that's<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> focus<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.610> other<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
that's the focus and the other one the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
that's the focus and the other one the
blur<00:01:09.570> you're<00:01:10.049> controlling<00:01:10.590> with<00:01:10.710> your

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
blur you're controlling with your

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.530 
blur you're controlling with your
camera's<00:01:11.220> shutter<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.270> need<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
camera's shutter and so we need to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.789 
camera's shutter and so we need to
understand<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> difference<00:01:13.439> between<00:01:13.680> those

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
understand the difference between those

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.320 
understand the difference between those
two<00:01:13.860> things<00:01:14.220> because<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> can't<00:01:15.210> figure

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
two things because if you can't figure

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.820 
two things because if you can't figure
those<00:01:15.570> two<00:01:15.659> things<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.290> can't<00:01:16.650> either

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
those two things out you can't either

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
those two things out you can't either
reproduce<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> every<00:01:17.670> time<00:01:17.790> or<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> can't<00:01:18.330> fix

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
reproduce it every time or you can't fix

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.910 
reproduce it every time or you can't fix
it<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.750> you're<00:01:18.900> having<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.140> problem<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.830> we're

let's<00:01:30.420> start<00:01:30.570> by<00:01:30.720> talking<00:01:30.780> about<00:01:31.170> focus<00:01:31.950> what

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
let's start by talking about focus what

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.980 
let's start by talking about focus what
I<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.579> right<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.240> my<00:01:33.329> camera<00:01:33.600> set

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
I have right now is have my camera set

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.679 
I have right now is have my camera set
so<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.350> focused<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.579> on<00:01:35.790> Lynn<00:01:36.119> so

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
so it's focused right here on Lynn so

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.810 
so it's focused right here on Lynn so
this<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.140> focus<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.040> background<00:01:38.070> back

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
this is in focus and the background back

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.120 
this is in focus and the background back
there<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.240> out<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.630> focus<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
there is out of focus so that's not a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.560 
there is out of focus so that's not a
blurry<00:01:41.490> background<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:42.090> an<00:01:42.180> out-of-focus

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
blurry background it's an out-of-focus

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.060 
blurry background it's an out-of-focus
background<00:01:43.049> let<00:01:43.140> me<00:01:43.200> show<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.470> exactly<00:01:43.860> what

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
background let me show you exactly what

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.740 
background let me show you exactly what
I'm<00:01:44.159> talking<00:01:44.430> about<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.210> my<00:01:45.360> camera

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
I'm talking about so I have my camera

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.080 
I'm talking about so I have my camera
set<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.140> an<00:01:46.229> aperture<00:01:46.439> value<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> 2.8<00:01:47.610> that

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
set to an aperture value of 2.8 that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.670 
set to an aperture value of 2.8 that
gives<00:01:48.270> us<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.630> shallow<00:01:49.049> depth<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.619> field

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
gives us really shallow depth of field

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.319 
gives us really shallow depth of field
trying<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.549> more<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.729> depth<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.149> field

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
trying to know more about depth of field

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.399 
trying to know more about depth of field

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
background is out of focus now watch

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.729 
background is out of focus now watch
this<00:02:08.610> I'm<00:02:09.060> gonna<00:02:09.179> shift<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.539> manual<00:02:09.929> focus<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
this I'm gonna shift to manual focus and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.710 
this I'm gonna shift to manual focus and
I'm<00:02:10.920> going<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> twist<00:02:11.580> my<00:02:11.819> lens<00:02:12.209> until<00:02:12.480> I'm

I'm going to twist my lens until I'm

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.930 
I'm going to twist my lens until I'm
focused<00:02:13.050> on<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> background

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940

take another picture and now you can see
that<00:02:17.520> what<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.210> an<00:02:18.360> out-of-focus

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
that what we have is an out-of-focus

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.050 
that what we have is an out-of-focus
picture<00:02:19.740> it's<00:02:20.280> not<00:02:20.430> blurry

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
picture it's not blurry

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.660 
picture it's not blurry
she's<00:02:21.510> out-of-focus<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.800> fix<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.130> image

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
she's out-of-focus so to fix this image

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.550 
she's out-of-focus so to fix this image
what<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.850> need<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.390> focus<00:02:24.780> with<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.350> lens

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
what I need to do is focus with the lens

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.380 
what I need to do is focus with the lens
so<00:02:26.220> I'll<00:02:26.370> do<00:02:26.520> that<00:02:26.700> we're<00:02:26.880> going<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.030> shoot<00:02:27.210> one

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
so I'll do that we're going to shoot one

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.270 
so I'll do that we're going to shoot one
more<00:02:27.600> here<00:02:27.930> yay

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
more here yay

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.240 
more here yay
perfect<00:02:29.910> all<00:02:30.630> right<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:31.110> fixed<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.440> image<00:02:31.800> so

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
perfect all right we fixed that image so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.800 
perfect all right we fixed that image so
that's<00:02:32.370> focus<00:02:32.940> well<00:02:33.240> now<00:02:33.390> let's<00:02:33.630> talk<00:02:33.750> about

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
that's focus well now let's talk about

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.830 
that's focus well now let's talk about
blur<00:02:34.530> blur<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.310> cost<00:02:35.550> when<00:02:35.940> your<00:02:36.180> shutter<00:02:36.600> is

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
blur blur is cost when your shutter is

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.690 
blur blur is cost when your shutter is
open<00:02:36.960> on<00:02:37.200> your<00:02:37.290> camera<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.920> camera<00:02:38.370> moves

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
open on your camera and the camera moves

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.640 
open on your camera and the camera moves
and<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.660> what<00:02:39.810> happens<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.230> when<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.380> shutter

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
and so what happens is when that shutter

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.930 
and so what happens is when that shutter
is<00:02:40.770> open<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.190> everything<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.580> moving<00:02:41.700> you're

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
is open and everything is moving you're

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.980 
is open and everything is moving you're
getting<00:02:42.120> all<00:02:42.240> kinds<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.570> light<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.930> that

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
getting all kinds of light and that

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.170 
getting all kinds of light and that
causes<00:02:43.260> blur<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.520> let<00:02:44.790> me<00:02:44.910> show<00:02:45.120> you

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
causes blur and so let me show you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.610 
causes blur and so let me show you
exactly<00:02:45.450> what's<00:02:45.810> happening<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.410> what<00:02:46.530> I've

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
exactly what's happening so what I've

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.410 
exactly what's happening so what I've
done<00:02:46.740> here<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.010> I've<00:02:47.130> changed<00:02:47.160> my<00:02:47.700> aperture

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
done here is I've changed my aperture

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.050 
done here is I've changed my aperture
value<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.050> 16<00:02:49.470> I've<00:02:49.620> closed<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.250> way<00:02:50.430> down<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
value to 16 I've closed it way down and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.820 
value to 16 I've closed it way down and
by<00:02:51.450> doing<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:52.140> can<00:02:52.200> slow<00:02:52.590> my<00:02:52.800> shutter

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
by doing that I can slow my shutter

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.800 
by doing that I can slow my shutter
speed<00:02:53.310> down<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:54.150> my<00:02:54.240> shutter<00:02:54.510> speed<00:02:54.570> is

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
speed down so my shutter speed is

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.540 
speed down so my shutter speed is
actually<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:55.170> twentieth<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.100> second<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.520> a

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
actually a twentieth of a second it's a

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.340 
actually a twentieth of a second it's a
really<00:02:56.820> slow<00:02:57.330> shutter<00:02:57.570> speed<00:02:57.840> but<00:02:58.020> I've<00:02:58.230> got

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
really slow shutter speed but I've got

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.840 
really slow shutter speed but I've got
this<00:02:58.470> tripod<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.220> what<00:02:59.370> I'm<00:02:59.460> going<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.640> first

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
this tripod so what I'm going to first

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.360 
this tripod so what I'm going to first
do<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.240> is<00:03:00.750> I'm<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.200> focus<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.920> leann

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
do here is I'm going to focus on leann

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.320 
do here is I'm going to focus on leann
like<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.610> did<00:03:02.820> before

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
like I did before

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.510 
like I did before
lock<00:03:03.810> down<00:03:03.840> my<00:03:04.230> tripod<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.980> Lyanna<00:03:05.190> be<00:03:05.310> really

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
lock down my tripod and Lyanna be really

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.600 
lock down my tripod and Lyanna be really
still<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:07.290> I'll<00:03:07.410> take<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.650> picture<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.490> we<00:03:08.580> can

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
still and I'll take a picture and we can

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.940 
still and I'll take a picture and we can
see<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.210> looks<00:03:09.780> pretty<00:03:10.050> clear<00:03:10.530> but

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
see that that looks pretty clear but

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.950 
see that that looks pretty clear but
what<00:03:11.160> would<00:03:11.340> happen<00:03:11.790> if<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.180> loosened<00:03:12.780> up<00:03:12.870> my

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
what would happen if I loosened up my

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.320 
what would happen if I loosened up my
tripod<00:03:13.200> here<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.160> took<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.490> same<00:03:14.790> picture

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
tripod here and I took the same picture

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.199 
tripod here and I took the same picture
and<00:03:15.570> my<00:03:16.020> camera's<00:03:16.470> moving<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.790> now<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:17.970> can

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
and my camera's moving and now you can

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.020 
and my camera's moving and now you can
see<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.660> that<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:19.020> blurry<00:03:19.530> picture<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.550> so

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
see that that is a blurry picture and so

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.640 
see that that is a blurry picture and so
to<00:03:21.090> fix<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.480> what<00:03:21.840> we<00:03:21.930> need<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.200> do<00:03:22.320> is<00:03:22.530> we

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
to fix that what we need to do is we

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.620 
to fix that what we need to do is we
need<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:22.920> speed<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.370> our<00:03:23.580> shutter<00:03:23.880> or<00:03:24.300> use<00:03:24.600> a

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
need to speed up our shutter or use a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.570 
need to speed up our shutter or use a
tripod<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.950> is<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> difference

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
tripod and that is the difference

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.770 
tripod and that is the difference
between<00:03:26.610> something<00:03:27.000> that's<00:03:27.120> blurry<00:03:27.510> and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
between something that's blurry and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.270 
between something that's blurry and
something<00:03:28.260> that's<00:03:28.350> out<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.680> focus<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.100> don't

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
something that's out of focus so don't

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.949 
something that's out of focus so don't
confuse<00:03:29.610> those<00:03:29.790> two<00:03:29.850> things<00:03:30.180> because<00:03:30.750> if<00:03:30.870> you

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
confuse those two things because if you

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.080 
confuse those two things because if you
want<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.140> nice<00:03:31.260> out-of-focus<00:03:31.770> background<00:03:32.550> and

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
want a nice out-of-focus background and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.310 
want a nice out-of-focus background and
what<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.270> need<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.420> do<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.690> use<00:03:33.840> your<00:03:33.959> aperture

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
what you need to do is use your aperture

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.140 
what you need to do is use your aperture
if<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.130> want<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.310> blurry<00:03:35.520> picture<00:03:35.610> while<00:03:36.030> you

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
if you want a blurry picture while you

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.729 
if you want a blurry picture while you
slow<00:03:36.360> down<00:03:36.540> your<00:03:36.750> shutter<00:03:36.959> speed<00:03:37.050> or<00:03:37.590> if<00:03:37.680> you

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
slow down your shutter speed or if you

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.680 
slow down your shutter speed or if you
want<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:37.950> fix<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.220> blur<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.360> speed<00:03:39.570> up<00:03:39.660> your

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
want to fix the blur to speed up your

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.330 
want to fix the blur to speed up your
shutter<00:03:40.020> speed<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.530> idea<00:03:40.890> don't

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
shutter speed you get the idea don't

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.070 
shutter speed you get the idea don't
interchange<00:03:41.850> blurry<00:03:42.209> without<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> focus

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
interchange blurry without a focus

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.960 
interchange blurry without a focus
they're<00:03:43.500> not<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.950> same<00:03:44.100> thing<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.700> once<00:03:44.880> you

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
they're not the same thing and once you

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.040 
they're not the same thing and once you
know<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.209> difference<00:03:45.570> you'll<00:03:45.690> be<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:45.840> better

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050
