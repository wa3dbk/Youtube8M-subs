00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
feels very solid it feels like a really

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.790 
feels very solid it feels like a really
good<00:02:06.120> quality<00:02:06.480> case<00:02:06.660> it's<00:02:07.260> rubber<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
good quality case it's rubber on the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.859 
good quality case it's rubber on the
inside<00:02:08.100> and<00:02:08.369> then<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.700> has<00:02:08.850> this<00:02:09.060> plastic

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
inside and then it has this plastic

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.290 
inside and then it has this plastic
overlay<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:10.980> kind<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.160> glossy<00:02:11.670> as<00:02:12.270> a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
overlay so it's kind of glossy as a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.690 
overlay so it's kind of glossy as a
finish<00:02:12.980> there<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.450> think<00:02:15.450> these<00:02:15.750> two<00:02:16.740> but<00:02:17.040> metal

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
finish there I think these two but metal

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.390 
finish there I think these two but metal
buttons<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.270> hole<00:02:19.110> for<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.380> mute<00:02:20.130> and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
buttons and the hole for the mute and

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.010
