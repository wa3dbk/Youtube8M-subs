00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.020
 that I had the pleasure of seeing him do 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.389
 just a couple of weeks in 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.500
 new york obviously was a thief 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.590
 of the television station that transmitted this the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.279
 all star game yesterday new york 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.369
 grandfather na 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.320
 what is interesting is the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.369
 size of his wife I think it's more 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.369
 short his people 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.340
 also last year in the game of 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.340
 115 stars one the ball one ball 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.140
 the paper or the basketball ball me the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.140

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.860

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.540
 and with heels 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.620
 one can not stop thinking about certain 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.620
 things but good 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.900
 It's Wednesday and it's three quarters for 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.470
 the photo that I have already heard the pachuca 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.540
 the cross came yesterday its a pity 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.600
 because in the hidalgo stadium they had 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.820
 tied 2 to 2 against the montreal impact 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.000
 it seems to me that there is loses is there 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.860
 look at you and I'll tell you I have the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.900
 great advantage thank god to be 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.610
 here and be able to say this because how many 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.590
 we want the last word do not stay 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.750
 how and what do you want to discuss to those of 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.610
 the last word and yesterday I said don 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.039
 manolo lapuente that the pachuca was better 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.420
 no it's not true it was not better one thing is 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.280
 have had more time the ball and 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.590
 something else that has been better seems to me 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.910
 that it is incredible that these heights of 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.220
 bale now yes that these heights of 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.380
 party win us in the strategy the 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.030
 impact of montreal was very good 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.770
 standing in the area that had to be 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.500
 stopped him complicated the match to pachuca 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.929
 never arrived never arrived with danger 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.460
 he never arrives with danger to crash me 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.619
 it seems that they made very good game very 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.789
 strategic smart obviously not 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.619
 they are the barcelona and they know it and they play with 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.390
 the conditions they have with the 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.110
 resources that they have and it seems to me 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.360
 amazing 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.880
 better the impact technician of montreal 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.490
 that what the truth did the lord 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.360
 alonso yesterday with the pachuca and from the 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.970
 match 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.070
 that's where he loses it and that's why I say 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.950
 don manolo lapuente excuse me not 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.320
 I agree with you this time it was not for 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.510
 nothing better the pachuca even when the 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.570
 world had to attack until with much 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.610
 better with cats and how 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.350
 lose not that at home draws and 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.690
 also here in the last seconds of 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.580
 silence as accompanying injury of the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.560
 bowling draw in secret by the way 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.840
 they lost is still worse but good 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.400
 I promise you nothing I promise you that I 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.959
 I would have said like I had not 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.720
 liked nothing in the performance of the pachuca 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.520
 in general in that tie although 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.760
 I would have ended up winning rain 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.320
 said I won by sticking out my tongue I swear 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.670
 which is what I thought to say however 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.310
 I think it was fair that I lost 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.080
 well what was tragic is that outside 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.459
 but at the last minute and that in the end 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.020
 the Canadians take it but for 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.580
 all Mexicans who keep the 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.830
 thorn good for today the america 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.150
 will be receiving the boys at home 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.150
 of saprissa the mons
