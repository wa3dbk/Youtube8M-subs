you<00:02:50.810> know<00:02:50.930> actually<00:02:51.610> it's<00:02:52.610> these<00:02:52.910> teams<00:02:53.240> it's

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
you know actually it's these teams it's

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.059 
you know actually it's these teams it's
a<00:02:53.690> little<00:02:53.959> bit<00:02:54.050> heavier<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.530> course<00:02:54.770> is<00:02:54.980> the
