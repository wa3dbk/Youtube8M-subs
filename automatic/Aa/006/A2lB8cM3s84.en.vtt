 there 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.980
 via swivel called percent here were cases with institute percent today 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.240
 such big tractor big-gerau programs the new the new software 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.079
 by Brahms in Texas Instruments 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.949
 Both nose versions have the Traktor Scratch on the computer 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.800
 prophète »if you hear the little overview give the beginning times ran forward 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.769
 with the introduction trade over to the interface as new software 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.699
 does it look like what are the big changes anyway in the look 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.840
 Oppermann the worker to the workflow what is new so degree compared to 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:45.339
 Today tractor 3 four jobs exactly the rtr tractor scratch version 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:46.600
 Fire 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.510
 Federal Office with then even a final assessment at the end from now on 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.810
 Parking space couple tips give woman direction percent 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:02.070
 So good of all, therefore, have 1 of Sager Feuers still smiles always 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.870
 short percent by so 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.230
 many have bitterly even looked at the west side 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.740
 Tractor this to have lists to crowd the verdict microsite 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.840
 there you can actually find percent in the rough all the information 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.820
 so that evening still cards the tractor Forum Mambo questions on what 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.009
 now agree these differences between the two solutions there are indeed Laumann 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.860
 Just tractor scratch per pound tractor happy so both are percent based 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.969
 On the same on the same basis is Traktor Scratch pro's classes 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.340
 Principle the same as tractor Profumo that is just about theirs 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.120
 Timecode functionality has been expanded and percent 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.270
 m last EM also the u8 interfaces is now just antenna 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.270
 percent according to web-tv Seidler has allowed the interface that would 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.700
 so it's been around since 2004 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 Tractor pro costs 199 euros in the eighth and software version tractor 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.820
 Scratch pro to just with the 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.200
 Audio 8 interface converted percent for 600 euros to have Baumann high quality 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.050
 Interface in any case with 8 3 0 go out defense while lifting 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.350
 if everything has to be everything is the question but it is definitely one of the total 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.050
 Possibilities very very open and percent I think too »so count 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.870
 explain the producing time as it definitely reveals meaningful ones 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.269
 Investment where you might save even the second sound card 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.629
 Exactly then there are still more options from Red so owners of the 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.680
 Pageant the tractor scratch version these may currently have lead 79 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.900
 Euro simply the desire for more because they from Greven as well as tractor 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.849
 Scratch soil together the tractor studio so tractor 3 4+ day that 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:50.919
 economic 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:56.129
 when camping at Getafe Instruments Percent for free download code 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.179
 yes to the installation is actually quite simple 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:01.639
 so I have percent 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.359
 Just downloaded by Dr. Madeleines since Kurt Beck on the souls of 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.619
 Wall will be sent directly by e-mail 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.800
 that's what net Instruments offers 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.430
 you enter the series Grandma Irene Nadler the whole 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.709
 whereupon the software is released evening is important here at the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.229
 Activation at the first start of iAd 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:26.029
 There is a choice of Tractor Scratch Porsche Tractor pro tractors 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:30.019
 In the best case, there have already been several animals in the country 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.139
 Forum percent for support or help 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.359
 Baumann that's just the difference how to be winterized 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.859
 appropriate and if you have access to the file in the code 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.419
 Functionality Dept 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.649
 because year we are already on the topic interface so what's new that he 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:52.659
 recorded first apparently is the biggest change there and the optics 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.529
 Ladies tractor is percent 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:04:00.339
 Quaas their death is the structure and remained the same but on 9 the optics 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:06.209
 have been rejuvenated significantly each time so overall, something epd acts 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.619
 Lahr and percent 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:13.269
 more robust so to speak from this year from the elements a bit more powerful too 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.870
 where he "If you compare that now that there was there 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.100
 Profiles said years are too big all the elements but of the principle is it 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.699
 from the one of the size 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.440
 if you believe that I fit everything in actually percent 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.220
 the same countries are there has been around at Traktor Scratch earlier it went 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.080
 not because you had an interface and because the other tractor was 3 4 4 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.320
 Although the interface praises reasonably customizable but hold 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.610
 not so differentiated so now the brand new tractor pro is actually 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.749
 everything adjustable so 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:49.819
 because that was earned here for our viewers adopts devices at home 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.629
 Goal of several length out of easy set where then all the 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:59.659
 Different functions like PDA have the a4 text internally iq-test the filter 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:01.530
 their central percent 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.670
 a race can be saved in different Leo 2 templates 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:12.010
 or customize it so that's almost completely open charming new 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.620
 Added to some features such as Interact access to the loops 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.030
 then you have the about Hans Controls 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.940
 which are directly under the DAX where 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.070
 now also the function as Qiu Bo and Pitt plays for any Gretzky 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.580
 Sent off scepters are available directly so you save yourself percent many detours 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.850
 Outstanding the animals have menus diadem earlier there were probes has it 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.680
 just i was pretty much four directly by mouse or available 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:45.020
 Hanauer has not particularly pleased even now even more expensive is that 

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:46.200
 for example one 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.430
 Percent Browser gives you the click of a button to pack percent on full screen 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.140
 So you can always have the big DAX around you did not see tragic percent 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.620
 if you just switch quickly by looking at the full 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.760
 Screen resolution mutant when selecting easy to close again 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.910
 Fuchs Wittstock you can also faulty pump and it-side but like now 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.550
 have a filter in the middle and then want the interface has been relatively full 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.800
 Still, in the market the browser is still starting and landing 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.780
 Switching back and forth, so to speak 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.400
 yes, and a big change the percent 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.740
 The people longed for it was finally in there 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.210
 if that is really implemented now has to make a special benefit 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.539
 probably everyone will decide for themselves but there is Abs on every page 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.650
 Three is now provided with its own body if it has been established 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.740
 which of course would have been after a big Colak Schänzer something 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.960
 can be exhausting because error the tool can steal something that is relative 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.600
 cheap so now note for example chansons the mp3 tech also quite good because 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.260
 The pass Naumann has access to the chef where just a lot of Cava easy 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.329
 to get to 

00:06:57.329 --> 00:07:02.049
 exactly riad percent january I have heard percent will also have the 

00:07:02.049 --> 00:07:06.219
 Porsches finally switch to the Caber but it is said to be synonymous 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:10.699
 still the whole XML information so neatly packed text 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:11.469
 Plus expected 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:13.340
 so that's a big step 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.449
 so easy net then on the field with the purchase type connected 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.800
 yes, that was just the first partner and a bit with ours 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:28.220
 Busy in the introduction and in the second part Bernward at later on 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.120
 the workflow so the chancellor functionality and what is internal now 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.599
 there's new stuff under the hood 

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:36.349
 come back to it
