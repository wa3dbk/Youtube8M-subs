on<00:03:28.000> darker<00:03:28.599> tones<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.430> really<00:03:30.430> really<00:03:30.609> fair

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
on darker tones and really really fair

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.080 
on darker tones and really really fair
tones<00:03:31.239> it<00:03:31.959> says<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.709> universal<00:03:33.340> shade<00:03:33.609> so<00:03:34.000> I

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.569 
guess you just have to blend the heck
out<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.669> to<00:03:37.510> get<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.930> work<00:03:38.459> luckily<00:03:39.459> I
