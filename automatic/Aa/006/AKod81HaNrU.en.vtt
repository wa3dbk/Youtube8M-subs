great<00:00:00.240> twisted<00:00:01.040> videos<00:00:02.040> for<00:00:02.220> twisting<00:00:02.520> 93<00:00:03.049> you

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
great twisted videos for twisting 93 you

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.200 
great twisted videos for twisting 93 you
wanted<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.440> know<00:00:04.620> what<00:00:05.490> was<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.759> easiest<00:00:06.000> way

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
wanted to know what was the easiest way

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:15.230 
wanted to know what was the easiest way
to<00:00:06.240> run<00:00:08.929> speaker<00:00:09.929> we're<00:00:13.519> know<00:00:14.519> if<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:14.910> see

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
to run speaker we're know if you can see

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.630 
to run speaker we're know if you can see
down<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:21.109> what<00:00:22.109> that's<00:00:23.010> for<00:00:23.189> mounting<00:00:23.550> I'm

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
down that what that's for mounting I'm

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.269 
down that what that's for mounting I'm
sure<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.939> already<00:00:24.090> mounted<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:25.010> and<00:00:26.010> wanted<00:00:26.250> a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
sure you already mounted it and wanted a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.980 
sure you already mounted it and wanted a
little<00:00:26.369> snap<00:00:26.670> that's<00:00:26.970> why<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.420> easy<00:00:27.570> I

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.880 

just<00:00:30.990> drill<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> hole<00:00:31.349> through<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> speaker

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
just drill a hole through the speaker

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.069 
just drill a hole through the speaker
wire<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:33.480> come<00:00:33.660> with<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> little

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
wire and then they come with a little

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.160 
wire and then they come with a little
sticky<00:00:34.500> stuff<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.100> stick<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.809> and<00:00:36.809> then<00:00:36.960> put

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
sticky stuff you stick on and then put

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.220 
sticky stuff you stick on and then put
it<00:00:37.290> up<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.329> can't<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> holes

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
it up so you can't see the holes

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.100 
it up so you can't see the holes
it<00:00:40.440> makes<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.710> look<00:00:40.770> nicer<00:00:41.750> now<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it makes it look nicer now it's for the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.440 
it makes it look nicer now it's for the
speaker<00:00:43.410> wire<00:00:43.590> goes<00:00:45.079> when<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.170> take<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.469> off

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
speaker wire goes when you take this off

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.049 
speaker wire goes when you take this off
this<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:49.230> line<00:00:50.129> will<00:00:50.700> come<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:50.940> to

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
this little like line will come up to

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.630 
this little like line will come up to
there<00:00:51.949> just<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.039> ahead<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.280> press<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
there just go ahead and press the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.040 
there just go ahead and press the
speaker<00:00:53.940> wire<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> way

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
speaker wire and with that all the way

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.819 
speaker wire and with that all the way
down<00:00:55.280> into<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:57.829> kick<00:00:58.829> mount<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:01.230> kick<00:01:01.440> panel

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
down into the kick mount the kick panel

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.549 
down into the kick mount the kick panel
and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.730> run<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:02.969> down<00:01:03.120> side<00:01:03.539> all<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and then just run it down side all the

way back let me show you

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.490 
way back let me show you
I<00:01:07.830> did<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.520> amp<00:01:08.729> configuration<00:01:09.409> because<00:01:10.409> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
I did my amp configuration because I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.140 
I did my amp configuration because I
don't<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.680> told<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.189> an<00:01:11.369> amplifier<00:01:11.820> I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
don't I told you to get an amplifier I

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:25.280 
don't I told you to get an amplifier I
think<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.260> was<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:22.880> all<00:01:23.880> right<00:01:24.200> remember<00:01:25.200> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
think that was you all right remember I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.190 
think that was you all right remember I
told<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.770> an<00:01:25.830> amplifier<00:01:29.930> which<00:01:30.930> probably

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
told you get an amplifier which probably

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.039 
told you get an amplifier which probably
isn't<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.500> best<00:01:31.590> thing<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:33.049> my

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
isn't the best thing to do my

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.460 
isn't the best thing to do my
distribution<00:01:34.380> block<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:36.509> then<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:40.259> I'll

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
distribution block and then and I'll

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.410 
distribution block and then and I'll
going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.920> amplifier<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.670> here

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.859 

alright

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
alright

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.100 
alright
my<00:01:46.680> rca's<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.579> side<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> same

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
my rca's on this side but it's the same

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.260 
my rca's on this side but it's the same
exact<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> other<00:01:50.009> side<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.340> just

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
exact way for the other side to just

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.300 
exact way for the other side to just
write<00:01:51.479> down<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.899> my<00:01:52.500> amp<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.829> actually<00:01:53.130> right

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
write down this my amp is actually right

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.760 
write down this my amp is actually right
here<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.200> if<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.439> Jeep<00:01:55.649> Grand

Cherokee like eSATA cherokee or whatever
I'm<00:01:57.570> pretty<00:01:57.780> sure<00:01:57.899> they<00:01:58.049> come<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.350> this

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
I'm pretty sure they come with this

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.800 
I'm pretty sure they come with this
carpeting<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.009> rent<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.189> seat<00:01:59.509> you<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.570> go

carpeting I rent the seat you can go

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.600 
carpeting I rent the seat you can go
ahead<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.049> try<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.229> do<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.500> did<00:02:01.560> took<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
ahead and try and do what I did took a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.609 
ahead and try and do what I did took a
little<00:02:02.759> time<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.270> made<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.110> look<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.290> lot<00:02:04.409> nicer

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
little time but made it look a lot nicer

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.150 
little time but made it look a lot nicer
