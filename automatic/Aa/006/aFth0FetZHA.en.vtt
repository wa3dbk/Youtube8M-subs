00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
 [Music] 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.759
 I always like to do something 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.740
 for apartment cats because many 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.369
 home cats sit at home 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.690
 all day long and the whole day 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.430
 Owner should really be with the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.010
 deal with kittens and there I have 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.529
 today i thought i will play a game 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.320
 you can play fishing tinkering quite well 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.330
 also in the specialized trade acquire but with 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.340
 You can do that with simple things 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.130
 make your own home very quickly 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.469
 First and foremost I would suggest in 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.410
 to go to the garden or in the forest and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.629
 just cut off a branch about 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.370
 The length is great then best 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.160
 a few go to the craft store 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.829
 Feathers buy cats like cats always 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.320
 very much like to play a little 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.690
 Socks for children, of course, you can also 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.280
 sew little mouse but so 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.750
 a little child rather such a small one 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.210
 Children's sock is just really great 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.549
 very suitable and a bit of cotton 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.200
 as filler i have one more 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.810
 other variation I will be the same 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.220
 So just tell one takes 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.369
 these kids sock stocker wait all the way 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.710
 just because the cat is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.200
 Basically, no matter what 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.540
 at the player or at the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.000
 Stick to it we make a prey 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.220
 Dummy because cats have one 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.710
 great hunter and would like to 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.960
 hunt for something with your paws 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 claws with the mouth and that's why 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.130
 we are tinkering with a prey today 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.950
 Dummy hanging on a stick like that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.060
 Now I have the feeling then I take 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.970
 a sewing needle with a thread on it and 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.799
 nea at the end of the socket a few mistakes 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.390
 Just turn it on normally 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.649
 I would not do that now 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.280
 that is, taking too long I have something 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.810
 I will show you this soon 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.439
 and just arrest 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.920
 so bite the feathers up very bad 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.500
 and it will be later 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.080
 now it looks like that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.040
 just the feathers are sewn here 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.569
 and that's a lot of motivating 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.170
 for a cat if there just fail 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.910
 it's your turn 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.400
 I filled in water here now 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.010
 But you can also do some chris tricks like 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.390
 For example, aluminum foil or something 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.980
 paper 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.069
 quasi take the breakfast types 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:41.400
 then packet cord cut off 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:43.769
 a piece of hanging that s.der socke 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.060
 tie that up and do it here 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.290
 on the floor 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.230
 so this binds firmly with easy 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.850
 a very normal knot 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.440
 make every case very firm that 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.989
 the cat what can not tear off right away 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.819
 and then we lure the cat in which we 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.799
 say come here and then you want it 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.130
 a wild with the claws and with the 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.260
 with the snout and behind this prey 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.610
 dummy and within ten 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.860
 minutes is the cat really 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.580
 Exploited goes very fast and all 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.580
 have fun with it
