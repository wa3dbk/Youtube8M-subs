like I said just kids if any of my

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.360 
like I said just kids if any of my
players<00:05:25.990> retired<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:26.770> wanted<00:05:27.040> to<00:05:27.100> use<00:05:27.220> my

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
players retired I wanted to use my

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.310 
players retired I wanted to use my
timeouts<00:05:27.850> for<00:05:27.970> that<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.540> that's<00:05:29.200> why<00:05:29.290> we

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
timeouts for that and that's why we

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.870 
timeouts for that and that's why we
ended<00:05:29.560> up<00:05:29.710> taking<00:05:29.890> the<00:05:30.040> penalty<00:05:30.190> and<00:05:30.640> we

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
ended up taking the penalty and we

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.310 
ended up taking the penalty and we
couldn't<00:05:31.090> kick<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.419> field<00:05:31.630> goal<00:05:31.750> even<00:05:32.229> though

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
couldn't kick the field goal even though

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.110

Justin<00:05:32.680> Tucker<00:05:32.860> is<00:05:33.070> a<00:05:33.100> beast<00:05:33.340> kicker<00:05:33.640> we

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
Justin Tucker is a beast kicker we

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.880 
Justin Tucker is a beast kicker we
couldn't<00:05:34.450> kick<00:05:34.630> the<00:05:34.750> field<00:05:34.960> goal<00:05:35.050> because<00:05:35.560> the

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
couldn't kick the field goal because the

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.610 
couldn't kick the field goal because the
wind<00:05:36.130> was<00:05:36.250> just<00:05:36.669> against<00:05:37.330> us<00:05:37.450> too<00:05:37.660> much<00:05:37.870> but

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
wind was just against us too much but

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.530 
wind was just against us too much but
that's<00:05:39.010> alright<00:05:39.340> man<00:05:39.760> because<00:05:40.180> he<00:05:40.300> ends<00:05:40.479> up

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
that's alright man because he ends up

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.730 
that's alright man because he ends up
chucking<00:05:40.930> deep<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.320> we<00:05:41.410> get<00:05:41.620> the
