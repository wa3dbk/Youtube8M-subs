00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
cute scissor organizer for us yeah I

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.459 
cute scissor organizer for us yeah I
thought<00:00:11.610> if<00:00:12.000> your<00:00:12.480> tables<00:00:12.870> anything<00:00:13.170> like<00:00:13.290> my

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
thought if your tables anything like my

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.379 
thought if your tables anything like my
table<00:00:13.980> when<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.759> everything<00:00:14.940> all<00:00:15.150> spread

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
table when I have everything all spread

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.300 
table when I have everything all spread
out<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.690> can't<00:00:15.990> ever<00:00:16.260> find<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:16.800> scissors<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
out I can't ever find my scissors and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.460 
out I can't ever find my scissors and
then<00:00:17.400> do<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> like<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.090> path<00:00:18.330> pat<00:00:18.630> pat<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.439> I

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
then do the like the path pat pat so I

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.599 
then do the like the path pat pat so I
thought<00:00:19.650> would<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.800> really<00:00:19.980> great<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
thought would be really great to have a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.010 
thought would be really great to have a
scissor<00:00:20.910> organizer<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.570> would<00:00:21.720> keep<00:00:21.840> them

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
scissor organizer that would keep them

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.810 
scissor organizer that would keep them
up<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.350> off<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> table<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.130> where<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.640> see

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
up and off the table and where I can see

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.429 
up and off the table and where I can see
them<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.150> grab<00:00:24.330> them<00:00:24.510> really<00:00:24.779> quickly<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
them and grab them really quickly the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.599 
them and grab them really quickly the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
okay first we have this little paper

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.060 
okay first we have this little paper
mache<00:00:29.580> box<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.240> we're<00:00:31.109> going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> draw<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
mache box and we're going to draw a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.850 
mache box and we're going to draw a
small<00:00:32.489> rectangle<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.899> our<00:00:34.170> scissors<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.739> go

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
small rectangle for our scissors to go

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.069 
small rectangle for our scissors to go
in<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.610> would<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.940> measure<00:00:36.270> your<00:00:36.600> scissors<00:00:36.930> or

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
in so would you measure your scissors or

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.060 
in so would you measure your scissors or
how<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.410> make<00:00:37.530> sure<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.010> size

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
how do you make sure it's the right size

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610 
how do you make sure it's the right size
well<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.180> could<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.989> could<00:00:40.140> kind<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.410> look<00:00:40.530> at

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
well you could you could kind of look at

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.569 
well you could you could kind of look at
your<00:00:40.739> scissors<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.430> they're<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
your scissors and see if they're a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.580 
your scissors and see if they're a
little<00:00:41.730> thicker<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.300> make<00:00:42.450> make<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.899> wider<00:00:43.260> or

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
little thicker and make make it wider or

little thicker and make make it wider or
narrower<00:00:43.700> um<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.789> always<00:00:45.180> start<00:00:45.360> with<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
narrower um I always start with a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.170 
narrower um I always start with a
thinner<00:00:46.350> hole<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.940> make<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
thinner hole and then I can make it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.779 
thinner hole and then I can make it
bigger<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.660> need<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.870> great<00:00:49.410> idea<00:00:49.590> hey<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.760> I

bigger if I need to great idea hey so I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.290 
bigger if I need to great idea hey so I
just<00:00:51.030> used<00:00:51.649> a<00:00:52.649> ruler<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.789> mechanical

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
just used a ruler and a mechanical

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.209 
just used a ruler and a mechanical
pencil<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.020> drew<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.469> rectangle<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
pencil and I drew the rectangle in the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.220 
pencil and I drew the rectangle in the
top<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.610> box<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.149> then<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.140> you're

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
top of the box and then when you're

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.900 
top of the box and then when you're
cutting<00:00:58.500> through<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:59.309> thick<00:01:01.609> cardboard<00:01:02.609> like

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
cutting through a thick cardboard like

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.210 
cutting through a thick cardboard like
this<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.359> want<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.539> take<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> lot<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.220> shallow

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
this you want to take a lot of shallow

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.300 
this you want to take a lot of shallow
cuts<00:01:05.760> mm-hmm<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.290> hard<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.740> jab<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.100> in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
cuts mm-hmm it's hard to like jab it in

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.420 
cuts mm-hmm it's hard to like jab it in
there<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.460> like<00:01:08.640> saw<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.000> sawed<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.330> sawed<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
there and like saw and sawed and sawed I

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.320 
there and like saw and sawed and sawed I
always<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.760> one<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> things

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
always think that one of the things

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850 
always think that one of the things
about<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.930> start<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.590> get<00:01:13.710> really

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
about this is I start to get really

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
about this is I start to get really
frustrated<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:14.850> then<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> start<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.390> want

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
frustrated and so then I start to want

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.870 
frustrated and so then I start to want
to<00:01:15.659> make<00:01:15.810> deeper<00:01:16.140> cuts<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.950> instead<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> think

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
to make deeper cuts but instead I think

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.340 
to make deeper cuts but instead I think
you're<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.420> always<00:01:18.659> better<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.049> make

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
you're right it is always better to make

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.719 
you're right it is always better to make
the<00:01:19.710> little<00:01:19.860> shallow<00:01:20.189> cuts<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.549> know<00:01:20.610> you

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the little shallow cuts and I know you

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.230 
the little shallow cuts and I know you
have<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.479> already<00:01:21.810> done<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:23.549> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
have one here that's already done so and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.640 
have one here that's already done so and
of<00:01:24.509> course<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.810> other<00:01:24.930> thing<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.350> you

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
of course the other thing is if you

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
of course the other thing is if you
change<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> blade<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.490> knife

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
change the blade on your knife

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
change the blade on your knife
frequently<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> sharper<00:01:27.810> blade<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.170> always

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
frequently a sharper blade is always

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
frequently a sharper blade is always
gonna<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> better<00:01:28.860> job<00:01:28.979> that's<00:01:29.579> true<00:01:30.150> so

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
gonna do a better job that's true so

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.050 
gonna do a better job that's true so
then<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> next<00:01:31.380> step<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> light<00:01:32.759> wash

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
then the next step is to do a light wash

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.840 
then the next step is to do a light wash
of<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.049> okay<00:01:34.560> then<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.670> hand

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
of just so okay then I know can I hand

background to show through right um I

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.889 
background to show through right um I
kind<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.219> think<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.670> an<00:01:59.820> old<00:02:00.060> house<00:02:00.479> that

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
kind of think of like an old house that

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.810 
kind of think of like an old house that
you<00:02:01.020> would<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:02.159> know<00:02:02.280> either<00:02:02.399> woods

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you would see you know either woods

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.249 
you would see you know either woods
somewhere<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.299> hasn't<00:02:03.570> been<00:02:03.600> painted<00:02:03.869> for<00:02:04.170> a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
somewhere that hasn't been painted for a

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.380 
somewhere that hasn't been painted for a
long<00:02:04.380> long<00:02:04.500> time<00:02:04.850> there's<00:02:05.850> still<00:02:06.090> some<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
long long time there's still some of the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.960 
long long time there's still some of the
white<00:02:06.570> paint<00:02:06.899> if<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.799> Genesis<00:02:08.190> by<00:02:08.369> nature<00:02:08.729> yes

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
white paint if I Genesis by nature yes

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.729 
white paint if I Genesis by nature yes
but<00:02:09.780> some<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.140> wood<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.410> still<00:02:10.560> showing

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
but some of the wood is still showing

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.369 
but some of the wood is still showing
through<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.569> okay<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:12.870> once<00:02:13.110> it's<00:02:13.260> painted

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
through so okay and so once it's painted

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.820 
through so okay and so once it's painted
you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.190 
you
obviously<00:02:14.100> would<00:02:14.340> let<00:02:14.610> it<00:02:14.880> dry<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.020> course

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
obviously would let it dry and of course

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.690 
obviously would let it dry and of course
it's<00:02:16.320> easier<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.620> add<00:02:16.770> more<00:02:17.040> paint<00:02:17.310> than<00:02:17.430> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
it's easier to add more paint than to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.640 
it's easier to add more paint than to
take<00:02:17.940> some<00:02:18.270> way<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.110> dries<00:02:19.320> really<00:02:19.500> fast

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
take some way and this dries really fast

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.770 
take some way and this dries really fast
because<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.310> paper<00:02:20.640> mache<00:02:21.030> absorbs<00:02:21.570> the

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
because the paper mache absorbs the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.630 
because the paper mache absorbs the
paint<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.860> don't<00:02:23.070> have<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.340> sit<00:02:23.550> around

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
paint so you don't have to sit around

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.520 
paint so you don't have to sit around
forever<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.450> ever<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.690> ever<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:24.990> wait<00:02:25.320> for

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
forever and ever and ever and wait for

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.370 
forever and ever and ever and wait for
it<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.650> dry<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.310> yay<00:02:26.550> cool<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.840> can<00:02:27.990> set<00:02:28.230> that

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
it to dry so yay cool so we can set that

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.500 
it to dry so yay cool so we can set that
aside<00:02:28.590> okay<00:02:29.040> I'll<00:02:29.250> take<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.580> for<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.940> thank

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
you and what's the next step the next

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.440 
you and what's the next step the next
step<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.980> great<00:02:35.040> metallic<00:02:35.820> gold

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
step is I have this great metallic gold

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.230 
step is I have this great metallic gold
ink<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.230> we're<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.160> going<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.400> tap<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
ink and we're just going to tap the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.120 
ink and we're just going to tap the
edges<00:02:39.690> though<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.500> that's<00:02:40.650> interesting<00:02:40.830> you

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
edges though so that's interesting you

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.950 
edges though so that's interesting you
tap<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.700> would<00:02:41.910> have<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.030> rubbed<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.810> is

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
tap it I would have just rubbed it is

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.360 
tap it I would have just rubbed it is
there<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.170> reason<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.530> tapping<00:02:43.950> works<00:02:44.130> better

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
there a reason that tapping works better

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.120 
there a reason that tapping works better
um<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.750> rub<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:45.990> you<00:02:46.320> get<00:02:46.440> kind<00:02:46.710> of<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.830> solid

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
um if you rub it you get kind of a solid

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.800 
um if you rub it you get kind of a solid
okay<00:02:47.790> color<00:02:48.000> on<00:02:48.240> there<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.630> we<00:02:48.690> don't

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
okay color on there and we don't

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.150 
okay color on there and we don't
necessarily<00:02:48.990> want<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.650> we're<00:02:49.800> still<00:02:50.010> going

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
necessarily want that we're still going

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.160 
necessarily want that we're still going
for<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.520> shortest<00:02:50.880> shabby<00:02:51.480> look<00:02:51.840> that's

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
for the shortest shabby look that's

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.510 
for the shortest shabby look that's
really<00:02:52.440> smart<00:02:52.560> I'm<00:02:52.980> gonna<00:02:53.070> have<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.340> try<00:02:53.490> that

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
really smart I'm gonna have to try that

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.880 
really smart I'm gonna have to try that
when<00:02:53.820> i<00:02:53.850> get<00:02:54.030> home<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.959> you<00:02:55.050> can<00:02:55.260> tap<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.770> and

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
when i get home so you can tap it and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.710 
when i get home so you can tap it and
then<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.370> can<00:02:56.520> tap<00:02:56.820> in<00:02:57.090> various<00:02:57.570> places

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
then you can tap in various places

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.420 
then you can tap in various places
through<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.260> box<00:02:58.440> because<00:02:58.620> it's<00:02:58.920> paper<00:02:59.100> mache

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
through the box because it's paper mache

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.730 
through the box because it's paper mache
it's<00:02:59.610> not<00:02:59.760> totally<00:03:00.360> flat<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.380> places

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
it's not totally flat so the places

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.410 
it's not totally flat so the places
where<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.070> got<00:03:02.250> sort<00:03:02.490> of<00:03:02.550> a<00:03:02.640> raised<00:03:02.880> texture

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
where it's got sort of a raised texture

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.790 
where it's got sort of a raised texture
will<00:03:03.540> pick<00:03:03.720> up<00:03:03.870> some<00:03:04.020> of<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.200> gold<00:03:04.380> as<00:03:04.620> well

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800

it<00:03:05.130> adds<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.580> much<00:03:05.610> richness<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:07.050> write

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
it adds so much richness to it to write

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.380 
it adds so much richness to it to write
and<00:03:07.890> see<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.250> here<00:03:08.490> on<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.730> finish<00:03:09.060> sample

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
and see that here on this finish sample

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.699 
and see that here on this finish sample
that<00:03:09.510> you've<00:03:09.660> done<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.470> looks

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
when you use the tape runner it just

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.219 
when you use the tape runner it just
wants<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.400> pull<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.669> fibers<00:04:18.060> up<00:04:18.269> yes<00:04:19.019> it

yes and I like the the solid color

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.830

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
because I can take a print mm-hmm and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.930 
because I can take a print mm-hmm and
layer<00:05:07.110> it<00:05:07.230> over<00:05:07.470> top<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.250> this<00:05:08.700> is<00:05:08.820> certainly

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
layer it over top and this is certainly

layer it over top and this is certainly
an<00:05:09.210> opportunity<00:05:09.780> if<00:05:09.930> let's<00:05:10.140> say<00:05:10.230> you're<00:05:10.500> not<00:05:10.740> a

just because I'm playing with you but
this<00:06:06.810> is<00:06:06.960> actually<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.260> multi<00:06:07.740> temp<00:06:08.070> glue<00:06:08.640> gun

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
this is actually a multi temp glue gun

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.490 
this is actually a multi temp glue gun
and<00:06:08.940> I<00:06:09.120> know<00:06:09.180> we<00:06:09.420> have<00:06:09.570> one<00:06:09.780> set<00:06:09.990> to<00:06:10.080> low<00:06:10.260> which

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
and I know we have one set to low which

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.440 
and I know we have one set to low which
is<00:06:10.620> the<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:10.950> write<00:06:11.430> one<00:06:11.640> sets<00:06:11.880> a<00:06:11.940> high<00:06:11.970> which<00:06:12.330> is

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
is the to write one sets a high which is

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.150 
is the to write one sets a high which is
the<00:06:12.570> one<00:06:12.780> so<00:06:13.140> what<00:06:13.320> I'm<00:06:13.440> thinking<00:06:13.470> is<00:06:13.890> why

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
don't you use the high to attach that

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.480 
don't you use the high to attach that
key<00:06:15.960> okay<00:06:16.470> and<00:06:16.620> what<00:06:16.830> would<00:06:16.920> you<00:06:16.950> recommend<00:06:17.130> i

burn myself but there are some easy ways

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.750 
burn myself but there are some easy ways
right<00:06:31.680> to<00:06:31.860> just<00:06:32.040> keep<00:06:32.160> your<00:06:32.310> fingers<00:06:32.730> away

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 
right to just keep your fingers away

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.420 
right to just keep your fingers away
from<00:06:33.000> you<00:06:33.979> just<00:06:34.979> like<00:06:35.100> when<00:06:35.190> you<00:06:35.250> were<00:06:35.400> a

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
from you just like when you were a

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.590 
from you just like when you were a
little<00:06:35.490> kid<00:06:35.700> and<00:06:36.000> you<00:06:36.090> learn<00:06:36.270> to<00:06:36.419> keep<00:06:36.540> your

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
little kid and you learn to keep your

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.730 
little kid and you learn to keep your
fingers<00:06:36.960> away<00:06:36.990> from<00:06:37.169> the<00:06:37.320> hot<00:06:37.500> things

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
fingers away from the hot things

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:38.810 
fingers away from the hot things
eventually<00:06:38.010> you<00:06:38.370> learn<00:06:38.430> to<00:06:38.640> keep<00:06:38.760> your

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
eventually you learn to keep your

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
eventually you learn to keep your
fingers<00:06:39.180> away<00:06:39.270> from

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
fingers away from

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.570 
fingers away from
right<00:06:40.139> and<00:06:40.350> of<00:06:40.410> course<00:06:40.620> low<00:06:40.830> temp<00:06:41.040> is<00:06:41.160> low<00:06:41.310> temp

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
right and of course low temp is low temp

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.670 
right and of course low temp is low temp
which<00:06:41.820> makes<00:06:42.090> it<00:06:42.240> right<00:06:42.480> even<00:06:42.750> better<00:06:43.380> for

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
which makes it right even better for
