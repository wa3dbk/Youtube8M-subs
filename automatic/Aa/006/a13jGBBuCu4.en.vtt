Lavigne on this Thursday September 12th
for<00:00:23.460> planet<00:00:23.880> pulse<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.300> feel<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.080> I've<00:00:25.289> just

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
for planet pulse I feel like I've just

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.589 
for planet pulse I feel like I've just
entered<00:00:25.920> into<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.609> Goldilocks<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
entered into the Goldilocks and the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.259 
entered into the Goldilocks and the
three<00:00:27.660> bears<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.920> too<00:00:29.099> hot<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.119> it

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
three bears it is it too hot or is it

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.590 
three bears it is it too hot or is it
too<00:00:30.420> cold<00:00:30.449> how<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.199> get<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.560> just<00:00:31.740> right<00:00:32.669> well

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
too cold how do I get it just right well

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.569 
too cold how do I get it just right well
I<00:00:33.630> think<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.380> challenge<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:35.250> have

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
I think that is the challenge we have

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.540 
I think that is the challenge we have
the<00:00:35.910> moon<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.329> fiery<00:00:36.719> hot<00:00:37.250> Sagittarius<00:00:38.250> today

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the moon and fiery hot Sagittarius today

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.119 
the moon and fiery hot Sagittarius today
which<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.820> too<00:00:39.120> hot<00:00:39.329> full<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.750> enthusiasm<00:00:40.129> too

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
which is too hot full of enthusiasm too

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.779 
which is too hot full of enthusiasm too
much<00:00:41.750> but<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.989> moon<00:00:43.320> forms<00:00:44.129> ask<00:00:44.550> where<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
much but the moon forms ask where the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.619 
much but the moon forms ask where the
first<00:00:45.390> quarter<00:00:45.780> square<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.070> Sun<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.760> not

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
first quarter square with the Sun in not

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.889 
first quarter square with the Sun in not
enough<00:00:49.280> logical<00:00:50.480> virgo<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.629> what<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:51.840> you

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
enough logical virgo but what do you

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.020 
enough logical virgo but what do you
think<00:00:52.230> little<00:00:52.620> red<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.610> recommend

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
think little red what do you recommend

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.049 
think little red what do you recommend
we<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.350> think<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.399> spend<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
we do I I think that we spend a lot of

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.020 
we do I I think that we spend a lot of
the<00:00:57.300> day<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.780> oh<00:00:58.199> my<00:00:58.620> god<00:00:58.829> that's<00:00:59.070> too<00:00:59.340> much<00:00:59.550> no

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the day in oh my god that's too much no

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.260 
the day in oh my god that's too much no
that's<00:01:00.449> not<00:01:00.600> enough<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:02.039> was

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
that's not enough at all that was

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.020 
that's not enough at all that was
exactly<00:01:03.270> right<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.710> perfect<00:01:05.070> that's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
exactly right that was perfect that's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.390 
exactly right that was perfect that's
the<00:01:06.330> in-between<00:01:06.930> thing<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> think<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the in-between thing but I think it's a

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.030 
the in-between thing but I think it's a
struggle<00:01:08.850> finding<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.650> square

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
struggle finding that because the square

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.940 
struggle finding that because the square
pulls<00:01:11.670> us<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.060> one<00:01:12.270> way<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.659> other<00:01:12.950> Virgo

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
pulls us to one way or the other Virgo

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429 
pulls us to one way or the other Virgo
being<00:01:14.310> narrowing<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.060> precise<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.810> exacting

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
being narrowing and precise and exacting

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.640 
being narrowing and precise and exacting
and<00:01:16.740> being<00:01:17.189> exactly<00:01:17.850> right<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.650> Sagittarius

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and being exactly right and Sagittarius

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950 
and being exactly right and Sagittarius
being<00:01:19.920> over-the-top<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.939> too<00:01:21.090> much<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.930> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
being over-the-top and too much and so I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.200 
being over-the-top and too much and so I
think<00:01:22.080> there's<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.619> constant

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
think there's this constant

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.640 
think there's this constant
overcompensation<00:01:24.210> trying<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.170> get<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.470> right

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
overcompensation trying to get it right

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
overcompensation trying to get it right
it's<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.250> touching<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.360> controller

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it's like touching the the controller

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.510 
it's like touching the the controller
and<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.650> trying<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> little

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
and just trying to get it a little

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.340 
and just trying to get it a little
louder<00:01:29.820> but<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> jumps<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.780> too<00:01:30.960> loud<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
louder but it jumps in it's too loud and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.690 
louder but it jumps in it's too loud and
then<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.560> try<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.340> quiet<00:01:32.490> down

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
then we try to get it just a quiet down

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.840 
then we try to get it just a quiet down
that's<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.590> it's<00:01:34.590> really<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.950> struggle<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
that's so it's really a struggle but the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
that's so it's really a struggle but the
purpose<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.689> struggle<00:01:37.409> little<00:01:37.799> benefit

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
purpose of this struggle little benefit

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.289 
purpose of this struggle little benefit
is<00:01:38.900> succeeding<00:01:39.900> at<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.280> enthusiasm<00:01:42.000> of

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
is succeeding at it is the enthusiasm of

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.770 
is succeeding at it is the enthusiasm of
the<00:01:42.409> Sagittarius<00:01:43.409> moon<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.850> had<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> new<00:01:45.570> moon

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
the Sagittarius moon we had a new moon

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.770 
the Sagittarius moon we had a new moon
in<00:01:46.020> virgo<00:01:46.049> about<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> week<00:01:47.130> or<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.399> ago<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.270> that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
in virgo about a week or so ago and that

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.660 
in virgo about a week or so ago and that
represents<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> beginning<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> new<00:01:50.250> cycle

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
represents the beginning of a new cycle

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
represents the beginning of a new cycle
but<00:01:51.000> Virgo<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.720> kind<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.079> dry<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
but Virgo can be kind of dry in that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.770 
but Virgo can be kind of dry in that
Sagittarius<00:01:53.250> moon<00:01:54.090> here<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> first

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
Sagittarius moon here at the first

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.889 
Sagittarius moon here at the first
quarter<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.380> about<00:01:55.950> rien<00:01:56.460> spiring<00:01:57.030> ourselves

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
quarter is about rien spiring ourselves

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.620 
quarter is about rien spiring ourselves
so<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.530> stay<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.640> path<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.180> we

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
so that we can stay on the path that we

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.999 
so that we can stay on the path that we
entered<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.110> week<00:02:01.259> ago<00:02:01.619> I'm<00:02:02.610> Jeff<00:02:02.969> shower<00:02:03.210> and

entered a week ago I'm Jeff shower and

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.350
