of the biggest issues that we see with

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.290 
of the biggest issues that we see with
players<00:00:09.990> from<00:00:10.230> seven<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.860> fourteen<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.700> bat

players from seven to fourteen is bat

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.940 
players from seven to fourteen is bat
Drac<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:13.110> don't<00:00:13.259> want<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.440> confuse<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.889> with

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
Drac we don't want to confuse that with

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.660 
Drac we don't want to confuse that with
bat<00:00:14.250> lag<00:00:14.519> but<00:00:15.269> bat<00:00:15.570> drag<00:00:15.990> just<00:00:16.500> sucks<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
bat lag but bat drag just sucks the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.910 
bat lag but bat drag just sucks the
power<00:00:17.880> out<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.300> swing<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:19.410> what<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.740> bad

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
power out of a swing so what is bad

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.400 
power out of a swing so what is bad
dragon<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.609> causes<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.270> essentially<00:00:22.260> it's

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
dragon what causes it essentially it's

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.920 
dragon what causes it essentially it's
caused<00:00:22.650> by<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> alarms<00:00:23.519> leading<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> swing

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
caused by the alarms leading the swing

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.439 
caused by the alarms leading the swing
and<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:26.070> elbow<00:00:26.519> gets<00:00:26.789> out<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.029> front<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and the elbow gets out in front of the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.439 
and the elbow gets out in front of the
knob<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.840> bat<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:29.369> bad<00:00:29.820> lag<00:00:30.119> being

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
knob of the bat so that bad lag being

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.749 
knob of the bat so that bad lag being
very<00:00:30.689> good<00:00:30.929> because<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.769> get<00:00:31.980> into<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.399> motion

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
very good because we get into a motion

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.819 
very good because we get into a motion
here<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> bat<00:00:34.200> whips<00:00:34.500> through<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
here and then the bat whips through the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
here and then the bat whips through the
zone<00:00:35.070> as<00:00:35.610> opposed<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.239> as<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> guy<00:00:36.630> starts<00:00:37.200> his

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440 
zone as opposed to as the guy starts his
swing<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> hitter<00:00:37.950> starts<00:00:38.309> his<00:00:38.430> swing<00:00:38.670> it's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
swing the hitter starts his swing it's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.380 
swing the hitter starts his swing it's
with<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> arms<00:00:40.290> first<00:00:40.820> they<00:00:41.820> hug<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.360> elbows

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
with the arms first they hug the elbows

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.930 
with the arms first they hug the elbows
close<00:00:42.960> together<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:44.040> get<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.460> elbow

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
close together and you get this elbow

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.880 
close together and you get this elbow
out<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.420> front<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> knob<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.440> then

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
out in front of the knob here and then

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.580 
out in front of the knob here and then
the<00:00:47.010> bat<00:00:47.219> head<00:00:47.460> drops<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.329> then<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.020> get<00:00:49.320> into

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the bat head drops and then we get into

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.459 
the bat head drops and then we get into
some<00:00:49.739> pop<00:00:50.100> ups<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.320> question<00:00:52.320> is

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
some pop ups like that so question is

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.500 
some pop ups like that so question is
how<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.770> fix<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.910> very<00:00:54.210> simple

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
how do we fix that it's a very simple

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299 
how do we fix that it's a very simple
fix<00:00:54.870> especially<00:00:55.739> when<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> know<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.160> you're

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
fix especially when you know what you're

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.729 
fix especially when you know what you're
doing<00:00:56.489> all<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> take<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> midline

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
doing all you do is you take the midline

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.229 
doing all you do is you take the midline
of<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> bat<00:00:59.250> place<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.789> against<00:01:00.059> your

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
of the bat place it against your

of the bat place it against your
shoulder<00:01:00.719> your<00:01:01.350> hands<00:01:01.980> about<00:01:02.430> at<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> top<00:01:02.940> of

the armpit and slightly behind the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.609 
the armpit and slightly behind the
shoulder<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.869> teach<00:01:07.049> them<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.439> turn

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
shoulders this is assuming of course

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.649 
shoulders this is assuming of course
that<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.400> start<00:01:11.670> our<00:01:11.790> swing<00:01:12.030> from<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> bottom

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that we start our swing from the bottom

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.310 
that we start our swing from the bottom
up<00:01:12.810> our<00:01:13.229> hips<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.710> already<00:01:14.010> fired<00:01:14.450> etc<00:01:15.450> all

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
up our hips have already fired etc all

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.200 
up our hips have already fired etc all
we<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.040> put<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> bat<00:01:17.790> against<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
we do is we put the bat against the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.149 
we do is we put the bat against the
shoulder<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:19.259> our<00:01:19.380> hands<00:01:19.680> lined<00:01:19.979> up

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
shoulder get our hands lined up

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.800 
shoulder get our hands lined up
correctly<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.509> teach<00:01:21.689> them

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
correctly and then we just teach them

correctly and then we just teach them
how<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.960> turn<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.939> alleviates<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.240> bat

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
how to turn and that alleviates that bat
