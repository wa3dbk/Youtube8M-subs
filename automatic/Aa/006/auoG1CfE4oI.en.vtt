00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
this is my big wide spreading theory of

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.450 
this is my big wide spreading theory of
the<00:00:09.480> 50th<00:00:09.929> anniversary<00:00:10.110> what<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.010> think<00:00:11.280> will

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
the 50th anniversary what I think will

the 50th anniversary what I think will
happen<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.090> will<00:00:12.360> be<00:00:12.480> wrong<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.840> some<00:00:13.080> things

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
but i think i generally got the idea

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.529 
but i think i generally got the idea
what's<00:00:15.630> going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.990> happen<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:17.300> part<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.390> this

I think they're going to scrap that idea

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.199 
I think they're going to scrap that idea
and<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> think<00:04:02.640> they're<00:04:02.730> just<00:04:02.790> going<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.030> call

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
and I think they're just going to call

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.300 
and I think they're just going to call
it<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.390> twelfth<00:04:03.690> regeneration<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:04.920> 50th

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
it the twelfth regeneration so the 50th

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.670 
it the twelfth regeneration so the 50th
anniversary<00:04:05.400> will<00:04:06.180> bring<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.959> 13th<00:04:07.470> in<00:04:07.620> the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
anniversary will bring the 13th in the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.390 
anniversary will bring the 13th in the
final<00:04:08.299> doctor<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.989> think<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.440> season<00:04:10.980> will

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
final doctor and I think a season will

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.699 
final doctor and I think a season will
be<00:04:11.640> about<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.840> doctor<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.230> on<00:04:13.380> his<00:04:13.440> final

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
be about that the doctor is on his final

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.220 
be about that the doctor is on his final
regeneration<00:04:14.609> and<00:04:14.820> ultimately<00:04:15.390> this<00:04:15.900> could

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
regeneration and ultimately this could

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.140 
regeneration and ultimately this could
be<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.500> end<00:04:16.620> for<00:04:16.739> him<00:04:16.919> he<00:04:17.280> has<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.609> find<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.120> way

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
be the end for him he has to find a way

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.270 
be the end for him he has to find a way
to<00:04:18.269> fix<00:04:18.510> it<00:04:18.750> some<00:04:19.680> people<00:04:19.949> think<00:04:20.130> that's

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
to fix it some people think that's

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.259 
to fix it some people think that's
already<00:04:20.549> been<00:04:20.730> fixed

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
already been fixed

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.300 
already been fixed
I<00:04:21.389> don't<00:04:21.870> necessarily<00:04:22.049> think<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:22.740> is<00:04:22.860> cuz<00:04:23.190> I

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
I don't necessarily think it is cuz I

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.770 
I don't necessarily think it is cuz I
think<00:04:23.490> it's<00:04:23.580> too<00:04:23.729> big<00:04:23.849> of<00:04:23.970> a<00:04:24.060> story<00:04:24.300> to<00:04:24.389> do<00:04:24.629> it

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
think it's too big of a story to do it

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.719 
think it's too big of a story to do it
so<00:04:25.770> easily<00:04:26.449> so<00:04:27.449> yes<00:04:27.690> I'm<00:04:28.560> gonna<00:04:29.129> be<00:04:29.310> wrong<00:04:29.550> in

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
so easily so yes I'm gonna be wrong in

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.480 
so easily so yes I'm gonna be wrong in
some<00:04:29.940> things<00:04:30.240> there's<00:04:30.659> too<00:04:31.020> many<00:04:31.289> years<00:04:32.039> here

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
some things there's too many years here

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.520 
some things there's too many years here
that<00:04:32.879> I<00:04:32.909> can't<00:04:33.180> be<00:04:33.300> I<00:04:33.330> have<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:34.050> be<00:04:34.169> wrong<00:04:34.379> than

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
that I can't be I have to be wrong than

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.899 
that I can't be I have to be wrong than
some<00:04:34.800> things<00:04:35.099> but<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.340> think<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.639> have<00:04:35.879> the

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
some things but I think I have the

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.999 
some things but I think I have the
general<00:04:36.330> idea<00:04:36.569> what's<00:04:37.050> going<00:04:37.199> to<00:04:37.259> happen<00:04:37.650> I'd

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
general idea what's going to happen I'd

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.409 
general idea what's going to happen I'd
love<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.310> know<00:04:38.430> what<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.639> think<00:04:39.000> do<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.210> like

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
love to know what you think do you like

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.119 
love to know what you think do you like
this<00:04:39.659> theory<00:04:39.960> do<00:04:40.319> you<00:04:40.409> think<00:04:40.590> this<00:04:40.740> theory<00:04:40.979> is

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
this theory do you think this theory is

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.830 
this theory do you think this theory is
wrong<00:04:41.370> do<00:04:42.000> you<00:04:42.060> think<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.300> have<00:04:42.449> everything

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
wrong do you think I have everything

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.010 
wrong do you think I have everything
wrong<00:04:43.379> I<00:04:43.590> could<00:04:44.009> it's<00:04:44.819> possible<00:04:45.360> but<00:04:45.539> I<00:04:45.810> could

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
wrong I could it's possible but I could

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.249 
wrong I could it's possible but I could
have<00:04:46.169> everything<00:04:46.440> right<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:47.520> I<00:04:47.900> think<00:04:48.900> I

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
have everything right so I think I

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:50.629 
have everything right so I think I
figured<00:04:49.319> it<00:04:49.680> out<00:04:49.800> but<00:04:50.009> I<00:04:50.069> would<00:04:50.220> love<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.400> know

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
figured it out but I would love to know

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.279 
figured it out but I would love to know

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
last thing I'll leave you on is I also

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.689 
last thing I'll leave you on is I also
think<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.669> fourth<00:04:59.940> doctor<00:05:00.919> tom<00:05:01.919> baker<00:05:01.949> will

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
think the fourth doctor tom baker will

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.909 
think the fourth doctor tom baker will
be<00:05:02.849> back<00:05:03.030> he's<00:05:03.330> still<00:05:03.659> Tom<00:05:04.110> Baker<00:05:04.349> still<00:05:04.740> very

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
be back he's still Tom Baker still very

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.830 
be back he's still Tom Baker still very
much<00:05:05.039> alive<00:05:05.220> but<00:05:05.849> that's<00:05:06.030> one<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.389> i<00:05:06.449> think

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
much alive but that's one that i think

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.210 
much alive but that's one that i think
i'm<00:05:06.930> going<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.139> probably<00:05:07.349> be<00:05:07.500> wrong<00:05:07.770> on<00:05:07.949> but

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
i'm going to probably be wrong on but

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.430 
i'm going to probably be wrong on but
hey<00:05:08.340> we<00:05:08.669> don't<00:05:08.789> know<00:05:09.000> this<00:05:09.840> is<00:05:09.960> goku<00:05:10.380> for
