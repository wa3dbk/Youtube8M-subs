00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.519

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.769
 fellow money yell at me and it's a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.230
 super sunny day because it is happening 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.179
 the shadows because you are hard 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.420
 especially I understand good and commenting 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.520
 the shadows because the sun covers me 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.010
 vehicle which the five designers 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.440
 I had not looked at the car has been compared 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.640
 be with the vehicle that I want to teach 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.940
 It's already a fucking train car 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.940
 and look compared to him 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.559
 I have no denial of six points 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:13.130
 a monster truck train and when the car 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.080
 is bouncing time is amazing 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.280
 Boys 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.200
 salgado the time voting is to register 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.909
 I really love it, it 's not 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.890
 I had seen is not able to keep it 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.970
 has seen to stay with the four 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.530
 wheels on the floor goes all the time 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.689
 voting on one side look at my book 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.280
 not that boy is I do not know what's wrong 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.409
 made the nonsense science my 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.850
 true the one that I know we're going and not for 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.890
 beaches of I want to try this the beach does not 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.570
 I know why but I want to prove this the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.000
 policy so let's remove 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.640
 necessary donation here you have it is a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.140
 monster with a train on top so it does not 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.670
 I understand, it's still those guys 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.500
 We went 30 with a damn train on and 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.970
 I used to rotate and that costs 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.069
 life or even part of me that line 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.490
 straight the car is voting something that does not 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.409
 has any kind of meaning and this 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.539
 I can turn, I can not, it costs a lot 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.130
 Uncle gymnastic so you have it 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.200
 will show up to the greatest moment that 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.590
 the most impressive is brought to the channel 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.590
 coolest 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.400
 because you will have the file of 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.040
 the tires and video the file 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.830
 these shock absorbers to the 100 plus goyo that 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.730
 line was given that makes that it makes 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.730
 ride from the street 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.290
 that I take from harper rain that is mounted 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.569
 above the clubhouse gut flipa 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.099
 flip towards these plastics these pairs 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.180
 of masters to this car is to flip and 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.799
 I say that I wanted to get to the beach 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.420
 gray tomorrow to the beach we will arrive 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.920
 tomorrow is that I want to try the car a 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.150
 site the beginning we could say no good 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.440
 Well, thank you when we want each other after 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.670
 for the largest ramp, I already know that 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.680
 always controlled clone lounged by 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.870
 the challenging ramp so he looks at me from 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.250
 around he was glad he could go to 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.140
 two wheels perfectly without any type 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.480
 of complication good guys here what 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.470
 you have the three gnostics to our 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.879
 mission is to get to the beach I say it in 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.500
 serious is that it takes all the time 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.500
 overturning has to leave it still 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.870
 Miriam exhausting before I stay I want 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.879
 flippant uncle 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.430
 I really think it's like too much 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.079
 long and very little width knows how to be so little 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.280
 wide as it costs a lot to turn without 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.409
 dump we can say how it has 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.939
 a lot of weight up and it was not thrown like that 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.680
 it's very difficult I do not know I do not know I do not know how 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.150
 explain really do not know how 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:21.359
 explain it because it has no explanation 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.359
 he is really handsome 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.530
 bye Bye 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.439
 because I think that from that time 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:41.590
 we will be able to do what you get 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:46.329
 nice and perfect with attic is that I 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.560
 I want to go to the beach to study 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.639
 test the vehicle this the beach pÃ©rez 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.280
 to get to the beach with this to be a 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.980
 little complicated in what you're going to do 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.489
 when then calm because in zero 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.239
 eat me I do here I do it like this and 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.990
 we make for example I love child there is in 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.550
 there stretches one of this 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.720
 the problem is that of course they would tell me and 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.690
 how are you going to take off the good question 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.950
 very good question indeed and I will tell you 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.700
 quiet guys please are you 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:17.500
 talking to the most important driver of 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.230
 all the saints be eye 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.410
 a damn airplane land in the water 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.410
 one day 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:31.630
 wait for your moment because from very high 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:34.110
 so let's make the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.110
 invincibility 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.250
 the parachicos and let's try we choose 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.380
 track version 3 or whatever you want to take it 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.070
 I do not know what to call magical life there 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.950
 it's perfect 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.740
 no but because if I would say 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.830
 I do not understand guys I do not understand why 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:01.630
 dies of myself is not true says 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.640
 that when you go down you do not want it to arrive 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.340
 we can get the case that we're going to 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.590
 go so yes to the largest ramp in the 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.900
 game so more back and as I seem 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.550
 that we are going to test our vehicle 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.590
 here on the biggest ramp of the game 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.590
 do so and we go back and perfect 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.460
 giant push us forget me 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.840
 one thing and that is that we have to have them 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.320
 we have to see the paintings that are 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.910
 can put this vehicle and such 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.290
