00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:31.230 

I<00:04:28.560> think<00:04:29.560> Steve's<00:04:29.860> been<00:04:30.160> very<00:04:30.400> inspiring<00:04:30.850> for

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
I think Steve's been very inspiring for

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.330 
I think Steve's been very inspiring for
a<00:04:31.270> lot<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:32.220> writers<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.690> aspiring<00:04:35.590> filmmakers

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
a lot of writers and aspiring filmmakers

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.990 
a lot of writers and aspiring filmmakers
because<00:04:36.970> he<00:04:37.810> wrote<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.800> script<00:04:39.130> he<00:04:39.610> directed

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
because he wrote the script he directed

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.980 
because he wrote the script he directed
the<00:04:40.120> script<00:04:40.419> so<00:04:40.630> it<00:04:40.690> was<00:04:40.780> his<00:04:40.990> original<00:04:41.650> work

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
the script so it was his original work

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.420 
the script so it was his original work
and<00:04:43.990> he<00:04:44.290> was<00:04:44.440> really<00:04:44.680> involved<00:04:44.919> with<00:04:45.130> every

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
and he was really involved with every

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.120 
and he was really involved with every
single<00:04:45.610> aspect<00:04:45.820> of<00:04:46.470> putting<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.560> together<00:04:47.680> and

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
single aspect of putting it together and

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.720 
single aspect of putting it together and
I<00:04:48.970> think<00:04:49.419> that's<00:04:49.630> unusual<00:04:49.870> and<00:04:50.380> special<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.280> I

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
I think that's unusual and special and I

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.540 
I think that's unusual and special and I
think<00:04:52.300> I've<00:04:52.930> talked<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.410> other<00:04:53.560> writers<00:04:54.100> who
