know<00:00:54.170> since<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.350> will<00:00:55.469> Sketchup<00:00:56.039> 8<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.550> play<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760

that's<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.620> terrain<00:03:21.919> but<00:03:22.129> it's<00:03:22.250> obviously

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
that's the terrain but it's obviously

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.970 
that's the terrain but it's obviously
way<00:03:22.879> too<00:03:22.910> big<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:23.750> hit<00:03:23.930> s<00:03:24.139> and<00:03:24.470> scale<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.829> down

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
way too big so hit s and scale it down

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.080 
way too big so hit s and scale it down
just<00:03:27.980> keep<00:03:28.280> scaling<00:03:28.819> it<00:03:28.940> might<00:03:29.060> take<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.299> while

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
just keep scaling it might take a while

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.970 
just keep scaling it might take a while
keep<00:03:32.090> scaling<00:03:32.829> alright

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
keep scaling alright

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.539 
keep scaling alright
that's<00:03:34.669> probably<00:03:35.629> about<00:03:35.810> right<00:03:36.099> um<00:03:37.099> it<00:03:37.340> looks

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
that's probably about right um it looks

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.789 
that's probably about right um it looks

pretty badly messed up though you'll

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.800 
pretty badly messed up though you'll

notice if you hit on smooth shading

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.720 
notice if you hit on smooth shading
nothing<00:03:42.410> happens<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.919> seconds<00:03:43.280> it's<00:03:43.430> already

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979 
that got rid of a lot of triangles in

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.099 
that got rid of a lot of triangles in
the<00:04:13.069> mash<00:04:13.220> there<00:04:13.549> is<00:04:13.669> still<00:04:13.879> some<00:04:14.150> along<00:04:14.959> the

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
the mash there is still some along the

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.689 
the mash there is still some along the
edges<00:04:15.440> there<00:04:15.650> but<00:04:15.859> I<00:04:16.010> cleaned<00:04:16.310> up<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.519> mess<00:04:16.549> a

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
edges there but I cleaned up the mess a

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.529 
edges there but I cleaned up the mess a
lot<00:04:16.909> more<00:04:17.120> um<00:04:18.789> so<00:04:19.789> that<00:04:19.940> pretty<00:04:20.090> much<00:04:20.239> brings

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
lot more um so that pretty much brings

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.339 
lot more um so that pretty much brings
in<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.079> terrain<00:04:21.580> um<00:04:22.690> you<00:04:23.690> come<00:04:23.870> over<00:04:23.900> here<00:04:24.110> I'm

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
in the terrain um you come over here I'm

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.240 
in the terrain um you come over here I'm
going<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.500> give<00:04:24.620> it<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.770> subsurf<00:04:25.219> modifier

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
going to give it a subsurf modifier

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.110 
going to give it a subsurf modifier
because<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.120> looks<00:04:26.300> too

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.810 

um<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:31.110> that's<00:04:31.710> looking<00:04:32.160> pretty<00:04:32.220> nice

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
um and that's looking pretty nice

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.540 
um and that's looking pretty nice
notice<00:04:33.480> that<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.690> textures<00:04:34.170> aren't<00:04:34.410> on<00:04:34.530> it<00:04:34.710> um

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
notice that the textures aren't on it um

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.670 
notice that the textures aren't on it um
if<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:35.970> come<00:04:36.150> in<00:04:36.270> here<00:04:36.480> under<00:04:36.690> material<00:04:36.990> they

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
are actually there it's already on UV so

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.830 
are actually there it's already on UV so

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
render setup a little bit doesn't really

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.440 
render setup a little bit doesn't really
matter<00:04:46.320> but<00:04:46.880> I'm<00:04:47.880> right<00:04:48.230> render<00:04:49.230> that<00:04:49.380> f12

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.610 
matter but I'm right render that f12
then<00:04:51.450> you'll<00:04:51.630> see<00:04:51.750> that<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:51.960> textures<00:04:52.380> are

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
then you'll see that the textures are

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.130 
then you'll see that the textures are
there<00:04:52.890> um<00:04:53.580> you'll<00:04:54.030> notice<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:54.480> they're<00:04:54.750> not

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
there um you'll notice that they're not

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.230 
there um you'll notice that they're not
the<00:04:55.530> best<00:04:55.710> texture<00:04:56.130> they're<00:04:56.670> pretty<00:04:56.880> low

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
the best texture they're pretty low

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.890 
the best texture they're pretty low
quality<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.320> they<00:04:58.620> have<00:04:59.180> the<00:05:00.180> words<00:05:00.360> powered

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
quality and they have the words powered

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.440 
quality and they have the words powered
by<00:05:01.110> Google<00:05:01.620> written<00:05:02.070> on<00:05:02.190> one<00:05:02.430> side<00:05:02.940> which<00:05:03.300> you

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
by Google written on one side which you

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.150 
by Google written on one side which you
really<00:05:03.690> wouldn't<00:05:04.140> really<00:05:04.290> want<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:04.770> on<00:05:05.100> your

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
really wouldn't really want that on your

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.520 
really wouldn't really want that on your
terrain<00:05:05.520> if<00:05:06.210> you<00:05:06.330> were<00:05:06.450> rendering<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:06.930> cg<00:05:07.260> image

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
terrain if you were rendering a cg image

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.280 
terrain if you were rendering a cg image
of<00:05:07.650> this<00:05:07.800> um<00:05:08.160> so<00:05:09.060> typically<00:05:09.540> I<00:05:09.720> would<00:05:09.990> be<00:05:10.080> third

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
of this um so typically I would be third

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.230 
of this um so typically I would be third
um<00:05:10.920> I<00:05:11.250> would<00:05:11.460> probably<00:05:11.490> just<00:05:11.910> find<00:05:12.120> another

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
um I would probably just find another

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.270 
um I would probably just find another
image<00:05:12.720> somewhere<00:05:13.110> else<00:05:13.260> to<00:05:13.470> use<00:05:13.590> as<00:05:13.800> textures

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
image somewhere else to use as textures

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.590 
image somewhere else to use as textures
but<00:05:15.830> so<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:17.310> got<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:18.090> terrain<00:05:18.390> in<00:05:18.540> the

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
but so that got the terrain in the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.409 
but so that got the terrain in the
blender<00:05:18.930> here<00:05:19.140> and<00:05:19.460> um<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.760> hope<00:05:21.060> you<00:05:21.240> learned

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
blender here and um I hope you learned

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.210 
blender here and um I hope you learned
something<00:05:21.660> from<00:05:21.780> this<00:05:21.930> tutorial<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:22.680> thanks

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
something from this tutorial and thanks

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.400 
something from this tutorial and thanks
for<00:05:23.340> watching
