very difficult if not impossible to turn
the<00:01:04.680> flywheel<00:01:05.000> counterclockwise<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the flywheel counterclockwise so you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.550 
the flywheel counterclockwise so you
should<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.159> able<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.460> turn<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.880> clockwise<00:01:09.560> but

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
should be able to turn it clockwise but

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.030 
should be able to turn it clockwise but
not<00:01:10.770> counterclockwise<00:01:12.530> if<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:13.920> the

not counterclockwise if you get the
opposite<00:01:14.610> reaction<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:15.600> probably<00:01:16.170> because

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
opposite reaction it's probably because

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.890 
opposite reaction it's probably because
you<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> clutch<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.509> backwards<00:01:18.509> there

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you have the clutch in backwards there

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.260 
you have the clutch in backwards there
are<00:01:19.020> X's<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.770> crosses<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.759> side<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.150> the
