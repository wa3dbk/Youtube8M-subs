the corners once again and then light in
the<00:00:22.020> middle<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:23.039> I've<00:00:23.340> seen<00:00:23.670> bebs<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.420> name

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the middle so I've seen bebs the name

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.929 
the middle so I've seen bebs the name
use<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.140> technique<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.800> loved<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.519> I

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
use this technique and I loved it and I

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.700 
use this technique and I loved it and I
did<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.660> spiced<00:00:28.019> chocolate<00:00:28.230> cod<00:00:28.590> and

did it for the spiced chocolate cod and

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.439 
did it for the spiced chocolate cod and
I<00:00:28.769> thought<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.760> wonder<00:00:30.029> what<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.269> would

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
I thought and I wonder what this would

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.939 
I thought and I wonder what this would
look<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.630> rock<00:00:31.050> climbing<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.529> because<00:00:31.830> it's
