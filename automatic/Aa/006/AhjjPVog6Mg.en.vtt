night walk around and did some did some
low-light<00:00:15.839> testing<00:00:16.199> and<00:00:16.320> things<00:00:16.440> like<00:00:16.560> that

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
low-light testing and things like that

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.529 
low-light testing and things like that
and<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.490> was<00:00:17.580> very<00:00:17.760> impressed<00:00:17.940> with<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> lens

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and I was very impressed with the lens

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.170 
and I was very impressed with the lens
however<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.560> did<00:00:19.770> mention<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.730> wanted<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
however I did mention that I wanted to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.720 
however I did mention that I wanted to
test<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> land<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> nikon<00:00:22.710> d800<00:00:23.430> as<00:00:23.550> well

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
test the land on a nikon d800 as well

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.990 
test the land on a nikon d800 as well
now<00:00:24.660> yeah<00:00:25.050> as<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> Nikon<00:00:25.890> user<00:00:26.130> having<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> shoot

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
now yeah as a Nikon user having to shoot

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.640 
now yeah as a Nikon user having to shoot
with<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.210> 5d<00:00:27.510> Mark<00:00:27.539> 3<00:00:27.720> did<00:00:28.050> kind<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.320> burn<00:00:28.500> my

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
with the 5d Mark 3 did kind of burn my

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.800 
with the 5d Mark 3 did kind of burn my
fingers<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> bit<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.029> wasn't<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.539> main

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
fingers a bit but that wasn't the main

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.600 
fingers a bit but that wasn't the main
reason<00:00:30.960> why<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> wanted<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.769> test<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.399> date

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
reason why I wanted to test it on a date

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.090 
reason why I wanted to test it on a date
hundred<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:34.079> wanted<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.800> how<00:00:35.040> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
hundred I actually wanted to see how the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.520 
hundred I actually wanted to see how the
lens<00:00:35.460> would<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> higher<00:00:36.930> 36

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
lens would do with the higher 36

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.150 
lens would do with the higher 36
megapixel<00:00:38.160> resolution<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:40.110> finally<00:00:41.040> I've

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
megapixel resolution and finally I've

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.830 
megapixel resolution and finally I've
had<00:00:41.489> an<00:00:41.579> opportunity<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.570> did

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
had an opportunity to do that I did

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.959 
had an opportunity to do that I did
finally<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.200> my<00:00:43.320> hands<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.160> Nikon<00:00:44.520> copy<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
finally get my hands on a Nikon copy of

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.520 
finally get my hands on a Nikon copy of
the<00:00:45.030> lens<00:00:47.360> now<00:00:48.360> I'm<00:00:48.629> not<00:00:48.840> gonna<00:00:48.960> go<00:00:49.230> through

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
the lens now I'm not gonna go through

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.529 
the lens now I'm not gonna go through
all<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.950> specifics<00:00:50.489> again<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.090> lands

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
all the specifics again of this lands

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.310 
all the specifics again of this lands
I'm<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.649> put<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> little<00:00:52.949> link<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:54.239> here

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
so I'm not gonna go over all the finer

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.120 
so I'm not gonna go over all the finer
details<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> lens<00:01:05.630> but<00:01:06.650> this<00:01:07.650> lens<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
details of the lens but this lens is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.510 
details of the lens but this lens is
extremely<00:01:08.700> sharp<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> d800<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.070> saw<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
extremely sharp on the d800 I saw a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
extremely sharp on the d800 I saw a
little<00:01:11.909> bit<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.390> chromatic<00:01:12.930> aberration

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
little bit more chromatic aberration

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
little bit more chromatic aberration
which<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.250> am<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.880> post<00:01:15.000> some<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.299> my

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
which I am going to post some of my

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.420 
which I am going to post some of my
samples<00:01:15.840> from<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.229> lens<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
samples from this lens I in the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.609 
samples from this lens I in the
description<00:01:17.880> below<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.320> little<00:01:19.530> bit

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
description below so it's a little bit

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.130 
description below so it's a little bit
more<00:01:19.770> chromatic<00:01:20.189> aberration<00:01:20.729> which<00:01:21.140> of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
more chromatic aberration which of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.830 
more chromatic aberration which of
course<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:23.310> higher<00:01:23.549> resolution<00:01:23.840> not

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
course if you have higher resolution not

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.420 
course if you have higher resolution not
only<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.170> resolve<00:01:25.439> more<00:01:25.770> good<00:01:26.040> detail

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
only do you resolve more good detail

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.999 
only do you resolve more good detail
which<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.880> resolve<00:01:27.210> more<00:01:28.170> negative

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
which you can resolve more negative

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.850 
which you can resolve more negative
detail<00:01:29.310> as<00:01:29.430> well<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.090> CA<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.869> that's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
detail as well just like CA so that's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.499 
detail as well just like CA so that's
something<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.369> saw<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> lens<00:01:33.210> did

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
something that I saw but the lens did

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.170 
something that I saw but the lens did
work<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.840> very<00:01:34.200> very<00:01:34.229> well<00:01:34.640> with<00:01:35.640> these<00:01:35.790> Sigma

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
work out very very well with these Sigma

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.429 
work out very very well with these Sigma
Prime's<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:37.049> did<00:01:37.530> find<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:39.170> sometimes<00:01:40.170> in

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
Prime's I did find that sometimes in

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.880 
Prime's I did find that sometimes in
very<00:01:40.680> low<00:01:40.920> light<00:01:41.360> focusing<00:01:42.360> situations<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.740> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
very low light focusing situations and I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.090 
very low light focusing situations and I
do<00:01:43.950> kind<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.640> an<00:01:44.850> issue<00:01:45.740> maybe<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
do kind of have an issue maybe just a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.560 
do kind of have an issue maybe just a
little<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.579> more<00:01:47.790> than<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.420> with

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
little bit more than what I have with

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.410 
samples and things along those lines in
the<00:03:21.810> past<00:03:22.109> I've<00:03:22.440> made<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.739> lot<00:03:23.069> of<00:03:23.100> videos<00:03:23.420> where

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the past I've made a lot of videos where

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.370 
the past I've made a lot of videos where
I<00:03:24.450> would<00:03:24.989> talk<00:03:25.290> for<00:03:25.730> 10<00:03:26.730> or<00:03:27.000> 15<00:03:27.389> or<00:03:27.420> 20<00:03:28.049> minutes

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
I would talk for 10 or 15 or 20 minutes

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.879 
I would talk for 10 or 15 or 20 minutes
but<00:03:29.069> I'm<00:03:29.160> going<00:03:29.430> to<00:03:29.549> try<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.840> do<00:03:30.889> shorter

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
but I'm going to try to do shorter

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.979 
but I'm going to try to do shorter
videos<00:03:32.190> but<00:03:33.150> just<00:03:33.420> make<00:03:33.660> them<00:03:33.840> more

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
videos but just make them more

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.020 
videos but just make them more
frequently<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.859> I<00:03:35.130> think<00:03:35.400> that'll<00:03:35.579> be<00:03:35.609> easier

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
frequently and I think that'll be easier
