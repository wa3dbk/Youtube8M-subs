00:00:49.940 --> 00:01:17.510 

all<00:00:50.940> right<00:00:58.820> all<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> way<00:01:00.000> over<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:16.190> fire<00:01:17.190> I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
all right all the way over to the fire I

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.480 
all right all the way over to the fire I
start<00:01:18.060> getting<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.690> again<00:01:19.590> my<00:01:20.250> truck

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
hasn't exploded yet but finally gets a

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.999 
hasn't exploded yet but finally gets a
little<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.840> closer<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.410> will<00:01:25.619> keep<00:01:25.830> on

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
little bit closer this will keep on

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.560 
little bit closer this will keep on
sneaking<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.759> down<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> Levien's<00:01:27.300> here

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
sneaking up and down the Levien's here

00:01:27.570 --> 00:02:07.360 
sneaking up and down the Levien's here
we<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.929> see

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.830 

interestingly<00:02:08.370> enough<00:02:08.760> the<00:02:09.120> mosquitoes<00:02:09.600> have

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
interestingly enough the mosquitoes have

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.550 
interestingly enough the mosquitoes have
picked<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.260> as<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.560> fires<00:02:10.800> gotten<00:02:11.220> closer<00:02:11.430> but

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
picked up as the fires gotten closer but

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.030 
picked up as the fires gotten closer but
it's<00:02:13.560> still<00:02:14.570> probably<00:02:15.570> what<00:02:16.370> 68<00:02:17.370> right<00:02:18.300> now

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
