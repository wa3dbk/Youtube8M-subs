00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hi in this video was to teach how 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.799
 I put the images of the same month 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.480
 how he recorded the video to be able to images 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.280
 Well the truth is very easy and good 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.990
 this video is very short 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.500
 good to start you have to have 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.420
 installed the video application efe - clip 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.939
 and well this works so much in video of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.680
 fx link or video to be alone that the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.960
 only difference is that envy fx live 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.160
 it is for recording without music and video 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.610
 stars or music 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.580
 first we have to go here plus 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.610
 what did you give him 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:46.090
 10 remove and good as you can see that is 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.809
 my good bed and you have to go here to 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.829
 the last option where it says new effect 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.859
 nothing more there 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.500
 and we will see these options and 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:02.460
 those options you have to select the one 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.790
 has the photo frame and we make ourselves 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.170
 pay it will appear this and you have to 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.630
 look for the one that is around here is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.180
 says and uses the photo and well this is not 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.960
 It costs this is free and good and you get 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.509
 appears there that says press take photo and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.409
 good is not served well and looks better 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.100
 hair 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.640
 You have to see good to be able to take a photo and 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.350
 das in catching photo of md and good for there 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.320
 I know is your selection the image of your 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.759
 images only if we were going to give 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.289
 this image and well had already the have 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.530
 that dying mobbing or how you want it 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:47.069
 young I do not know how much space you want 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.490
 that occupies or we are going to suppose that everything 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.170
 this this video space so 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.149
 you have to be exact of the one you're going to put 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.580
 of videos or putting it as normally 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.560
 I put the beginning of how to draw the I put 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:04.080
 the corner like that and well here they look like 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.479
 says one finger to drag two fingers 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.619
 to resize and rotate press two 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:14.890
 times to reset and now 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:18.320
 good to present I'm not sure is that 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.170
 is for this little sugar 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:26.330
 that is how to restart it and good for 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.330
 make a small stop and part 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.750
 well let's put it like that and we give it in 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.750
 fact 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.840
 and it will appear like that and now nothing more 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.349
 let's go here 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.300
 and your new effect is saved and now 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.180
 example you do not want that with these 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.350

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.140

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.460
 when it is washing for that 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.460
 supposing let's talk 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:06.620

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.620
 moment or just activate it 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.700
