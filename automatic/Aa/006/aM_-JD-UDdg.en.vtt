 We are fine because I also have an eye 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.939
 I bring 'breaking news' father everything 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.099
 I was doing if I was preparing a 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.050
 tortilla of the French I left the tortilla 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.339
 leave the French and I sent the French 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.539
 for home 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.099
 I'm going to teach her I was going to make a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.039
 good omelette with a good boost pair 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.869
 it fits the thing that interests in news of 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.219
 very important sports that comes to us 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.690
 say that everyone in some way 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.969
 we could become like the duchess 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.730
 of dawn is to say very very very very old 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.820
 yes, if we run mega one after super 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.109
 Very long marathons that will weigh you 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.390
 does this mean host 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.670
 many times and it's more on facebook 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.769
 facebook.com to valentí sanjuan if I do not 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.600
 I would still be able to do it and if you already follow me 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.879
 can you continue to create a 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.620
 facebook new and many people 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.719
 even as I told you, he tells me 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.670
 facebook or on twitter ostia valentí that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.800
 with these ultra racing follies 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.769
 100 kilometer trails 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.540
 the ironman the ultraman so much career you're going 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.610
 to end up fucked because this the body what 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.830
 will end up paying to see do not say no 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.600
 I start walking that looks before said 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.030
 the duchess of alba posse already sometimes 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.240
 It seems that when I start walking 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.220
 it seems that the Duchess style dance in 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.409
 order the thing is very simple despite 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.509
 that many people think to do all 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.640
 these mega super long ultramarathons 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.830
 from so much distance is harmful to 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.540
 the body has come out a news that 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.030
 comes based on a study that comes 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.030
 based on a university job where 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.970
 attention in a study indicates that running 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.700
 ultra marathons could lengthen life 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.080
 well I teach you the news if I had the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.350
 newspaper would be better than us the 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.090
 taught and that is finished print this 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.979
 is from a university in australia and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.539
 says this is from a little late Monday 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.670
 we are friday but hey you can not have 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.259
 everything and if they do not buy from the newspaper well 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.590
 you will pay and this channel is free 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.479
 I just wanted to say what one in 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.670
 australia have published the results 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.920
 of this study by which it seems that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.409
 the biological age of the runners of 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.450
 Ultra is much smaller 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.090
 the usual to say that age 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.120
 biological that is not always the brand 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.519
 our ID is much smaller when 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.510
 you run these distances attention that 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.819
 is me or the paragraph or sometimes which 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.680
 this is the main result and the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.510
 most striking for the runners is that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.180
 the subjects studied had an age 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.720
 average of 43 years although his age 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.060
 Biological biological was 16 years old - with 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.730
 an average of 27 years since according to this 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.560
 study run can delay the process 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.540
 of aging by protecting the part 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.000
 of the body that is responsible for the process of 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.040
 stop attrition of genes like 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.410
 you've been left with your ass twisted that if 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.540
 I eat ultra marathons I have the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.099
 twisted but in 16 years younger 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.530
 with which it would be like the ass of a 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.470
 baby is to say without so much clothes that are left 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.120
 like a uglier picture pull back 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.129
 and delete what I can not edit the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.340
 video that I'm very caught of time and 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:08.280
 that if eye told me here to do 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.220
 that would have to run between 40 and 100 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.230
 kilometers per week or you do not want 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.170
 degree is that once run a race 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.079
 70km longer here account 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.150
 basically the training and the hours and 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.730
 kilometers that you dedicate to train that 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.169
 during each week and regularly 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.650
 said what I'm doing 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:29.390
 apology of long distance 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.370
 I would be doing apology for these 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.890
 crazy things that I do and that in principle 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.440
 I do not train them well enough 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.110
 I have told you many times how typical 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.930
 this is done by a specialist of 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.520
 shit do not do it at home and if 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.290
 you want to do things like these I think what 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.940
 The best you can do is to put us in 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.920
 contact with a club get in touch 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.660
 with a coach if in the end the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.490
 you want to do pussy ostia does not make 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.180
 it's still necessary to ask permission for anyone to do what 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.380
 you want if you are of legal age but 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.640
 As I was telling you, this is not how the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.200
 palentino does I also have to 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.340
 make him look valentí he does it because 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.950
 he wants and because he is so hama 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.170
 you do what you want but only 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.150
 I wanted to break this spear against everything 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.100
 so much that is said many times of 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.010
 I spend mail so much you're going to pay it 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:17.209
 there goes a study of a university 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.660
 of fish memory that I have of a 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.820
 extra university 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.640
 what it does not say is whether sleeping during 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.520
 the videos that lengthen life I hope that 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.759
 you 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.759
 all right
