00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 interior architecture is the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.450
 consolidation of a customer 's dream is the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.160
 objective to be materialized in space are 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.199
 the market trends linked to the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.670
 personality such as the style of the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.820
 customer and the way you even saw it 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.449
 customer are the needs that people 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.220
 use in space and this who will me 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.189
 to say is the client himself 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.640
 The main point for the project is the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.410
 steak where customers will pass me 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.030
 all your needs 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.739
 Your expectations are your everyday life. 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.260
 then these guidelines will guide my 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.879
 project and from it I can 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.719
 materialize this dream 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.149
 the zoning of this room 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.370
 eliav sales own needs 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.320
 client for example if I have a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.410
 customer that he does not use 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.260
 Then I think of that wall of 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.680
 another way that goes another way 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.890
 meet customer expectations 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 another need that I always research 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.310
 for the customer are the colors that go 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.320
 to guide the project is itself the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.380
 lifestyle that customers will have 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.090
 and then comes the project of 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.900
 decoration ne 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.229
 are the colors all involve but the layout 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.439
 is the main reason why from there 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.960
 I'm going to make all my decisions. 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.840
 aesthetic or full and empty 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.450
 everything there seeing layout as a consequence 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.060
 layout and then I have to work 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 video that is behind the most 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.840
 translucent the mirror all these 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.110
 have teeth are tendencies of the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.869
 market that we work from 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.990
 a defined honey that will provide 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.009
 a pleasing result in the eyes of 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.680
 customer and now I'll show you 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.530
 all these points 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.950
 which were addressed in the designed room 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.950
 by me 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:24.239
 This is the project carried out in the 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:26.790
 two young girls who present 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.159
 various activities in a lair until 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.640
 Of course and the other plays guitar 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:35.459
 Both are students and enjoy a 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.640
 community that is the room set with 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.670
 cheerful colors and brings a sense of 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.189
 comfort at the same time I want to help 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.379
 you the first contact you have with 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:49.500
 alexandra to the girls' mother and was 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.420
 fundamental was the designer's briefing 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.540
 also called program 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.819
 in which she introduced me to the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:03.150
 day to day of the girls is the likes to 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:06.239
 personality of each is the form of 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.879
 dress and intimacy of bridges that 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.720
 were guidelines for the project 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:15.209
 Both are students so I thought every 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.340
 one of the girls need to think about 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.739
 individual study to avoid this 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.739
 contact and conversation with the 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.470
 attraction plus the studies and area of 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.489
 sleep was also planned the environment 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.609
 chi in which access stops the bed 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.290
 is a little hidden from the 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.000
 main room access 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.069
 Now for us this idea of beds 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.239
 all the furniture was 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.150
 harnessed 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.239
 use the bed with the drawers to store and 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.090
 tony only in bed linen in general that the 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.489
 route with its internal divisions 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.829
 because she does very much shoe 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.949
 dressed then everyone has their area 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:59.190
 individual in the own wardrobe and in the 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:04:01.709
 each study has its desk study 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.659
 your tilt your shelf to 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.400
 save your accessories 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.359
 you may notice that a room 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.000
 small are nine square meters 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.430
 100% used for two girls 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.180
 students with diverse activities 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.910
 the wallpaper 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.870
 it has red and pink tint 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.850
 solutions that girls like very much and 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.300
 sticker on the door also with the 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.840
 functionality and with musical tones 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.880
 how much a symbol of music is always the 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.910
 decoration is referring to this area of 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.280
 music I like by the colors throughout 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.729
 room composition the views 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.419
 full and empty are elements such as 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.030
 niches is the cabinet itself through the 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.139
 mirror that depth later in the 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.070
 environment 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:56.500
 the na v3 with the mute set that is movable 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.160
 the whole profile of the room brings us 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.590
 lightness to the environment as a whole 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.650
 as you can see in a room of 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.630
 only 9 square meters to achieve 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.380
 take advantage of the space for these two 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:15.870
 young people in the weak functional 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.870
 comfortable that coupled with aesthetics 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:25.169
 I hope you have enjoyed it if you 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:27.929
 have young children or are you young and 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.339
 abuses of strong colors thrown to 

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:31.799
 primary 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:36.199
 especially if you want to give this 

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:36.199
 joy in your environment in your daily life
