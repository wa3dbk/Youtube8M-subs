so<00:00:10.850> far<00:00:11.120> we've<00:00:11.330> created<00:00:11.600> a<00:00:11.870> basic<00:00:12.080> track<00:00:12.530> and

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
so far we've created a basic track and

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.920 
so far we've created a basic track and
approved<00:00:13.430> upon<00:00:13.730> it<00:00:13.910> by<00:00:14.000> adding<00:00:14.210> curves<00:00:14.630> to<00:00:14.809> the

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
approved upon it by adding curves to the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.870 
approved upon it by adding curves to the
driving<00:00:15.320> line<00:00:15.469> and<00:00:15.710> decorations<00:00:16.430> to<00:00:16.610> the<00:00:16.640> game

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
driving line and decorations to the game

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.240 
driving line and decorations to the game
world<00:00:17.090> now<00:00:17.720> we'll<00:00:18.410> move<00:00:18.560> forward<00:00:18.830> on<00:00:19.160> our

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
world now we'll move forward on our

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.490 
world now we'll move forward on our
mission<00:00:19.640> towards<00:00:19.820> Motocross<00:00:20.510> Madness<00:00:20.540> by

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
mission towards Motocross Madness by

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.400 
mission towards Motocross Madness by
adding<00:00:21.860> triggers<00:00:22.220> and<00:00:22.430> events<00:00:22.760> to<00:00:22.880> our<00:00:23.000> track

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
adding triggers and events to our track

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.840 
adding triggers and events to our track
this<00:00:24.410> time<00:00:24.710> we'll<00:00:25.039> be<00:00:25.160> using<00:00:25.340> some<00:00:25.730> more

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
this time we'll be using some more

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.670 
this time we'll be using some more
advanced<00:00:26.210> tools<00:00:26.539> so<00:00:27.080> let's<00:00:27.260> start<00:00:27.529> by

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
advanced tools so let's start by

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.980 
advanced tools so let's start by
launching<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.160> pro<00:00:28.430> editor<00:00:28.850> to<00:00:29.510> save<00:00:29.779> some

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
launching the pro editor to save some

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.109 
launching the pro editor to save some
time<00:00:30.199> however<00:00:30.410> we<00:00:30.830> can<00:00:31.250> load<00:00:31.430> up<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.730> track<00:00:31.970> we

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
time however we can load up the track we

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.020 
time however we can load up the track we
started<00:00:32.540> in<00:00:32.629> the<00:00:32.750> last<00:00:32.780> video<00:00:33.879> triggers<00:00:34.879> and

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
started in the last video triggers and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.030 
started in the last video triggers and
events<00:00:35.360> are<00:00:35.449> more<00:00:35.660> advanced<00:00:36.110> tools<00:00:36.350> I'll

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
events are more advanced tools I'll

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.009 
events are more advanced tools I'll
provide<00:00:37.340> a<00:00:37.519> basic<00:00:38.000> explanation<00:00:38.570> as<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:38.780> how

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
provide a basic explanation as to how

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:40.660 
provide a basic explanation as to how
they<00:00:39.199> function<00:00:39.650> but<00:00:40.100> I<00:00:40.130> highly<00:00:40.520> recommend

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
they function but I highly recommend

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.970 
they function but I highly recommend

more<00:00:45.430> events<00:00:46.430> are<00:00:46.550> basically<00:00:47.000> tools<00:00:47.329> that

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
more events are basically tools that

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.080 
more events are basically tools that
perform<00:00:48.050> some<00:00:48.290> sort<00:00:48.559> of<00:00:48.620> action<00:00:49.010> and<00:00:49.219> triggers

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
perform some sort of action and triggers

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.540 
perform some sort of action and triggers
are<00:00:50.329> how<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.600> events<00:00:51.079> are<00:00:51.200> activated<00:00:51.829> you<00:00:52.370> can

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
are how the events are activated you can

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.190 
are how the events are activated you can
find<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.879> number<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.210> examples<00:00:53.540> of<00:00:53.870> triggers

the first thing we'll add is an

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.200 
the first thing we'll add is an
explosion<00:01:00.379> you<00:01:00.829> can<00:01:01.070> make<00:01:01.399> explosions<00:01:02.030> by

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
explosion you can make explosions by

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.090 
explosion you can make explosions by
breaking<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.840> explosive<00:01:03.440> objects<00:01:03.950> like

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
breaking the explosive objects like

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.639 
breaking the explosive objects like
dynamite<00:01:04.489> boxes<00:01:05.059> or<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:05.840> can<00:01:06.020> use<00:01:06.200> an<00:01:06.320> effect

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
dynamite boxes or you can use an effect

event to activate explosion effects

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.840 
event to activate explosion effects
personally<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:09.680> prefer<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:10.220> explosion

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
personally I prefer the explosion

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.850 
personally I prefer the explosion
effects<00:01:11.180> as<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:11.690> get<00:01:11.840> more<00:01:12.050> choices<00:01:12.590> for<00:01:12.740> the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
effects as you get more choices for the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.070 
effects as you get more choices for the
look<00:01:13.069> of<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.340> explosions<00:01:14.000> for<00:01:14.690> our<00:01:14.810> track

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
look of the explosions for our track

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.960 
look of the explosions for our track
let's<00:01:15.560> place<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:15.800> ground<00:01:16.130> explosion<00:01:16.640> near<00:01:16.819> the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
let's place a ground explosion near the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.090 
let's place a ground explosion near the
start<00:01:17.300> so<00:01:17.690> we<00:01:17.869> get<00:01:18.020> a<00:01:18.050> nice<00:01:18.289> big<00:01:18.590> boom<00:01:18.830> right

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
start so we get a nice big boom right

that<00:01:55.210> was<00:01:55.360> fun<00:01:55.600> next<00:01:56.290> how<00:01:56.620> about<00:01:56.650> we<00:01:57.040> add<00:01:57.190> in

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
that was fun next how about we add in

out of the riders way for this we'll

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.380 
out of the riders way for this we'll
need<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.560> trigger<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:12.130> physics<00:02:12.700> event<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.180> a

need a trigger a physics event and a
break<00:02:13.630> event<00:02:15.000> again<00:02:16.000> we'll<00:02:16.480> start<00:02:16.600> by<00:02:16.870> opening

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
break event again we'll start by opening

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.900 
break event again we'll start by opening
the<00:02:17.410> trigger<00:02:17.620> properties<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.370> pointing<00:02:18.820> it

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
the trigger properties and pointing it

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.080 
the trigger properties and pointing it
towards<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.300> physics<00:02:19.630> event<00:02:20.730> will<00:02:21.730> set<00:02:21.940> up

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
towards the physics event will set up

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.000 
towards the physics event will set up
the<00:02:22.240> physics<00:02:22.600> event<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.110> activate<00:02:23.530> physics<00:02:23.890> on

the physics event to activate physics on
the<00:02:24.130> barrels<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.930> impulse<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.230> be<00:02:26.290> passed

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
the barrels the impulse can be passed

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.220 
the barrels the impulse can be passed
along<00:02:26.770> between<00:02:27.100> events<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.300> now<00:02:28.480> instead<00:02:28.840> of

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
along between events so now instead of

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.230 
along between events so now instead of
placing<00:02:29.410> another<00:02:29.860> trigger<00:02:30.220> we<00:02:30.820> can<00:02:31.000> choose

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
placing another trigger we can choose

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.120 
placing another trigger we can choose
the<00:02:31.420> select<00:02:31.810> event<00:02:32.140> filter<00:02:32.560> option<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
physics event and point it towards the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.940 
physics event and point it towards the
break<00:02:35.260> event

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
break event

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.010 
break event
finally<00:02:36.610> we'll<00:02:36.910> open<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.300> break<00:02:37.510> event<00:02:37.840> and

finally we'll open the break event and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.780 
finally we'll open the break event and
select<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.560> wooden<00:02:38.860> plank<00:02:39.100> as<00:02:39.310> our<00:02:39.430> target

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
select the wooden plank as our target

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.480 
select the wooden plank as our target
object<00:02:39.880> now<00:02:40.870> we're<00:02:41.320> all<00:02:41.440> set<00:02:41.710> let's<00:02:42.070> give<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.370> a

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
object now we're all set let's give it a

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:50.340 
object now we're all set let's give it a
test<00:02:42.640> run

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.720 

finally<00:02:51.350> let's<00:02:51.710> end<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.040> thing<00:02:52.250> with<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.430> bang

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
finally let's end this thing with a bang

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.150 
finally let's end this thing with a bang
this<00:02:53.570> time<00:02:53.840> we'll<00:02:54.260> place<00:02:54.500> an<00:02:54.650> explosive

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
this time we'll place an explosive

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160 
this time we'll place an explosive
object<00:02:55.550> on<00:02:55.760> or<00:02:55.970> around<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.420> finish<00:02:56.600> line<00:02:56.930> and

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
object on or around the finish line and

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.930 
object on or around the finish line and
since<00:02:57.770> we're<00:02:57.920> using<00:02:57.950> an<00:02:58.340> object<00:02:58.460> this<00:02:58.880> time

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
since we're using an object this time

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.240 
since we're using an object this time
we'll<00:02:59.690> use<00:02:59.720> the<00:03:00.080> break<00:03:00.290> event<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.770> blow<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.100> up

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
we'll use the break event to blow it up

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.060 
we'll use the break event to blow it up
in<00:03:01.940> trials<00:03:02.420> evo<00:03:02.720> we<00:03:03.050> can<00:03:03.200> also<00:03:03.380> use<00:03:03.740> check

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
in trials evo we can also use check

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.580 
in trials evo we can also use check
points<00:03:04.400> as<00:03:04.520> triggers<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.600> this<00:03:05.810> time<00:03:06.050> we'll

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
points as triggers so this time we'll

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.560 
points as triggers so this time we'll
use<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:06.980> check<00:03:07.220> point<00:03:07.460> instead<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:07.970> placing<00:03:08.300> a

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
use the check point instead of placing a

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.360 
use the check point instead of placing a
trigger<00:03:08.840> this<00:03:09.590> will<00:03:09.740> ensure<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.100> this

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
trigger this will ensure that this

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.190 
trigger this will ensure that this
explosion<00:03:10.820> can't<00:03:11.270> be<00:03:11.420> accidentally

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200
