post hugging the tree embracing horse

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.580 
post hugging the tree embracing horse
but<00:00:17.820> essentially<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.660> embodies<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.350> main

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
but essentially it embodies the main

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.470 
but essentially it embodies the main
alignment<00:00:20.250> principles<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.850> we'll<00:00:21.060> discuss

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
alignment principles that we'll discuss

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.620 
alignment principles that we'll discuss
and<00:00:21.779> learn<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:23.160> foundation<00:00:24.090> for<00:00:24.300> Tai<00:00:24.420> Chi

practice
so<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:25.680> first<00:00:25.949> posture<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> most

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
so this first posture is the most

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.640 
so this first posture is the most
important<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.840> learn<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.349> if<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.529> learn

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
important one you learn and if you learn

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
important one you learn and if you learn
nothing<00:00:28.680> else<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.240> your<00:00:30.390> default

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
nothing else this is your default

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.400 
nothing else this is your default
practice<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.740> fact<00:00:32.690> when<00:00:33.690> before<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> had<00:00:34.380> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
practice in fact when before I had a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.920 
practice in fact when before I had a
school<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.130> would<00:00:35.190> wanted<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.270> maintain<00:00:36.570> my

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
school and I would wanted to maintain my

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.479 
school and I would wanted to maintain my
practice<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.500> would<00:00:37.739> come<00:00:37.980> back<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.190> this

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
practice I would come back to this

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.729 
practice I would come back to this
posture<00:00:38.969> when<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.450> was<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.780> college<00:00:40.320> in

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
posture when I was in college in

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.760 
posture when I was in college in
practicing<00:00:41.430> Tai<00:00:41.610> Chi<00:00:41.640> every<00:00:42.270> day<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> did<00:00:43.620> this

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
practicing Tai Chi every day I did this

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.520 
practicing Tai Chi every day I did this
posture<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.789> minimum<00:00:45.390> maintenance<00:00:45.809> posture

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
posture as a minimum maintenance posture

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.029 
posture as a minimum maintenance posture
it's<00:00:47.219> very<00:00:47.520> powerful<00:00:48.440> details<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.649> alignment

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
it's very powerful details to alignment

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.770 
it's very powerful details to alignment
that'll<00:00:50.219> be<00:00:50.579> very<00:00:50.610> subtle<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.329> beginning

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that'll be very subtle in the beginning

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.970 
that'll be very subtle in the beginning
so<00:00:51.899> at<00:00:52.020> first<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.590> want<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> get

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
so at first you just want to get

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
so at first you just want to get
familiar<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.120> posture<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.750> an

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
familiar with the posture and get an

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.930 
familiar with the posture and get an
idea<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.789> okay

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
idea of it okay

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.520 
idea of it okay
what<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> do<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.750> separate<00:00:58.140> your<00:00:58.350> feet

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
what you do is you separate your feet

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.380 
what you do is you separate your feet
about<00:00:58.680> shoulder<00:00:58.859> width<00:00:59.760> shoulder<00:01:00.120> width<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
about shoulder width shoulder width and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.840 
about shoulder width shoulder width and
a<00:01:00.510> half<00:01:00.719> apart<00:01:01.280> but<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.430> means<00:01:02.579> you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
a half apart but that means you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.390 
a half apart but that means you
separated<00:01:03.359> about<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.809> far<00:01:04.049> apart<00:01:04.400> shoulder

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
separated about this far apart shoulder

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.340 
separated about this far apart shoulder
width<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> sometimes<00:01:06.150> debatable<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:07.229> it

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
width is sometimes debatable but it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.929 
width is sometimes debatable but it
should<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.560> comfortable<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.490> too<00:01:08.729> close

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
should be comfortable but not too close

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.880 
should be comfortable but not too close
together<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:10.290> wouldn't<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.740> very

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
together this wouldn't be very

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.469 
together this wouldn't be very
comfortable<00:01:11.340> once<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.970> show<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> whole

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
comfortable once I show you the whole

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.710 
comfortable once I show you the whole
posture<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.170> stepping<00:01:14.070> too<00:01:14.310> big<00:01:14.689> was<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
posture and stepping too big was a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.840 
posture and stepping too big was a
common<00:01:16.170> mistake<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.799> misaligns<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> body

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
common mistake that misaligns the body

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.840 
common mistake that misaligns the body
so<00:01:18.780> anyways<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.619> separated<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.430> shoulder

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
so anyways it's separated of shoulder

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.539 
so anyways it's separated of shoulder
width<00:01:21.119> shoulder<00:01:21.600> width<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> half<00:01:22.110> apart

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
width shoulder width and a half apart

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.030 
width shoulder width and a half apart
begins<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.820> toes<00:01:24.060> turning<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.689> slightly

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
begins with the toes turning in slightly

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.819 
begins with the toes turning in slightly
and<00:01:26.540> then<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> knees<00:01:27.869> Bend<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> knees<00:01:28.650> go

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and then the knees Bend and the knees go

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.649 
and then the knees Bend and the knees go
out<00:01:29.070> slightly<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.820> there's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> beach<00:01:30.329> ball

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
out slightly like there's a beach ball

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.350 
out slightly like there's a beach ball
between<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.229> knees<00:01:31.880> notice<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.030> might<00:01:33.150> do

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
between the knees notice that might do

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.420 
between the knees notice that might do
this<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.720> my<00:01:33.840> ankles<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.619> supported<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
this that my ankles get supported and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.810 
this that my ankles get supported and
aligned<00:01:36.140> if<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.680> simply<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.159> toes<00:01:38.549> in

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
aligned if this is simply this toes in

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.800 
aligned if this is simply this toes in
knees<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.329> idea<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.930> simply<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:41.659> correct<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
knees out idea is simply to correct the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.020 
knees out idea is simply to correct the
problem<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.380> knees<00:01:43.619> twisting<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> lot<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
problem of knees twisting so a lot of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.850 
problem of knees twisting so a lot of
knee<00:01:45.210> problems<00:01:45.630> come<00:01:45.840> from<00:01:45.869> knees<00:01:46.229> twisting

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
knee problems come from knees twisting

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.219 
knee problems come from knees twisting
what<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.130> mean<00:01:47.369> by<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.509> put<00:01:48.750> my<00:01:48.899> toes

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
what I mean by that is if I put my toes

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.700 
what I mean by that is if I put my toes
out<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:50.820> my<00:01:51.030> knees<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.200> looked<00:01:52.409> at<00:01:52.530> my

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
out in my knees in if you looked at my

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.730 
out in my knees in if you looked at my
knees<00:01:52.979> they're<00:01:53.820> twisting<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:55.500> might

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
knees they're twisting and this might

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.069 
knees they're twisting and this might
even<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.250> cringe<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:57.060> bit<00:01:57.240> but

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
even make you cringe a little bit but

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.010 
even make you cringe a little bit but
this<00:01:58.799> simply<00:01:59.189> corrects<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.899> you've

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
this simply corrects it and if you've

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.179 
this simply corrects it and if you've
never<00:02:01.200> done<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.469> before

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
never done this before

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.520 
never done this before
this<00:02:02.340> should<00:02:02.549> feel<00:02:02.700> quite<00:02:02.909> odd<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:04.259> after<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
this should feel quite odd but after a

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.190 
this should feel quite odd but after a
little<00:02:04.649> bit<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.979> practice<00:02:05.159> you'll<00:02:06.149> say<00:02:07.079> of

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
little bit of practice you'll say of

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.080 
little bit of practice you'll say of
course<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.890> course<00:02:08.190> why<00:02:08.459> would<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.879> any

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
course of course why would you do it any

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.070 
course of course why would you do it any
other<00:02:09.179> way

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080

they<00:03:43.470> get<00:03:43.590> older<00:03:43.920> which<00:03:44.130> also<00:03:44.489> causes<00:03:44.880> back

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
they get older which also causes back

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.390 
they get older which also causes back
pain<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.510> problems<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.350> when<00:03:47.070> we're<00:03:47.220> just

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
pain and problems so when we're just

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.800 
pain and problems so when we're just
standing<00:03:47.670> we<00:03:47.970> want<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.239> find<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.480> neutral

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
standing we want to find a neutral

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.800 
standing we want to find a neutral
position<00:03:49.200> for<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.920> pelvis<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.420> pelvis

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
position for the pelvis so the pelvis

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.100 
position for the pelvis so the pelvis
can<00:03:52.050> roll<00:03:52.380> back<00:03:52.800> with<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.370> back<00:03:53.550> arches<00:03:54.030> or<00:03:54.239> it

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
can roll back with the back arches or it

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.050 
can roll back with the back arches or it
can<00:03:55.290> roll<00:03:55.500> under<00:03:56.010> which<00:03:56.160> we<00:03:56.280> call<00:03:56.459> tucking<00:03:56.850> in

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
can roll under which we call tucking in

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.840 
can roll under which we call tucking in
when<00:03:57.989> we<00:03:58.140> have<00:03:58.320> our<00:03:58.440> legs<00:03:58.650> straight<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.670> want

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
when we have our legs straight you want

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.600 
when we have our legs straight you want
to<00:04:00.000> have<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.600> neutral<00:04:01.320> position<00:04:01.530> for<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:02.310> so

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
to have a neutral position for this so

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.850 
to have a neutral position for this so
it's<00:04:02.760> not<00:04:02.820> tucked<00:04:03.209> under<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.750> lot<00:04:04.050> or<00:04:04.380> not
