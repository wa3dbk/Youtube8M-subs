00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.810 
inside and I saw it had that option I
couldn't<00:00:25.769> figure<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.010> how<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> do<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.789> I

looked<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.269> up<00:00:27.390> online<00:00:27.720> head<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> little<00:00:28.859> tro

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
looked it up online head a little tro

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.540 
looked it up online head a little tro
find<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.820> manual<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.199> how<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.529> do<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.949> this

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
find the manual to see how to do it this

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.660 
find the manual to see how to do it this
is<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.880> do<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.239> go<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.570> delay<00:00:34.260> start

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
is how you do it you go to a delay start

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.810 
is how you do it you go to a delay start
and<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.480> will<00:00:36.600> start<00:00:36.809> blinking<00:00:37.460> you<00:00:38.460> do<00:00:38.579> this

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
and this will start blinking you do this

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.299 
and this will start blinking you do this
and<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.510> will<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.200> time<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.950> want<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and this will be the time you want to

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.799 
and this will be the time you want to
start<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.850> really<00:00:41.940> not<00:00:42.090> 3:30<00:00:42.600> but

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
start so it's really not 3:30 but

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.380 
start so it's really not 3:30 but
whatever<00:00:43.170> you're<00:00:44.100> 31<00:00:44.550> okay<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.000> then<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> go

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
whatever you're 31 okay and then you go

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.709 
whatever you're 31 okay and then you go
to<00:00:45.420> clean<00:00:46.320> there<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.090> then<00:00:48.090> you'll<00:00:48.239> press<00:00:48.450> up

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
to clean there and then you'll press up

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.020 
to clean there and then you'll press up
area<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.950> would<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> four<00:00:50.489> hour<00:00:50.640> cycle

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
area so this would be a four hour cycle

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.939 
area so this would be a four hour cycle
that's<00:00:51.480> three<00:00:51.840> hour<00:00:51.960> cycle<00:00:52.440> whatever<00:00:52.680> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
that's three hour cycle whatever you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.180 
that's three hour cycle whatever you
want<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.610> press<00:00:54.620> press<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.739> again<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
want it to do press press it again and

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.180 
want it to do press press it again and
it<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:56.969> start<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.629> hear<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> motor

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
it will start and you can hear the motor

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.220 
it will start and you can hear the motor
the<00:00:59.190> motor<00:00:59.219> will<00:00:59.640> lock<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.090> door<00:01:00.300> open<00:01:00.660> or

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the motor will lock the door open or

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.009 
the motor will lock the door open or
closed<00:01:02.059> and<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.149> won't<00:01:03.270> let<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.510> open<00:01:03.750> until

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.330 
closed and I won't let you open until
it's<00:01:04.199> done<00:01:05.150> I'm<00:01:06.150> going<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.360> cancel<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.810> though

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
it's done I'm going to cancel it though

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.340 
it's done I'm going to cancel it though
so<00:01:08.340> that's<00:01:08.549> how<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.240> one<00:01:10.020> thing<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
so that's how you do that one thing I

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
so that's how you do that one thing I
noticed<00:01:11.210> it<00:01:12.210> says<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:13.010> remove<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.340> broiler

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
noticed it says here remove the broiler

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.070 
noticed it says here remove the broiler
pan<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.780> insert<00:01:17.060> ball<00:01:18.060> ball<00:01:18.360> remove<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080

pan and insert ball ball remove the
boiler<00:01:19.409> pan<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.090> my<00:01:21.990> problem<00:01:22.409> was<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:23.360> can<00:01:24.360> never

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
boiler pan so my problem was I can never

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.920 
boiler pan so my problem was I can never
get<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> thing<00:01:25.140> clean<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.680> right<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.930> I

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
can never get it clean so I didn't do it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.920
