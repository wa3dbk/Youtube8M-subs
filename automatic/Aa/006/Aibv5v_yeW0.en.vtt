00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.530
 So we would be the 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.540
 Charging station of 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.120
 which McKinnon explain to me a bit like all this 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.430
 it worked that did not mean anything else than forgive us such a way 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.900
 and yet a pity 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.090
 Thus, these and before the work all day and in Großbeeren 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.980
 Key Minibus b micro-usb here grows a key for iPod iPhone 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.819
 twice 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.669
 and the whole is then covered with this party 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.429
 he later on the 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.670
 Consumers have been such a beautiful word then and we will have them 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.470
 but a little nice 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.530
 the whole is driven 4 back with mim normal connection 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.980
 where to click then 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.990
 Headrest Reinstetten can or the hallmark of the 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.990

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.420
 lives 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.280
 another special feature 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.470
 Of course, the percentage of shares here is still different 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.540
 So if you can handle it 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.820
 no matter on which continent, no matter on which you are or which part of the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.060
 World about this solar system which planet 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.360
 So you have here for every country 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.630
 had these essays for the different chambers 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.870
 Sticker in the hotels houses and so on 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.479
 Here we have Europe, so we seem to use it here 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.310
 then i found out it is best to have the equipment you have 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.570
 he also wants to do it now 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.600
 wired with the stickers 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 and then we should the iPhone 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.690
 so 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.760
 No, I cheated on myself "even in the café, there were far too few seen 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.970
 Photo 1 Dr 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.360
 again as an example 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.630
 the iPod 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.850
 quite normal then comes the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.259
 So here is synonymous BlackBerry worried micro-usb and Sandro 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.369
 USB ports and so on but I'm doing it next to me with these two 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.030
 equipment 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.390
 what he has on me surrounded me 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.710
 then you just look at the map on top of it 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.019
 Quicktime the devices just here on the test procedure on the plate 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.899

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:16.239
 and then just close the whole thing here 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.199
 performance 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.199

 Jump 1 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.129
 So you can now have her lying so long let her say 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.569
 that just looks backlogs i have to say i just look great 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.789
 it would therefore have as well 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:49.969
 as I imagine that this one is very practically impossible this whole 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.839
 Cable Salad Everything Else Finds Security Lives Life 

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.029
