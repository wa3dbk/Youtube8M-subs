00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
okay so then we're going to use a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.650 
okay so then we're going to use a
toothpick<00:02:17.510> oh<00:02:18.020> can<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:18.770> see<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.040> a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
toothpick and we're going to make the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.690 
toothpick and we're going to make the
design<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.920> we're<00:02:22.040> going<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.190> make<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.340> star

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
design and we're going to make a star

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.780 
design and we're going to make a star
this<00:02:22.910> time<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.900> we<00:02:24.020> bring<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.320> in<00:02:24.470> oops<00:02:25.040> we're

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
this time so we bring it in oops we're

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:34.600 
this time so we bring it in oops we're
just<00:02:25.940> going<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.150> bring<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:26.650> like<00:02:27.650> that

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.330 

so<00:02:35.240> after<00:02:35.390> that's<00:02:35.840> done<00:02:36.350> we're<00:02:36.980> going<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.190> take

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
so after that's done we're going to take

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.060 
so after that's done we're going to take
our<00:02:37.520> nail<00:02:37.760> right<00:02:38.510> here<00:02:38.750> and<00:02:39.020> we<00:02:39.800> can<00:02:39.920> actually

under the water and start blowing the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.970 
under the water and start blowing the
surface<00:02:59.750> so<00:02:59.990> that<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.230> nail<00:03:00.380> polish<00:03:00.680> dries

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
surface so that the nail polish dries
