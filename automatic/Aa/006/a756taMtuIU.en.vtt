that all right now just put it on I know

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.630 
that all right now just put it on I know
code<00:04:08.540> so<00:04:08.810> just<00:04:08.989> use<00:04:09.139> like<00:04:09.230> lasers<00:04:09.889> code<00:04:10.190> where

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
code so just use like lasers code where

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.070 
code so just use like lasers code where
for<00:04:10.910> disco<00:04:11.480> ten<00:04:12.380> percent<00:04:12.680> off<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:14.569> raises<00:04:14.870> a

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
for disco ten percent off so it raises a

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.340 
for disco ten percent off so it raises a
little<00:04:15.440> bit<00:04:15.620> like<00:04:16.370> it<00:04:16.700> feels<00:04:16.970> way<00:04:17.690> different

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350
