00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.429
 if x or the steam quine 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.500
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.250
 new tutorial or more particularly 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.869
 for problem solving on itunes 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:27.630
 so it's related to this little window 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.480
 or the ivy weisz so iphone ipod touch 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.219
 and ipad 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.160
 we can not update it 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.620
 so I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 solve this problem 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.250
 so first of all you have to go to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.399
 finder and then go into alley at 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.300
 folder 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:53.430
 private slash 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.379
 slash the tc slash so east when we 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.309
 arrives in a small window like that 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.500
 2 6 tc we can close saint apre est 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.470
 made there you have to find the folder host 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.040
 so this is this one host you do it 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.060
 slide on your desk 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.610
 now once it's done click 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.729
 right open with tex is said 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.400
 so this is exactly this window 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.970
 full that happens so that we do not care 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.850
 the problem is there in front it must 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.540
 put a pound and press the key 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.540
 tabulation 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:39.000
 once it's done you do 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:43.380
 so leave the habit once that 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.020
 recorded it after once that you 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.869
 take your back arm you put it 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.399
 in the trash hop that will you 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.829
 ask for your password 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.970
 of users so once that is 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.560
 made 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.470
 you replace it with the new you 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.870
 come create or put it in 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.440
 authenticated or authenticate it again the 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.440
 password of users 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.950
 once it's done it's over 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.580
 problem should be solved 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.580
 that's good
