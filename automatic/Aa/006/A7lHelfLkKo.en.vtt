friction of the applicator pad on the
paste<00:03:17.280> wax<00:03:17.520> is<00:03:17.790> actually<00:03:18.360> going<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.540> prime<00:03:18.840> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
paste wax is actually going to prime the

paste wax is actually going to prime the
applicator<00:03:19.440> pad<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.860> give<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> lot<00:03:20.640> on<00:03:20.820> the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
applicator pad and give you a lot on the

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.729 
applicator pad and give you a lot on the
pad<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:22.019> might<00:03:22.170> seem<00:03:22.380> like<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.590> little

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
pad now that might seem like a little

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:23.870 
pad now that might seem like a little
bit<00:03:22.890> but<00:03:23.100> it's<00:03:23.220> actually<00:03:23.430> going<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.640> spread

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
bit but it's actually going to spread

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.560 
bit but it's actually going to spread
all<00:03:24.120> over<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.570> surface<00:03:26.120> I'm<00:03:27.120> going<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.299> set<00:03:27.450> my

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
all over the surface I'm going to set my

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.390 
all over the surface I'm going to set my
wax<00:03:27.780> down<00:03:28.049> now<00:03:28.860> I'm<00:03:28.950> going<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.130> take<00:03:29.250> my

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
wax down now I'm going to take my

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.100 
wax down now I'm going to take my
applicator<00:03:29.850> pad<00:03:30.030> I'm<00:03:30.180> gonna<00:03:30.330> gently<00:03:30.630> spread

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
applicator pad I'm gonna gently spread

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.289 
applicator pad I'm gonna gently spread
it<00:03:31.230> on<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.350> surface<00:03:31.440> now<00:03:32.340> people<00:03:32.730> often<00:03:32.880> think

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
it on the surface now people often think

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.880 
it on the surface now people often think
you're<00:03:33.390> supposed<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.750> apply<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.110> wax<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:34.769> a

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
you're supposed to apply the wax in a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.380 
you're supposed to apply the wax in a
circular<00:03:35.160> motion<00:03:35.519> but<00:03:36.150> that's<00:03:36.299> actually

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
circular motion but that's actually

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.690 
circular motion but that's actually
incorrect<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.140> want<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.380> apply<00:03:37.590> lines<00:03:38.040> so

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
incorrect you want to apply lines so

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.370 
incorrect you want to apply lines so
we're<00:03:38.850> going<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.030> apply<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.330> carnuba<00:03:39.780> wax<00:03:39.870> in

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
we're going to apply the carnuba wax in

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.289 
we're going to apply the carnuba wax in
lines<00:03:40.920> now<00:03:41.250> look<00:03:41.430> at<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.610> coverage<00:03:41.940> we<00:03:42.090> get

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
lines now look at the coverage we get

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.750 
lines now look at the coverage we get
when<00:03:42.630> we<00:03:42.720> apply<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:43.080> lines<00:03:43.500> we<00:03:44.070> get<00:03:44.220> even

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
when we apply it lines we get even

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.090 
when we apply it lines we get even
coverage<00:03:45.209> over<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.540> entire<00:03:45.870> vehicle<00:03:46.230> and

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
coverage over the entire vehicle and

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.400 
coverage over the entire vehicle and
it's<00:03:47.790> also<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.150> nice<00:03:48.390> thin<00:03:48.690> coat<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.170> we're<00:03:49.320> not

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
it's also a nice thin coat so we're not

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.759 
it's also a nice thin coat so we're not
over<00:03:49.769> using<00:03:50.160> our<00:03:50.310> paste<00:03:50.610> wax

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
over using our paste wax

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.080 
over using our paste wax
now<00:03:52.769> our<00:03:52.920> paste<00:03:53.130> wax<00:03:53.459> has<00:03:53.640> come<00:03:53.820> in<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:53.970> variety

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
now our paste wax has come in a variety

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.449 
now our paste wax has come in a variety
of<00:03:54.330> sizes<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.110> piece<00:03:55.320> 53<00:03:55.950> paste<00:03:56.190> wax

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
of sizes but this piece 53 paste wax

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.670 
of sizes but this piece 53 paste wax
should<00:03:57.030> be<00:03:57.150> able<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.390> get<00:03:57.630> over<00:03:57.780> 100

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
should be able to get over 100

applications<00:03:59.400> on<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.700> vehicle<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.920> that's<00:04:02.040> a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
applications on a vehicle so that's a

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
applications on a vehicle so that's a
great<00:04:02.280> way<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.489> ensure<00:04:02.820> that<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:03.030> have

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
great way to ensure that you have

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.640 
great way to ensure that you have
maximum<00:04:03.420> protection<00:04:04.019> over<00:04:04.230> any<00:04:04.410> type<00:04:04.620> of

maximum protection over any type of

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.340 
maximum protection over any type of
surface<00:04:05.390> we<00:04:06.390> need<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.630> little<00:04:06.810> bit<00:04:06.900> more<00:04:07.049> paste

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350

applicator pad and you can keep on
moving<00:04:15.500> here<00:04:16.500> we<00:04:16.620> go<00:04:17.120> even<00:04:18.120> thin<00:04:18.359> coverage<00:04:18.840> is

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
moving here we go even thin coverage is

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.279 
moving here we go even thin coverage is
