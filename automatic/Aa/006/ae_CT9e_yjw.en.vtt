Britain's<00:00:33.600> Got<00:00:33.750> Talent<00:00:33.780> tried<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.559> beat<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
Britain's Got Talent tried to beat the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
Britain's Got Talent tried to beat the
record<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.550> guess<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> record<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.300> seven

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
record and I guess the record is seven

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.139 
record and I guess the record is seven
in<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.140> minute<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:38.250> guy<00:00:38.460> only<00:00:38.670> eat<00:00:38.910> like

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
in one minute and that guy only eat like

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.500 
in one minute and that guy only eat like
four<00:00:39.360> even<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> announcer<00:00:40.890> guy<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.790> he<00:00:42.329> ate

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
four even the announcer guy like he ate

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.410 
four even the announcer guy like he ate
more<00:00:42.750> than<00:00:42.809> him<00:00:43.520> so<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.760> mean<00:00:44.940> clearly<00:00:45.270> that

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
more than him so I mean clearly that

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.270 
more than him so I mean clearly that
guy's<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> failure<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.800> personal

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
guy's a failure but I think my personal

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.040 
guy's a failure but I think my personal
record<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.000> beat<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.360> guy<00:00:48.600> let's<00:00:48.899> go
