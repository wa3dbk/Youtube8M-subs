00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:06.440
 together with my z4 again one 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.200
 washing plant or so sb 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.440
 can see here and 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.079
 climate is the so-called 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.930
 ballet per bill berry wants climate or 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:19.550
 google's safe cleaner and I have at 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.140
 my last cleaning video to 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.060
 explain and show how to fell 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.830
 really cleans already with such a clean 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.130
 cleaner very much positive feedback 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.810
 and get some private messages 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.280
 and accordingly I go there now 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.020
 yet a closer look I want a sure 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.420
 show how to do his cases really 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.610
 well completely cleaned has to do that too 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.470
 a little bit of a few tools him 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.390
 brought them quickly once the 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:47.690
 has use and then we see from here 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.520
 Daytona exactly the speedmaster per machine 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.070
 Brush looks like one over the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.620
 but saale toilet brush is of course ideal 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.649
 Rim here a pretty free 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.809
 have agreed and have there 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.910
 we just think the possibility is great 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.290
 to clean with that you can see here 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.299
 if I'm such a little bit 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.700
 try without any cleaner here 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.440
 cleaning a bit of a rim is there 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.150
 Already clear the dare is relatively new 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.000
 It is one year old but as you can see 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.920
 can prove here to this firmer 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.420
 we are not as easy to come off so 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.220
 is not a fake or similar here in the 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.750
 I'm here for the sylvari climate video 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.310
 I have a mixture of 13 is the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.260
 really as effective as the other one 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.600
 video is already seen because 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.010
 if you spray on it now then 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.970
 should you already see how the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.250
 dirt dissolves the brake dust and me 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.310
 would now also be targeted in the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.939
 rim holes probably already in the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.220
 screw holes and that's what we have 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.049
 actually still the possibility this 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.590
 disgusting brake dust really good too 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.450
 to solve 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.970
 because as long as I'm not a porsche with me 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.020
 The ceramic brake must be able to perform the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.020
 just for it 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.799
 that should be enough now I have 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.159
 also another tool as well 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.250
 That's what it's always been talking about somewhere 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.250
 Not 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.380
 deep down in there is that is one 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.760
 special brush and I do not know 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.350
 there is a manufacturer somewhere on it 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.900
 also from the same manufacturer as the 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.920
 bill berry cleaner of ballet pro and 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.200
 That's rubber rubber brush I say 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.600
 in addition to rubber knobs 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.820
 somehow also relatively soft and 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.380
 accordingly fields gently and 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.240
 With that you have the possibility we 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.190
 can see here within the 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.460
 fields holes also the fucking 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.080
 rauszukriegen we oppose the 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.260
 now always do that kind of thing 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:51.010
 a bit of preliminary work here 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:53.180
 Zack Zack zack we would have and 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.590
 between those things a little bit of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:00.980
 billberry cleaner says it says something 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.770
 the decent brake dust but that 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.400
 we should get away and so now 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.690
 I have to as a hand I have 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.120
 unfortunately no camera with at hand 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.880
 Now let's go here and help her 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.100
 euro one 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.430
 the lance with and normal on clear 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.140
 let's play here we can set 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.330
 a cleaner or something like that now 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.330
 still something night and clean 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.450
 so hopefully we can try to see 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.090
 It's a bit difficult here now 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.379
 with a hand on so a bit already 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.379
 go in the rim bed 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.459
 to the largest possible dirt simply 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.459
 get rid of 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.620
 and okay the rim is here now 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.620
 not very much now 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.140
 if you see the rim is in here 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.269
 really in the cot still the black 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.370
 so dirty here 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.380
 there is still a lot of dirt and he 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.790
 just will not be solved so that 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.790
 creates possible the bill berry china 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.240
 really for the cold and that is 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.240
 a cool thing 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.780
 So some of that stuff really has 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.300
 power everything here jet black 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.460
 this is not a fake or anything like that 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.660
 accordingly, here also above 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.450
 I had really taken care of it here and 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.090
 we what everything is still down number 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.590
 pitch black ahland dust just yes 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.680
 and accordingly the baby is 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.690
 really recommended because funded 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.070
 Berlin 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.580
 Now let's just go and take 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.490
 This ominous toilet brush I baptize 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.260
 I think it's very important 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.630
 first, so-called grid down here 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.350
 in and dirt that accumulates here 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:17.790
 no one down now and then really 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.110
 Just clean the brake disc 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.060
 of course it is a bit tight now 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.670
 because you would have to move the car sovereign 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:28.280
 with you also at the interdental spaces 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:30.660
 quasi comes but just said that 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.910
 are working we see foot with 1 1 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.120
 the rubber gloves on fall's 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.760
 cheap to buy at amazon just around it 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.500
 aldi or else where it is relatively important 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.050
 if you clean up in chemistry with time 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.490
 you do not necessarily work and should not 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.730
 also neglect safety goggles 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.210
 Should one actually share in theirs? 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:57.810
 some uses good if you pay attention 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:58.350
 that works already quite a lot 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.500
 opposite 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.670
 So it's a bit too 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.360
 I want to sensitize you with it 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.360
 who is paying attention 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.150
 and that should actually already 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.020
 Sufficient, I have a short car 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.610
 get out money 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.150
 you put on a break and right away 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.530
 you continue on the financial statements continued 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.950
 let's keep it thrown in again 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.950
 the left hand 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:52.180
 original clean cumshot and if you 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:55.800
 arriving now the result is 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:59.770
 just brilliant because we have here 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.300
 really nothing left to dirt ok behind 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.430
 I have to admit that often 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.710
 a little bit okay a little bit okay 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.029
 stain that's ok because I stop there 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.430
 the brush'm not so good got there 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:10.990
 but you can see and the fans 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.259
 really ideal even here in the 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.689
 between the screws and 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:18.430
 holes we have no dirt 

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:19.810
 left okay here a bit there 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.639
 you would have to readjust again 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.529
 okay it is not the problem either 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:26.229
 wherein the pre-cleaning a bit 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:29.889
 better take care that they are 

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:31.689
 looks better and accordingly the 

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:34.900
 pictures climate really a brilliant part 

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:37.389
 I can only recommend you so clean 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.800
 you really have a rim and so 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:40.990
 for the material and also the paint 

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.889
 yes, it's on such a race 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.819
 painted aluminum really and already 

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.199
 This really only shows you 

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:48.460
 recommend and grabs you below 

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:51.180
 of the video in the infobox 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.180
 so
