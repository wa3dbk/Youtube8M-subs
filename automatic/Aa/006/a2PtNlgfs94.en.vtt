that has four years of track record

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.370 
that has four years of track record
their<00:02:17.210> refined<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:17.750> don't<00:02:17.900> want<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.110> be<00:02:18.200> there

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
their refined you don't want to be there

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.010 
their refined you don't want to be there
so<00:02:18.790> what<00:02:19.790> hammer<00:02:19.970> went<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.540> said<00:02:20.690> we're<00:02:20.870> going

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
so what hammer went and said we're going

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.630 
so what hammer went and said we're going
to<00:02:21.140> be<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> pvp<00:02:21.770> based<00:02:22.670> MMORPG<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:25.310> tried

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
to be a pvp based MMORPG and they tried

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.210 
to be a pvp based MMORPG and they tried
and<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.240> think<00:02:26.510> they<00:02:26.690> succeeded<00:02:27.290> mostly<00:02:28.010> in

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
and I think they succeeded mostly in

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.650 
and I think they succeeded mostly in
doing<00:02:28.760> things<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.090> then<00:02:29.209> they<00:02:29.330> kind<00:02:29.570> of

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
doing things and then they kind of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.220 
doing things and then they kind of
squandered<00:02:30.230> away<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.440> little<00:02:30.650> bit<00:02:31.030> their<00:02:32.230> users

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
squandered away a little bit their users

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.040 
squandered away a little bit their users
goodwill<00:02:34.040> what<00:02:34.400> isn't<00:02:34.640> there<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.209> this<00:02:35.600> you

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
goodwill what isn't there is this you

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.260 
goodwill what isn't there is this you
know<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.470> cash<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.430> casual<00:02:37.880> feeling

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
know is the cash is the casual feeling

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.940 
know is the cash is the casual feeling
that<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.200> world<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.500> warcraft<00:02:39.680> has

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
that that world of warcraft has

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.650 
that that world of warcraft has
developed<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.430> i<00:02:40.459> think<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.180> good<00:02:41.420> thing

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
developed and i think it's a good thing

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.390 
developed and i think it's a good thing
that<00:02:41.720> there<00:02:42.020> is<00:02:42.080> no<00:02:42.230> casual<00:02:42.680> feeling<00:02:43.070> i<00:02:43.160> think

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
that there is no casual feeling i think

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.980 
that there is no casual feeling i think
it's<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.940> really<00:02:44.060> good<00:02:44.180> thing<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.780> kind

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
it's a really good thing that you kind

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.050 
it's a really good thing that you kind
of<00:02:45.050> always<00:02:45.530> feel<00:02:45.980> like<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.580> have<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.790> do
