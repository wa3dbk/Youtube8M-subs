00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
so that this is now on the bottom and

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.360 
so that this is now on the bottom and
crimp<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.250> way<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:55.650> you're<00:02:55.770> giving<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
crimp it this way so you're giving the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.370 
crimp it this way so you're giving the
look<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.060> three<00:02:57.390> barrel<00:02:57.570> but<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:58.020> just<00:02:58.200> I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
look of a three barrel but it just I

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.199 
look of a three barrel but it just I
think<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:58.860> looks<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.220> lot<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.459> softer<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.090> a

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
think this looks a lot of softer it's a

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.020 
think this looks a lot of softer it's a
lot<00:03:00.360> bigger<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.290> barrel<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.130> just<00:03:02.340> it

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
lot bigger of a barrel so it just it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.229 
lot bigger of a barrel so it just it
looks<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.510> soft<00:03:04.220> soft<00:03:05.220> wave<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.940> really

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
looks like a soft soft wave I really

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.550 
looks like a soft soft wave I really
think<00:03:06.540> it's<00:03:06.660> pretty<00:03:06.780> then<00:03:07.020> turn<00:03:07.230> your<00:03:07.380> ride

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
think it's pretty then turn your ride

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.490 
think it's pretty then turn your ride
around<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.250> do<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.880> other<00:03:08.910> way<00:03:09.090> and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
around and do it the other way and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.990 
around and do it the other way and
connect<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.620> right<00:03:10.650> where<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.400> ended<00:03:11.820> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
connect it right where you ended the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.570 
connect it right where you ended the
last<00:03:12.209> one<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:13.350> kind<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.709> cinch<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.220> up<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:14.520> I

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
last one and I kind of cinch it up so I

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.160 
last one and I kind of cinch it up so I
can<00:03:14.790> see<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.480> actually<00:03:15.600> giving<00:03:16.050> like

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
can see that it's actually giving like

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.220 
can see that it's actually giving like
the<00:03:16.320> S<00:03:16.500> type<00:03:17.190> of<00:03:17.400> effect<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.750> make<00:03:19.020> sure

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.570 
and Klaus and I have a lot of hair so I
had<00:03:53.370> a<00:03:53.400> lot<00:03:53.520> of<00:03:53.580> stuff<00:03:53.850> up<00:03:54.060> there<00:03:54.090> hold<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.690> up

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
had a lot of stuff up there hold it up

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.050 
had a lot of stuff up there hold it up
okay<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.850> then<00:03:56.940> just<00:03:57.120> take<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.390> down<00:03:57.720> and

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
okay and then just take it down and

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.930 
okay and then just take it down and
spray<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.569> repeat<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.470> same<00:04:01.709> process<00:04:02.010> so

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
spray and repeat the same process so

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.210 
spray and repeat the same process so
let's<00:04:03.360> start<00:04:03.569> again<00:04:03.660> take<00:04:04.230> this<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.190> just

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
let's start again take this and just

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.740 
let's start again take this and just
take<00:04:05.580> up<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.000> root<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.660> your<00:04:06.720> hair<00:04:08.750> just

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
take up to the root of your hair just

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.470 
take up to the root of your hair just
all<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.110> way<00:04:10.140> up<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.500> top<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:12.150> just<00:04:12.330> let

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
all the way up to the top and just let

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.380 
all the way up to the top and just let
that<00:04:12.630> sit<00:04:12.870> for<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.140> few<00:04:13.320> seconds<00:04:16.579> around<00:04:17.579> the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
that sit for a few seconds around the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.610 
that sit for a few seconds around the
other<00:04:18.630> side<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:20.540> the<00:04:21.540> little<00:04:21.810> loop<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.500> want

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
other side and the little loop you want

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.930 
other side and the little loop you want
to<00:04:22.740> do<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.950> other<00:04:23.100> side<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.580> you<00:04:23.640> did<00:04:23.850> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
to do the other side and you did the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:31.700 
to do the other side and you did the
opposite<00:04:24.330> way<00:04:29.810> well<00:04:30.810> don't<00:04:30.930> come<00:04:31.200> through<00:04:31.560> it

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
opposite way well don't come through it

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.710 
opposite way well don't come through it
until<00:04:31.830> you're<00:04:32.160> completely<00:04:32.310> done<00:04:32.790> okay<00:04:33.540> and

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
until you're completely done okay and

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.030 
until you're completely done okay and
then<00:04:33.810> when<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:33.990> come<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.350> back<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.770> take

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
then when I come to the back I take

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.370 
then when I come to the back I take
another<00:04:35.340> section<00:04:35.729> like<00:04:36.030> this<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:37.229> it's

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
another section like this and it's

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.060 
another section like this and it's
actually<00:04:37.860> I<00:04:38.160> do<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:39.120> first<00:04:39.390> few<00:04:40.200> cuddles<00:04:40.710> so<00:04:40.979> I

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
actually I do the first few cuddles so I

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.760 
actually I do the first few cuddles so I
I<00:04:41.280> spray<00:04:41.729> it<00:04:41.760> always<00:04:42.330> spraying<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.080> then

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
I spray it always spraying and then

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.170 
I spray it always spraying and then
we'll<00:04:43.890> do<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.100> first<00:04:44.370> few<00:04:44.550> curls<00:04:44.850> at<00:04:45.060> the

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
we'll do the first few curls at the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.230 
we'll do the first few curls at the
roots<00:04:45.360> just<00:04:45.660> like<00:04:45.810> this<00:04:46.290> from<00:04:46.650> behind<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:48.030> do

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
roots just like this from behind you do

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.040 
roots just like this from behind you do
the<00:04:49.110> first<00:04:49.350> one<00:04:49.620> like<00:04:49.800> so<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.870> then<00:04:51.870> the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
the first one like so and then the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.680 
the first one like so and then the
second<00:04:52.470> one<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:55.910> then<00:04:56.910> I'll<00:04:57.090> come<00:04:57.390> to<00:04:57.419> this

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
second one and then I'll come to this

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.560 
second one and then I'll come to this
side<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:58.200> I'll<00:04:58.350> finish<00:04:58.590> it<00:04:59.150> it's<00:05:00.150> not<00:05:00.360> gonna

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
side and I'll finish it it's not gonna

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.510 
side and I'll finish it it's not gonna
be<00:05:00.780> perfect<00:05:00.990> but<00:05:01.500> it's<00:05:01.650> really<00:05:01.919> hard<00:05:02.280> if

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
be perfect but it's really hard if

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.100 
be perfect but it's really hard if
you're<00:05:02.669> going<00:05:02.820> like<00:05:03.000> we're<00:05:03.300> all<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.780> way<00:05:03.990> out

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
you're going like we're all the way out

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.170 
you're going like we're all the way out
so<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.500> just<00:05:04.710> turn<00:05:04.890> up<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.250> go<00:05:05.340> like<00:05:05.460> this

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.469 

got<00:05:09.719> most<00:05:09.930> of<00:05:10.139> it<00:05:10.289> done<00:05:10.349> I'm<00:05:11.219> at<00:05:11.610> my<00:05:11.789> Vain's<00:05:12.119> now

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
got most of it done I'm at my Vain's now

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.969 
got most of it done I'm at my Vain's now
and<00:05:12.749> I<00:05:12.809> just<00:05:12.839> wanted<00:05:13.229> to<00:05:13.349> show<00:05:13.499> you<00:05:13.529> what<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:13.860> do

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
and I just wanted to show you what I do

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.439 
and I just wanted to show you what I do
with<00:05:14.099> my<00:05:14.249> beings<00:05:14.550> I've<00:05:14.729> done<00:05:14.939> in<00:05:15.059> a<00:05:15.180> couple

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
with my beings I've done in a couple

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.089 
with my beings I've done in a couple
times<00:05:15.629> where<00:05:15.869> it<00:05:15.990> curled<00:05:16.409> the<00:05:16.589> whole<00:05:16.830> thing

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
times where it curled the whole thing

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.089 
times where it curled the whole thing
but<00:05:17.909> it<00:05:18.059> looks<00:05:18.330> weird<00:05:18.629> to<00:05:19.050> me<00:05:19.199> and<00:05:19.469> this<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:19.830> for

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
but it looks weird to me and this is for

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.379 
but it looks weird to me and this is for
those<00:05:20.189> of<00:05:20.309> you<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.550> have<00:05:20.729> things<00:05:21.029> if<00:05:21.270> you

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
those of you that have things if you

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.820 
those of you that have things if you
don't<00:05:21.569> have<00:05:21.749> bangs<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.139> can<00:05:22.169> skip<00:05:22.499> over<00:05:22.649> this

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
don't have bangs you can skip over this

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.549 
don't have bangs you can skip over this
part<00:05:22.889> but<00:05:23.399> um<00:05:23.610> so<00:05:24.479> what<00:05:24.659> I<00:05:24.689> do<00:05:24.839> instead<00:05:25.319> of

00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:25.559 
part but um so what I do instead of

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:27.200 
part but um so what I do instead of
crimping<00:05:26.069> the<00:05:26.129> entire<00:05:26.669> Bank

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
crimping the entire Bank

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.329 
crimping the entire Bank
I'll<00:05:27.330> just<00:05:27.509> take<00:05:27.689> like<00:05:27.869> one<00:05:28.289> piece<00:05:28.889> of<00:05:29.189> my

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:29.339 
I'll just take like one piece of my

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.339 
I'll just take like one piece of my
bangs<00:05:29.550> like<00:05:29.819> a<00:05:29.879> small<00:05:30.330> piece<00:05:30.809> that<00:05:31.080> drapes

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
bangs like a small piece that drapes

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.570 
bangs like a small piece that drapes
over<00:05:31.559> the<00:05:31.770> bangs<00:05:32.270> and<00:05:33.270> I'll<00:05:33.419> just<00:05:33.689> crimp<00:05:34.289> that

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
over the bangs and I'll just crimp that

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.339 
over the bangs and I'll just crimp that
say<00:05:35.580> just<00:05:35.789> crimp<00:05:36.210> it<00:05:36.389> how<00:05:36.719> I've<00:05:36.899> been<00:05:37.020> doing<00:05:37.229> my

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
say just crimp it how I've been doing my

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:42.079 
say just crimp it how I've been doing my
whole<00:05:37.529> head<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:40.550> that<00:05:41.550> way<00:05:41.669> it<00:05:41.729> gives<00:05:41.879> the

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:42.089 
whole head and that way it gives the

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.059 
whole head and that way it gives the
current<00:05:42.300> texture<00:05:42.809> in<00:05:43.080> my<00:05:43.110> bangs<00:05:43.469> but<00:05:43.740> I'm<00:05:43.889> not

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
current texture in my bangs but I'm not

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.639 
current texture in my bangs but I'm not
doing<00:05:44.339> the<00:05:44.430> whole<00:05:44.729> thing<00:05:45.020> see<00:05:46.020> so<00:05:46.349> it<00:05:46.469> just

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:46.649 
doing the whole thing see so it just

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.230 
doing the whole thing see so it just
kind<00:05:46.830> of<00:05:46.889> goes<00:05:47.039> across<00:05:47.309> things<00:05:47.759> without<00:05:47.969> me<00:05:48.180> I

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
kind of goes across things without me I

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.639 
kind of goes across things without me I
can<00:05:48.389> keep<00:05:48.509> some<00:05:48.749> of<00:05:48.779> them<00:05:48.990> straight<00:05:49.289> and<00:05:49.319> it

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:49.649 
can keep some of them straight and it

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:52.459 
can keep some of them straight and it
still<00:05:49.919> just<00:05:50.129> it<00:05:50.669> doesn't<00:05:50.939> make<00:05:51.689> my<00:05:51.960> hair<00:05:51.990> look

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:52.469 
still just it doesn't make my hair look
