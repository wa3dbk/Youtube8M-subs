00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.990
 first there is let's say he takes advantage of what 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.390
 we call mods air berna football ex is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.310
 fundamentally use many 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.270
 things that work very well for eleven 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.740
 against eleven but in spending a lot of time 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.779
 studying analyzing what opportunity 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.699
 we have that are specific to this type 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.309
 first main game 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.809
 obviously fly nit which connects 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.550
 let's say simple with the leg of a 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.550
 Unique way that eliminates distractions 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.600
 the product the way it is 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.760
 built does not have no language or 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.160
 tongue which also eliminates 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.200
 distractions if it brings you closer to the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.330
 Ball gives you a better feeling 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.670
 one of the most important things 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.590
 is the fly wire that are the cables that 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.810
 they run through say the 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.250
 capellada to this case super important 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.560
 for this type of game that this player 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.080
 why is it proven in 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.960
 our studies that there are twice as many 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.520
 accelerations and decelerations the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.000
 flight wire what it does is simply 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.890
 keep you super adjusted and focused on 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 the boot so you do not feel that you're 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 let's say losing stability 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.890
 some of the specific things let's say 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.590
 of the product is the theme of love you 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.420
 foundation in this case we have one between 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 sole that is the material we call 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.000
 bailón that what gives you is more security 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.360
 more protection when you step on and change 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.470
 of direction in that in that movement 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.370
 approximately four or five times the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.080
 your body's weight is let's say exercised 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.060
 in this area of ​​the product 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.000
 this is important to stay protected 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.890
 is between sole runs both the heel 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.530
 as to the front of the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.479
 product anyway in the part 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.850
 front what we wanted is despite 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.650
 that there are protections keep the minimum 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.910
 protection so you can at the same 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.910
 time to feel the ball 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.520
 it is important to maintain the integrity of 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.550
 product in this case we have an X 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.890
 large that is a recycled material of 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.660
 old rubber shoes that are 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.850
 recycle and create this product in this 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.190
 What it does is protect the chapel 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.930
 to the front of the boot so that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.120
 do not have holes in your body when you 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.490
 you are dragging your foot we have also 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.850
 added a seam which ensures more 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.850
 durability 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.310
 another great novelty that we have is a 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.840
 second color option in this case what 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.840
 we call the street color that 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.760
 simply give the consumer an option 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.680
 that you need a product that is not 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.220
 necessarily the same product that 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.290
 want I do not know against 11 and the reason why 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.970
 which is very simple there are players who are 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.710
 players but do not want to be perceived 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.990
 with players all day who want a 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.360
 product that gives them the versatility of 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.340
 You can go directly from your home to the 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.140
 plaza play soccer to the playing field and 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.600
 there directly to go out with your friends 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.390
 without having to change the boot that is 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.370
 the opportunity that delivers let's say this 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.370
 second color that is the product of home
