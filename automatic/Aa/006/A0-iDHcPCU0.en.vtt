timber - works quite well tis the last
ice<00:00:18.050> or<00:00:19.050> I've<00:00:19.199> put<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.500> onto<00:00:19.650> some<00:00:20.460> sleepest

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
ice or I've put it onto some sleepest

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.300 
ice or I've put it onto some sleepest
and<00:00:21.510> scaffolding<00:00:22.260> poles<00:00:22.650> scaffolding

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and scaffolding poles scaffolding

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.160 
and scaffolding poles scaffolding
pallets<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> raise<00:00:24.510> them<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.869> off<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
pallets just to raise them it off the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.330 
pallets just to raise them it off the
ground<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.680> put<00:00:25.949> these<00:00:26.939> are<00:00:27.119> scaffolding

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
ground and put these are scaffolding

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.410 
ground and put these are scaffolding
things<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.609> lock<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.970> down<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.359> it

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
things that just lock it down so it

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.930 
things that just lock it down so it
stays<00:00:30.630> nice<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:30.929> tight<00:00:31.399> so<00:00:32.399> if<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.610> lift<00:00:32.759> this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
stays nice and tight so if you lift this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:41.180 
stays nice and tight so if you lift this
up<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:39.290> basically<00:00:40.290> all<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.890> fold

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
up and basically all you do is you fold

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.900 
up and basically all you do is you fold
it<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.760> right<00:00:41.969> laterally<00:00:42.500> concertinas<00:00:43.500> up

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
it up right laterally concertinas up

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.220 
it up right laterally concertinas up
like<00:00:44.910> so

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.549 

and<00:00:51.230> he<00:00:51.289> just<00:00:51.469> folds<00:00:51.859> back<00:00:52.039> like<00:00:52.280> that

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
and he just folds back like that

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.810 
and he just folds back like that
don't<00:00:54.559> worry<00:00:54.680> about<00:00:54.860> all<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.010> leaves<00:00:55.219> off<00:00:55.460> pop

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
don't worry about all the leaves off pop

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.150 
don't worry about all the leaves off pop
it<00:00:55.969> into<00:00:56.089> one<00:00:56.239> partly<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.629> car<00:00:56.870> park<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:58.070> I

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
it into one partly the car park but I

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.009 
it into one partly the car park but I
sweep<00:00:58.399> it<00:00:58.550> out<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.850> then<00:00:58.969> basically<00:00:59.539> just<00:00:59.780> pop

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
sweep it out and then basically just pop

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:07.090 
sweep it out and then basically just pop
drive<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:00.940> Boyken<00:01:02.199> and<00:01:03.489> I<00:01:04.489> put<00:01:05.089> that<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:06.100> little

drive you Boyken and I put that a little

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.780 
drive you Boyken and I put that a little
wimp<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:07.640> here<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.990> I'll<00:01:09.320> go<00:01:09.640> parks<00:01:10.640> in

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
wimp just here and I'll go parks in

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.789 
wimp just here and I'll go parks in
there<00:01:11.030> now<00:01:12.020> I've<00:01:12.110> got<00:01:12.290> as<00:01:12.409> those<00:01:12.590> that<00:01:12.680> are

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
it quite easy so it's quite big if I put

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.590 
it quite easy so it's quite big if I put
it<00:01:22.190> back<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.580> see<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.850> construction<00:01:23.090> on<00:01:23.509> the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
it back and see the construction on the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.690 
it back and see the construction on the
inside<00:01:25.630> so<00:01:26.630> it's<00:01:26.899> whole<00:01:27.619> wall<00:01:28.009> down<00:01:28.190> there<00:01:28.250> fix

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
inside so it's whole wall down there fix

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.889 
inside so it's whole wall down there fix
down<00:01:28.970> there<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:31.190> they<00:01:31.310> just<00:01:31.780> concertina<00:01:32.780> up

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
down there and they just concertina up

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.180 
down there and they just concertina up
you've<00:01:33.080> got<00:01:33.110> one<00:01:33.319> pole<00:01:33.590> that<00:01:33.740> goes<00:01:33.979> up

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
you've got one pole that goes up

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.219 
you've got one pole that goes up
lighting<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.729> there's<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.509> real<00:01:35.690> shrimp<00:01:35.960> for<00:01:36.170> it

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
lighting it there's a real shrimp for it

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.859 
lighting it there's a real shrimp for it
those<00:01:36.440> jumps<00:01:36.890> in<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.100> one<00:01:37.280> pole<00:01:37.569> and<00:01:38.569> it<00:01:38.690> just

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
those jumps in that one pole and it just

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.800 
those jumps in that one pole and it just
folds<00:01:39.080> over<00:01:39.319> like<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:39.979> as<00:01:40.729> you<00:01:40.850> see<00:01:41.060> ruin

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
folds over like that and as you see ruin

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.800 
folds over like that and as you see ruin
it

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
it

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.389 
it
anything<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:44.869> could<00:01:45.050> knock<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.229> for<00:01:45.560> is<00:01:45.800> if<00:01:46.280> I

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
anything I could knock it for is if I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.050 
anything I could knock it for is if I
put<00:01:46.640> these<00:01:46.759> bits<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.149> string<00:01:47.330> up<00:01:48.909> because<00:01:49.909> it

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
put these bits of string up because it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.880 
put these bits of string up because it
sags<00:01:50.390> in<00:01:50.539> middle<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:50.899> water<00:01:51.140> sit<00:01:51.409> says<00:01:51.619> I<00:01:51.770> put

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
sags in middle and water sit says I put

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.010 
sags in middle and water sit says I put
that<00:01:52.039> string<00:01:52.399> up<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:52.850> holds<00:01:52.970> it<00:01:53.209> up<00:01:53.300> got

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
that string up and it holds it up got

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.660 
that string up and it holds it up got
the<00:01:54.050> little<00:01:54.229> air<00:01:54.410> vents<00:01:55.750> let<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.869> in<00:01:57.310> there<00:01:58.310> we

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
the little air vents let you in there we

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.670 
the little air vents let you in there we
so<00:01:59.209> you<00:01:59.599> know<00:01:59.690> get<00:01:59.840> to<00:02:00.050> dam

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.680 

doesn't<00:02:03.520> actually<00:02:03.610> get<00:02:03.820> damp<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:04.270> here<00:02:04.300> but<00:02:04.600> it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
doesn't actually get damp in here but it

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.609 
doesn't actually get damp in here but it
works<00:02:04.960> quite<00:02:05.080> well<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.840> that's<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.110> joy<00:02:08.320> top

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
works quite well so that's the joy top

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.500 
works quite well so that's the joy top
white<00:02:09.039> cover<00:02:11.430> once<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.580> put<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.120> little<00:02:13.330> lock
