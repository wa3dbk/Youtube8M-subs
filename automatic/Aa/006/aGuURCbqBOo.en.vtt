same<00:00:29.369> place<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.880> got<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.210> get<00:00:30.359> new<00:00:30.480> crank

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
same place you got to get new crank

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.000 
same place you got to get new crank
shafts<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:32.900> these<00:00:33.900> things<00:00:34.199> I've<00:00:34.710> checked

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
shafts and these things I've checked

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.860 
shafts and these things I've checked
these<00:00:35.220> these<00:00:35.519> might<00:00:35.820> go<00:00:36.030> anywhere<00:00:36.600> from

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
these these might go anywhere from

to help me do I'm never going to have to
touch<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:09.010> with<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.220> hammer<00:03:09.519> most<00:03:10.239> cases<00:03:10.540> but

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
touch this with a hammer most cases but

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.170 
touch this with a hammer most cases but
the<00:03:11.500> skill<00:03:11.739> line<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.100> trying<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.430> go<00:03:12.519> perfect

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
the skill line is trying to go perfect

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:38.310 
the skill line is trying to go perfect
yes<00:03:14.110> all<00:03:14.350> we<00:03:14.440> do<00:03:14.620> it

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.710 

that's<00:03:39.320> it<00:03:42.160> cracks<00:03:43.160> perfectly<00:03:43.760> aligned<00:03:44.060> we'll

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
that's it cracks perfectly aligned we'll

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.660 
that's it cracks perfectly aligned we'll
check<00:03:44.930> it<00:03:45.050> on<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.170> backside<00:03:48.160> okay<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:49.400> we<00:03:49.520> got

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
check it on the backside okay so we got

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.790 
check it on the backside okay so we got
our<00:03:49.790> crank<00:03:50.090> all<00:03:50.270> pressed<00:03:50.630> back<00:03:50.840> together<00:03:51.110> and

you<00:04:14.720> rebuild<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.170> crankshaft<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:16.580> can't

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
you rebuild the crankshaft you can't

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.900 
you rebuild the crankshaft you can't
just<00:04:17.030> do<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.239> with<00:04:17.390> bad<00:04:17.540> status<00:04:18.110> because<00:04:18.910> you

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
just do it with bad status because you

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.310 
just do it with bad status because you
never<00:04:20.030> know<00:04:20.299> what<00:04:20.450> you're<00:04:20.600> getting<00:04:20.900> here<00:04:20.930> I

never know what you're getting here I
don't<00:04:21.860> know<00:04:21.920> how<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.130> disassembled<00:04:23.000> your

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
don't know how you disassembled your

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.270 
don't know how you disassembled your
engine<00:04:23.510> if<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.750> get<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:23.930> crankshaft<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:24.830> most

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
engine if I get a crankshaft and most

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.180 
engine if I get a crankshaft and most
here<00:04:25.810> unfortunately<00:04:26.810> I'm<00:04:27.440> going<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.680> pound<00:04:27.920> on

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
here unfortunately I'm going to pound on

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.850

stuff so what that's going to do is take

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.670 
stuff so what that's going to do is take
that<00:04:30.890> Center<00:04:31.430> holes<00:04:31.670> on<00:04:32.090> each<00:04:32.360> side<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:33.410> it's

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
that Center holes on each side and it's

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.680 
that Center holes on each side and it's
going<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:33.890> put<00:04:34.040> little<00:04:34.280> birds<00:04:34.490> in<00:04:34.730> them<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.660> I

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
going to put little birds in them so I

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.570 
going to put little birds in them so I
came<00:04:35.840> up<00:04:36.020> with<00:04:36.290> another<00:04:36.410> scheme<00:04:36.860> testis<00:04:37.550> and

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
came up with another scheme testis and

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.470 
came up with another scheme testis and
I'll<00:04:37.820> show<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.030> how<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.330> do<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:40.270> okay<00:04:41.270> this

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480

bearing surfaces into the V blocks and I

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.870 
bearing surfaces into the V blocks and I
put<00:04:57.200> a<00:04:57.230> couple<00:04:57.260> indicators<00:04:58.070> on<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.370> as<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.550> roll

us over you look at the right indicator

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.550 
us over you look at the right indicator
it's<00:05:01.760> not<00:05:01.910> even<00:05:02.180> moving<00:05:02.360> you<00:05:03.200> look<00:05:03.350> at<00:05:03.440> the

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
it's not even moving you look at the

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.700 
it's not even moving you look at the
last<00:05:04.180> that's<00:05:05.180> just<00:05:05.540> it's<00:05:06.230> doing<00:05:06.530> a<00:05:06.590> little

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
last that's just it's doing a little

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.380 
last that's just it's doing a little
blip<00:05:07.160> every<00:05:07.490> now<00:05:07.640> and<00:05:07.850> then<00:05:07.970> I'm<00:05:08.180> going<00:05:08.300> to

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
blip every now and then I'm going to

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.240 
blip every now and then I'm going to
tribute<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:08.900> to<00:05:09.140> burrs<00:05:09.410> on<00:05:09.770> the<00:05:09.860> bearing

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
tribute that to burrs on the bearing

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.980 
tribute that to burrs on the bearing
surface<00:05:10.700> and<00:05:10.880> I<00:05:10.910> can<00:05:11.090> actually<00:05:11.300> see<00:05:11.690> him<00:05:11.810> as<00:05:11.960> a

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
surface and I can actually see him as a

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.290 
surface and I can actually see him as a
roll<00:05:12.260> this<00:05:12.380> thing<00:05:12.590> by<00:05:12.830> it<00:05:12.890> so<00:05:13.640> this<00:05:13.790> crank<00:05:14.120> is

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
roll this thing by it so this crank is

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.350 
roll this thing by it so this crank is
perfectly<00:05:15.020> dialed<00:05:15.320> in<00:05:15.940> that's<00:05:16.940> how<00:05:17.090> we<00:05:17.210> do<00:05:17.330> it

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
perfectly dialed in that's how we do it

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.910 
perfectly dialed in that's how we do it

here at count O'Conner racing I think

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.320 
here at count O'Conner racing I think
it's<00:05:19.010> the<00:05:19.100> right<00:05:19.310> way<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.490> do<00:05:19.760> it<00:05:19.940> if<00:05:20.090> I<00:05:20.180> can

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
it's the right way to do it if I can

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.060
