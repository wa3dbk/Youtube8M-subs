00:00:06.317 --> 00:00:08.567
The Princess Farmer

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:11.983
A Bhili folktale

00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:13.567
Kansari was the daughter

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:16.983
of a powerful king.

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:19.317
Although she was a princess,

00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:22.067
she had always wanted to be a farmer

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:24.900
when she was a child.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.483
This made her father angry,

00:00:27.483 --> 00:00:29.150
and when she grew up,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.233
her father ordered her

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:33.483
to leave the palace.

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:35.317
"I want you to experience

00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:39.817
how difficult life is outside this palace.

00:00:39.817 --> 00:00:43.150
Only then will you come to your senses,"

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.150
he said angrily.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.150
So Kansari packed the seeds

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.567
that she had collected

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:52.650
throughout her childhood,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.233
and went to live in the woods.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.233
She built a little hut

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.567
and began planting seeds

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:12.567
in the nearby field.

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:14.900
It was hard work,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.400
butKansari had help

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.983
from her three new friends:

00:01:20.983 --> 00:01:27.567
a cat, a parrot and a spider.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:32.483
The cat hunted rats in the field.

00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:35.817
The spider took care of the hut.

00:01:35.817 --> 00:01:39.233
The parrot flew around the kingdom

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:42.900
and brought back the latest news.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.567
They all became good friends

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:49.233
and lived together happily.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.900
It wasn't long before

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.483
everyone in the kingdom

00:01:53.483 --> 00:01:58.900
was talking about Kansari's lush farm.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.150
This made the king furious

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.233
and he went to Indra,

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:07.233
the king of the gods.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:15.483
The king requested Indra to help him,

00:02:15.483 --> 00:02:20.233
as he wanted to teach his daughter a lesson.

00:02:22.483 --> 00:02:24.150
"Leave it to me.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.733
I'll send down a drought.

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:27.900
All the crops 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.817
will dry up and die,"

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.317
saidIndra.

00:02:34.317 --> 00:02:36.150
The parrot heard this 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.233
and quickly recounted it to Kansari.

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:43.900
Kansari and her friends

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.317
then moved their crops

00:02:46.317 --> 00:02:50.233
to a damp riverbed.

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:53.817
When the drought took place,

00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:54.733
all the crops

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:56.817
in the kingdom dried up,

00:02:56.817 --> 00:03:01.817
butKansari's crops survived.

00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:06.400
Indra saw this and scratched his head.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.817
"I'll send down a flood.

00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:13.150
That should stop Kansari," he said.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.650
But again, 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.733
the parrot overheard Indra.

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:20.233
This time, Kansari,

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:22.233
along with her friends,

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:24.067
planted their crops 

00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:28.733
on the slope of a hill.

00:03:28.733 --> 00:03:31.900
When the flood came, it drowned

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.817
all the crops in the kingdom.

00:03:34.817 --> 00:03:36.150
Kansari's crops

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.317
were the only ones that survived,

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:39.650
because the excess water

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.900
simply flowed downhill.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.067
“I'll send hundreds of rats!”

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:49.483
Indra decided.

00:03:49.483 --> 00:03:51.650
But the parrot told the cat 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.483
of Indra's plan.

00:03:54.483 --> 00:03:55.650
“Wonderful!

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.150
I'll call my cat friends for a feast!”

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.817
purred the cat.

00:04:03.817 --> 00:04:06.067
Soon the cats had eaten

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:11.233
every single rat in the field.

00:04:13.317 --> 00:04:18.400
By now, Indra was at his wit's end.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.650
"I'll send birds!

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.400
She can't save her crops 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.900
from birds!"

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.483
he said.

00:04:25.483 --> 00:04:30.567
But the spider called her spider friends

00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:32.983
and they wove sticky webs 

00:04:32.983 --> 00:04:37.233
above the crops.

00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:43.567
When the birds attacked the crops

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:46.817
they were stuck in the sticky web.

00:04:46.817 --> 00:04:49.900
The crops were saved once again.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.650
By now the king had bigger problems.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.067
The drought and flood had destroyed

00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:57.400
all the crops in the kingdom.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.150
People were starving.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.900
The king went to Indra for help.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.733
"You don't need my help.

00:05:03.733 --> 00:05:05.400
Your daughter Kansari

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.233
 is already feeding 

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:08.067
your people!" 

00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:10.067
said Indra.

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:14.233
He took the king to the woods.

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:17.483
There he saw Kansari and her friends

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:23.067
giving away sacks of grain to everyone.

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:25.900
The king felt ashamed of himself

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.150
and proud of his daughter.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.233
"There are nobler things

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:35.650
than just living in a palace.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.067
Don't you agree?" asked Indra.

00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:40.567
The king

00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:43.650
begged his daughter for forgiveness

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.150
and requested her to come back to the palace.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.150
She forgave her father

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.567
but did not return to the palace;

00:05:51.567 --> 00:05:55.067
she stayed in her hut beside her fields,

00:05:55.067 --> 00:06:00.233
living happily with her friends.

00:06:01.983 --> 00:06:04.233
Kansari later became known as

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:07.817
the Princess Farmer.
