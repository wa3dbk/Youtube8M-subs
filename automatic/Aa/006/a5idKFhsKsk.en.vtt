easier<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.329> change<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.870> constitution<00:00:34.170> than

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
easier to change the constitution than

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.170 
easier to change the constitution than
it<00:00:34.829> would<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.160> change<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.790> word<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
it would be to change the word of the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.150 
it would be to change the word of the
Living<00:00:36.300> God<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.770> need<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> do

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
Living God and that's what we need to do

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.250 
Living God and that's what we need to do
is<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.460> amend<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> Constitution<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.050> in
