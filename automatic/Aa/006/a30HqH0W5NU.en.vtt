 he to learn 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.930
 it already comes with several pre encodings 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.280
 the sound equipment of the panel and 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.710
 several that will give their all 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.680

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.840
 how do you identify how then guys? 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.899
 show you now how's the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.759
 installation as it has glue 3m to 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.409
 people reap the golandim people got this 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.450
 a little more sports car with the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.649
 more sports steering wheel has a galley 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.689
 who likes the inscriptions do something that 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.850
 will stay cool is this which 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.719
 3m we will have to take is here to 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.489
 people are going to paste 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.120
 then as I told you guys it 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.590
 It was a 3m ribbon. 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:17.959
 We're going to have to highlight her. Let's go. 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.810
 there she is, we highlight fruity 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.540
 3m ribbon and we will center right 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.799
 cool we see here media position 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.810
 More or less how is it to stand by 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.250
 example to me I put this control 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.079
 here is good for me to change, I'm going 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.670
 put in that position here I go 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.140
 put well centralized and then she 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.030
 It's 30 out now 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.430
 just remembering that even with a tape of 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.470
 high resistance good hit from home 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.870
 because if you take it you can stay in a place 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.670
 so good or not there that we will centralize 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:50.450
 he centralized with law the way I 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.129
 wanted to paste it supports a little power 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.640
 from here to stand 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:59.750
 I've been taking this tyranny and 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.129
 being that also of putting do not speak 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.989
 in a detail to you as I told you 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.090
 this tape could be folded to be 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.010
 Adapted on various types of steering wheel 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.599
 here we will need to double then 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.340
 people come down, right? 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.099
 I made a zinho marking before 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.420
 begin here in which how the body 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.919
 would be to bend not to look like 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.049
 here behind soon they are the steering wheel 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.799
 because I'm going to stick this base in the 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.660
 behind 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.760
 so I came by sticking continue rolling 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.160
 here I had also made a mark 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.819
 I had made a mark before I came 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.370
 sun than I'm going to stick here on 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.870
 Marquinhos had done let's go there only 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.870
 here and let's paste and now 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.220
 so here are marquinhos that had done 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.560
 with law they continue to release and come back 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.410
 everybody's already tape 30 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.569

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.000
 the lake on the bench is the position behind the 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.889
 steering wheel or even getting a way 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.020

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.320
 like I said at the beginning of the video to 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.169
 you this product he is pre-qualified 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.060

 and several others and for those others 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.320
 that does not come the dfi cadu he already owns 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.060
 order to have any control or 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.560
 any of any sound equipment 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.510
 that has the remote control 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.139
 It gives the option to be triggered learn 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.360
 qualifying the panel question or 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.650
 in the configuration issue, that 's where the 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.990
 using a device from the page as what 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.580
 works to encode we have to 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.220
 press the power button 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.039
 the pause button and the minus button to the 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.510
 same time we hold three seconds 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.690
 pressed it can hold three 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.440
 seconds at the base in behind he goes fishing 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.849
 a led 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.110
 here we will not see much 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.229
 very light but he will get a doctor 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.060
 so it flashes oled after 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.460
 people have to feel that push the button 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.280
 which symbolizes the modification for example 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.480
 investigate the three tight it goes 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.310
 stay 1 leg 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.230
 so they khaled option to put the 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.330
 qualification of the panel is the little button 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.620
 but as soon as the portal over it goes 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.250
 be qualified with the apparatus of the 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.660
 page 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.380

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.670
 hold for three seconds 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.530

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.750
 flashing luizinho and roberto buddy 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.820

 Dad already understands that toad getting 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.410
