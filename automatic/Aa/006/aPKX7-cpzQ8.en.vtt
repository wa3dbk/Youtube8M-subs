 cleaning 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.650
 if we go a little further with 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.049

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.350

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.280
 a reference to his armor after all 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.939
 there are armors that are made of 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.520

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.920
 to make two epic sleeves but the bar 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.920

 nobody knows who he or she is 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.899

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.310
 everyone knows that both the beginning of the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.349
 movies and animations videos 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.590
 no colors were all black and 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.150
 whites and the animes were not different 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.170
 to whose good it was the first animal in 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.630
 colors being released in 1956 but not 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.820
 did not even breast 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.980
 the first color animation of our 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.870
 dear millionaire rat was responsible 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.230
 for the first color animation 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.330
 flowers andré luís was released in 1932 and 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.530
 to win the title of the first animation in 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.780
 colors of the world 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.780
 It really was an incredible leap to 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.580
 time you get the idea of how many obama 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.010
 are needed to produce a single 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.170
 episode of food only saga of hades 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.990
 knights of the zodiac that had a 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.320
 budget considered under its 13 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.260
 episodes cost the trifle of 712 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.860
 million yen which is equivalent to 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.290
 more than 6 million obama but that is 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.640
 equivalent to more than 13 million 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.420
 of about four hundred thousand dolphins per 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.490
 episode 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.550
 and you find the average cost of a 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.780
 hollywood movie is over 100 million 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.060
 of dollars is a lot of money in honor
