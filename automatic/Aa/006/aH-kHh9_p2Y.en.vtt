00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
going upwards the clippings are going to

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.320 
going upwards the clippings are going to
be<00:01:35.140> clips<00:01:35.530> in<00:01:35.680> my<00:01:36.070> head<00:01:36.340> in<00:01:36.580> an<00:01:36.729> upward<00:01:37.150> motion

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
be clips in my head in an upward motion

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.450 
be clips in my head in an upward motion
they<00:01:38.110> are<00:01:38.259> not<00:01:38.439> clipped<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:38.860> going<00:01:39.250> down

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
they are not clipped in going down

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.580 
they are not clipped in going down
they're<00:01:39.939> clipped<00:01:40.210> in<00:01:40.390> going<00:01:40.689> up<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.170> the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
they're clipped in going up and the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.410 
they're clipped in going up and the
reason<00:01:42.070> why<00:01:42.220> I'm<00:01:42.369> doing<00:01:42.430> that<00:01:42.909> is<00:01:43.119> because

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
reason why I'm doing that is because

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.300 
reason why I'm doing that is because
it's<00:01:43.720> going<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.020> create<00:01:44.290> incredible<00:01:45.100> volume

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
it's going to create incredible volume

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.910 
it's going to create incredible volume
it's<00:01:45.759> also<00:01:46.150> going<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.540> naturally<00:01:46.869> shorten<00:01:47.560> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
it's also going to naturally shorten the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.670 
it's also going to naturally shorten the
clip<00:01:48.070> ins<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:49.020> you'll<00:01:50.020> just<00:01:50.200> see<00:01:50.350> it<00:01:50.470> works

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
clip ins and you'll just see it works

00:01:50.680 --> 00:02:03.910 
clip ins and you'll just see it works
out

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.830 

now<00:02:04.920> when<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> halfway<00:02:05.909> point<00:02:06.119> it's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
now when I get to the halfway point it's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.690 
now when I get to the halfway point it's
time<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.259> me<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.380> start<00:02:07.710> putting<00:02:08.130> my<00:02:08.250> clip-ins

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
time for me to start putting my clip-ins

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:23.420 
time for me to start putting my clip-ins
in<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.090> circular<00:02:09.450> pattern<00:02:22.160> once<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.280> get

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
in a circular pattern once I get

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.699 
in a circular pattern once I get
everything<00:02:23.700> parted<00:02:24.180> out<00:02:24.330> in<00:02:24.620> pretty<00:02:25.620> much

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
everything parted out in pretty much

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.740 
everything parted out in pretty much
even<00:02:26.250> all<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.519> way<00:02:26.549> around<00:02:26.760> I'm<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
circular pattern upside down as I did
