on<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.480> Wii<00:02:35.600> version<00:02:35.840> it's<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.170> lot<00:02:36.350> easier<00:02:36.830> and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
on the Wii version it's a lot easier and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.180 
on the Wii version it's a lot easier and
speaking<00:02:38.840> as<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.960> hardcore<00:02:39.380> Sonic<00:02:39.740> fan<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:39.950> can

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
speaking as a hardcore Sonic fan I can

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.950 
speaking as a hardcore Sonic fan I can
say<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.580> was<00:02:40.670> probably<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.210> best<00:02:41.480> choice<00:02:41.720> to

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
say that was probably the best choice to

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.510 
say that was probably the best choice to
me<00:02:42.260> because<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:42.950> could<00:02:43.100> get<00:02:43.250> really

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
me because it could get really

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.760 
me because it could get really
frustrating<00:02:44.390> there's<00:02:44.750> one<00:02:44.930> little<00:02:45.290> mechanic

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
frustrating there's one little mechanic

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.380 
frustrating there's one little mechanic
and<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.070> Wii<00:02:46.310> Remote<00:02:46.520> levels<00:02:46.880> just<00:02:47.060> one

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
and the Wii Remote levels just one

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.750 
and the Wii Remote levels just one
little<00:02:47.780> mechanic<00:02:48.350> that<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:48.950> hate<00:02:49.340> more<00:02:49.550> than

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
little mechanic that I hate more than

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.750 
little mechanic that I hate more than
any<00:02:49.940> other<00:02:50.150> I'll<00:02:50.960> talk<00:02:51.170> about<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.530> later<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:52.250> a

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
any other I'll talk about it later and a

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.730 
any other I'll talk about it later and a
level<00:02:53.180> where<00:02:53.360> it's<00:02:53.480> appropriate<00:02:53.720> where<00:02:54.620> it's

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
level where it's appropriate where it's

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.840 
level where it's appropriate where it's
always<00:02:55.220> present

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
always present

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.070 
always present
that's<00:02:56.330> not<00:02:56.570> this<00:02:56.750> level<00:02:57.140> at<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.320> moment<00:02:59.080> but

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
that's not this level at the moment but

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.560 
that's not this level at the moment but
the<00:03:00.560> controls<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.340> controls<00:03:01.700> feel<00:03:01.910> good<00:03:02.270> they

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
the controls the controls feel good they

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.050 
the controls the controls feel good they
take<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.780> really<00:03:02.960> get<00:03:03.260> used<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.860> know<00:03:03.980> but<00:03:04.700> I

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
right away so then I started together

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.870 
right away so then I started together
and<00:03:12.620> then<00:03:12.800> I<00:03:12.830> feel<00:03:13.100> really<00:03:13.130> comfortable<00:03:13.460> with

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
and then I feel really comfortable with

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.400 
and then I feel really comfortable with
but<00:03:16.880> yeah<00:03:17.030> some<00:03:17.330> parts<00:03:17.630> are<00:03:17.750> just<00:03:17.990> stupidly

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
but yeah some parts are just stupidly

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.710

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
level design of the Wii version if they

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.190 
level design of the Wii version if they
combined<00:03:57.879> those<00:03:58.120> two<00:03:58.150> together<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:59.019> really

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
combined those two together it really

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:10.979 
combined those two together it really
would<00:03:59.439> have<00:03:59.530> been<00:03:59.590> perfect<00:04:09.720> all<00:04:10.720> right<00:04:10.810> let<00:04:10.959> me

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
would have been perfect all right let me

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:26.869 
would have been perfect all right let me
show<00:04:11.170> you<00:04:11.260> some<00:04:11.560> combos<00:04:12.040> I've<00:04:12.220> learned<00:04:12.519> that

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:26.879 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.249 

all<00:04:27.879> right<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.240> also<00:04:28.419> these<00:04:28.780> quick<00:04:29.050> team

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
all right and also these quick team

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.640 
all right and also these quick team
events<00:04:29.650> actually<00:04:29.830> they<00:04:30.430> can<00:04:30.639> be<00:04:30.789> very<00:04:30.970> hard

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
events actually they can be very hard

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.890 
events actually they can be very hard
but<00:04:32.819> well<00:04:33.819> you've<00:04:33.909> got<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.180> keep<00:04:34.270> in<00:04:34.449> mind<00:04:34.689> is

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
but well you've got to keep in mind is

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.619 
but well you've got to keep in mind is
that<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.259> more<00:04:35.409> health<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.949> enemy<00:04:36.310> has<00:04:36.629> the

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:37.629 
that the more health the enemy has the

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.629 
that the more health the enemy has the
harder<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.650> quick<00:04:38.830> team<00:04:39.039> event<00:04:39.310> is<00:04:39.430> gonna<00:04:39.520> be

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
harder the quick team event is gonna be

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.029 
harder the quick team event is gonna be
so<00:04:40.000> it's<00:04:40.060> best<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.419> just<00:04:40.509> like<00:04:40.900> him<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:41.830> couple

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
so it's best to just like him a couple

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.939 
so it's best to just like him a couple
of<00:04:42.129> times<00:04:42.219> before

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
of times before

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.439 
of times before
yeah<00:04:44.949> initiator<00:04:45.460> so<00:04:45.879> that<00:04:46.030> will<00:04:46.120> be<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.240> lot

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
yeah initiator so that will be a lot

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.059 
yeah initiator so that will be a lot
easier<00:04:46.599> if<00:04:46.870> see<00:04:47.020> look<00:04:47.139> he's<00:04:47.319> almost<00:04:47.560> dead<00:04:47.830> but

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
easier if see look he's almost dead but

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:53.010 
easier if see look he's almost dead but
right<00:04:48.520> now<00:04:50.550> he<00:04:51.550> lets<00:04:51.729> me<00:04:51.849> see<00:04:52.689> like<00:04:52.840> it's

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
right now he lets me see like it's

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:02.080 
right now he lets me see like it's
really<00:04:53.259> slow<00:04:53.620> now

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090
