00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 to see how we can do the 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.259
 ebooks update is the gift of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.290
 They need our decoders 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.530
 satellites so we can open the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.540
 which is that it has the highest to three for 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.930
 that you can watch the channels in hd 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.670
 in this double we can use it with the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.800
 evo x clm with many versions of 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.449
 decoders like the s 810 which is the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.610
 which has been sold the most 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.350
 encoders accept class accept fox 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.649
 it is not served for all 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.379
 decoders we do not see what's coming in 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.379
 the capita de viviendas instructions 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.160
 already from the team how to connect 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.510
 so you can connect this where 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.510
 you need another my theme 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.840
 has to be has to be targeted at 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:04.320
 pass also does not have cable mun2 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.800
 the cable as was the port with the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.520
 computer audio cable 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.980
 for some old decoders 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:21.300
 has also the virus is where already 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.630
 then it has 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.439
 with an entrance 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.969
 r s the 32 o port with the entry 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.750
 audio for decoders 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:35.780
 old as he had told them to come 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:39.250
 with the entry for the elena law and for 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.250
 the charge not the tc 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.060
 and here comes your charger 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.719
 this is the charger and the way that 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.619
 we have to update it is connecting 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:56.109
 the cable to the port with your last 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.749
 computer this on computers 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:01.240
 old not because she the new 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:05.490
 they come with different private entrances 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.039
 if you do not have say the cable 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.540
 in the port how can you use the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.940
 usb cable to port how can you buy 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.010
 those cables that sell in the greens 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.830
 where they sell computers that sell 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.160
 also that cable that makes the 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.750
 port as about you can enter a 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.599
 port a usb port not then once 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.890
 that has held you connect to the port 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.920
 com goes to where the first thing you do 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.030
 history 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.540
 you have to be connected but not yet 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.830
 you have to plug in the power cord 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.640
 ready you just have to put the cable 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.970
 in the RS 232 and in the port as the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.680
 cool 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.490
 that's the first thing you have to do 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.180
 services if you have energy and you're going to 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.180
 Computer 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.030
 Y 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.670
 this file that we have here is the 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.410
 ebook is 27 1 of 2012 is the last 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.150
 update that we have had the ribbon 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:16.340
 you can not go down in the part of this 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.370
 video in the description part you 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.690
 We indicate where to download it, double click 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.470
 in if you are going to lower it 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:31.470
 in simple format you do not open and there's 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.470
 inside is the file and you take it out 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.879
 and run it here you can see that you 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.700
 says in what port to start 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:46.959
 scan depending on which port is 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.780
 using the equipment you place in what 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.019
 port will be ok sometimes we have in 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.900
 the port with another is in the old 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.609
 we have like printers or something like that 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.069
 then you are looking for in what port 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:05.560
 you can use already if you use more of the 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:08.739
 cable the usb arc2 converter 32 then 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.970
 I was to do as number 10 or 12 or 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.970
 fifteen 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.269
 so then you have to go back to the com 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.859
 towards 1 to 2 ok so you can 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.060
 work in this case will work in 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:26.020
 the channel with 1 ok you tell him to start 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.830
 it tells you that connecting 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.289
 you just there you make the connection of 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.559
 electricity cable 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:39.550
 once you connect the cable 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:43.750
 here it says connecting 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.110
 and sending the data is not starting to 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.110
 be already 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.300
 We wait a moment while doing 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.300
 reflection 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.780
 as I tell you with once you can 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.510
 make this update you can 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.419
 use this ebooks in any of 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.880
 the equipment you have does not matter that 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.639
 be old just like you will get the hd 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.940
 it's for any team and it's a lot 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:22.760
 better now than those who already come with 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:26.030
 the gift incorporated because it takes you out 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:30.610
 sharper I do not know much better in the 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.610
 way you can see them hd is not 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.630
 there he has started to do and we are 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:43.140
 walk flash and you're typing 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.140
 to be able to have a support file 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.790
 there he is finishing 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:57.160
 I have seen the update yes no 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:06:02.930
 completed and healthy 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:06.500
 you give to accept and disconnect linux 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.180

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.110
 hispasat 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:15.810
 and from there you will know that you will be able to see 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:19.030
 all the hd's is not that's about the 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.190
