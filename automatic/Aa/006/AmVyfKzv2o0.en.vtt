wanted to see a multi-touch test with

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.839 
wanted to see a multi-touch test with
HTC<00:00:10.440> aria<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:11.010> let's<00:00:11.219> do<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.490> here<00:00:11.639> we've<00:00:11.820> got

HTC aria so let's do it here we've got

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.999 
HTC aria so let's do it here we've got
the<00:00:12.000> nexus<00:00:12.330> one<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.660> left<00:00:12.870> motorola<00:00:13.740> droid

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the nexus one on the left motorola droid

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.289 
the nexus one on the left motorola droid
in<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.160> middle<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.639> re<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> right

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
in the middle and the re on the right

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.910 
in the middle and the re on the right
now<00:00:15.480> here's<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.900> test<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.529> multi-touch

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
now here's this test the multi-touch

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.460 
now here's this test the multi-touch
test<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.430> we've<00:00:17.550> done<00:00:17.699> before<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.470> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
test that we've done before and the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.730 
test that we've done before and the
droid<00:00:19.740> obviously<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.789> better<00:00:21.380> phones<00:00:22.380> so

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
droid obviously is the better phones so

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.859 
droid obviously is the better phones so
far<00:00:22.949> when<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.369> tested<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.119> nexus<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:24.660> so

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
far when we tested it with nexus one so

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.269 
far when we tested it with nexus one so
you<00:00:24.960> see<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> dots<00:00:25.410> follow<00:00:25.740> my<00:00:25.920> finger<00:00:26.220> is

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
you see the dots follow my finger is

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.700 
you see the dots follow my finger is
exactly<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.000> should<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.420> no<00:00:28.289> problems

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
exactly what it should be no problems

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.470 
exactly what it should be no problems
when<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.039> start<00:00:29.279> crossing<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.760> axis<00:00:30.210> or

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
when you start crossing the axis or

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.880 
when you start crossing the axis or
crossing<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> streams<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.470> i<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.769> call

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
crossing the streams as i like to call

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
crossing the streams as i like to call
it<00:00:32.040> them<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.460> everything<00:00:33.210> works<00:00:33.390> as<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.660> should

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it them so everything works as it should

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.020 
it them so everything works as it should
then<00:00:34.410> there's<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.829> nexus<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.309> which<00:00:35.670> has

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
then there's the nexus one which has

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.869 
then there's the nexus one which has
infamously<00:00:36.719> been<00:00:37.050> tested<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.530> oh<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.790> at

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
infamously been tested to oh look at

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.250 
infamously been tested to oh look at
that<00:00:38.910> not<00:00:39.239> quite<00:00:39.540> work<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> way<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.170> should

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
that not quite work the way it should

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.440 
that not quite work the way it should
cross<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> streams<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.700> everything<00:00:42.180> goes<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
cross the streams and everything goes to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.830 
cross the streams and everything goes to
hell<00:00:43.010> so<00:00:44.010> there's<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.910> now<00:00:45.239> let's<00:00:45.660> take<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
hell so there's that now let's take a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.540 
hell so there's that now let's take a
look<00:00:45.899> at<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> aria<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:46.920> we've<00:00:47.070> seen<00:00:47.280> how<00:00:47.430> it's

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
look at the aria so we've seen how it's

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.500 
look at the aria so we've seen how it's
supposed<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> look<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> how<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.390> not

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
supposed to look and how it's not

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.850 
supposed to look and how it's not
supposed<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> look<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.230> here's<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> aria

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
supposed to look and here's the aria

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.889 
supposed to look and here's the aria
look<00:00:50.070> how<00:00:50.219> small<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.730> screen<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.480> compared

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
look how small that screen is compared

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.110 
look how small that screen is compared
to<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.079> other<00:00:52.230> two<00:00:52.469> remember<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> 320<00:00:54.000> x

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
to the other two remember it's a 320 x

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.080 
to the other two remember it's a 320 x
480<00:00:54.510> screen<00:00:54.870> instead<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.289> 480<00:00:55.620> x<00:00:55.829> 800<00:00:56.309> makes<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
480 screen instead of 480 x 800 makes a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.490 
480 screen instead of 480 x 800 makes a
big<00:00:57.270> difference<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.989> screen<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.379> only

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
big difference in this screen is only

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.650 
big difference in this screen is only
3.2<00:00:59.039> inches<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.550> diagonal<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.149> look<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.480> that

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
3.2 inches in diagonal and look at that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.100 
3.2 inches in diagonal and look at that
I<00:01:00.870> got<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:02.090> access<00:01:03.090> problem<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:03.690> I've

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
I got a little access problem now I've

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.600 
I got a little access problem now I've
done<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> whole<00:01:04.530> bunch<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.799> tests<00:01:05.159> other<00:01:05.369> than

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
done a whole bunch of tests other than

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.039 
done a whole bunch of tests other than
the<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:05.850> you're<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.960> it

doesn't do it every single time a lot of

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.120 
doesn't do it every single time a lot of
times<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.330> tracks<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.780> fine<00:01:10.080> doesn't<00:01:11.010> get

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
times it tracks just fine doesn't get

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.370 
times it tracks just fine doesn't get
confused<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.420> fact<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.229> to

confused and in fact I kind of have to
force<00:01:13.890> Italy<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.330> force<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:15.869> not

it every time so I'm not sure how big a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.260 
it every time so I'm not sure how big a
problem<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.790> for<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.850> guys<00:01:24.000> I'm

playing<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.770> Aria<00:01:26.040> right<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.610> small

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
playing on the Aria right it's a small

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.210 
playing on the Aria right it's a small
screen<00:01:27.259> certainly<00:01:28.259> not<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> largest<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
screen certainly not the largest in the
