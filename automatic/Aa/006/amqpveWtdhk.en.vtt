00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 for our panoply of exercise we 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.309
 to enlarge it with this exercise 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.590
 that I would name the balance must why 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.700
 because the fingers then jump on 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.099
 the keyboard we will work the fingers 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.109
 in pairs per bus successively with 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.550
 2 then two with the 3 the hole with the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.070
 4th 4 with the 5 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.320
 so how are we going to do for lamah 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.119
 for the first two the 1 and the 2 he 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.449
 who are going to work but the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.630
 other woods anyway so screen 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.030
 that the offered did 1 2 then we 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.510
 let go 2 and we 'll put one in its place 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.510
 to press 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.629
 So here's the thing is to get to 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:51.030
 let go quickly enough the second so that 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.030
 the one more and more hear that he supports 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.190
 and that's why we say it 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.600
 is why I called it the only 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.489
 finger and for power plants did 2 1 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.940
 this time it is the 1 that must be dropped 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.940
 very quickly 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.689
 claude ii and iii do the same 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.580
 a3 and a4 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.510
 1400 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:36.100
 it's the hardest for the last 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.509
 finger is harder it's always them 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.990
 who are less muscular is less accustomed 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.259
 to play we do not do with the left hand 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.259
 horsehair 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.900
 had only 3 and 2 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.900
 then with the 3rd quarter 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.250
 with the 4 5 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.900
 finally 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.760
 so that you get used to typing well 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.220
 the keyboard then the last ones for me 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.680
 so I did not train much 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.060
 for before doing on the video but that 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.370
 is always slower for the last 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.420
 finger because the troubles is 3 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.050
 fingers the landscapes they are obviously 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.520
 the 23 work is also good for the 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.100
 last do not forget them important 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.440
 lets you work shouting on 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.599
 has not seen this yet but for example 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.599
 then this is our notes' doing 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.960
 the well and then 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.139
 I did that with the 3 and 2 possible 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.090
 it's still the simplest thing to do 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:07.799
 a rain is 4.5 knows that falls 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.310
 really a mastery of this exercise 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:14.189
 pretty exemplary so here's the balance 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.170
 must you can train with this 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.569
 exercise if you want to progress in 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.819
 your fingering and your strength on the 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.980
 keyboard there are classic pieces 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.859
 that you have to train yourself 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.409
 to do that kind of to do what 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.269
 is written in any case but for our 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.040
 lessons it's not very useful let's say that 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.290
 will make you progress your fingering 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.150
 it is especially that the objective the goal 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.219
 it's not that you had very fast 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:46.489
 that you arrive is regularly must 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:46.489
 not do it's regular 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.820
 we go it's regular really 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.820
 maintain regularity
