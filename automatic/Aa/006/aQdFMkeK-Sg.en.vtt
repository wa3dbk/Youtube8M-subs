00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:11.980
 greater 72 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:15.379
 what happens riveros 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:20.070
 well today I have one thing about which 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:22.320
 talk and it's the fucking headphones 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.900
 a season in the past and in fact not 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.420
 I know yes I do believe that in a greater CTV of the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.210
 first I did I talked about the subject makes 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.309
 thing of years I good because they had good 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.100
 my mp3 as I have now good art a 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.280
 mp4 whatever it is balls are called and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.379
 used he did not use much and what 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.750
 was doing was spending enough 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.930
 headphones what I was doing was taking the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.089
 mp3 and well I was not listening to it 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.180
 I picked up the headphones and two rolled up 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.789
 that it happened that the hard part that is the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.579
 main from where it hooks to the mp3 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.190
 because it ended up doubling they ended 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.379
 breaking or ended up wearing out and 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.690
 you could no longer hear they were unusable 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.630
 and I ended up throwing about 3 or 5 4 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.100
 headphones per pair of headphones that 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.380
 I dont know 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.990
 in the end how many I ended up spending was 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.640
 incredible was the host until I decided 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.649
 good try to have a little more 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.740
 careful and then what I did was 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.439
 apart from winding the unhook the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.040
 part that connects so that it will not bend 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.350
 but 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.590
 I was up to the balls that in the end 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.870
 determined by doing again what is the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.870
 problem that I only had about 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.970
 headphones that are really torch and if 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.810
 moss for not the headphones themselves 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.180
 same because the headset is not bad 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.760
 but because they have this piece of cable 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.010
 if I went to the fucking store to buy 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.479
 a normal headphones and is that 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.040
 it turns out that headphones 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.740
 carry now are not the ones that had before 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.290
 but instead of being let's say more or 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.660
 less circular like this one here you get 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.200
 they put inside the fucking ear not what 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.470
 I understand better in March and I do not 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 I want to put then I caught this with 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.760
 the bad luck that I did not notice or better 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.740
 it did not look in the housing the truth is 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.000
 I do not remember I had this piece 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.860
 of cable and is that they were not the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.590
 normal headphones were about 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.610
 headphones for roll television with a 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.120
 hey 45 meters to use 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.390
 he got the television but I'm hearing it 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.719
 so now I'm going with this one 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.180
 that is, it occupies as much as the mp3 point or 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.739
 imagine what it is to come and fulfill 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.620
 with this on the street if it's that 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.079
 has a tone regulator and to put it 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.319
 in overalls and everything is kiss kiss' the cock 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.790
 why do I need that then what 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.040
 I'm going to have to do now is buy 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.439
 some decent helmets something that does not 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.180
 I have a cable break as steel 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:59.530
 so as fat as me 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.310
 you get it then I hope that that 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.269
 last I do not know how much I'll find it 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.890
 well then in the comic expo I 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.750
 they talked about helmets that had 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.819
 pretty good price but good I think 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.310
 that I will use some pretty good ones 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.719
 no house is hovering around 50 payments and 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.829
 then to see that he caught me I do not know what 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:19.930
 better I have to send the two 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.150
 the same to go down the street because 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.709
 I want some good ones to work in my 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.510
 music and also have others with whom 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.239
 go out on the street without being broken 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.599
 and do not be this and it's good as you know 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.010
 I with little my own music and then 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.709
 well I've done since I have a couple of 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.769
 songs that I have uploaded in the by 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.379
 example I am a ninja in walk major cti 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.450
 the one of dragon soul in greater 7news and 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.000
 that looks of major 7 music for tunes 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.040
 instrumental is not how it was done and 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.109
 some songs that are not humorous 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.469
 because also put in there the biggest 7 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.900
 music all songs that are not from 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:00.150
 let's say comedy or development 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.220
 carefree not 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.019
 that I suppose you put them all in 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.909
 a larger bowl cts is at least my plan 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.640
 and that is when I'm editing music 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.189
 composing in the middle of the night 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.650
 pussy to not make noise or do not know what 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.640
 you better also need some helmets 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.280
 because for example you when you're 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.840
 singing what you can not do is be 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.400
 singing listening to the instrument at 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.699
 same time because if not then the 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.090
 sound is sneaking into your microphone and what 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.970
 you do 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.250
 is let's say generate a kind of echo and 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.050
 that's obviously not good because the 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.180
 you are shitting then at the time of 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.490
 singing or composing is always necessary 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.250
 have good helmets and good those 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.740
 are things that you are realizing with the 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.020
 the passage of time when you are doing the 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.880
 things and I have a good camera 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.979
 I have a good tripod, I have good ones 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.870
 spotlights I have a green background I have 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.639
 enough things but still in things 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.570
 that I do not have and I'm going to end up with 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.099
 a fucking producer that is going to have 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.389
 companies that envy me for the amount 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.889
 of things that I have because I'm 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.870
 spending the dough on this pile of 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.110
 shit and well I have the truth about 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.710
 helmets there behind in the music room 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.020
 good is a kind 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.510
 and I do not know if you can see it well but 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.330
 I have a normal piano I have a piano 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.510
 electric there are two electric guitars and 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.040
 an electric battery that is there is there 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.280
 it's too much and it's coming with the battery 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.010
 electric a few helmets but they are not 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.410
 helmets that convince me are not the 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.220
 typical helmets that you can imagine not 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:33.700
 I know it seems to me like a little retro 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.920
 I do not roll 90s or something like that or early 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.870
 of the 2000 then I want a helmets 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.880
 normal that do not go over the price 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.150
 because there are a hundred or even 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.980
 two hundred turkeys three that are 100 or 150 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.140
 turkeys that you spend only for the name 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.990
 of the brand then I have to look there 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.580
 well helmets pillar I guess I 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.860
 I will study it in the fnac because there 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.570
 enough helmets so I wait for 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.320
 Christmas have something decent with what 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:01.900
 listen to music so I do not expect anything 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.240
 good you are a little bit of everything 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.760
 this really influences us in 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.790
 absolutely nothing unless you consider 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.409
 that the music that I do influences you and 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.569
 like because 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:15.459
 the truth I hope to have better material 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.809
 because when I was composing all 

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:18.610
 the songs that I've made up 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:21.639
 now and other instrumentals that not yet 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.189
 you have seen then used some cases 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.809
 which are the ones that just broke 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:27.009
 that did not reach me from the computer 

00:06:25.809 --> 00:06:30.550
 face and had to be with a 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.379
 implant well or very close to the computer and 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.179
 we were pretty ridiculous for someone 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:36.989
 that you try to put a little seriously 

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:39.860
 with the musical composition so nothing 

00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:44.289
 until next time 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.289
 life
