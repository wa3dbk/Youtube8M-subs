for<00:06:12.919> us<00:06:12.950> because<00:06:13.220> I<00:06:13.930> think<00:06:14.930> they're<00:06:15.440> stolen

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
for us because I think they're stolen

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.909 
for us because I think they're stolen
over<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.430> years<00:06:17.000> but<00:06:17.419> Santa<00:06:18.169> had<00:06:18.530> some<00:06:18.770> better

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
over the years but Santa had some better

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.340 
over the years but Santa had some better
forest<00:06:19.430> like<00:06:20.150> that's<00:06:20.360> a<00:06:20.419> forest<00:06:20.690> last<00:06:20.870> year<00:06:21.050> I

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
forest like that's a forest last year I

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.530 
forest like that's a forest last year I
mean<00:06:22.070> we<00:06:22.370> struggled<00:06:22.790> down<00:06:22.880> the<00:06:22.940> bottom<00:06:23.300> but<00:06:23.450> we

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
mean we struggled down the bottom but we

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.360 
mean we struggled down the bottom but we
survived<00:06:23.900> survived<00:06:24.440> and<00:06:24.650> now<00:06:24.800> we've<00:06:25.010> had<00:06:25.040> to

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
survived survived and now we've had to

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.500 
survived survived and now we've had to
take<00:06:25.580> over<00:06:25.850> a<00:06:26.180> new<00:06:26.979> manager<00:06:27.979> nice<00:06:28.430> and<00:06:29.180> we've

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
take over a new manager nice and we've

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.560 
take over a new manager nice and we've
made<00:06:29.660> some<00:06:29.870> good<00:06:30.020> stylings<00:06:30.500> yeah<00:06:31.010> and<00:06:31.300> I<00:06:32.300> think

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
made some good stylings yeah and I think

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.120 
made some good stylings yeah and I think
I'm<00:06:33.500> not<00:06:33.740> expecting<00:06:34.430> promotion<00:06:34.940> but<00:06:35.390> I<00:06:36.130> think

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
I'm not expecting promotion but I think

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.750 
I'm not expecting promotion but I think
whatever<00:06:37.280> better<00:06:37.669> season<00:06:38.060> in<00:06:38.180> last<00:06:38.270> year<00:06:39.760> we

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
whatever better season in last year we

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.969 
whatever better season in last year we
were<00:06:40.820> steamed

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
were steamed

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.320
