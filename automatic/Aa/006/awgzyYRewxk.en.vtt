00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
problem this is a 1999 Ford that we're

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.440 
problem this is a 1999 Ford that we're
using<00:00:36.860> for<00:00:37.040> all<00:00:37.250> of<00:00:37.370> our<00:00:37.460> hinder<00:00:37.760> rust<00:00:37.970> tests

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
using for all of our hinder rust tests

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.080 
using for all of our hinder rust tests
it's<00:00:39.290> a<00:00:39.500> nice<00:00:39.830> machine<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.460> we<00:00:40.550> were<00:00:40.700> testing

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
it's a nice machine and we were testing

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.670 
it's a nice machine and we were testing
underneath<00:00:41.480> on<00:00:41.690> top<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.140> everybody's<00:00:42.500> even

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
underneath on top and everybody's even

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.800 
underneath on top and everybody's even
think<00:00:42.860> of<00:00:42.980> see<00:00:43.580> how<00:00:43.730> we<00:00:43.790> do<00:00:44.090> on<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.420> rust

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
think of see how we do on the rust

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.110 
think of see how we do on the rust
we've<00:00:45.440> already<00:00:45.620> treated<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.070> inside<00:00:46.400> so<00:00:46.790> who

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
we've already treated the inside so who

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.710 
we've already treated the inside so who
did<00:00:47.270> here<00:00:47.540> I<00:00:47.750> gotta<00:00:48.730> check<00:00:49.730> your<00:00:49.970> engine<00:00:50.090> code

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
did here I gotta check your engine code

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.320 
did here I gotta check your engine code
on<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.470> front<00:00:51.980> of<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.160> car<00:00:52.370> not<00:00:52.700> too<00:00:52.850> long<00:00:53.030> ago

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
on the front of the car not too long ago

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.060 
on the front of the car not too long ago
we<00:00:54.080> put<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:55.930> reader<00:00:56.930> on<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.350> computer<00:00:57.980> and

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
we put a reader on the computer and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.210 
we put a reader on the computer and
found<00:00:58.220> out<00:00:58.460> we<00:00:58.550> had<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:58.700> 401<00:00:59.330> error<00:01:00.080> code<00:01:00.530> what

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
found out we had a 401 error code what

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.500 
found out we had a 401 error code what
that<00:01:01.400> means<00:01:01.610> is<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.910> exhaust<00:01:02.300> gas

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
that means is the exhaust gas

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.200 
that means is the exhaust gas
recirculation<00:01:03.050> twerking<00:01:03.800> probably<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.089> we

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
recirculation twerking probably so we

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.789 
recirculation twerking probably so we
decided<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.630> fix<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:06.020> because<00:01:06.170> what<00:01:06.530> and

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
decided to fix it because what and

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.620 
decided to fix it because what and
couldn't<00:01:07.369> pass<00:01:07.520> for<00:01:07.729> inspection<00:01:08.179> because<00:01:08.509> of

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
couldn't pass for inspection because of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.749 
couldn't pass for inspection because of
that<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.380> what<00:01:09.560> I<00:01:09.590> wanted<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.039> do<00:01:10.189> is<00:01:10.429> get<00:01:10.609> this

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
that so what I wanted to do is get this

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.459 
that so what I wanted to do is get this
up<00:01:10.999> so<00:01:11.119> we<00:01:11.149> passed<00:01:11.509> inspection<00:01:11.719> it<00:01:12.170> was<00:01:12.289> a<00:01:12.320> very

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
up so we passed inspection it was a very

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.739 
up so we passed inspection it was a very
important<00:01:12.859> car<00:01:13.039> I<00:01:13.429> can't<00:01:14.030> afford<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.329> junk<00:01:14.600> it

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:14.749 
important car I can't afford to junk it

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:17.649 
important car I can't afford to junk it
out<00:01:14.899> the<00:01:15.890> first<00:01:16.159> thing<00:01:16.310> we<00:01:16.460> did<00:01:16.640> was<00:01:16.850> was<00:01:17.359> clean

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
out the first thing we did was was clean

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.190 
out the first thing we did was was clean
and<00:01:18.850> replaced<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.149> exhaust<00:01:20.990> gas

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
and replaced the exhaust gas

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.260 
and replaced the exhaust gas
recirculation<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:22.280> took<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.909> one<00:01:23.060> out<00:01:23.240> of

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
recirculation I took the one out of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.969 
recirculation I took the one out of
there<00:01:23.569> that<00:01:23.749> was<00:01:23.869> in<00:01:24.020> there<00:01:24.229> cut<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.649> open<00:01:24.770> and

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
there that was in there cut it open and

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.139 
there that was in there cut it open and
I<00:01:25.100> wasn't<00:01:25.369> seem<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.549> be<00:01:25.609> anything<00:01:25.729> wrong<00:01:25.819> with

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
I wasn't seem to be anything wrong with

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.029 
I wasn't seem to be anything wrong with
it<00:01:26.179> a<00:01:26.420> little<00:01:26.810> dirty<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:27.740> that's<00:01:27.890> what<00:01:28.009> I

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
it a little dirty and that's what I

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.730 
it a little dirty and that's what I
cleaned<00:01:28.310> out<00:01:28.460> next<00:01:29.179> thing<00:01:29.299> we<00:01:29.450> did<00:01:29.689> this<00:01:30.560> is

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
cleaned out next thing we did this is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.330 
cleaned out next thing we did this is
the<00:01:30.859> vacuum<00:01:31.579> in<00:01:32.539> regular<00:01:32.960> case<00:01:33.649> it<00:01:33.920> takes<00:01:34.100> that

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
the vacuum in regular case it takes that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.870 
the vacuum in regular case it takes that
signal<00:01:35.240> from<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.719> computer<00:01:36.350> send<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.399> vacuum

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
signal from the computer send the vacuum

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.809 
signal from the computer send the vacuum
here<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.689> operates<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.229> bow<00:01:39.429> we<00:01:40.429> replace<00:01:40.789> that

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
here it operates the bow we replace that

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.879 
here it operates the bow we replace that
no<00:01:41.389> effect<00:01:41.780> we<00:01:41.899> still<00:01:42.109> had<00:01:42.229> two<00:01:42.350> four<00:01:42.560> on<00:01:42.710> one

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:42.889 
no effect we still had two four on one

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:46.200 
no effect we still had two four on one
code<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.960> then<00:01:45.200> we

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
code so then we

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.999 
code so then we
disconnected<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.390> intake<00:01:48.320> manifold<00:01:48.829> right

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
disconnected the intake manifold right

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.819 
disconnected the intake manifold right
here<00:01:49.430> went<00:01:50.329> in<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:50.899> cleaned<00:01:51.409> out<00:01:51.619> the

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
here went in and cleaned out the

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.889 
here went in and cleaned out the
manifold<00:01:52.640> which<00:01:52.789> was<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:52.969> disaster<00:01:53.689> with

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
manifold which was a disaster with

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.510 
manifold which was a disaster with
chocked<00:01:54.320> full<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:54.590> carbon<00:01:55.039> we<00:01:55.189> had<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.340> go<00:01:55.430> in

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
chocked full of carbon we had to go in

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.190 
chocked full of carbon we had to go in
with<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.700> hammer<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.119> chisel<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.899> work<00:01:57.049> it

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
with a hammer and a chisel and work it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.169 
with a hammer and a chisel and work it
loose<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.130> was<00:01:58.340> pretty<00:01:58.520> bad<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.970> minute

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
loose so that was pretty bad the minute

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.700 
loose so that was pretty bad the minute
I<00:01:59.240> did<00:01:59.420> that<00:01:59.600> I<00:01:59.630> said<00:01:59.810> oh<00:01:59.929> boy<00:02:00.140> we<00:02:00.350> fix<00:02:00.590> the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
I did that I said oh boy we fix the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.190 
I did that I said oh boy we fix the
problem<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.850> we<00:02:01.880> put<00:02:02.149> it<00:02:02.240> back<00:02:02.390> on<00:02:02.600> again<00:02:02.630> and

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
problem so we put it back on again and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.340 
problem so we put it back on again and
I'll<00:02:04.130> be<00:02:04.310> damned<00:02:04.490> if<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.700> 401<00:02:05.390> coach<00:02:05.990> didn't

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
I'll be damned if that 401 coach didn't

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.979 
I'll be damned if that 401 coach didn't
keep<00:02:06.470> coming<00:02:06.799> up<00:02:07.119> then<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.239> decided<00:02:08.630> they<00:02:08.869> would

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
keep coming up then I decided they would

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.570 
keep coming up then I decided they would
have<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.289> get<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.920> differential

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
have to get the the differential

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.550 
have to get the the differential
pressure<00:02:10.959> regulator<00:02:11.959> which<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.349> down

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
pressure regulator which is down

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.460 
pressure regulator which is down
underneath<00:02:12.950> here<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.840> thought<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.349> was

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
underneath here and you thought it was

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.920 
underneath here and you thought it was
designed<00:02:15.860> by<00:02:16.160> some<00:02:16.430> diabolical<00:02:17.239> fiend<00:02:17.269> at

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
designed by some diabolical fiend at

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.289 
designed by some diabolical fiend at
Ford<00:02:18.200> who<00:02:19.040> decided<00:02:19.489> that<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.910> had<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.180> have

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
Ford who decided that you had to have

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.420 
Ford who decided that you had to have
Explorer<00:02:21.200> hand<00:02:21.530> about<00:02:21.709> half<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> size<00:02:22.160> of

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
Explorer hand about half the size of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.789 
Explorer hand about half the size of
mine<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.060> with<00:02:23.420> two<00:02:23.599> wrist<00:02:24.140> bowl<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.530> get<00:02:24.650> in

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
mine and with two wrist bowl to get in

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.130 
mine and with two wrist bowl to get in
there<00:02:25.010> I<00:02:25.299> finally<00:02:26.299> went<00:02:26.420> in<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:26.720> got<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.870> damn

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
there I finally went in and got the damn

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.009 
there I finally went in and got the damn
thing<00:02:27.410> out<00:02:27.620> run<00:02:28.489> it<00:02:28.580> out<00:02:28.700> we<00:02:29.269> put<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.510> new<00:02:29.720> one<00:02:29.870> on

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
thing out run it out we put a new one on

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.630 
thing out run it out we put a new one on
because<00:02:30.410> we<00:02:30.560> figured<00:02:30.830> well<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.160> absolutely

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
because we figured well that absolutely

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.809 
because we figured well that absolutely
has<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.849> be<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> problem<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.530> we<00:02:34.519> didn't<00:02:34.730> got

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
has to be the problem and we didn't got

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.750 
has to be the problem and we didn't got
to<00:02:34.940> we<00:02:35.180> still<00:02:35.420> got<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.630> score<00:02:35.870> on<00:02:35.900> one<00:02:36.110> coat

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
to we still got the score on one coat

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.650 
to we still got the score on one coat
well<00:02:37.760> this<00:02:37.849> is<00:02:37.970> starting<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.239> get<00:02:38.299> me<00:02:38.480> pretty

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
well this is starting to get me pretty

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.240 
well this is starting to get me pretty
upset<00:02:38.870> because<00:02:39.380> we<00:02:39.560> couldn't<00:02:39.890> pass<00:02:40.010> this

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
upset because we couldn't pass this

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.550 
upset because we couldn't pass this
function<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.660> question<00:02:42.140> is<00:02:42.170> what<00:02:42.319> to<00:02:42.440> do

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
function now the question is what to do

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.740 
function now the question is what to do
next<00:02:42.769> well<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.730> went<00:02:43.940> back<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.329> stumped<00:02:44.690> for

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
next well I went back and stumped for

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.390 
next well I went back and stumped for
about<00:02:44.989> three<00:02:45.230> days<00:02:45.440> because<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:45.980> couldn't<00:02:46.250> see

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
about three days because I couldn't see

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.089 
about three days because I couldn't see
this<00:02:46.610> one<00:02:46.760> happened<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.440> went<00:02:48.739> on<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:48.920> web

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
this one happened and I went on the web

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.099 
this one happened and I went on the web
trying<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.849> find<00:02:50.030> everything<00:02:50.329> I<00:02:50.390> could<00:02:50.569> find<00:02:50.840> a

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
trying to find everything I could find a

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.360 
trying to find everything I could find a
lot<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.500> information<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.160> lot<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.310> people

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
lot of information a lot of people

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.330 
lot of information a lot of people
having<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.819> problem<00:02:53.500> so<00:02:54.500> then<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.680> decided<00:02:54.829> to

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
having this problem so then I decided to

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.840 
having this problem so then I decided to
get<00:02:55.579> a<00:02:55.640> new<00:02:56.560> differential<00:02:57.560> pressure<00:02:57.850> device

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
get a new differential pressure device

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.910 
get a new differential pressure device
in<00:02:59.060> there<00:02:59.209> that<00:02:59.510> didn't<00:02:59.780> work<00:02:59.959> so<00:03:00.260> then<00:03:00.709> I

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
in there that didn't work so then I

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.379 
in there that didn't work so then I
started<00:03:01.190> thinking<00:03:01.250> illustrate<00:03:02.060> what<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.269> was

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:02.389 
started thinking illustrate what I was

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.490 
started thinking illustrate what I was
thinking<00:03:02.690> about<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:04.519> way<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:05.500> differential

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
thinking about the way this differential

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.940 
thinking about the way this differential
pressure<00:03:06.799> device<00:03:07.250> works<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.500> takes<00:03:09.530> it

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
pressure device works is it takes it

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.289 
pressure device works is it takes it
picks<00:03:10.250> up<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.579> differential<00:03:10.970> pressure

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
picks up the differential pressure

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.670 
picks up the differential pressure
across<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.780> Northeast<00:03:12.230> in<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.440> exhaust

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
across the Northeast in the exhaust

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.280 
across the Northeast in the exhaust
manifold<00:03:13.310> here<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.600> high<00:03:14.750> pressure<00:03:15.049> and<00:03:15.170> low

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
manifold here the high pressure and low

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.319 
manifold here the high pressure and low
pressure<00:03:15.410> reads<00:03:16.069> up<00:03:16.250> here<00:03:16.489> this<00:03:17.000> sends<00:03:17.239> that

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
pressure reads up here this sends that

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.590 
pressure reads up here this sends that
information<00:03:17.389> to<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.230> computer<00:03:19.030> now<00:03:20.030> going<00:03:20.450> on

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
information to the computer now going on

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.150 
information to the computer now going on
me<00:03:20.810> that<00:03:21.079> says<00:03:21.290> everything<00:03:21.530> else<00:03:21.769> was<00:03:21.920> plugged

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
me that says everything else was plugged

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.590 
me that says everything else was plugged
up<00:03:22.340> pretty<00:03:22.700> good<00:03:22.850> chance<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.299> was

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
up pretty good chance that that was

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.240 
up pretty good chance that that was
 up<00:03:24.019> -<00:03:24.230> down<00:03:24.440> there<00:03:24.620> with<00:03:24.769> that<00:03:24.799> orifice

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
 up - down there with that orifice

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.650 
 up - down there with that orifice
but<00:03:25.340> all<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.549> crud<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.910> was<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.239> system

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
but all the crud that was in the system

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.140 
but all the crud that was in the system
and<00:03:27.260> then<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.769> was<00:03:27.920> sending<00:03:28.130> out<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.670> very<00:03:29.060> high

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
and then it was sending out a very high

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.620 
and then it was sending out a very high
error<00:03:29.840> message<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.739> computer<00:03:31.600> so<00:03:32.600> I

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
error message to the computer so I

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.229 
error message to the computer so I
figured<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:33.139> get<00:03:33.260> cute<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.579> Steve<00:03:34.819> I<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:35.090> jump

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
figured to get cute and Steve I can jump

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.629 
figured to get cute and Steve I can jump
ahead<00:03:35.359> of<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.569> problem<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.769> what<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:36.980> did<00:03:37.130> was<00:03:37.459> I

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
ahead of the problem so what I did was I

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.240 
ahead of the problem so what I did was I
put<00:03:37.670> a<00:03:38.209> t<00:03:38.480> across<00:03:38.900> here<00:03:39.200> with<00:03:39.650> a<00:03:39.680> needle<00:03:40.040> valve

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
put a t across here with a needle valve

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.690 
put a t across here with a needle valve
so<00:03:40.850> I<00:03:40.880> could<00:03:41.120> adjust<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.780> read<00:03:42.079> reel<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.859> me

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
so I could adjust and read reel of me

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.790 
so I could adjust and read reel of me
reduce<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.209> pressure<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.599> little<00:03:44.690> bit<00:03:45.050> on<00:03:45.500> the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
reduce the pressure a little bit on the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.240 
reduce the pressure a little bit on the
ends<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.130> whites<00:03:46.340> let's<00:03:46.670> see<00:03:46.880> what<00:03:47.030> I<00:03:47.090> did<00:03:48.250> okay

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
ends of whites let's see what I did okay

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.370 
ends of whites let's see what I did okay
first<00:03:49.670> thing<00:03:49.819> I<00:03:49.910> did<00:03:50.180> was<00:03:50.690> I<00:03:50.840> putting<00:03:51.080> a<00:03:51.140> couple

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
first thing I did was I putting a couple

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.170 
first thing I did was I putting a couple
of<00:03:51.440> extender<00:03:51.890> tubes<00:03:52.130> on<00:03:52.370> this<00:03:52.610> thing<00:03:52.819> because

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
of extender tubes on this thing because

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.570 
of extender tubes on this thing because
I<00:03:53.390> was<00:03:53.510> not<00:03:54.050> gonna<00:03:54.260> go<00:03:54.440> back<00:03:54.650> onto<00:03:54.830> there<00:03:55.099> put

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
I was not gonna go back onto there put

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.890 
I was not gonna go back onto there put
that<00:03:55.610> in<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.060> out<00:03:56.180> every<00:03:56.420> time<00:03:56.510> something

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
that in and out every time something

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.630 
that in and out every time something
they<00:03:57.200> look<00:03:57.349> at<00:03:57.560> because<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.250> was<00:03:58.459> such<00:03:58.610> a

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
they look at because it was such a

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.580 
they look at because it was such a
painter<00:03:59.060> than<00:03:59.209> that<00:03:59.390> there's<00:04:00.050> no<00:04:00.170> idea<00:04:00.470> how

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
painter than that there's no idea how

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.680 
painter than that there's no idea how
difficult<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:01.160> was<00:04:01.370> so<00:04:02.150> then<00:04:02.270> what<00:04:02.420> I<00:04:02.450> do<00:04:02.569> is

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
difficult that was so then what I do is

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.750 
difficult that was so then what I do is
I<00:04:02.870> made<00:04:03.020> up<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.230> tee<00:04:03.530> putting<00:04:04.040> across<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.489> lines

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
I made up a tee putting across the lines

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.050 
I made up a tee putting across the lines
and<00:04:05.630> put<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.870> needle<00:04:06.500> valve<00:04:06.680> on<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:07.670> I've<00:04:07.880> got

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
and put a needle valve on and I've got

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.520 
and put a needle valve on and I've got
the<00:04:08.209> needle<00:04:08.480> valve<00:04:08.720> open<00:04:08.989> just<00:04:09.140> roughly

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
the needle valve open just roughly

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.729 
the needle valve open just roughly
exactly<00:04:10.160> one<00:04:10.340> turn<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:11.750> all<00:04:12.500> of<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.680> sudden

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
exactly one turn and all of a sudden

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.339 
exactly one turn and all of a sudden
things<00:04:13.519> start<00:04:13.760> behaving<00:04:13.940> themselves<00:04:14.330> I'll<00:04:15.170> be

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
things start behaving themselves I'll be

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.440 
things start behaving themselves I'll be
damned<00:04:15.650> if<00:04:15.769> I<00:04:15.890> didn't<00:04:16.190> see<00:04:16.310> barely<00:04:16.910> outwitted

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
damned if I didn't see barely outwitted

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.140 
damned if I didn't see barely outwitted
the<00:04:17.540> Machine<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:19.310> then<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:19.609> see<00:04:19.790> whether<00:04:20.000> we

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
the Machine and then to see whether we

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.390 
the Machine and then to see whether we
were<00:04:20.239> still<00:04:20.450> legal<00:04:20.810> or<00:04:20.900> not<00:04:21.079> I<00:04:21.350> could<00:04:22.070> at<00:04:22.160> each

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
were still legal or not I could at each

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.510 
were still legal or not I could at each
nation<00:04:22.850> on<00:04:22.970> here<00:04:23.389> on<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.990> top<00:04:24.200> of<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.560> valve

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
nation on here on the top of the valve

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.950 
nation on here on the top of the valve
so<00:04:25.940> when<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:26.120> back<00:04:26.330> vacuum<00:04:26.780> shows<00:04:27.020> up<00:04:27.260> here<00:04:28.960> it

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
so when I back vacuum shows up here it

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.170 
so when I back vacuum shows up here it
will<00:04:30.229> appear<00:04:30.740> over<00:04:31.700> here

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
will appear over here

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.260 
will appear over here
on<00:04:33.050> this<00:04:33.200> pressure<00:04:33.470> gate<00:04:33.850> now<00:04:34.850> what<00:04:35.030> I'm<00:04:35.120> gonna

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
on this pressure gate now what I'm gonna

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.420 
on this pressure gate now what I'm gonna
do<00:04:35.540> is<00:04:36.020> take<00:04:36.320> you<00:04:36.440> out<00:04:36.590> there<00:04:36.740> for<00:04:36.919> a<00:04:36.979> ride<00:04:37.190> in

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
do is take you out there for a ride in

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.580 
do is take you out there for a ride in
the<00:04:37.520> car<00:04:37.700> now<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.180> you<00:04:38.240> can<00:04:38.389> watch<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.570> work<00:04:38.930> it

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
the car now and you can watch it work it

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.900 
the car now and you can watch it work it
turns<00:04:39.800> out<00:04:39.950> we<00:04:40.070> fixed<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.430> problem<00:04:40.790> very

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
turns out we fixed the problem very

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.150 
turns out we fixed the problem very
nicely<00:04:41.380> that<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.410> car<00:04:42.919> is<00:04:43.070> now<00:04:43.840> inspected

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
nicely that the car is now inspected

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.140 
nicely that the car is now inspected
2014<00:04:46.160> on<00:04:46.310> this<00:04:46.490> right<00:04:46.700> now

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
2014 on this right now

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.330 
2014 on this right now
we're<00:04:47.720> in<00:04:47.810> good<00:04:47.930> shape<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:49.010> we've<00:04:49.160> jumped

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
we're in good shape so we've jumped

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.320 
we're in good shape so we've jumped
ahead<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.669> the<00:04:49.729> whole<00:04:49.850> problem<00:04:50.090> though<00:04:50.300> I

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
ahead of the whole problem though I

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.000 
ahead of the whole problem though I
wonder<00:04:50.810> about<00:04:50.840> how<00:04:51.110> many<00:04:51.289> vehicles<00:04:51.590> have<00:04:51.800> gone

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
wonder about how many vehicles have gone

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.529 
wonder about how many vehicles have gone
to<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.250> junkyard<00:04:52.580> because<00:04:53.060> it's<00:04:53.270> something

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
to the junkyard because it's something

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:55.600 
to the junkyard because it's something
like<00:04:53.720> this<00:04:53.900> it's<00:04:54.560> almost<00:04:54.740> impossible<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.520> get

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
like this it's almost impossible to get

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.610 
like this it's almost impossible to get
down<00:04:55.789> there<00:04:56.030> to<00:04:56.150> service<00:04:56.660> those<00:04:56.960> door<00:04:57.289> forces

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
down there to service those door forces

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.850 
down there to service those door forces
and<00:04:58.340> this<00:04:59.150> now<00:04:59.360> shows<00:04:59.840> us<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.200> neat<00:05:00.410> fix<00:05:00.710> to

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
and this now shows us the neat fix to

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.080 
and this now shows us the neat fix to
jump<00:05:01.070> around<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.490> problem<00:05:01.880> if<00:05:02.000> the

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
jump around that problem if the

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.520 
jump around that problem if the
pressures<00:05:02.450> out<00:05:02.840> of<00:05:03.050> range

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
pressures out of range

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.230 
pressures out of range
we're<00:05:04.250> gonna<00:05:04.460> take<00:05:04.700> this<00:05:04.880> to<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.150> windshield

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
we're gonna take this to the windshield

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.180 
we're gonna take this to the windshield
then<00:05:06.140> we're<00:05:06.289> gonna<00:05:06.440> take<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.680> we're<00:05:06.890> gonna<00:05:07.010> go

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
then we're gonna take the we're gonna go

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.860 
then we're gonna take the we're gonna go
out<00:05:07.340> for<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.550> ride<00:05:07.729> and<00:05:07.789> you<00:05:08.150> will<00:05:08.630> show<00:05:08.780> you

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
out for a ride and you will show you

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.659 
out for a ride and you will show you
what<00:05:09.050> it<00:05:09.140> does<00:05:09.350> in<00:05:09.560> the<00:05:09.620> car<00:05:09.860> we're<00:05:10.280> on<00:05:10.460> route

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
what it does in the car we're on route

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.010 
what it does in the car we're on route
17<00:05:11.270> now<00:05:11.510> I'm<00:05:12.050> cruising<00:05:12.620> at<00:05:12.680> about<00:05:12.890> 55

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
17 now I'm cruising at about 55

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.680 
17 now I'm cruising at about 55
notice<00:05:16.020> that<00:05:16.170> the<00:05:16.580> yes<00:05:17.580> research<00:05:18.030> take<00:05:18.540> my

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
notice that the yes research take my

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.520 
notice that the yes research take my
foot<00:05:18.870> off<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.140> pedal

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
foot off the pedal

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.800 
foot off the pedal
he<00:05:19.890> goes<00:05:20.070> down<00:05:20.310> put<00:05:21.030> my<00:05:21.150> foot<00:05:21.360> on<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.630> pedal

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
he goes down put my foot on the pedal

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.140 
he goes down put my foot on the pedal
goes<00:05:22.080> back<00:05:22.320> up<00:05:22.500> again<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:23.490> then<00:05:23.670> it<00:05:23.760> clicks<00:05:24.030> it

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
goes back up again and then it clicks it

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.050 
goes back up again and then it clicks it
in<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:25.290> it's<00:05:25.680> doing<00:05:26.310> exactly<00:05:26.430> what<00:05:26.820> it's

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
in and it's doing exactly what it's

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.510 
in and it's doing exactly what it's
supposed<00:05:27.440> so<00:05:28.440> what<00:05:28.620> we<00:05:28.770> could<00:05:29.010> say<00:05:29.220> now<00:05:29.460> we

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
supposed so what we could say now we

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.060 
supposed so what we could say now we
fixed<00:05:30.000> the<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.570> whole<00:05:30.780> system<00:05:31.290> we've

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
fixed the the whole system we've

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.090 
fixed the the whole system we've
eliminated<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.730> 401<00:05:33.330> code<00:05:33.690> so<00:05:34.650> it's<00:05:34.860> legal

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
eliminated the 401 code so it's legal

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.510 
eliminated the 401 code so it's legal
and<00:05:35.520> we<00:05:36.300> know<00:05:36.450> everything<00:05:36.780> is<00:05:36.870> operating<00:05:37.520> so

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
and we know everything is operating so

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.330 
and we know everything is operating so
this<00:05:38.730> puts<00:05:38.970> me<00:05:39.150> back<00:05:39.330> in<00:05:39.390> a<00:05:39.570> good<00:05:39.750> movie<00:05:39.960> in<00:05:40.340> I'm

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
were coming up with a 401 code I'm gonna

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.860 
were coming up with a 401 code I'm gonna
put<00:06:05.660> on<00:06:05.810> right<00:06:06.050> now<00:06:06.199> the<00:06:06.259> engines<00:06:06.650> running

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
okay it's reading the computer right now

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.790 
okay it's reading the computer right now
takes<00:06:14.389> a<00:06:14.509> minute<00:06:14.750> or<00:06:14.810> two<00:06:14.990> it's<00:06:15.440> not<00:06:15.500> in<00:06:15.680> any
