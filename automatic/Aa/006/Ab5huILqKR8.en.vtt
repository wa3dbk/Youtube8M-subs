everything out it wasn't too heavy you
can<00:05:01.060> definitely<00:05:01.630> add<00:05:01.750> more<00:05:01.960> drops<00:05:02.169> to<00:05:02.260> get<00:05:02.380> a

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
can definitely add more drops to get a

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.840 
can definitely add more drops to get a
fuller<00:05:02.620> coverage<00:05:02.800> but<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.220> do<00:05:03.370> have<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.639> little

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
fuller coverage but I do have a little

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.100 
fuller coverage but I do have a little
bit<00:05:03.970> like<00:05:04.240> I've<00:05:04.360> got<00:05:04.510> this<00:05:04.690> cap<00:05:04.900> these

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.830 
bit like I've got this cap these
capillaries<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:06.389> always<00:05:07.389> seem<00:05:07.570> to<00:05:07.600> show

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
capillaries that always seem to show

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.210 
capillaries that always seem to show
through<00:05:08.050> no<00:05:08.139> matter<00:05:08.260> what<00:05:08.500> I<00:05:08.530> do<00:05:08.650> just<00:05:08.800> kind<00:05:09.100> of

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
through no matter what I do just kind of

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.159 
through no matter what I do just kind of
peeking<00:05:09.490> through<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.729> little<00:05:09.970> bit<00:05:10.120> but<00:05:11.050> it's

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
peeking through a little bit but it's

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.510 
peeking through a little bit but it's
basically<00:05:11.470> just<00:05:11.590> even<00:05:11.949> everything<00:05:12.160> out<00:05:12.370> and

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
basically just even everything out and

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.680 
basically just even everything out and
it<00:05:12.610> is<00:05:12.729> very<00:05:13.000> very<00:05:13.060> natural<00:05:13.900> in<00:05:14.080> skin<00:05:14.500> like<00:05:14.740> um

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
it is very very natural in skin like um

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.210 
it is very very natural in skin like um
but<00:05:16.690> I'm<00:05:16.870> probably<00:05:17.289> going<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.770> go<00:05:17.919> back<00:05:18.070> in

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.469 
but I'm probably going to go back in
with<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.400> little<00:05:18.520> bit<00:05:18.610> of<00:05:18.760> concealer<00:05:19.030> around<00:05:19.240> my

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479
