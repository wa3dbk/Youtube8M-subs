00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
basic quick videos of that duck so this

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.600 
basic quick videos of that duck so this
species<00:00:10.230> might<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.440> think<00:00:10.740> Danny's<00:00:11.070> ace<00:00:11.280> did

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
species might I think Danny's ace did

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.749 
species might I think Danny's ace did
one<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.090> i<00:00:12.980> think<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.040> rhyming<00:00:14.250> did<00:00:14.519> not<00:00:14.670> as

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
one and i think in rhyming did not as

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.680 
one and i think in rhyming did not as
well<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.199> figured<00:00:16.529> why<00:00:16.800> not<00:00:16.880> just<00:00:17.880> get<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.480> few

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
well so I figured why not just get a few

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.150 
well so I figured why not just get a few
more<00:00:18.840> videos<00:00:19.080> up<00:00:19.109> there<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.500> also<00:00:19.590> I've<00:00:19.890> had

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
more videos up there and also I've had

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.929 
more videos up there and also I've had
but<00:00:21.150> not<00:00:21.359> many<00:00:21.539> team<00:00:21.779> quests<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.730> get<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
but not many team quests and to get the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.849 
but not many team quests and to get the
sum<00:00:24.090> up<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.510> I'll<00:00:25.019> start<00:00:25.320> from<00:00:25.470> left<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> right

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
sum up so I'll start from left to right

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.769 
sum up so I'll start from left to right
as<00:00:26.130> everybody's<00:00:26.490> done<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.910> far<00:00:27.090> that's

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
as everybody's done so far that's

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929 
as everybody's done so far that's
obviously<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.619> finder<00:00:29.550> which<00:00:29.699> everybody

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
obviously the finder which everybody

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.209 
obviously the finder which everybody
knows<00:00:30.119> about<00:00:30.590> just<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> point<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:32.040> this

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
knows about just the point out this

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.250 
knows about just the point out this
video<00:00:32.460> might<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.940> little<00:00:33.120> choppy<00:00:33.510> because

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
video might be a little choppy because

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.709 
video might be a little choppy because
i'm<00:00:34.920> using<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.340> demo<00:00:35.550> application<00:00:36.030> when<00:00:36.600> it

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
i'm using a demo application when it

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.139 
i'm using a demo application when it
gives<00:00:36.899> me<00:00:37.020> 30<00:00:37.200> seconds<00:00:37.680> every<00:00:37.829> time<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.700> i'll

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
gives me 30 seconds every time so i'll

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.510 
gives me 30 seconds every time so i'll
try<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.660> patch<00:00:39.809> them<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.110> together<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:41.370> is

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
try and patch them all together this is

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.060 
try and patch them all together this is

it's thurs the different Sumner's
between<00:00:45.930> normal<00:00:46.379> dashboard<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.950> tire<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
between normal dashboard and tire and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.770 
between normal dashboard and tire and
the<00:00:47.489> dashboard<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.120> lap<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> doesn't<00:00:48.750> tell

which<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:56.130> think<00:02:56.400> cost<00:02:56.640> around<00:02:56.760> 1700<00:02:57.600> pounds<00:02:57.750> so

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
which I think cost around 1700 pounds so

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.720 
which I think cost around 1700 pounds so
that's<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.860> lot<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.040> money<00:02:59.280> so<00:02:59.370> I've<00:02:59.580> got<00:02:59.700> the

in<00:03:44.160> fact<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.880> think<00:03:45.630> it's<00:03:45.780> quite<00:03:46.019> good<00:03:46.200> for

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
in fact I think it's quite good for

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.770 
in fact I think it's quite good for
people<00:03:47.280> just<00:03:47.459> starting<00:03:47.730> up<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.239> new<00:03:48.269> command

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780

people just starting up a new command
study<00:03:49.050> either<00:03:49.530> youtube<00:03:50.040> or<00:03:50.220> making<00:03:50.430> videos

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
study either youtube or making videos

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.790 
study either youtube or making videos
etc<00:03:51.000> because<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.050> does<00:03:52.200> make<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:52.530> very<00:03:52.680> simple

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
etc because it does make it very simple

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.860 
etc because it does make it very simple
fair<00:03:53.340> enough<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.580> can't<00:03:53.820> do<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.690> most

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
fair enough you can't do the most

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.560 
fair enough you can't do the most
complex<00:03:55.290> things<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:55.830> you<00:03:55.920> can<00:03:56.100> do<00:03:56.360> enough<00:03:57.360> to

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
complex things but you can do enough to

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.090 
complex things but you can do enough to
make<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> quick<00:03:57.989> family<00:03:58.290> video<00:03:58.739> which<00:03:59.070> is

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
that i'll save it it's just a quick way

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.340 
that i'll save it it's just a quick way
of<00:04:16.140> basic<00:04:16.890> giving<00:04:17.220> keeping<00:04:18.000> notes<00:04:18.350> because

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
of basic giving keeping notes because

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.400 
of basic giving keeping notes because
you<00:04:19.830> can<00:04:20.010> use<00:04:20.160> your<00:04:20.310> dashboard<00:04:21.200> widget<00:04:22.200> notes

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
you can use your dashboard widget notes

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.050 
you can use your dashboard widget notes
but<00:04:22.680> they<00:04:22.770> don't<00:04:22.950> really<00:04:23.160> fit<00:04:23.340> much<00:04:23.550> text<00:04:23.940> on

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
but they don't really fit much text on

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.340 
but they don't really fit much text on
so<00:04:24.600> how<00:04:24.720> their<00:04:24.960> staff<00:04:25.140> just<00:04:25.470> for<00:04:25.590> quick<00:04:25.770> access

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
so how their staff just for quick access

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.860 
so how their staff just for quick access
if<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.490> remember<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.330> think<00:04:28.570> it<00:04:28.690> was<00:04:28.780> around

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
if you remember I think it was around

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.330 
if you remember I think it was around
about<00:04:29.170> we<00:04:29.440> can<00:04:29.590> have<00:04:29.740> two<00:04:29.920> weeks<00:04:30.130> ago<00:04:30.310> i

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
about we can have two weeks ago i

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.850 
about we can have two weeks ago i
unboxed<00:04:31.090> Microsoft<00:04:31.960> Word<00:04:32.140> so<00:04:32.470> that's<00:04:32.620> this

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
unboxed Microsoft Word so that's this

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.760 
unboxed Microsoft Word so that's this
then<00:04:33.340> this<00:04:33.970> is<00:04:34.150> Microsoft<00:04:34.600> Excel<00:04:35.140> for<00:04:35.560> all

these spreadsheets and things and this

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.600 
these spreadsheets and things and this
right<00:04:38.020> here<00:04:38.050> is<00:04:38.230> called<00:04:38.380> screening<00:04:39.100> this<00:04:39.460> is

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
right here is called screening this is

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.600 
right here is called screening this is
