Series<00:00:14.900> 3<00:00:15.260> Palmer<00:00:15.770> figure<00:00:16.100> people<00:00:16.580> have

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
Series 3 Palmer figure people have

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.279 
Series 3 Palmer figure people have
wanted<00:00:16.910> a<00:00:16.970> Palmer<00:00:17.300> figure<00:00:17.510> for<00:00:17.720> a<00:00:17.750> really<00:00:18.140> long

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
wanted a Palmer figure for a really long

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.370 
wanted a Palmer figure for a really long
time<00:00:18.350> and<00:00:18.949> now<00:00:19.610> we<00:00:19.670> finally<00:00:20.240> kind<00:00:20.570> of<00:00:20.869> have<00:00:21.109> one

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
time and now we finally kind of have one

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.189 
time and now we finally kind of have one
and<00:00:21.590> I<00:00:22.010> say<00:00:22.190> kind<00:00:22.490> of<00:00:22.609> because<00:00:22.940> it<00:00:23.210> is<00:00:23.390> just<00:00:23.779> the

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
and I say kind of because it is just the

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.409 
and I say kind of because it is just the
Scout<00:00:24.589> that's<00:00:24.919> been<00:00:25.099> repainted<00:00:25.609> to<00:00:26.000> look<00:00:26.240> like

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
Scout that's been repainted to look like

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.560 
Scout that's been repainted to look like
Palmer<00:00:26.869> it's<00:00:27.410> not<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.980> actual<00:00:28.449> sculpt<00:00:29.449> of

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
Palmer it's not the actual sculpt of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.630 
Palmer it's not the actual sculpt of
Palmer<00:00:30.439> doesn't<00:00:30.890> look<00:00:31.039> like<00:00:31.189> a<00:00:31.220> girl<00:00:31.490> it<00:00:31.609> looks

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
Palmer doesn't look like a girl it looks

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.220 
Palmer doesn't look like a girl it looks
like<00:00:31.849> a<00:00:31.880> guy<00:00:32.150> so<00:00:32.840> that's<00:00:32.990> a<00:00:33.079> little

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
like a guy so that's a little

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.900 
like a guy so that's a little
disappointing<00:00:33.920> but<00:00:34.100> at<00:00:34.160> least<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:34.730> is

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
disappointing but at least it is

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.030 
disappointing but at least it is
technically<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:35.660> Palmer<00:00:36.140> figure<00:00:36.440> based<00:00:36.710> on<00:00:36.890> the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
technically a Palmer figure based on the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.800 
technically a Palmer figure based on the
name<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:38.060> official<00:00:38.450> release

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
name and the official release

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.720 
name and the official release
information<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:39.740> that's<00:00:39.950> good<00:00:40.280> enough<00:00:40.310> I

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
information so that's good enough I

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.200 
information so that's good enough I
guess<00:00:40.970> to<00:00:41.960> add<00:00:42.110> her<00:00:42.290> to<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.470> collection<00:00:43.010> she

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
guess to add her to the collection she

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.490 
guess to add her to the collection she
stands<00:00:44.210> as<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:44.570> would<00:00:44.690> expect<00:00:45.020> just<00:00:45.080> like<00:00:45.320> all

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
stands as you would expect just like all

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.590 
stands as you would expect just like all
the<00:00:45.680> other<00:00:45.860> Spartans<00:00:46.430> about<00:00:46.910> thirteen<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.510> a

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
the other Spartans about thirteen and a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.160 
the other Spartans about thirteen and a
half<00:00:47.630> centimeters<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.740> about<00:00:49.660> five<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.020> a

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
half centimeters and about five and a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.580 
half centimeters and about five and a
quarter<00:00:51.530> inches<00:00:52.810> she<00:00:53.810> does<00:00:53.990> have<00:00:54.170> obviously

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
quarter inches she does have obviously

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.380 
quarter inches she does have obviously
the<00:00:54.770> unique<00:00:55.130> paint<00:00:55.430> scheme<00:00:55.760> which<00:00:56.000> does<00:00:56.240> look

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
the unique paint scheme which does look

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.240 
the unique paint scheme which does look
pretty<00:00:56.540> good<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:57.050> lot<00:00:57.620> of<00:00:57.770> times<00:00:57.950> with<00:00:58.160> the

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
pretty good a lot of times with the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.400 
pretty good a lot of times with the
white<00:00:58.490> or<00:00:58.790> light<00:00:59.060> colored<00:00:59.090> figures<00:01:00.080> you<00:01:00.260> end

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
white or light colored figures you end

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.410 
white or light colored figures you end
up<00:01:00.530> with<00:01:00.680> like<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.950> dirty<00:01:01.280> look<00:01:01.550> rather<00:01:01.880> than<00:01:02.060> a

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
up with like a dirty look rather than a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.719 
up with like a dirty look rather than a
battle<00:01:02.810> damage<00:01:03.080> look<00:01:03.440> this<00:01:03.980> one<00:01:04.280> while<00:01:04.580> it's

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
battle damage look this one while it's

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.640 
battle damage look this one while it's
not<00:01:04.879> perfect<00:01:05.479> it<00:01:05.659> looks<00:01:05.720> pretty<00:01:06.140> darn<00:01:06.409> good

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
not perfect it looks pretty darn good

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.740 
not perfect it looks pretty darn good
and<00:01:06.890> basically<00:01:07.520> all<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.850> panel<00:01:08.210> lining<00:01:08.540> is

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
and basically all the panel lining is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.319 
and basically all the panel lining is
lined<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:10.549> helps<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.909> figures<00:01:11.180> stand

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
lined so that helps the figures stand

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:12.429 
lined so that helps the figures stand
out<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:11.659> then<00:01:11.749> we<00:01:11.840> have<00:01:11.960> a<00:01:11.990> lot<00:01:12.170> of<00:01:12.200> these

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
out and then we have a lot of these

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.319 
out and then we have a lot of these
green<00:01:12.770> accents<00:01:13.549> these<00:01:13.729> really<00:01:13.999> dark<00:01:14.270> green

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
and then a lot of all the red accents

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.130 
and then a lot of all the red accents
that<00:01:16.909> she's<00:01:17.060> supposed<00:01:17.299> to<00:01:17.390> have<00:01:17.450> too<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.049> it

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
that she's supposed to have too so it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.959 
that she's supposed to have too so it

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.789 
looks really nice I'm happy to have it
each<00:01:20.299> of<00:01:20.539> her<00:01:20.689> weapons<00:01:21.020> comes<00:01:21.259> with<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.439> weapons

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
each of her weapons comes with a weapons

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.709 
each of her weapons comes with a weapons
peg<00:01:22.039> and<00:01:22.159> as<00:01:22.280> you<00:01:22.399> can<00:01:22.490> see<00:01:22.729> there<00:01:22.909> are<00:01:23.090> egg

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
peg and as you can see there are egg

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.599 
peg and as you can see there are egg
holes<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.140> there<00:01:24.380> there<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.039> peg<00:01:25.280> hole<00:01:25.460> in

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:25.609 
holes in there there is a peg hole in

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:26.709 
holes in there there is a peg hole in
the<00:01:25.729> back<00:01:25.909> just<00:01:26.210> like<00:01:26.270> all<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.600> other

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
the back just like all the other

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.779 
the back just like all the other
Spartans<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:27.649> she<00:01:28.039> comes<00:01:28.280> with<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.609> dual

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
Spartans and she comes with the dual

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.630 
Spartans and she comes with the dual
pistols<00:01:29.799> which<00:01:30.799> is<00:01:31.069> a<00:01:31.100> good<00:01:31.340> thing<00:01:31.369> I<00:01:31.579> guess

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
pistols which is a good thing I guess

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.730 
pistols which is a good thing I guess
they<00:01:32.390> don't<00:01:32.479> really<00:01:32.659> have<00:01:32.869> any<00:01:32.929> paint<00:01:33.350> detail

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
they don't really have any paint detail

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.260 
they don't really have any paint detail
on<00:01:33.950> them<00:01:34.219> there's<00:01:34.490> kind<00:01:34.789> of<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:34.969> metallic

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
on them there's kind of a metallic

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.020 
on them there's kind of a metallic
silver<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.920> she<00:01:37.460> doesn't<00:01:37.609> have<00:01:37.700> trigger

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
silver and she doesn't have trigger

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.300 
silver and she doesn't have trigger
finger<00:01:38.420> hands<00:01:38.810> so<00:01:39.439> you<00:01:39.590> have<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.829> really<00:01:40.100> pry

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
finger hands so you have to really pry

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.800 
finger hands so you have to really pry
the<00:01:40.369> hand<00:01:40.700> open<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.149> then<00:01:41.270> get<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.630> gun<00:01:41.780> in

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
the hand open and then get the gun in

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.929 
the hand open and then get the gun in
there<00:01:42.139> as<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.710> can<00:01:42.829> see<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.340> trigger<00:01:43.670> is

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
there as you can see that trigger is

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.419 
there as you can see that trigger is
starting<00:01:44.329> to<00:01:44.420> flex<00:01:44.719> and<00:01:44.990> break<00:01:45.499> and<00:01:45.799> then<00:01:46.340> this

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
starting to flex and break and then this

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.219 
starting to flex and break and then this
one<00:01:46.670> broke<00:01:46.999> as<00:01:47.240> soon<00:01:47.420> as<00:01:47.569> I<00:01:47.659> tried<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.899> put<00:01:48.139> the

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
one broke as soon as I tried to put the

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.719 
one broke as soon as I tried to put the
hand<00:01:48.409> in<00:01:48.560> there<00:01:48.679> even<00:01:49.009> though<00:01:49.130> I<00:01:49.159> pried<00:01:49.490> the

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
hand in there even though I pried the

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.760 
hand in there even though I pried the
fingers<00:01:50.030> open<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:50.689> either<00:01:50.899> expect<00:01:51.469> to<00:01:51.590> not

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
fingers open so either expect to not

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.469 
fingers open so either expect to not
hold<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.130> weapons<00:01:52.459> or<00:01:52.639> expect<00:01:52.969> your<00:01:53.119> triggers

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
hold the weapons or expect your triggers

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.300 
hold the weapons or expect your triggers
to<00:01:54.200> break<00:01:54.939> so<00:01:55.939> that's<00:01:56.740> interesting<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:58.100> guess

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
to break so that's interesting I guess

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.129 
to break so that's interesting I guess
we<00:01:58.909> still<00:01:58.939> don't<00:01:59.209> get<00:01:59.299> trigger<00:01:59.509> fingers<00:01:59.899> that

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
we still don't get trigger fingers that

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.679 
we still don't get trigger fingers that
would<00:02:00.319> be<00:02:00.439> a<00:02:00.469> big<00:02:00.799> benefit<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.579> have<00:02:02.270> trigger

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
would be a big benefit to have trigger

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.029 
would be a big benefit to have trigger
fingers<00:02:03.079> but<00:02:03.409> whatever

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
fingers but whatever

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:05.769 
fingers but whatever
as<00:02:04.310> far<00:02:04.490> as<00:02:04.520> articulation<00:02:05.179> goes<00:02:05.359> the<00:02:05.509> head<00:02:05.659> is

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:05.779 
as far as articulation goes the head is

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:07.149 
as far as articulation goes the head is
on<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.899> double<00:02:06.229> ball<00:02:06.380> peg<00:02:06.619> so<00:02:06.799> you<00:02:06.859> can<00:02:07.009> get

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
on a double ball peg so you can get

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.430 
on a double ball peg so you can get
pretty<00:02:07.579> good<00:02:07.759> range<00:02:07.939> of<00:02:08.060> motion<00:02:08.240> really<00:02:09.229> no

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
pretty good range of motion really no

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.809 
pretty good range of motion really no
trouble<00:02:09.770> at<00:02:09.860> all<00:02:09.950> posing<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:10.520> figure

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
trouble at all posing this figure

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.360 
trouble at all posing this figure
shoulders<00:02:11.720> go<00:02:12.290> out<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.650> far<00:02:12.950> because<00:02:13.069> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
shoulders go out that far because the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.440 
shoulders go out that far because the
armor<00:02:13.610> gets<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:13.940> way<00:02:14.060> they<00:02:14.180> don't<00:02:14.270> go<00:02:14.420> down

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
armor gets in the way they don't go down

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.660 
armor gets in the way they don't go down
very<00:02:14.840> far<00:02:15.140> either<00:02:15.409> but<00:02:15.799> you<00:02:15.950> can<00:02:16.069> probably<00:02:16.310> put

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
very far either but you can probably put

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.119 
very far either but you can probably put
them<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.879> a<00:02:16.909> combat<00:02:17.360> pose<00:02:17.659> with<00:02:18.349> very<00:02:18.920> little

them in a combat pose with very little

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.620 
them in a combat pose with very little
issue<00:02:19.580> shouldn't

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
issue shouldn't

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.870 
issue shouldn't
be<00:02:20.720> able<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.960> pose<00:02:21.140> her<00:02:21.380> or<00:02:22.160> shouldn't<00:02:22.430> be<00:02:22.610> able

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
be able to pose her or shouldn't be able

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.760 
be able to pose her or shouldn't be able
to<00:02:23.380> Wow

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
to Wow

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.200 
to Wow
you<00:02:24.890> shouldn't<00:02:25.220> have<00:02:25.370> too<00:02:25.610> much<00:02:25.790> trouble

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
you shouldn't have too much trouble

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.470 
you shouldn't have too much trouble
being<00:02:26.450> able<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:27.080> pose<00:02:27.320> this<00:02:27.620> figure<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:29.360> with

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
being able to pose this figure so with

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.330 
being able to pose this figure so with
the<00:02:29.600> ratcheted<00:02:29.990> shoulder<00:02:30.410> no<00:02:30.800> swivel<00:02:31.160> in<00:02:31.250> the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
the ratcheted shoulder no swivel in the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.310 
the ratcheted shoulder no swivel in the
bicep<00:02:31.730> here<00:02:31.970> we<00:02:32.060> get<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.330> swivel<00:02:32.570> down<00:02:32.900> here

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
bicep here we get the swivel down here

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.340 
bicep here we get the swivel down here
in<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.680> forearm<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.960> actually<00:02:35.960> now<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.170> I'm

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
in the forearm and actually now that I'm

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.380 
in the forearm and actually now that I'm
looking<00:02:36.500> at<00:02:36.830> it<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.190> don't<00:02:37.460> remember<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:38.060> Scout

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
looking at it I don't remember the Scout

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.050 
looking at it I don't remember the Scout
having<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.680> hinge<00:02:39.980> in<00:02:40.160> there<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.550> remember<00:02:40.970> it

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
having that hinge in there I remember it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.840 
having that hinge in there I remember it
being<00:02:41.240> built<00:02:41.540> like<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:42.310> which<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.490> slightly

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
being built like this which is slightly

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.460 
being built like this which is slightly
different<00:02:44.210> so<00:02:44.420> I'm<00:02:44.630> gonna<00:02:44.840> have<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.230> pull<00:02:45.410> out

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
different so I'm gonna have to pull out

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.910 
different so I'm gonna have to pull out
the<00:02:45.650> scout<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.190> compare<00:02:47.260> okay<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:48.440> I<00:02:48.590> got<00:02:48.800> this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
the scout and compare okay so I got this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.770 
the scout and compare okay so I got this
got<00:02:49.130> out<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.790> was<00:02:49.940> wrong<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.480> built<00:02:50.720> like

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
got out and I was wrong it is built like

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.380 
got out and I was wrong it is built like
that<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.530> exactly<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.310> same<00:02:52.820> mold<00:02:53.120> as

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
that so it is exactly the same mold as

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.660 
that so it is exactly the same mold as
before<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.050> Palmer<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.650> now<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.800> guy<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:55.490> most

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
before so Palmer is now a guy but most

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.010 
before so Palmer is now a guy but most
people<00:02:55.910> didn't<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.210> her<00:02:56.360> anyway<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:56.870> guess

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
people didn't like her anyway so I guess

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.660 
people didn't like her anyway so I guess
that's<00:02:57.230> okay<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:57.650> we<00:02:57.800> have<00:02:57.890> our<00:02:57.980> bicep<00:02:58.370> swivel

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
that's okay so we have our bicep swivel

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.390 
that's okay so we have our bicep swivel
in<00:02:58.820> here<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.330> we<00:03:00.080> have<00:03:00.380> our<00:03:00.620> ratcheting<00:03:00.860> hinge

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
in here and we have our ratcheting hinge

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.190 
in here and we have our ratcheting hinge
right<00:03:01.610> there<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.270> we<00:03:02.450> should<00:03:02.690> also<00:03:02.840> get<00:03:03.140> a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
right there and we should also get a

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.860 
right there and we should also get a
forearm<00:03:03.530> swivel<00:03:04.220> out<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:05.030> end<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:05.720> that's

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
forearm swivel out of that end so that's

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.290 
forearm swivel out of that end so that's
pretty<00:03:06.170> nice<00:03:06.410> we<00:03:07.160> have<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.340> ball<00:03:07.820> hinge<00:03:08.060> at<00:03:08.210> the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
pretty nice we have a ball hinge at the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.390 
pretty nice we have a ball hinge at the
wrist<00:03:08.480> also<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.020> we<00:03:09.140> have<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.440> hinge<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.100> then

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
wrist also so we have the hinge and then

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.580 
wrist also so we have the hinge and then
it<00:03:10.520> will<00:03:10.640> swivel<00:03:10.910> at<00:03:11.240> the<00:03:11.360> forearm<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.170> at<00:03:12.410> the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
it will swivel at the forearm and at the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.230 
it will swivel at the forearm and at the
hand<00:03:12.830> so<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.130> can<00:03:13.160> pretty<00:03:13.430> much<00:03:13.520> put<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.000> hand

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
hand so you can pretty much put the hand

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.720 
hand so you can pretty much put the hand
however<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:15.140> want<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.590> impose<00:03:16.100> these<00:03:16.310> figures

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
however you want to impose these figures

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.820 
however you want to impose these figures
really<00:03:17.270> well<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.510> still<00:03:17.930> say<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.380> I<00:03:18.440> said<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.740> in

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
really well I still say and I said it in

for<00:03:57.500> me<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.680> prove<00:03:57.890> that<00:03:58.130> without<00:03:58.820> pulling<00:03:59.150> it

off<00:03:59.480> so<00:03:59.780> you<00:03:59.810> really<00:04:00.170> just<00:04:00.200> get<00:04:00.560> this<00:04:00.800> swivel

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
off so you really just get this swivel

off so you really just get this swivel
which<00:04:02.060> isn't<00:04:02.480> very<00:04:02.660> good<00:04:02.750> that's<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.890> only

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
which isn't very good that's the only

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.490 
which isn't very good that's the only

what<00:04:06.920> happened<00:04:07.400> there

well<00:04:08.690> that's<00:04:08.870> kind<00:04:09.110> of<00:04:09.140> a<00:04:09.260> bummer<00:04:09.770> anyway<00:04:10.550> we

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
well that's kind of a bummer anyway we

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.670

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
pose the figure a little bit but if you

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.170 
pose the figure a little bit but if you
rotate<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.430> ankle<00:04:31.430> around<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:31.880> can<00:04:32.030> give

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
rotate the ankle around you can give

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.060
