 short sent 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.510
 which arrive at it will be a signal 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.520
 needed to call 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.010
 fast number 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.810
 also there are trilogy that serve to 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.050
 interrupts after a crash if you are more likely 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.350
 just go 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.600
 there was no time 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.680
 permanent smash 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.230
 this signal is a few signal 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.330
 necessary to call 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.330

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.740
 changed to red dust from h 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.260
 any charging mode 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.089
 but here we go 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:09.859
 power bus 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.489

 here is another contact there was not enough 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.639
 contact in this already 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.790
 this signal appeared 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.249
 eventually played done 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:38.129
 casting 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.509
 that is, with each arming 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:44.169
 alarm that one car issues 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:45.669
 signal 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.069
 will this come from this 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.889
 screen cleaning acting 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.239
 there were no outsiders a signal that may 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.039
 impede committed trimmed 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:59.039
 to 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.609
 data fraud means we have 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.099
 the reason for the management of skolkovo means here 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.059
 three wires 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:10.739
 the first 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.980
 reds gives someone a manager plus 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.299
 the fire

 when serving short 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.489
 positive signal to it 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.489
 triggered 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.359
 in management closes the coca 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.129
 quick call we can like this 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.129
 happens 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:34.129
 to km zone 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.699
 briefly 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.989
 did not work the second attempt 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.619
 at the heart of years 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:43.689

 we are bad for not seeing the screen 

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.729
 highlight 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.819
 Well, in general, it is 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.609
 plus ooo management 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.709
 this 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.439
 created for 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.439
 besides the price we have the system leads 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.659
 plus fire about the father 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.610
 nominally automobile when earns 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.360
 siren 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.540
 will be the final 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.879
 call on mobile phone 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.599

 blue tones 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.009
 same negative 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.360
 polarity 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.550
 plus he does not react leagues 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.889
 short calls too 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.340

 yaki said green green it 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.759
 governing negative 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.340
 polarity 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.340
 as a ram 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.030
 spurs inspire how everything works that 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.029
 again 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:10.029
 my telephone 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:15.009
 to which this system is configured 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.879
 to this number 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.389
 so shows on the plus here is a short 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.639
 short term 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.639
 positive target signal 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.960
 generally keep quiet 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.960
 went and hall 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.870
 used her 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:46.809
 m 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:49.809
 but 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.180
 so far only 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.879
 her 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.879
 square 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:05.069
 if you hold nominations to London 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:06.939
 will turn off that is 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.270
 not just like that 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.990
 red phone button green 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.729
 signal 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.439
 Well, since everything and him let's check more 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:16.449
 in negative polarity checked 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.680
 positively 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.680
 check negatively 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:26.809
 listen there should be a click 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.749
 in training glasses 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:32.630
 you can do this 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.710
 same cheap done 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.270
 listening 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.270
 when touched, a click appears 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.639
 not leading a call 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.639
 also this thing cooked there is a breaker 

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:53.969
 vyshgorod hide 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:56.259
 breaker i.e. if 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.930
 hold it will not be one 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.779
 short press of a button 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:02.339
 so to say failure 

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.509
 a series of intermittent 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:07.509
 checking out 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.740
 the second 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.110
 rare 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.110
 the fourth one that is from the first 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:21.319

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:29.839
 share of lukoil sq 

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:35.389
 all mountain is this 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:36.879
 red 

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:38.880
 percent manager 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.420
 Senyavina with managing borrowed 

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.790
 screen cleaning 

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.999
 when setting 

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:47.999
 we have a man's alarm 

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:51.749
 such a system 

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:52.490
 here 

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.589
 a plus 

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:55.270
 load is shown 

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.389
 nutrition 

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:00.099
 and minus 

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:00.779
 that's all
