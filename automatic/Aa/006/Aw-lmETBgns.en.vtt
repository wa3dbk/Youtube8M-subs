00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.670

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.250
 we see ourselves ensuring quite reliable 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:38.280
 of resistance to the producer we see here 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.280
 a little guide of what you have 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.280
 characteristics 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.690
 let's proceed to a boxing 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:06.530
 as always by brands 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.470
 well protected with a foam 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.760

 the mouse that is with gold-plated cable 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.440
 with a braided cable that improves 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.240
 quite connectivity and now 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.259
 we will talk more about mouse we continue with the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.259
 contents of the box 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.579
 pretty fast user 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.499
 that tells us about the software that we can 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.829
 install on our computer to 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:49.450
 better access to button commands 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.450
 of the mouse we see the guarantee 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.310
 with the players 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.230
 laws 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.860
 we'll see 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.160
 here comes with accessories that come 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.160
 To be 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.599
 some types of stock 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.319
 types of sides and now you 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.100
 we will teach 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.600
 we go with the mouse we teach well 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.600
 they have many buttons 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.569
 has to be exact 15 buttons 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.700
 let's teach you well the 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.700
 characteristics we remove the paper 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.650
 it is a mouse that as its own name 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.640
 indicates 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.880
 m7 is indicated above all for games 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.330
 Mo style 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.780
 comes with preconfigured profiles of 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.780
 world of warcraft 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.890
 and it is ideal for all this type of games 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:03.970
 we see that it has a button here 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.160
 which squeeze and masters with the thumb 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.450
 as with all of this 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.460
 lateral that are here a button here another 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.850
 here the most that are the classics of 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:19.180
 navigation and here we see as a small 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.930
 analog that has five buttons the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.020
 middle button left right up and 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.820
 below we see here this buttons for 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.940
 select the profiles that 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.700
 we configure 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.370
 this button also to forgive this 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.680
 separate profiles that we signed this is 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.510
 the country level and these two keys are 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.160
 totally customizable through the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.910
 software provided by matt capps 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.870
 for results we see also 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.510
 that has a small tab here with 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.819
 which we can change the healed 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.519
 come 3 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.400
 and what they differ in is these two 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.340
 the difference is touch one is mate and 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.100
 smooth and the other comes with a rough rubber 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.130
 to improve grip 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:12.050
 and this is the characteristic is that it is 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.050
 higher as we can see well 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.290
 we will put the one that is higher so that 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.050
 you see well 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.890
 it's very is very simple to put 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.890
 just from behind 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.900
 it counted and we can regulate 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.080
 the height we put the formula from 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.080
 here 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.039
 everything is totally 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.030
 this side of here we can also 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:45.259
 configure we simply have here the 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.259
 utensil to remove it 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:01.200
 comes with 15 buttons in total 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:04.580
 and we can put these edges just like that 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:09.909
 it would be normal if it comes with one 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.909
 that gives us support for the little finger 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.389
 what would it be to put it here 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.930
 very complete 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.270
 here also a wheel 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.840
 the base is aluminum what 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.870
 It provides much much much 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.370
 resistance to shock and to 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.699
 goatherds that we can suffer many 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.699
 gamers 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.979
 and also with a system of weights the 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.979
 which we access from behind 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.840
 we will show you the mouse 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.840
 we will also 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.060
 the rope of 2 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:15.050
 It is very easy to use a nut 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.050
 screw 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.490
 the utensil 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:39.669
 the sensor the sensor is a laser sensor 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:42.669
 that goes from 20 and if I'm not wrong to 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.669
 6400 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.680
 we saved very attractive matt 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:58.920

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:01.710
