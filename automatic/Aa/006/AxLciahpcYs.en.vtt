idea to have just solely one type on a
pokemon<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.750> know<00:02:00.840> magmar<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.409> learn

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
pokemon like I know magmar can learn

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.410 
pokemon like I know magmar can learn
like<00:02:01.710> Thunder<00:02:02.040> punch<00:02:02.219> or<00:02:02.700> psychic<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.299> some

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
like Thunder punch or psychic or some

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.120 
like Thunder punch or psychic or some
other<00:02:03.509> shit<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.140> see<00:02:04.350> he<00:02:04.799> only<00:02:04.950> has

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
other shit but as you see he only has

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.280 
other shit but as you see he only has
fire<00:02:05.340> type<00:02:05.610> moves<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.329> when<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.479> use<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
fire type moves so when you use the the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.080 
fire type moves so when you use the the
flamethrower<00:02:07.740> my<00:02:07.920> chandeliers<00:02:08.459> flash<00:02:08.700> flash

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
flamethrower my chandeliers flash flash

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.760 
flamethrower my chandeliers flash flash
fire<00:02:09.450> got<00:02:09.840> 20<00:02:10.229> ash

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
fire got 20 ash

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.800 
fire got 20 ash
so<00:02:11.370> he<00:02:11.490> can't<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.910> anything<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.270> my<00:02:12.360> chandelure

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
so he can't do anything to my chandelure

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.650 
so he can't do anything to my chandelure
