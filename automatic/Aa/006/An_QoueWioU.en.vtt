under practiced and very few players
realize<00:00:21.330> how<00:00:21.660> important<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.560> return<00:00:22.920> serve

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
realize how important the return serve

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.820 
realize how important the return serve

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
actually is when was the last time you

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.890 
actually is when was the last time you
went<00:00:26.010> out<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> court<00:00:26.670> specifically<00:00:27.330> to

players<00:00:30.150> practice<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> serve<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.740> some

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
players practice the serve but for some

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.010 
players practice the serve but for some
reason<00:00:32.279> very<00:00:32.460> few<00:00:32.730> players<00:00:32.969> practice<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
reason very few players practice the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.620

call the ultimate return key what is the
ultimate<00:00:58.320> return<00:00:58.980> key<00:00:59.280> returns<00:01:00.180> are<00:01:00.449> all

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
ultimate return key returns are all

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.560 
ultimate return key returns are all
about<00:01:00.899> depth<00:01:01.289> okay<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.190> about<00:01:02.430> power<00:01:02.730> depth

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
about depth okay not about power depth

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.870 
about depth okay not about power depth
is<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:04.320> what's<00:01:04.500> crucial<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.729> get

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
is really what's crucial if you can get

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240 
is really what's crucial if you can get
that<00:01:06.060> ball<00:01:06.330> close<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.260> baseline<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that ball close to the baseline here it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.750 
that ball close to the baseline here it
does<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:08.880> matter<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:10.020> speed<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:11.280> hit<00:01:11.580> that

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
does not matter what speed you hit that

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.969 
does not matter what speed you hit that
return<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.600> okay<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.860> that

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
return with okay if you can get that

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
return with okay if you can get that
ball<00:01:14.189> deep<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:15.060> are<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:15.750> least

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
ball deep you are going to at least

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.219 
ball deep you are going to at least
start<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> point<00:01:17.189> off<00:01:17.600> neutral<00:01:18.600> okay<00:01:18.990> most

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
start the point off neutral okay most

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.780 
start the point off neutral okay most
likely<00:01:19.680> you're<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.250> able<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.549> hit<00:01:20.700> an

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
likely you're going to be able to hit an

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.120 
likely you're going to be able to hit an
offensive<00:01:21.270> shot<00:01:21.330> even<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.470> hit<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> slow

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
offensive shot even if you hit a slow

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.700 
offensive shot even if you hit a slow
return<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> lands<00:01:24.390> really<00:01:24.869> deep<00:01:25.080> most

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
return but if it lands really deep most

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.350 
return but if it lands really deep most
likely<00:01:26.189> afterwards<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.970> hit<00:01:27.119> an

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
likely afterwards you can hit an

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
likely afterwards you can hit an
offensive<00:01:27.900> shot<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.189> all<00:01:29.310> about<00:01:29.340> depth

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
offensive shot so it's all about depth

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.219 
offensive shot so it's all about depth
now<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> watch<00:01:30.450> some<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> best

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.690 
it's all about depth now how do you get
depth<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.630> return<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.140> serve<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:47.100> may

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
depth on your return of serve you may

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.609 
depth on your return of serve you may
have<00:01:47.909> heard<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.570> short<00:01:48.869> backswing<00:01:49.439> on

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
have heard about the short backswing on

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.679 
have heard about the short backswing on
the<00:01:49.710> return<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> serve<00:01:50.430> okay<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.450> don't

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the return of serve okay so you don't

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.030 
the return of serve okay so you don't
want<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> take<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> huge<00:01:52.380> backswing<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> want

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
want to take a huge backswing you want

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.139 
want to take a huge backswing you want
to<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> short<00:01:53.460> backswing<00:01:53.939> you've

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
to have a short backswing you've

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.700 
to have a short backswing you've
probably<00:01:54.329> heard<00:01:54.570> about<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.560> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
probably heard about that and that is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.219 
probably heard about that and that is
correct<00:01:55.890> okay<00:01:56.630> but<00:01:57.630> that's<00:01:57.780> not<00:01:57.960> going<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
correct okay but that's not going to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.200 
correct okay but that's not going to
give<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.439> depth<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.670> maybe<00:01:59.909> have

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
give you depth and then you maybe have

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.819 
give you depth and then you maybe have
also<00:02:00.390> heard<00:02:00.750> about<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:01.200> concept<00:02:01.710> of

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
also heard about this concept of

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.370 
also heard about this concept of
blocking<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.460> return<00:02:02.939> okay<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
blocking the return okay so so if it's a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.109 
blocking the return okay so so if it's a
block<00:02:04.590> then<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.860> looks<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.490> okay<00:02:05.909> and

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
block then it looks like this okay and

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.600 
block then it looks like this okay and
that's<00:02:06.509> actually<00:02:07.049> not<00:02:07.259> correct<00:02:07.610> unless

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
that's actually not correct unless

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.940 
that's actually not correct unless
you're<00:02:08.970> returning<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.660> super<00:02:10.170> fast<00:02:10.410> serve<00:02:10.709> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you're returning a super fast serve to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.490 
you're returning a super fast serve to
the<00:02:11.039> body<00:02:11.450> but<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.750> all

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
the body but for all

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.920 
the body but for all
all<00:02:13.680> returns<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:14.820> not<00:02:15.030> correct<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.570> if

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
all returns that is not correct and if

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.930 
all returns that is not correct and if
you<00:02:16.020> try<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.260> block<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.920> return<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:17.640> you're

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
you try to block the return then you're

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.150 
you try to block the return then you're
not<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.630> get<00:02:18.750> depth<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.470> your<00:02:19.740> returns

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
not going to get depth on your returns

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.300 
not going to get depth on your returns
so<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.150> real<00:02:21.360> key<00:02:21.660> here<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.740> long

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
so the real key here is to have a long

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.210 
so the real key here is to have a long
and<00:02:23.670> high<00:02:24.380> follow-through<00:02:25.380> okay<00:02:25.890> what<00:02:26.130> does

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
and high follow-through okay what does

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.250 
and high follow-through okay what does
that<00:02:26.430> mean<00:02:26.610> if<00:02:26.940> I'm<00:02:27.060> standing<00:02:27.300> here<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.810> return

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
that mean if I'm standing here to return

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.340 
that mean if I'm standing here to return
okay<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:28.770> go<00:02:29.040> into<00:02:29.190> my<00:02:29.400> split<00:02:29.820> step<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.420> turn<00:02:31.020> and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
okay I go into my split step I turn and

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.070 
okay I go into my split step I turn and
now<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.340> go<00:02:32.850> for<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> long<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.870> high

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
now I go for a long and high

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.350 
now I go for a long and high
follow-through<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:34.740> swing<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.310> racket<00:02:35.580> way

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
follow-through I swing that racket way

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.660 
follow-through I swing that racket way
out<00:02:36.600> here<00:02:37.140> okay<00:02:37.740> way<00:02:37.950> out<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.280> front<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.610> the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
out here okay way out in front of the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.420 
out here okay way out in front of the
body<00:02:38.850> towards<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.480> target<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:40.170> then<00:02:40.800> way<00:02:41.400> up

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
body towards the target and then way up

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.220 
body towards the target and then way up
like<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.480> forehand<00:02:42.870> side<00:02:43.110> I'm

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
like this and on the forehand side I'm

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.590 
like this and on the forehand side I'm
going<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.440> catch<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.710> right<00:02:44.100> here<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.520> long<00:02:45.240> and

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
going to catch it right here a long and

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.540 
going to catch it right here a long and
high<00:02:45.959> follow-through<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:46.830> will<00:02:47.190> give<00:02:47.400> you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
high follow-through that will give you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.460 
high follow-through that will give you
depth<00:02:47.850> on<00:02:48.060> your<00:02:48.180> returns<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:48.930> will<00:02:49.230> put

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
depth on your returns and that will put

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.640 
depth on your returns and that will put
you<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:50.340> an<00:02:50.670> offensive<00:02:51.120> position<00:02:51.530> after<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
you in an offensive position after the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.320 
you in an offensive position after the
return<00:02:53.010> okay<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> one-handed<00:02:54.120> backhand

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
return okay on the one-handed backhand

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.880 
return okay on the one-handed backhand
return<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.990> would<00:02:55.080> look<00:02:55.230> like<00:02:55.290> this

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
return it would look like this

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.460 
return it would look like this
so<00:02:56.310> again<00:02:56.580> split<00:02:56.940> step<00:02:57.270> short<00:02:57.900> backswing<00:02:58.410> and

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
so again split step short backswing and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.670 
so again split step short backswing and
now<00:02:58.880> long<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.300> high<00:03:00.630> follow-through<00:03:01.440> right

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
now long and high follow-through right

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.830 
now long and high follow-through right
here<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.459> hand<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:02.970> way<00:03:03.120> up<00:03:03.330> there<00:03:03.570> in<00:03:03.810> front

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
here that hand is way up there in front

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.660 
here that hand is way up there in front
of<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.290> body<00:03:04.470> I'm<00:03:04.709> swinging<00:03:05.100> towards<00:03:05.520> the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
of the body I'm swinging towards the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.790 
of the body I'm swinging towards the
target<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> other<00:03:06.270> side<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.810> net<00:03:07.020> okay<00:03:07.200> to

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
target the other side of the net okay to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.710 
target the other side of the net okay to
hand<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.070> back<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.430> return<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.910> same<00:03:09.090> concept

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
hand it back and return the same concept

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.860 
hand it back and return the same concept
right<00:03:09.900> here<00:03:10.200> okay<00:03:10.440> split<00:03:10.709> step<00:03:11.190> turn<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.420> now

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
right here okay split step turn and now

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.949 
right here okay split step turn and now
long<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.890> high<00:03:14.160> follow-through<00:03:15.090> just<00:03:15.750> like

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
long and high follow-through just like

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.750 
long and high follow-through just like
that<00:03:16.170> alright<00:03:16.920> let's<00:03:17.160> take<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.340> look<00:03:17.580> at<00:03:17.670> that

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
that alright let's take a look at that

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.930 
that alright let's take a look at that
in<00:03:17.910> super<00:03:18.060> slow<00:03:18.360> motion<00:03:19.250> okay<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.459> let's<00:03:20.730> take

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
in super slow motion okay so let's take

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.360 
in super slow motion okay so let's take
a<00:03:20.970> look<00:03:21.269> at<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.510> forehand<00:03:21.900> return<00:03:22.080> first<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:23.130> go

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
a look at the forehand return first I go

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.030 
a look at the forehand return first I go
into<00:03:23.489> my<00:03:23.730> split<00:03:24.120> step<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.750> right<00:03:25.440> here<00:03:25.709> we<00:03:25.860> can

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
into my split step and right here we can

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.009 
into my split step and right here we can
see<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.459> have<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.670> short<00:03:27.030> backswing<00:03:27.720> and

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
see that I have a short backswing and

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.650 
see that I have a short backswing and
from<00:03:28.590> here<00:03:28.800> that<00:03:29.010> racket<00:03:29.489> is<00:03:29.610> going<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:30.090> travel

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
from here that racket is going to travel

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.110 
from here that racket is going to travel
forward<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.440> upward<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.040> target<00:03:32.640> which

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
forward and upward to the target which

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.370 
forward and upward to the target which
is<00:03:33.150> really<00:03:33.690> what<00:03:33.840> we're<00:03:34.019> trying<00:03:34.200> to

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
is really what we're trying to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.170 
is really what we're trying to
accomplish<00:03:34.680> with<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.310> long<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.970> high

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
accomplish with that long and high

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.960 
accomplish with that long and high
follow-through<00:03:37.010> this<00:03:38.010> kind<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.430> swing<00:03:38.700> path

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
follow-through this kind of a swing path

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.090 
follow-through this kind of a swing path
will<00:03:39.300> give<00:03:39.450> us<00:03:39.600> depth<00:03:39.930> on<00:03:40.170> these<00:03:40.350> returns<00:03:43.100> take

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
will give us depth on these returns take

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.590 
will give us depth on these returns take
a<00:03:44.130> close<00:03:44.430> look<00:03:44.549> at<00:03:44.790> this<00:03:44.910> position<00:03:45.150> right<00:03:45.540> here

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
a close look at this position right here

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.620 
a close look at this position right here
my<00:03:46.590> racket<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.370> hitting<00:03:47.790> hand<00:03:48.030> went<00:03:48.299> way<00:03:48.600> out

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
my racket and hitting hand went way out

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.110 
my racket and hitting hand went way out
to<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.200> target<00:03:49.530> forward<00:03:50.310> away<00:03:50.489> from<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.000> body

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
to the target forward away from the body

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.870 
to the target forward away from the body
as<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.780> can<00:03:52.380> see<00:03:52.590> here<00:03:52.890> with<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.280> green<00:03:53.610> arrow

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
as you can see here with the green arrow

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.990 
as you can see here with the green arrow
there's<00:03:54.239> distance<00:03:54.630> between<00:03:54.930> my<00:03:55.470> body<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:56.190> the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
there's distance between my body and the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.030 
there's distance between my body and the
hitting<00:03:57.239> hand<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.870> racket<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.650> that's<00:03:58.830> what

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
hitting hand and racket and that's what

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.630 
hitting hand and racket and that's what
I<00:03:59.070> consider<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.670> long<00:04:00.150> follow-through<00:04:01.580> now<00:04:02.580> we

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
I consider a long follow-through now we

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.880 
I consider a long follow-through now we
can<00:04:02.940> also<00:04:03.120> already<00:04:03.450> see<00:04:03.959> that<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.680> hitting

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
can also already see that the hitting

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.670 
can also already see that the hitting
hand<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.400> racket<00:04:05.790> are<00:04:05.910> up<00:04:06.090> very<00:04:06.540> high<00:04:06.900> I'm

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
hand and racket are up very high I'm

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.890 
hand and racket are up very high I'm
going<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.040> let<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.310> clip<00:04:08.610> run<00:04:08.880> here<00:04:09.269> into<00:04:09.750> the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
going to let the clip run here into the

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.340 
going to let the clip run here into the
final<00:04:10.530> finish<00:04:10.920> position<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.959> right<00:04:12.959> here<00:04:13.200> you

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
final finish position and right here you

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.320 
final finish position and right here you
can<00:04:13.500> see<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.860> that<00:04:14.070> racket<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.030> hitting

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
can see that that racket and hitting

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.890 
can see that that racket and hitting
hand<00:04:15.630> are<00:04:15.840> above<00:04:16.799> eye<00:04:17.010> level<00:04:17.100> and<00:04:17.910> that<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.660> the

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
hand are above eye level and that is the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.830 
hand are above eye level and that is the
high<00:04:19.109> finished<00:04:19.590> position<00:04:20.040> right<00:04:20.190> here<00:04:20.840> okay

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
high finished position right here okay

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.390 
high finished position right here okay
let's<00:04:22.080> take<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.289> look<00:04:22.500> at<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.680> same<00:04:22.919> thing<00:04:23.220> on

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
let's take a look at the same thing on

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.210 
let's take a look at the same thing on
the<00:04:23.490> one-handed<00:04:24.030> topspin<00:04:24.539> return<00:04:25.010> from<00:04:26.010> this

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
the one-handed topspin return from this

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.290 
the one-handed topspin return from this
position<00:04:26.430> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
position the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.210 
position the
swing<00:04:27.569> is<00:04:27.690> going<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:27.990> be<00:04:28.110> forward<00:04:28.560> and<00:04:28.860> upward

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
swing is going to be forward and upward

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.830 
swing is going to be forward and upward
which<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:29.610> what<00:04:29.789> we're<00:04:29.940> trying<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.389> accomplish

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
which is what we're trying to accomplish

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.629 
which is what we're trying to accomplish
with<00:04:31.409> that<00:04:31.680> long<00:04:32.159> and<00:04:32.550> high<00:04:32.759> follow-through

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.610 

take<00:04:38.639> a<00:04:38.669> look<00:04:38.909> here<00:04:39.270> how<00:04:39.659> far<00:04:39.690> in<00:04:40.139> front<00:04:40.409> of<00:04:40.560> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
take a look here how far in front of the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.680 
take a look here how far in front of the
body<00:04:40.800> might<00:04:41.190> hitting<00:04:41.580> hand<00:04:41.819> and<00:04:42.060> racket<00:04:42.509> are

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
body might hitting hand and racket are

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.320 
body might hitting hand and racket are
and<00:04:43.069> we<00:04:44.069> can<00:04:44.220> also<00:04:44.370> see<00:04:44.729> how<00:04:45.000> high<00:04:45.270> this

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
and we can also see how high this

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.450 
and we can also see how high this
position<00:04:45.990> is<00:04:46.139> this<00:04:46.349> position<00:04:46.800> is<00:04:46.919> even<00:04:47.159> higher

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
position is this position is even higher

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.309 
position is this position is even higher
than<00:04:47.789> on<00:04:47.909> the<00:04:48.030> forehand<00:04:48.449> return<00:04:48.930> this<00:04:49.169> is

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
than on the forehand return this is

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:52.850 
than on the forehand return this is
above<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.889> head<00:04:51.050> last<00:04:52.050> but<00:04:52.289> not<00:04:52.379> least<00:04:52.620> let's

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
above the head last but not least let's

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.260 
above the head last but not least let's
take<00:04:53.039> a<00:04:53.069> look<00:04:53.310> at<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.460> same<00:04:53.669> thing<00:04:53.940> on<00:04:54.150> the

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
take a look at the same thing on the

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.290 
take a look at the same thing on the
two-handed<00:04:54.870> backhand<00:04:55.379> topspin<00:04:55.860> return<00:04:56.300> from

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
two-handed backhand topspin return from

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.879 
two-handed backhand topspin return from
here<00:04:57.539> I'm<00:04:57.659> going<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.930> swing<00:04:58.229> forward<00:04:58.740> and

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
here I'm going to swing forward and

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.529 
here I'm going to swing forward and
upward<00:04:59.220> which<00:04:59.699> is<00:04:59.879> what<00:05:00.030> we're<00:05:00.180> trying<00:05:00.360> to

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
upward which is what we're trying to

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.420 
upward which is what we're trying to
accomplish<00:05:00.870> with<00:05:01.259> that<00:05:01.500> long<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.280> high

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
accomplish with that long and high

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.520 
accomplish with that long and high
follow-through<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:03.300> that<00:05:03.840> is<00:05:04.020> going<00:05:04.199> to<00:05:04.319> give

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
follow-through and that is going to give

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.580 
follow-through and that is going to give
us<00:05:04.650> depth<00:05:04.979> on<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.370> return

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.290 

so<00:05:10.590> once<00:05:10.860> again<00:05:11.009> we<00:05:11.310> see<00:05:11.520> very<00:05:11.909> long

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
so once again we see very long

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.839 
so once again we see very long
follow-through<00:05:13.259> as<00:05:13.530> you<00:05:14.039> can<00:05:14.190> see<00:05:14.460> the

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
follow-through as you can see the

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.629 
follow-through as you can see the
hitting<00:05:15.210> hand<00:05:15.659> is<00:05:15.960> way<00:05:16.409> out<00:05:16.680> in<00:05:16.710> front<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.520> the

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
hitting hand is way out in front of the

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.439 
hitting hand is way out in front of the
body<00:05:18.830> we<00:05:19.830> can<00:05:20.009> also<00:05:20.129> clearly<00:05:20.639> see<00:05:20.789> that<00:05:21.090> the

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
body we can also clearly see that the

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.450 
body we can also clearly see that the
hands<00:05:21.810> are<00:05:21.870> up<00:05:22.050> very<00:05:22.349> high<00:05:22.620> right<00:05:23.009> here<00:05:23.250> at

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
hands are up very high right here at

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.149 
hands are up very high right here at
around<00:05:23.729> eye<00:05:23.940> level<00:05:24.389> and<00:05:24.690> as<00:05:25.139> we<00:05:25.440> continue<00:05:25.710> the

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
around eye level and as we continue the

swings and in fact everything I do when
I<00:05:52.680> work<00:05:52.860> on<00:05:53.039> technique<00:05:53.400> we<00:05:53.699> start<00:05:54.000> with<00:05:54.180> shadow

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:54.629

okay so the first step is to work on
this<00:06:01.139> with<00:06:01.349> shadow<00:06:01.830> swings<00:06:02.360> isolating<00:06:03.360> what

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
I'm also finishing up high like this and

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:34.999 
I'm also finishing up high like this and
when<00:06:33.330> you<00:06:33.419> hold<00:06:33.659> at<00:06:33.930> the<00:06:34.050> end<00:06:34.199> you<00:06:34.440> check<00:06:34.770> and

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
okay the common mistake is to be

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.459 
okay the common mistake is to be
somewhere<00:06:38.849> in<00:06:38.969> here<00:06:39.000> and<00:06:39.449> to<00:06:39.900> be<00:06:40.020> too<00:06:40.169> close

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:40.469 
somewhere in here and to be too close

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:42.379 
somewhere in here and to be too close
and<00:06:40.860> too<00:06:40.889> low<00:06:41.279> okay<00:06:41.669> so<00:06:41.729> let<00:06:42.000> me<00:06:42.029> do<00:06:42.180> a<00:06:42.210> couple

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389 
and too low okay so let me do a couple

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.490 
and too low okay so let me do a couple
of<00:06:42.599> those<00:06:42.779> forehand<00:06:43.620> return<00:06:44.150> split<00:06:45.500> long

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
of those forehand return split long

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.619 
of those forehand return split long
follow<00:06:47.009> through<00:06:47.340> and<00:06:47.490> finish<00:06:47.550> up<00:06:48.029> high<00:06:48.240> just

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:48.629 
follow through and finish up high just

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:49.999 
follow through and finish up high just
like<00:06:48.840> that<00:06:49.080> and<00:06:49.289> then<00:06:49.409> you<00:06:49.529> practice<00:06:49.770> that

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
like that and then you practice that

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.390 
like that and then you practice that
over<00:06:50.400> and<00:06:50.789> over<00:06:50.879> okay<00:06:51.740> just<00:06:52.740> like<00:06:52.949> that<00:06:53.190> and

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
over and over okay just like that and

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.490 
over and over okay just like that and
the<00:06:53.699> same<00:06:53.909> concept<00:06:54.449> on<00:06:54.599> the<00:06:55.050> one-handed

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
the same concept on the one-handed

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.869 
the same concept on the one-handed
backhand<00:06:55.710> return<00:06:57.500> shadow<00:06:58.500> swing<00:06:58.949> and<00:06:59.219> hold

00:06:59.869 --> 00:06:59.879 
backhand return shadow swing and hold

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:01.430 
backhand return shadow swing and hold
the<00:07:00.000> finish<00:07:00.300> and<00:07:00.419> you<00:07:00.509> can<00:07:00.629> see<00:07:00.840> that<00:07:01.020> hand<00:07:01.289> is

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
the finish and you can see that hand is

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.019 
the finish and you can see that hand is
way<00:07:01.710> out<00:07:01.919> in<00:07:02.069> front<00:07:02.099> of<00:07:02.370> my<00:07:02.490> body<00:07:02.669> right<00:07:02.969> here

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:03.029 
way out in front of my body right here

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:05.119 
way out in front of my body right here

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.550 
should be up high okay on the two-handed
return<00:07:07.409> same<00:07:08.099> concept<00:07:09.050> long<00:07:10.050> and<00:07:10.409> high

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
return same concept long and high

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.420 
return same concept long and high
follow-through

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
follow-through

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.809 
follow-through
you<00:07:11.639> hold<00:07:11.940> the<00:07:12.120> finish<00:07:12.509> and<00:07:12.690> then<00:07:13.139> you<00:07:13.169> release

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:13.819 
you hold the finish and then you release

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:16.850 
you hold the finish and then you release
so<00:07:14.819> you<00:07:14.849> can<00:07:15.120> practice<00:07:15.330> your<00:07:15.840> returns<00:07:16.289> really

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
so you can practice your returns really

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.889 
so you can practice your returns really
well<00:07:17.039> just<00:07:17.610> with<00:07:17.789> these<00:07:17.880> shadow<00:07:18.210> swings<00:07:18.630> and

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:18.899 
well just with these shadow swings and

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:21.709 
well just with these shadow swings and
you<00:07:19.259> can<00:07:19.409> improve<00:07:19.800> a<00:07:20.070> lot<00:07:20.250> with<00:07:20.580> that<00:07:20.759> now<00:07:21.570> of

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:21.719 
you can improve a lot with that now of

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:22.820 
you can improve a lot with that now of
course<00:07:21.990> it<00:07:22.169> would<00:07:22.320> make<00:07:22.349> same

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
course it would make same

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.220 
course it would make same
to<00:07:23.040> find<00:07:23.310> a<00:07:23.460> practice<00:07:23.940> partner<00:07:24.120> in<00:07:24.510> the<00:07:24.900> next

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.230 
to find a practice partner in the next

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.260 
to find a practice partner in the next
step<00:07:25.410> and<00:07:25.590> then<00:07:25.710> go<00:07:25.920> out<00:07:26.070> and<00:07:26.100> practice<00:07:26.580> with<00:07:27.060> a

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:27.270 
step and then go out and practice with a

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.390 
step and then go out and practice with a
partner<00:07:27.780> I<00:07:27.960> tend<00:07:28.530> to<00:07:28.590> see<00:07:28.830> a<00:07:28.860> lot<00:07:28.980> of<00:07:29.160> players

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 
partner I tend to see a lot of players

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.040 
partner I tend to see a lot of players
going<00:07:29.820> out<00:07:29.940> on<00:07:30.090> the<00:07:30.180> court<00:07:30.420> with<00:07:30.510> a<00:07:30.570> basket

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050 
going out on the court with a basket

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.810 
going out on the court with a basket
practicing<00:07:31.560> their<00:07:31.710> serve<00:07:31.950> but<00:07:32.430> for<00:07:32.640> some

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:32.820 
practicing their serve but for some

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.090 
practicing their serve but for some
reason<00:07:33.180> almost<00:07:33.360> never<00:07:33.750> is<00:07:34.050> there<00:07:34.530> a<00:07:34.590> partner

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.100 
reason almost never is there a partner

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.940 
reason almost never is there a partner
that<00:07:35.370> practices<00:07:36.000> their<00:07:36.600> return<00:07:36.990> so<00:07:37.620> simply<00:07:37.920> go

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:37.950 
that practices their return so simply go

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.230 
that practices their return so simply go
out<00:07:38.190> ask<00:07:38.490> somebody<00:07:38.850> if<00:07:38.940> they<00:07:39.030> want<00:07:39.210> to

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 
out ask somebody if they want to

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.330 
out ask somebody if they want to
practice<00:07:39.420> their<00:07:39.630> serve<00:07:39.990> and<00:07:40.290> then<00:07:40.590> you<00:07:40.710> have<00:07:40.950> a

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 
practice their serve and then you have a

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.000 
practice their serve and then you have a
chance<00:07:41.850> to<00:07:42.060> practice<00:07:42.300> your<00:07:42.840> returns<00:07:43.260> and<00:07:43.740> can

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.010 
chance to practice your returns and can

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.980 
chance to practice your returns and can
really<00:07:44.190> improve<00:07:44.550> that<00:07:44.580> way<00:07:44.910> all<00:07:45.630> right<00:07:45.810> so

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:45.990
