he's short crust but I think that the
crunchiness<00:00:25.579> of<00:00:25.820> digestive<00:00:26.300> is<00:00:26.390> actually<00:00:26.660> a

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
crunchiness of digestive is actually a

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.050 
crunchiness of digestive is actually a
bit<00:00:26.840> nicer<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:27.380> to<00:00:28.279> help<00:00:28.550> that<00:00:28.700> along<00:00:28.730> I'm

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
bit nicer and to help that along I'm

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.609
