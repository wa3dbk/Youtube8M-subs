from<00:00:16.529> silicon<00:00:17.340> rx<00:00:17.880> saw<00:00:18.470> so<00:00:19.470> I'll<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.800> grabbing

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
from silicon rx saw so I'll be grabbing

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.660 
from silicon rx saw so I'll be grabbing
iron<00:00:21.000> tester<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.750> start<00:00:22.500> with<00:00:22.680> Rubbermaid

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
iron tester and start with Rubbermaid

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.960 
iron tester and start with Rubbermaid
blower<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.660> we'll<00:00:25.529> start<00:00:26.039> doing<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.490> testing

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
blower and we'll start doing the testing

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.030 
blower and we'll start doing the testing
as<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.470> see<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:32.430> rubbermaid<00:00:33.059> blower

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
as you can see the the rubbermaid blower

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.920 
as you can see the the rubbermaid blower
doesn't<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:36.800> any<00:00:37.800> iron<00:00:38.579> emitting<00:00:39.239> property

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
doesn't have any iron emitting property

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.799 
doesn't have any iron emitting property
at<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.230> stage<00:00:40.829> we<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.640> see<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.329> number<00:00:42.719> of

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
at this stage we can see the number of

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.619 
at this stage we can see the number of
clips<00:00:44.059> within<00:00:45.059> dying<00:00:45.570> tester<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.879> all<00:00:48.210> wait

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
clips within dying tester so we all wait

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.319 
clips within dying tester so we all wait
all<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.469> numbers<00:00:50.010> zero<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.030> basically

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
all the numbers zero a so basically

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.290 
all the numbers zero a so basically
there<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.930> none<00:00:52.170> there<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.120> go<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
there is none there and then we go to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.540 
there is none there and then we go to
regular<00:00:54.989> silicon<00:00:55.440> which<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.620> very<00:00:56.039> similar<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
regular silicon which is very similar to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.619 
regular silicon which is very similar to
Zion<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.629> start<00:00:58.440> doing<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.800> testing<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.670> we'll

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
Zion I start doing the testing and we'll

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.799 
Zion I start doing the testing and we'll
wait<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.859> register<00:01:02.460> recorded<00:01:03.090> number<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
wait for a register recorded number to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.990 
wait for a register recorded number to
see<00:01:04.049> what<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.739> number<00:01:05.070> would<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.820> can

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
see what the number would be so we can

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.570 
see what the number would be so we can
compare<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:07.490> Zion<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.880> stage<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.580> as

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
compare it to Zion at this stage so as

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.260 
compare it to Zion at this stage so as
we<00:01:12.270> wait<00:01:12.600> we'll<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.400> what<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> number<00:01:14.970> will

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
we wait we'll see what the number will

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.620 
we wait we'll see what the number will
be<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:17.040> recorded<00:01:17.549> number<00:01:17.670> will<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
be the recorded number will be out the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.770 
be the recorded number will be out the
recorded<00:01:19.200> number<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.740> six<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.780> Machine

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
recorded number is six so the Machine

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.090 
recorded number is six so the Machine
gives<00:01:22.049> us<00:01:22.200> number<00:01:22.950> six<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.110> now<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.170> will<00:01:25.650> be

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
gives us number six so now we will be

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.080 
gives us number six so now we will be
doing<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> testing<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:28.130> Zion<00:01:29.130> which<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
doing the testing on Zion which is the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.870 
doing the testing on Zion which is the
yellow<00:01:30.390> one<00:01:30.570> which<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.229> made<00:01:31.470> from<00:01:31.710> silicon<00:01:32.340> rx

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
yellow one which is made from silicon rx

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.170 
yellow one which is made from silicon rx
has<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.750> new<00:01:34.140> improved<00:01:34.860> back<00:01:35.250> filter<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:35.909> well

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
has a new improved back filter as well

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.780 
has a new improved back filter as well
so<00:01:38.390> we'll<00:01:39.390> start<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.430> presetting<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
so we'll start the presetting the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.060 
so we'll start the presetting the
machine<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.930> start<00:01:43.170> doing<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.590> testing

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
machine and we start doing the testing

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.539 
machine and we start doing the testing
and<00:01:44.780> we'll<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.799> wait<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.399> machine

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and we'll we will wait for the machine

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.480 
and we'll we will wait for the machine
to<00:01:47.729> give<00:01:47.970> us<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.560> recorded<00:01:49.560> number<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.340> can

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
to give us a recorded number so we can

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.859 
to give us a recorded number so we can
do<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> comparison<00:01:51.180> at<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.869> stage<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:54.540> we

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
do the comparison at this stage so we

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.219 
do the comparison at this stage so we
will<00:01:55.079> wait<00:01:55.350> till<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:56.549> get<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> number

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.969 

number<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:01.979> ions<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.850> between<00:02:03.270> 300<00:02:03.900> to<00:02:03.979> 1200

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
number of ions is between 300 to 1200

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
number of ions is between 300 to 1200
and<00:02:05.189> depending<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.330> environmental

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
and depending on environmental

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.199 
and depending on environmental
conditions<00:02:07.229> such<00:02:07.650> as<00:02:07.799> humidity<00:02:08.369> temperature

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
conditions such as humidity temperature

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.680 
conditions such as humidity temperature
etc<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.610> can<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.209> iron<00:02:12.330> has

etc so and as you can see the iron has

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.699 
etc so and as you can see the iron has
advantages<00:02:13.440> over<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.459> other<00:02:14.610> regular<00:02:15.209> plural

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
advantages over the other regular plural

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.800 
advantages over the other regular plural
produces<00:02:16.709> some<00:02:16.920> ions<00:02:17.370> which<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.180> sufficient

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
produces some ions which is sufficient

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.350 
produces some ions which is sufficient
enough<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.290> remove<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.160> static<00:02:20.610> charge<00:02:20.910> built

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
powered ionizer which is very

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.210 
powered ionizer which is very
inconvenient<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:32.190> carry<00:02:32.670> around<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.950> ion

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
inconvenient to carry around so the ion

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.510 
inconvenient to carry around so the ion
is<00:02:35.430> highly<00:02:35.880> recommended
