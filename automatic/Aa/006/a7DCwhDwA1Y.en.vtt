that<00:00:40.170> I'm<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.850> start<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> game<00:00:42.030> up<00:00:42.270> I'm

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that I'm going to start a game up I'm

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.229 
that I'm going to start a game up I'm
going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.680> start<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> game<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.489> um<00:00:44.670> I

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
going to start a game up that um I

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.830 
going to start a game up that um I
played<00:00:45.690> before<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.579> know<00:00:47.690> play<00:00:48.690> it's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
played before and I know play it's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.150 
played before and I know play it's
pretty<00:00:49.050> smooth<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:50.550> almost<00:00:50.879> playable

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
pretty smooth and it's almost playable

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.680 
pretty smooth and it's almost playable
so<00:00:53.160> these<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> games<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.850> got<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.180> far<00:00:54.420> for

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
so these are the games I got so far for

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.130 
so these are the games I got so far for
DF<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:56.460> reason<00:00:56.699> why<00:00:56.789> there<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.059> two<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.899> each

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
DF the reason why there are two of each

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.130 
DF the reason why there are two of each
one<00:00:58.410> because<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.520> extract<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.239> um

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
one because I extract it um

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.579 
one because I extract it um
these<00:01:01.379> files<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.449> they<00:01:03.449> play<00:01:03.629> an<00:01:03.780> MDS<00:01:04.199> format

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
these files and they play an MDS format

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.140 
these files and they play an MDS format
or<00:01:04.769> dot<00:01:05.010> zip<00:01:05.220> format<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.790> don't<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
or dot zip format so you don't have to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.920 
or dot zip format so you don't have to
extract<00:01:06.479> them<00:01:06.659> anymore<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:08.240> I<00:01:09.240> wanted<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
extract them anymore so I wanted to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.039 
extract them anymore so I wanted to
start<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:10.380> Yoshi's<00:01:11.159> Island<00:01:11.960> because<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
start up Yoshi's Island because it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.679 
start up Yoshi's Island because it
actually<00:01:13.170> plays<00:01:13.380> pretty<00:01:13.650> good<00:01:13.830> okay<00:01:14.689> with

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
actually plays pretty good okay with

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
actually plays pretty good okay with
this<00:01:15.840> emulator<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.650> has<00:01:16.860> settings<00:01:17.280> when<00:01:17.460> you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
this emulator it has settings when you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.240 
this emulator it has settings when you
go<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> settings<00:01:18.200> make<00:01:19.200> sure<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.009> from

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
go to settings make sure all of the from

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.740 
go to settings make sure all of the from
just<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.759> my<00:01:20.850> device<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.330> make<00:01:21.450> sure<00:01:21.630> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
just for my device to make sure you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.550 
just for my device to make sure you
enable<00:01:22.290> sound<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.400> actually<00:01:24.560> increases

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
enable sound it actually increases

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.859 
enable sound it actually increases
performance<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.280> enable<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.240> sounds

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
performance we enable it and it sounds

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.450 
performance we enable it and it sounds
funny<00:01:28.080> because<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.470> tells<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.950> Maybelline

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
funny because it tells you in Maybelline

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.020 
funny because it tells you in Maybelline
they<00:01:30.360> play<00:01:30.509> backup<00:01:30.720> how<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> go<00:01:31.200> um<00:01:32.030> basically

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
they play backup how to go um basically

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.319 
they play backup how to go um basically
and<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.869> many<00:01:34.020> words<00:01:34.140> decrease<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.329> emulator

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and so many words decrease the emulator

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.399 
and so many words decrease the emulator
speed<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.490> actually<00:01:38.490> makes<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.820> smoother<00:01:39.409> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
speed it actually makes a smoother and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.740 
speed it actually makes a smoother and
I'm<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:41.070> sure<00:01:41.369> why<00:01:41.670> makes<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.090> spoofer<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.659> it

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
I'm not sure why makes a spoofer but it

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.940 
I'm not sure why makes a spoofer but it
definitely<00:01:42.869> does<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.470> make<00:01:43.590> sure<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.740> they

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
definitely does so make sure and they

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.170 
definitely does so make sure and they
will<00:01:44.070> sound<00:01:44.220> uncheck<00:01:44.880> it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
will sound uncheck it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
will sound uncheck it
