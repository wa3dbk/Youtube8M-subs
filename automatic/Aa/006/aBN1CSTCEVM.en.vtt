00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
semi-permanent because basically a few

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.779

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.760 

november<00:00:53.789> time<00:00:54.000> i<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.570> was<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.590> did

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
november time i think it was that I did

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.510 
november time i think it was that I did
it<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:57.230> idolized<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.440> blonde<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.250> reason<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it I idolized the blonde the reason I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.979 
it I idolized the blonde the reason I
went<00:00:59.670> blonde<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.300> am<00:01:00.629> naturally

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
went blonde is because I am naturally

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.820 
went blonde is because I am naturally
blonde<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> was<00:01:02.579> younger<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.879> was<00:01:03.090> anyway

stuff<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:09.000> honest<00:02:09.269> I'm<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
stuff but to be honest I'm not that

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.410

impressed<00:02:10.379> with<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.039> product<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:12.299> can

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
impressed with the product as you can

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.940 
impressed with the product as you can
probably<00:02:12.629> see<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.140> still<00:02:13.379> see<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> lot<00:02:13.890> of

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
probably see you can still see a lot of

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.009 
probably see you can still see a lot of
blonde<00:02:14.489> patches<00:02:16.549> but<00:02:17.549> originally<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.269> don't

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
blonde patches but originally I don't

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.809 
blonde patches but originally I don't
think<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.379> necessarily<00:02:19.950> because<00:02:20.430> where<00:02:20.670> he

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
think it's necessarily because where he

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.759 
think it's necessarily because where he
put<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.209> because<00:02:22.200> I've<00:02:22.410> had<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.709> for

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
put it on because I've had this for

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.100 
put it on because I've had this for
about<00:02:23.930> just<00:02:24.930> under<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.200> week<00:02:25.260> now<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:26.540> it<00:02:27.540> was

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
about just under a week now and it was

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.229 
about just under a week now and it was
originally<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:28.709> brown<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.180> after<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> few

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
originally all brown and after a few

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.479 
originally all brown and after a few
mushes<00:02:30.780> some<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.799> its<00:02:31.950> already<00:02:32.129> showing

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
mushes some of its already showing

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.479 
mushes some of its already showing
through<00:02:32.849> so<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.930> says<00:02:34.349> it's<00:02:34.560> good<00:02:34.829> one<00:02:35.250> hundred

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
through so it says it's good one hundred

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.250 
through so it says it's good one hundred
percent<00:02:35.519> grey<00:02:35.970> coverage<00:02:36.239> which<00:02:36.629> clearly<00:02:36.989> is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
percent grey coverage which clearly is

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.140 
percent grey coverage which clearly is
not<00:02:37.500> obviously<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.250> wasn't<00:02:38.430> padded<00:02:38.760> enough

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
not obviously I wasn't padded enough

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.089 
not obviously I wasn't padded enough
gray<00:02:39.360> hair<00:02:39.599> but<00:02:40.200> I'm<00:02:40.319> going<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.680> assume<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
gray hair but I'm going to assume a

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.890 
gray hair but I'm going to assume a
similar<00:02:41.549> situation<00:02:41.760> would<00:02:42.180> occur<00:02:42.450> if<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.690> did

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
similar situation would occur if you did

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.500 
similar situation would occur if you did
have<00:02:43.019> gray<00:02:43.230> hair<00:02:46.549> application<00:02:47.549> wise<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.269> was

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
have gray hair application wise it was

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.869 
have gray hair application wise it was
really<00:02:48.780> easy<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:50.250> was<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> lot<00:02:50.579> easier<00:02:50.610> to

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
really easy it was a lot easier to

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.610 
really easy it was a lot easier to
distribute<00:02:51.299> compared<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.140> gel<00:02:52.349> ones

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
distribute compared to the gel ones

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.589 
distribute compared to the gel ones
because<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:53.190> was<00:02:53.310> almost<00:02:53.459> like<00:02:53.730> poop<00:02:54.150> shampoo

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
because it was almost like poop shampoo

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.720 
because it was almost like poop shampoo
in<00:02:54.720> your<00:02:54.750> hair<00:02:55.049> explore<00:02:55.920> as<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.069> foam<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.640> was

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
in your hair explore as a foam it was

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.910 
in your hair explore as a foam it was
just<00:02:56.879> like<00:02:57.090> sides<00:02:57.359> you<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.690> rub<00:02:58.049> it<00:02:58.079> in<00:02:58.290> in

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
just like sides you just rub it in in

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.880 
just like sides you just rub it in in
that<00:02:59.519> sense<00:02:59.730> however<00:03:00.629> it<00:03:00.900> didn't<00:03:01.230> take<00:03:01.500> any

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
that sense however it didn't take any

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.390 
that sense however it didn't take any
less<00:03:02.340> time<00:03:02.790> compared<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.480> normal<00:03:03.660> gel<00:03:04.400> hair

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
less time compared to a normal gel hair

less time compared to a normal gel hair
dye<00:03:05.549> I<00:03:05.579> don't<00:03:05.879> think<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.450> fact<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.870> think<00:03:06.989> it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
dye I don't think in fact I think it

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.620 
dye I don't think in fact I think it
took<00:03:07.349> about<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.400> same<00:03:08.519> much<00:03:08.910> time<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.510> be

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
took about the same much time to be

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.240 
took about the same much time to be
honest<00:03:12.799> overall<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:14.389> probably<00:03:15.920> wouldn't<00:03:16.920> buy

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
honest overall it probably wouldn't buy

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.559 
honest overall it probably wouldn't buy
again<00:03:19.280> just<00:03:20.280> because<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:22.700> where<00:03:23.700> as<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.540> I
