like if I can resolve a tool i'm

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.949 
like if I can resolve a tool i'm
probably<00:02:43.579> see<00:02:43.790> really<00:02:43.940> far<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.299> like<00:02:44.780> I

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
probably see really far it like I

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.000 
probably see really far it like I
wouldn't<00:02:45.019> cut<00:02:45.349> it<00:02:45.380> just<00:02:45.620> because<00:02:45.799> i<00:02:45.860> am

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
wouldn't cut it just because i am

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.800 
wouldn't cut it just because i am
playing<00:02:46.220> authorized<00:02:46.579> if<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:46.970> cut<00:02:47.239> cut<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.630> would

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
playing authorized if I cut cut I would

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.750 
playing authorized if I cut cut I would
cut<00:02:47.959> out<00:02:47.989> eyes<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.440> don't<00:02:48.590> know<00:02:48.709> yeah<00:02:49.579> it's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
cut out eyes but I don't know yeah it's

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.430 
cut out eyes but I don't know yeah it's
just<00:02:49.970> more<00:02:50.120> ways<00:02:50.269> to<00:02:50.299> get<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.599> scout<00:02:50.840> like<00:02:51.200> I

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
just more ways to get the scout like I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.860 
just more ways to get the scout like I
think<00:02:51.680> all<00:02:51.739> dies<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.069> pretty<00:02:52.250> good<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:53.420> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
think all dies is pretty good on the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.670 
think all dies is pretty good on the
side<00:02:54.079> deck<00:02:55.989> probably<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.049> reason<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.440> didn't

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
side deck probably the reason I didn't

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.819 
side deck probably the reason I didn't
like<00:02:57.920> draw<00:02:58.340> anything<00:02:58.640> um<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.540> played<00:03:00.319> a<00:03:00.349> three

marvel I was playing room with me and

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.530 
marvel I was playing room with me and
yet<00:03:12.709> we<00:03:12.920> were<00:03:13.010> playing<00:03:13.220> normal<00:03:13.459> AO<00:03:13.579> with<00:03:13.880> space

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
yet we were playing normal AO with space

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.430 
yet we were playing normal AO with space
time<00:03:14.750> because<00:03:14.930> we<00:03:14.989> thought<00:03:15.109> it<00:03:15.230> was<00:03:15.319> really

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
time because we thought it was really

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.110 
time because we thought it was really
good<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.739> mirror<00:03:15.920> match<00:03:16.040> my<00:03:16.910> friend

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
good in the mirror match my friend

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.370 
good in the mirror match my friend
actually<00:03:17.239> told<00:03:17.480> me<00:03:17.569> about<00:03:17.660> this<00:03:17.840> card<00:03:18.049> like<00:03:18.230> a

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
actually told me about this card like a

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.780 
actually told me about this card like a
couple<00:03:18.680> days<00:03:18.799> before<00:03:18.889> but<00:03:19.340> we<00:03:19.579> didn't<00:03:19.760> really

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
couple days before but we didn't really

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.849 
couple days before but we didn't really
have<00:03:20.060> time<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.239> test<00:03:20.569> it<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:21.019> we<00:03:21.560> just<00:03:21.709> played

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
have time to test it so we just played

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.199 
have time to test it so we just played
remember<00:03:22.489> Lee<00:03:22.549> I<00:03:22.609> was<00:03:22.730> like<00:03:22.819> still<00:03:23.060> really

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
remember Lee I was like still really

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.150 
remember Lee I was like still really
good<00:03:23.389> I<00:03:23.599> said<00:03:24.079> this<00:03:24.139> is<00:03:24.200> infinitely<00:03:24.799> better<00:03:24.950> in

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
good I said this is infinitely better in

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.740 
good I said this is infinitely better in
the<00:03:25.220> mirror<00:03:25.430> magic<00:03:25.549> like<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.180> realize<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.540> now

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
the mirror magic like I realize that now

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.300 
the mirror magic like I realize that now
it's<00:03:27.380> probably<00:03:27.620> like<00:03:27.769> one<00:03:27.920> of<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.069> reasons

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
it's probably like one of the reasons

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.490 
it's probably like one of the reasons
why<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.430> when<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.359> lot<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.720> mayor's<00:03:29.900> they

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
why I when a lot of the mayor's they

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.620 
why I when a lot of the mayor's they
resolve<00:03:30.829> on<00:03:31.069> tool<00:03:31.430> going<00:03:31.730> first<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.150> you<00:03:32.510> have

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
resolve on tool going first and you have

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.940 
resolve on tool going first and you have
this<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.019> they<00:03:33.079> don't<00:03:33.170> have<00:03:33.290> like<00:03:33.560> bottomless

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
this and they don't have like bottomless

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.979 
this and they don't have like bottomless
or<00:03:34.099> warning<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.299> win<00:03:35.480> because<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:35.780> just

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
or warning then you win because you just

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.900 
or warning then you win because you just
make<00:03:36.139> X<00:03:36.319> tone<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.650> destroy<00:03:37.160> all<00:03:37.340> their<00:03:37.430> msts

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
make X tone and destroy all their msts

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.870 
make X tone and destroy all their msts
and<00:03:38.090> like<00:03:38.859> yeah<00:03:39.859> you<00:03:39.919> saw<00:03:40.160> four<00:03:40.430> cards<00:03:40.760> so

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
and like yeah you saw four cards so

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.940 
and like yeah you saw four cards so
they're<00:03:41.030> probably<00:03:41.290> noticeably<00:03:42.290> less<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:42.709> this

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
they're probably noticeably less so this

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.259 
they're probably noticeably less so this
was<00:03:43.099> really<00:03:43.220> good<00:03:43.400> going<00:03:43.849> first<00:03:44.060> you<00:03:44.150> could

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
was really good going first you could

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.879 
was really good going first you could
make<00:03:44.389> reckons<00:03:44.690> 0<00:03:44.840> with<00:03:44.959> it<00:03:45.049> I<00:03:45.109> 10<00:03:45.530> dolla<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.859> I

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
make reckons 0 with it I 10 dolla to I

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.830 
make reckons 0 with it I 10 dolla to I
like<00:03:46.190> I<00:03:46.370> just<00:03:46.700> like<00:03:46.790> to<00:03:46.910> hold<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.239> because<00:03:47.750> I

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
like I just like to hold it because I

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.210 
like I just like to hold it because I

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
know they're gonna um msg my Scout

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.699 
know they're gonna um msg my Scout

probably not just once so I just like to
UM<00:03:51.859> have<00:03:52.069> them<00:03:52.190> msci<00:03:52.639> make<00:03:52.910> this<00:03:53.090> i<00:03:53.359> overlay

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
UM have them msci make this i overlay

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.690 
UM have them msci make this i overlay

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
into ragan 0 I get on the sacrifice fact

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.099 
into ragan 0 I get on the sacrifice fact
we<00:03:55.849> search<00:03:56.030> either<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:56.269> monster<00:03:56.630> another<00:03:56.870> tool
