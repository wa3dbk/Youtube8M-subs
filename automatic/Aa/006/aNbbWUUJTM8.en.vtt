00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
the behringer powered speaker sits

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.090 
the behringer powered speaker sits
perfectly<00:06:20.320> as<00:06:20.890> a<00:06:20.950> fall<00:06:21.400> back<00:06:21.610> on<00:06:21.970> its<00:06:22.270> edge

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
perfectly as a fall back on its edge

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.370 
perfectly as a fall back on its edge
which<00:06:24.100> is<00:06:24.240> how<00:06:25.240> it'll<00:06:25.420> be<00:06:25.510> used<00:06:25.840> tonight

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
which is how it'll be used tonight

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.880 
which is how it'll be used tonight
unless<00:06:26.860> of<00:06:27.250> course<00:06:27.340> when<00:06:27.910> I<00:06:27.940> plug<00:06:28.360> in<00:06:28.390> my<00:06:28.890> front

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
unless of course when I plug in my front

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.050 
unless of course when I plug in my front
of<00:06:29.950> house<00:06:30.070> this<00:06:30.310> thing<00:06:30.490> I'll<00:06:30.610> sound<00:06:30.790> better

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 
of house this thing I'll sound better

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.180 
of house this thing I'll sound better
then<00:06:31.270> I'll<00:06:31.360> swap<00:06:31.720> one<00:06:32.080> out<00:06:32.290> and<00:06:32.530> using<00:06:32.860> old<00:06:33.010> one

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
then I'll swap one out and using old one

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.800 
then I'll swap one out and using old one
but<00:06:33.400> I<00:06:33.610> think<00:06:34.180> I'll<00:06:34.270> use<00:06:34.300> this<00:06:34.540> is<00:06:34.690> the

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
but I think I'll use this is the

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.600 
but I think I'll use this is the
fallback<00:06:34.990> tonight<00:06:35.410> just<00:06:36.250> to<00:06:36.340> keep<00:06:36.460> it

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
fallback tonight just to keep it

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.780 
fallback tonight just to keep it
balanced<00:06:37.320> but<00:06:38.320> yeah<00:06:38.950> this<00:06:39.220> is<00:06:39.280> really<00:06:39.670> cool

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
balanced but yeah this is really cool

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.560 
balanced but yeah this is really cool
hopefully<00:06:41.370> it'll<00:06:42.370> be<00:06:42.580> as<00:06:42.730> reliable<00:06:43.060> as<00:06:43.390> their

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
hopefully it'll be as reliable as their

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.650 
hopefully it'll be as reliable as their
mixes<00:06:43.870> because<00:06:44.200> I've<00:06:44.350> had<00:06:45.180> I've<00:06:46.180> got<00:06:46.240> two<00:06:46.570> of
