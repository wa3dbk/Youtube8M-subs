 affirm that a military intervention in 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.170
 Syria must have the support of the council of 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:20.779
 UN security could the US and its 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.060
 allies as on other occasions attack 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.500
 Syria without the green light of 1 and ignore 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.190
 the call for dialogue of the 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.940

 england are preparing for a 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.530
 attack on Syria this morning from 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.770
 england it was announced that if it could 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.280

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.739
 without having the light of the onu or del 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.290
 safety advice because they know that in 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.879
 the security council will have the veto 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.820
 of Russia in China and surely have 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.430
 prepared another way to be able to attack 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.409
 to Syria if the green light of the council of 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.429
 Mine safety or 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:13.759
 yes, we would like to know about giving 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:15.619
 military incursion into Syria that should 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.090
 make that country that should be Syrian 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.189
 to protect yourself and the community 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.470
 international what should be the 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.750
 come from the international community 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.030
 the international community first has 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.030
 to learn from the history of what 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.680
 happened in irak in 2003 the community 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.600
 international what you have to do is 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.670
 support the Syrian people and stop any 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.200
 type of an intervention an aggression 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.580
 that I call her no is not a 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.490
 intervention if it is not an aggression 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:49.020
 military against Syria the only solution 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:53.100
 in Syria is a political solution not a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.380
 military solution if it happens or if there will be a 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.990
 military admission and intervention 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.080
 military against Syria this could lead 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.470
 to the entire region to a war 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.700
 that envelop many countries and 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.850
 can be extended to others if 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.460
 devil who can defend himself is with the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.440
 missiles you have with the defense area 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.660
 what he has and what he has to do 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.200
 any army of any country 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.880
 they have to defend the land the country is 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.210
 a town but what you have to do 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.900
 international community is to stop this 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.750
 intervention and say to usa and england 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.060
 and even your allies that have to 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.490
 wait at least until you have 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.380
 results we know that the observers 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.690
 So far they have not had any 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.209
 result by visiting the sites where 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.459
 they say there was an attack with weapons 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.190
 We still do not have any results 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.800
 does not have results that's why they do not have the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.520
 right to intervene or even think about 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.590
 to intervene militarily in Syria 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.150

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.740
 have attended to distant news 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.740
