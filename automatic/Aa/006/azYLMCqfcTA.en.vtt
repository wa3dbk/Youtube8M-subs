00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.680 

and<00:01:26.950> then<00:01:27.460> it's<00:01:27.610> time<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:27.820> use<00:01:28.120> the<00:01:28.240> flattening

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.600 
and then it's time to use the flattening
iron<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.290> what<00:01:29.440> I<00:01:29.470> do<00:01:29.590> is<00:01:29.740> kind<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.010> section<00:01:30.430> my

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
iron so what I do is kind of section my

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.470 
iron so what I do is kind of section my
hair<00:01:30.790> off<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.510> then<00:01:32.230> twist<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:32.860> like<00:01:33.100> so<00:01:33.490> with

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
hair off and then twist it like so with

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.650 
hair off and then twist it like so with
the<00:01:34.630> flattening<00:01:34.990> iron<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.400> used<00:01:36.760> the<00:01:37.150> pointy

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
the flattening iron so I used the pointy

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.570 
the flattening iron so I used the pointy
end<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.930> my<00:01:38.140> comb<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.740> lift<00:01:38.980> up<00:01:39.160> the<00:01:39.280> section

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
end of my comb to lift up the section

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.330 
end of my comb to lift up the section
that<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.030> want<00:01:40.090> to<00:01:40.300> style<00:01:40.540> and<00:01:40.960> then<00:01:41.770> I<00:01:42.070> just

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
that I want to style and then I just

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.420 
that I want to style and then I just
take<00:01:43.300> the<00:01:43.540> flattening<00:01:43.930> iron<00:01:44.050> and<00:01:44.440> curve<00:01:45.010> it<00:01:45.220> or

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
take the flattening iron and curve it or

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.560 
take the flattening iron and curve it or
just<00:01:46.119> bend<00:01:46.420> it<00:01:46.630> outwards<00:01:47.170> like<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.340> is

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
just bend it outwards like so so that is

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590 
just bend it outwards like so so that is
rounded<00:01:49.570> out<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.590> while<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:51.310> style<00:01:52.000> my<00:01:52.090> hair<00:01:52.360> it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
rounded out so while I style my hair it

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.050 
rounded out so while I style my hair it
is<00:01:52.720> also<00:01:52.900> dried<00:01:53.380> from<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:54.580> flattening<00:01:54.910> iron

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
is also dried from the flattening iron

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.940 
is also dried from the flattening iron

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
styling my bangs so I go through my

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.410 
styling my bangs so I go through my
entire<00:02:11.170> bangs<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.830> couple<00:02:12.100> of<00:02:12.160> times<00:02:12.459> to<00:02:13.390> make

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
entire bangs a couple of times to make

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.780 
entire bangs a couple of times to make
sure<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:14.200> everything<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.650> curved<00:02:15.040> properly

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
sure that everything is curved properly

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.940 
sure that everything is curved properly
so<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.030> go<00:02:16.180> through<00:02:16.420> like<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.050> top<00:02:17.320> layers<00:02:17.590> and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
so I go through like the top layers and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.800 
so I go through like the top layers and
then<00:02:18.040> make<00:02:18.400> sure<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:18.910> lift<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.480> get<00:02:19.630> the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
then make sure that I lift to get the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.040 
then make sure that I lift to get the
lower<00:02:20.290> layers<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:21.220> my<00:02:21.760> bangs<00:02:22.000> as<00:02:22.270> well<00:02:22.570> so<00:02:22.870> that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
lower layers of my bangs as well so that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.140 
lower layers of my bangs as well so that
everything<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.500> nice<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.709> curled<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.520> it's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
everything is nice and curled and it's

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.090 
everything is nice and curled and it's
important<00:02:25.510> not<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.690> forget<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.200> sides<00:02:26.500> too

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
important not to forget the sides too

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.890 
important not to forget the sides too
because<00:02:27.520> that's<00:02:27.760> where<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.300> tends<00:02:28.570> to<00:02:28.690> be

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
because that's where it tends to be

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.500 
because that's where it tends to be
tricky<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.830> style<00:02:30.130> if<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.489> haven't<00:02:30.820> curled<00:02:31.299> my

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
tricky to style if I haven't curled my

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.729 
tricky to style if I haven't curled my
hair<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.940> just<00:02:34.330> making<00:02:34.810> my<00:02:34.930> way<00:02:34.959> through<00:02:35.170> takes

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
hair so just making my way through takes

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:36.960 
hair so just making my way through takes
me<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> couple<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.250> minutes<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.670> do<00:02:36.790> this

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
me a couple of minutes to do this

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.910 
me a couple of minutes to do this
process<00:02:37.420> but<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:37.780> not<00:02:38.019> too<00:02:38.230> tedious<00:02:38.470> it's

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
process but it's not too tedious it's

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:48.240 
process but it's not too tedious it's
totally<00:02:39.340> worth<00:02:39.519> it

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.910 

once<00:02:49.180> I'm<00:02:49.390> done<00:02:49.540> with<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.020> I'm<00:02:50.440> happy<00:02:50.800> with

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
once I'm done with that I'm happy with

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.640 
once I'm done with that I'm happy with
the<00:02:51.040> shape<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.610> shove<00:02:52.540> my<00:02:52.570> flattening<00:02:53.080> iron<00:02:53.290> off

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
the shape I shove my flattening iron off

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.340 
the shape I shove my flattening iron off
and<00:02:54.040> just<00:02:54.640> spray<00:02:55.270> my<00:02:55.650> bangs<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:56.980> place<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:58.350> get

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
and just spray my bangs in place I get

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.260 
and just spray my bangs in place I get
out<00:02:59.440> my<00:02:59.470> trusty<00:03:00.100> comb<00:03:00.400> again<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.970> sort<00:03:01.150> of

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
lift where I feel like I need to in

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.700 
lift where I feel like I need to in
order<00:03:03.460> for<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:04.180> get<00:03:04.300> straight<00:03:04.810> maybe

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
order for it to get straight maybe

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.560 
order for it to get straight maybe
