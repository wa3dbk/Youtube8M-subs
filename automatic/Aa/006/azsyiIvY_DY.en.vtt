00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
way as you can see in spawn why don't

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.849 
way as you can see in spawn why don't
you<00:03:25.790> just<00:03:26.000> play<00:03:26.690> around<00:03:26.840> for<00:03:27.169> a<00:03:27.199> second<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.590> top

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
you just play around for a second on top

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.289
