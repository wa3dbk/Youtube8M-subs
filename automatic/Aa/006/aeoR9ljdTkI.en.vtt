and I just think they knew settle in
oeuvres<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:56.989> find<00:01:57.530> their<00:01:57.739> groove<00:01:57.770> because

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
oeuvres and find their groove because

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.800 
oeuvres and find their groove because
one<00:01:58.459> in<00:01:58.579> five<00:01:58.759> is<00:01:58.939> not<00:01:59.149> a<00:01:59.179> good<00:01:59.360> start<00:01:59.509> for<00:01:59.719> them
