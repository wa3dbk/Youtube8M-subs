if i choose to wear them and it wear
eyelashes<00:02:34.680> every<00:02:34.980> single<00:02:35.280> day<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:35.730> i<00:02:35.850> was

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
eyelashes every single day but if i was

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.290 
eyelashes every single day but if i was
to<00:02:36.090> wear<00:02:36.360> them<00:02:36.570> for<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:37.680> normal<00:02:38.190> everyday<00:02:38.760> lash

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
to wear them for a normal everyday lash

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.780 
to wear them for a normal everyday lash
then<00:02:39.900> i'd<00:02:40.680> wear<00:02:41.010> these<00:02:41.160> ones<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:41.670> they're

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
then i'd wear these ones and they're

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.060 
then i'd wear these ones and they're
much<00:02:41.970> thinner<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.720> they<00:02:43.440> look<00:02:43.740> more<00:02:44.010> natural

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
much thinner and they look more natural

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.340 
much thinner and they look more natural
skin<00:02:44.760> I've<00:02:45.180> actually<00:02:45.540> got<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> picture<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.200> me

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
skin I've actually got a picture of me

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.010 
skin I've actually got a picture of me
wearing<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.890> fun<00:02:47.130> they<00:02:47.970> are<00:02:48.120> really<00:02:48.450> not<00:02:48.600> nice

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
wearing is fun they are really not nice

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.990 
wearing is fun they are really not nice
they're<00:02:49.440> really<00:02:49.560> strong<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
they're really strong so this is the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.699 
they're really strong so this is the
difference<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.600> this<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.170> thicker<00:02:52.410> one

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
difference that this is the thicker one

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.930 
difference that this is the thicker one
and<00:02:53.520> that's<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:55.040> natural<00:02:56.040> one<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.730> can

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
and that's the natural one so you can

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.940 
and that's the natural one so you can
actually<00:02:57.090> see<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.570> difference<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.770> the

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
actually see the difference in the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.880 
actually see the difference in the
thickness<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.700> was<00:02:59.850> more<00:03:00.030> fuller<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.720> more

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
thickness this was more fuller and more

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.320 
thickness this was more fuller and more
dramatical<00:03:01.890> looking<00:03:02.220> that's<00:03:02.400> why<00:03:02.520> uses<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.120> lot

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
dramatical looking that's why uses a lot

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.080 
dramatical looking that's why uses a lot
in<00:03:03.510> my<00:03:03.540> makeup<00:03:03.810> video<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.430> use<00:03:05.610> these<00:03:05.850> one

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
in my makeup video and I use these one

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.520 
in my makeup video and I use these one
for<00:03:06.300> every<00:03:06.510> day<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.230> get<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.380> lot<00:03:07.470> of

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
for every day so you can get a lot of

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.590 
for every day so you can get a lot of
different<00:03:07.620> types<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.459> was<00:03:09.209> really<00:03:09.480> really

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
different types I was really really

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.620 
different types I was really really
recommend<00:03:10.200> these<00:03:10.380> they<00:03:11.010> were<00:03:11.070> like<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.550> first

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
recommend these they were like the first

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.510 
recommend these they were like the first
no<00:03:12.630> they<00:03:12.780> wasn't<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.860> first<00:03:14.070> message<00:03:14.280> I

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
no they wasn't the first message I

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.580 
no they wasn't the first message I
brought<00:03:14.790> was<00:03:14.970> from<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.630> drugstore<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:16.530> i

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
brought was from the drugstore but i

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.500 
brought was from the drugstore but i
think<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.430> drugstore<00:03:17.880> ones<00:03:18.030> are<00:03:18.209> not<00:03:18.330> worth

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
think the drugstore ones are not worth

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.240 
think the drugstore ones are not worth
it<00:03:18.780> because<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.230> can<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:19.440> use<00:03:19.650> them<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> few

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
it because you can just use them a few

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.040 
it because you can just use them a few
times<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.850> then<00:03:20.910> they<00:03:21.150> cost<00:03:21.420> as<00:03:21.630> much<00:03:21.660> money

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
times and then they cost as much money

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.960 
times and then they cost as much money
and<00:03:22.950> if<00:03:23.070> you're<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.250> beginner<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.760> you've

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
and if you're a beginner and you've

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.240 
and if you're a beginner and you've
never<00:03:24.090> born<00:03:24.570> eyelashes<00:03:25.140> on<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.950> can<00:03:26.100> buy

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
never born eyelashes on you can buy

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.220 
never born eyelashes on you can buy
these<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.820> even<00:03:27.360> if<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.600> mess<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.989> your

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
these and even if you mess up your

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.960 
these and even if you mess up your
eyelashes<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.860> doesn't<00:03:29.160> matter<00:03:29.340> then<00:03:29.880> it

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
eyelashes it doesn't matter then it

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.630 
eyelashes it doesn't matter then it
costs<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.390> lot<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.570> money<00:03:30.920> so<00:03:31.920> if<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.220> do<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> lot

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
costs a lot of money so if you do a lot

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.949 
costs a lot of money so if you do a lot
of<00:03:32.730> eyelashes<00:03:33.390> you<00:03:33.600> know
