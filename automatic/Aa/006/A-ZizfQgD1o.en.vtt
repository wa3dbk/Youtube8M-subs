for<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:06.030> series<00:04:06.390> i<00:04:06.420> think<00:04:07.130> at<00:04:08.130> least<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.489> my

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
for the series i think at least in my

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.500 
for the series i think at least in my
opinion<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.269> liked<00:04:09.630> it<00:04:09.870> on<00:04:10.049> but<00:04:10.730> then<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:12.269> was

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
opinion I liked it on but then it was

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.990
