 I'm not going to keep a secret about Milan. 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.850

 and milk 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.490
 and to make the cover three eggs and a cup of 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.270
 sugar you will need a plastic sacolinha to form the source 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.400
 to start preparing you should put in a bowl like this a 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.240
 margarine and sugar 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.770
 a little later then put more sugar that knocks again until it becomes a 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.770
 cream and 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.200
 now go the sour cream this time you have to move with your hands 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 then add a cup of freshly ground peanut 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.340
 profit today does everything to form the way that way 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.860
 now let's assemble first you must wet each milk cookies well 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.860
 placed on the sides and bottom of the mold with a 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.720
 in a cry now it's the turn of the peanut stuffing sugarcane 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.670
 a and then 18 more 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.020
 is what always interspersed with a cruel regime 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.820
 on board the pilot the next step is to take to the refrigerator and close by a 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.129
 hour 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.229
 after waiting the right time with 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:17.929
 just take the plastic and turn the form upside down in practice 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.569
 What is missing now is so close. 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.819
 separate the eggs he had only the clear potatoes 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.809

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.599
 - Lastly is if it is worth the cover over one side 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.629
 category pie with peanuts 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:55.840

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.129
 this door and be quiet without doing anything 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.879

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.669
 in a duel 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.709

 this past proposition that people can do 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.539
