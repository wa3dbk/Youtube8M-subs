00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello how about in this video I'm going to this 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.730
 teach them how to reset the password in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.049
 an exclusive satellite to 215 very well what 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.040
 what they have to do first of all is 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.750
 remove the ram 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.750
 in the two modules 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.740
 a little closer to the light both 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.800
 modules 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.029
 and they will locate here in 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.029
 that one that says 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 triple x and then they are 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:43.290
 500 and what they are going to do is that good 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.210
 they remove the hard drive too and this one 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.330
 remove the current 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.770
 obviously and leoneses that are going to join 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.720
 these 2 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.360
 louis all 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 then they will raise the 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:02.140
 and already with the raised then I thought about 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.690
 a laptop and they will remove the password 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.400
 of the bios sometimes it takes a few 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.920
 times actually on this computer and 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.350
 I think he tries like about 8 times and already 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.060
 suddenly she stopped asking password in 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.770
 these models does not matter that they take them 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.190
 the battery of the video will not prescribe the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.159
 password is very important that you are 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.800
 a memory 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.670
 the good thing in bridging 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.050
 and if you can see it, we're like that because 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.120
 all the other videos reached us 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.300
 see why I'm doing this apart 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.470
 to bring it here in Spanish and good 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.100
 raise those 2 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.940
 the garment 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.620
 and they do not stop raising it 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.360
 and when it starts 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.960
 and the moment you stop asking 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.270
 the password of the bios any doubt 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.930

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.020
