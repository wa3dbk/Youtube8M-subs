I<00:00:02.300> was<00:00:03.300> wondering<00:00:03.510> if<00:00:03.929> we<00:00:04.020> had<00:00:04.440> we<00:00:04.770> wanted<00:00:05.009> to

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
I was wondering if we had we wanted to

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.860 
I was wondering if we had we wanted to
update<00:00:05.220> our<00:00:05.430> presentation<00:00:06.150> rubric<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:06.540> this

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
update our presentation rubric for this

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.549 
update our presentation rubric for this
tour<00:00:07.200> down<00:00:07.429> projects<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.639> put<00:00:09.300> major<00:00:09.960> points

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
tour down projects and put major points

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.100 
tour down projects and put major points
down<00:00:10.830> for<00:00:11.130> people<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.429> do<00:00:11.580> fancy<00:00:12.110> powerpoints

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
down for people to do fancy powerpoints

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.350 
down for people to do fancy powerpoints
it<00:00:13.559> should<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:13.920> like<00:00:14.070> valued<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
it should be like valued that the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.529 
it should be like valued that the
powerpoints<00:00:16.260> are<00:00:16.410> simple<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:18.180> need<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.449> be

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
powerpoints are simple we need to be

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.210 
powerpoints are simple we need to be
throwing<00:00:18.990> elements<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.619> principles<00:00:19.770> of

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
throwing elements and principles of

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.210 
throwing elements and principles of
design<00:00:20.400> into<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.420> language<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.740> rubric

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
design into the language and the rubric

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.130 
design into the language and the rubric
so<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.760> not<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.970> matter<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.300> simplicity<00:00:24.810> it's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
so it's not a matter of simplicity it's

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.170 
so it's not a matter of simplicity it's
a<00:00:25.289> matter<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.619> good<00:00:26.160> design<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
a matter of good design on the
