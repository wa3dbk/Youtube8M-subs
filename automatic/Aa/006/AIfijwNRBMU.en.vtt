throughout the game whether you're
underground<00:01:56.729> or<00:01:57.030> aboveground<00:01:57.140> you'll<00:01:58.140> come

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
underground or aboveground you'll come

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.690 
underground or aboveground you'll come
around<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.649> corner<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.250> these<00:01:59.399> just

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
around the corner and get these just

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.730 
around the corner and get these just
amazing<00:02:00.420> views<00:02:03.020> we<00:02:04.020> want<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.319> have<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.470> heavy

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
being up in a post is the better area

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.610 
being up in a post is the better area
cuz<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.150> get<00:02:12.269> a<00:02:12.300> view<00:02:12.600> as<00:02:12.900> more<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.530> a

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
cuz you can get a view as more of a

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140 
cuz you can get a view as more of a
melee<00:02:13.800> character<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.519> can<00:02:14.640> sit<00:02:14.880> there<00:02:15.060> and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
melee character you can sit there and

melee character you can sit there and
protect<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.810> area<00:02:17.300> well<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.780> one<00:02:18.959> of

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
protect that area well this is one of

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.930 
protect that area well this is one of
the<00:02:19.110> final<00:02:19.440> areas<00:02:19.739> when<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.250> first<00:02:20.430> started<00:02:20.910> we

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
the final areas when we first started we

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.940 
the final areas when we first started we
talked<00:02:21.269> about<00:02:21.420> doing<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:22.019> tower<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.560> doing

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
talked about doing a tower and doing

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.320 
talked about doing a tower and doing
something<00:02:23.190> big<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.519> it's<00:02:23.670> been<00:02:23.819> done<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.209> many

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
something big but it's been done so many

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.030 
something big but it's been done so many
times<00:02:24.540> when<00:02:24.750> we<00:02:24.810> thought<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.260> know<00:02:25.410> let's<00:02:25.799> do

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
times when we thought you know let's do

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.729 
times when we thought you know let's do
a<00:02:26.310> giant<00:02:26.790> pit<00:02:27.060> instead<00:02:27.239> there<00:02:28.080> might<00:02:28.380> be<00:02:28.410> a

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
a giant pit instead there might be a

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.699 
a giant pit instead there might be a
little<00:02:28.920> bit<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.310> spider<00:02:29.730> problem<00:02:29.880> down<00:02:30.420> here

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
little bit of a spider problem down here

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.160 
little bit of a spider problem down here
these<00:02:31.709> big<00:02:32.100> pieces<00:02:32.549> of<00:02:32.760> basalt<00:02:33.420> rock<00:02:33.690> they

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
these big pieces of basalt rock they

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.590 
these big pieces of basalt rock they
actually<00:02:34.320> were<00:02:34.590> modeled<00:02:34.980> out<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.340> 3d<00:02:35.760> first<00:02:36.090> so

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
actually were modeled out in 3d first so

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.199 
actually were modeled out in 3d first so
it<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:36.930> has<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.380> very<00:02:37.769> sculpted<00:02:38.760> feel<00:02:38.970> I

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
it really has a very sculpted feel I

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.030 
it really has a very sculpted feel I
want<00:02:39.690> them<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.900> feel<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.380> they're<00:02:40.650> stepping

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
want them to feel like they're stepping

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.430 
want them to feel like they're stepping
on<00:02:41.280> hard<00:02:41.579> ground<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.390> they're<00:02:42.630> climbing<00:02:43.290> up

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
on hard ground and they're climbing up

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.920 
on hard ground and they're climbing up
solid<00:02:43.739> stairs<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.579> interacting<00:02:45.420> with<00:02:45.600> every

it's<00:02:54.680> not<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.250> typical<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.420> console<00:02:57.079> game<00:02:57.319> to

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
it's not so typical in a console game to

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.030 
it's not so typical in a console game to
be<00:02:57.739> able<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.250> create<00:02:58.459> your<00:02:58.700> own<00:02:59.060> world<00:02:59.480> I<00:03:00.040> can't

be able to create your own world I can't

be able to create your own world I can't
thank<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.430> enough<00:03:01.849> you<00:03:02.299> know<00:03:02.420> what<00:03:02.659> happens

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
thank you enough you know what happens

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.479 
thank you enough you know what happens
if<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.170> could<00:03:03.379> build<00:03:03.590> my<00:03:03.709> own<00:03:03.769> dungeons<00:03:04.310> and

that was the founding principles of

crucible what we allow the players to do

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.250 
crucible what we allow the players to do
is<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.769> know<00:03:09.890> jump<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.430> there<00:03:10.930> grab<00:03:11.930> these

unique levels that we created put them

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.559 
unique levels that we created put them
in<00:03:14.629> a<00:03:14.930> map<00:03:15.640> populate<00:03:16.640> them<00:03:16.849> with<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.120> enemies

the ability to be the game maker at

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.770 
the ability to be the game maker at
first<00:03:31.549> one<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.970> idea<00:03:32.209> was<00:03:32.329> pitched<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.629> me<00:03:32.750> I

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
first one the idea was pitched to me I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.839 
first one the idea was pitched to me I
actually<00:03:32.900> thought<00:03:33.170> we're<00:03:33.799> crazy<00:03:34.129> I<00:03:34.459> was<00:03:34.639> based

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
actually thought we're crazy I was based

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.059 
actually thought we're crazy I was based
or<00:03:35.030> everywhere<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.109> team<00:03:36.409> goes<00:03:36.709> in<00:03:36.889> there

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
or everywhere so this team goes in there

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.649 
or everywhere so this team goes in there
and<00:03:37.250> they're<00:03:37.790> actually<00:03:37.940> making<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.359> levels

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
and they're actually making the levels
