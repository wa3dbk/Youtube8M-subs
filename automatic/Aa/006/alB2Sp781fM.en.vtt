00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.730
 so welcome to or mw2 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.560
 ruler on donations with the pharma 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 gmbh is very cool is a very good one 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.320
 aim at the start but actually I would 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.119
 so do not upload something I have it 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.290
 played a bit mw2 yesterday and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.520
 You can tell that at rum I wanted to know 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.800
 as the two witnesses had one again 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.790
 bit not only black ops 1 is 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.990
 find a little variety again 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.730
 I actually completely new I could yes 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.500
 no lady newcastle unfortunately there 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.879
 such a sacrifice somehow at 100 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.520
 score was the itching and hewn 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.300
 i already had gentleman to double new 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.620
 little sad what gm wants is the same 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.300
 important could definitely very with 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.250
 It is easy to get in from aim 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.510
 well I did it yesterday what I considered 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.610
 could have been a little could the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.409
 very bad last days generally 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.540
 I'm always asleep at 5 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.129
 6 o'clock sleep I do not know why 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.269
 and I have a bit about youtube 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.010
 came to crete I'll do it anyway 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.330
 really ok on which I do not know I can 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.710
 Do not know why do not ask me why 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.720
 i came across youtube after i think 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.460
 not escaped and I say to myself thoughtfully 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.409
 and since he is actually main 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.060
 channel so without you one could be yes 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.650
 actually nothing 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.150
 and times when I delete something like that 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.590
 so have already go subscribers 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.420
 have liked that jutta when she's up 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.950
 a canal was seen and I have 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.450
 I think because you have your main channel time 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.729
 So you all have the chance to really enjoy each one of them 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.690
 you can watch this video on my 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.250
 be represented 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.560
 So do not know now 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.270
 any with the whole video though 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.620
 such a 30 seconds audio track I have 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.120
 Anyone can consider me 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.230
 Send in so that's what you do 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.650
 not now after this video 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.180
 that's just the basic idea 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.070
 Well about 30 seconds 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.270
 audio track that can send me one 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.710
 you can somehow know each other 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.020
 do not leave anything funny 1 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.040
 I know your name knows what I friends 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.620
 greet or something like me so much so 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.820
 as if I have the software but now 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.260
 maybe that would celebrate some 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.880
 that you somehow do not know 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.980
 each other with your friends somehow 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.570
 what's on the ears on a canal 30 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.170
 Seconds so no gross insult 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.520
 or something 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.470
 but somehow something in the direction 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.600
 that one just says so here I am me 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.920
 I'm Lukas or so I'm fan of you 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.720
 something one direction is no idea 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.300
 that I mean that you all his 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.830
 30 seconds so 30 good time on something like that 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.090
 to say clearly I have it too 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.110
 some gameplay some I start 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.940
 I will not use it because I am now 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.409
 again very much what would like to bring something 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.120
 So I want my own gameplays and 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:17.129
 I will be the host for that 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.480
 use that I hold only the gamer is 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.409
 Do not stop sending me 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.940
 were in vain so that they directly 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.260
 I've uploaded that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.609
 percent and I will 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.439
 wait your whole is at the end 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.879
 It was actually so cool so it is 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.550
 a little subscriber special that you 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.410
 So whether you 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.670
 Let's see if you know that 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.810
 So just want to celebrate in the first 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.330

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.340

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.380
 Of course I can be a channel 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.090
 I did that yesterday so I got that 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.840

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.120

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.470
