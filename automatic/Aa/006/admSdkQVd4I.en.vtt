00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
work great they have saved me many a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.179 
work great they have saved me many a
time<00:00:23.189> such<00:00:24.029> as<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:28.500> durability<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:29.099> these

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
time such as the durability of these

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.980 
time such as the durability of these
pads<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.609> not<00:00:29.849> what<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> would<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.480> hoped<00:00:30.720> for

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
pads is not what I would have hoped for

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.549 
pads is not what I would have hoped for
for<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.679> pad<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.700> my<00:00:32.910> knees<00:00:33.090> here's<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.140> one

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
for a pad for my knees here's what one

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.520 
for a pad for my knees here's what one
would<00:00:34.739> look<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.100> after<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:36.260> two<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.500> three

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
would look like after about two to three

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.619 
would look like after about two to three
months<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:43.969> this<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.120> is<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> little<00:00:45.390> less

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
months and this one is a little less

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
months and this one is a little less
thrashed<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.829> squishy

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
thrashed but you can see the squishy

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.979 
thrashed but you can see the squishy
parts<00:00:47.820> still<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.180> there<00:00:48.300> hasn't<00:00:48.629> fallen<00:00:48.780> out

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
parts still in there hasn't fallen out

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.130 
parts still in there hasn't fallen out
yet<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.610> reason<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.449> has<00:00:51.629> happened<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
yet the reason that this has happened is

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.580 
yet the reason that this has happened is
because<00:00:52.879> there<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.780> there's<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> base

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
because there is this there's the base

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.770 
because there is this there's the base
of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> knee<00:00:56.039> pad<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.579> then<00:00:57.180> there<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
of the knee pad and then there is the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.770 
of the knee pad and then there is the
elevated<00:00:58.469> area<00:00:59.039> there's<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> stitch<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.420> patch

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
elevated area there's a stitch on patch

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.560 
elevated area there's a stitch on patch
around<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:02.219> squishy<00:01:02.910> part<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.449> is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
around the squishy part that is

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.450 
around the squishy part that is
cushioning<00:01:04.080> your<00:01:04.110> knee<00:01:04.409> when<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.040> fall<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.369> an

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
cushioning your knee when you fall in an

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
cushioning your knee when you fall in an
uncontrolled<00:01:06.150> way<00:01:06.350> generally<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.470> will<00:01:07.590> hit

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
uncontrolled way generally you will hit

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.289 
uncontrolled way generally you will hit
the<00:01:07.950> side<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.689> that<00:01:10.189> will<00:01:11.189> rip<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.700> part<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the side and that will rip this part and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.210 
the side and that will rip this part and
then<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.350> it'll<00:01:13.560> look<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:14.040> with

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
then and then it'll look like this with

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.160 
then and then it'll look like this with
the<00:01:14.310> pad<00:01:14.520> sticking<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.119> then<00:01:15.299> these<00:01:15.960> got

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the pad sticking out and then these got

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
the pad sticking out and then these got
really<00:01:16.530> shredded<00:01:16.860> they<00:01:17.130> were<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.610> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
really shredded they were like that and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.429 
really shredded they were like that and
when<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.450> skating<00:01:18.659> around<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.259> pad<00:01:19.409> just

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
when I was skating around the pad just

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.940 
when I was skating around the pad just
fell<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.159> fall<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.790> lot<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.619> that<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.799> why

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
fell out I fall a lot and that is why

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.499 
fell out I fall a lot and that is why
this<00:01:23.009> happened<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.729> protected<00:01:24.180> me<00:01:24.270> pretty

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
this happened it protected me pretty

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
they do slide off a little easier than

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.010 
they do slide off a little easier than

comfortable<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:03.570> found<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.259> these<00:02:04.469> are

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
comfortable I have found that these are

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.429 
comfortable I have found that these are
a<00:02:05.189> little<00:02:05.340> more<00:02:05.430> durable<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.509> cannot<00:02:07.049> replace

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
a little more durable you cannot replace

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.320 
a little more durable you cannot replace
the<00:02:07.799> plastic<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.489> these<00:02:08.700> where<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.000> can't<00:02:09.239> on

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the plastic on these where you can't on

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.089 
the plastic on these where you can't on

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
those because I don't

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.890

over the park pads they will last longer

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.000 
over the park pads they will last longer
they<00:02:26.069> won't<00:02:26.280> slip<00:02:26.459> off<00:02:26.730> as<00:02:27.000> easily<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:28.010> you
