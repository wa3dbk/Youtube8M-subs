anyway here you go guess what maybe
three<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.739> four<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.910> small

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
three or four here on that small

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.510 
three or four here on that small
container<00:00:43.850> I'm<00:00:44.850> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> start<00:00:45.530> maybe<00:00:46.530> maybe

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
container I'm going to start maybe maybe

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.040 
container I'm going to start maybe maybe
not<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.879> year<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.829> I'll<00:00:49.829> start<00:00:50.760> planting<00:00:51.750> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
not this year but I'll start planting it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.220 
not this year but I'll start planting it
in<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:53.039> bigger<00:00:53.340> container

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.820
