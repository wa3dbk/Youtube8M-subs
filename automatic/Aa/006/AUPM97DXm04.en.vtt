 voodoo net This display is not 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:37.520
 It is in a 103.5 inch 4 inch 2 inch flexible ored display 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:44.239
 There are three major technologies used here. 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:52.300
 In that one has been Hitotsugako of that tft side of a place called that scene acos 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:56.470
 It becomes Oh related to the transistor of the process large increase in technology 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:02.379
 Sharp has adopted cac os as smart child 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:08.909
 Of the three crystals meat cac tool Zoni typified by an oxide semiconductor 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.909
 The arrangement of atoms grows strongly along the c-axis and has such a structure 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:21.680
 cac os has high uniformity of crystal orientation 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:28.310
 It has the characteristic that it is excellent in the tightness of the tft property because it does not have a clear dragonfly . 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:33.890
 With this technology, you can configure that channel edge type tft so it is very high 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.320
 It is also the child's tft that can realize a fine display and the brain 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.770
 By using the characteristic called Marion 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:47.409
 You can integrate the circuit with the gate driver 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:51.880
 Then Toshimashite two eyes two eyes that do it but is 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:58.329
 Oh Red's Technology There is a technology of Deaulet . 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:03.819
 We use the official called white + color filters in the much more possible to use this method 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:07.050
 After all that high-definition display is relatively easy to do well and art yield high 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:13.500
 It has the feature of being able to 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:15.720
 Then the third technology is to make the display made here flexible 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.280
 Become a technology of 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:25.830
 We use our own method of peeling heaven and earth 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.240
 If the element made on the glass substrate is opposite to the base made on the glass substrate 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.390
 Is a color filter 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.780
 To this 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.640
 After putting the el, I will paste it 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:41.810
 Made of glass glass 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:45.550
 If you put a resin base on that high there, it's an all- resin display 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.550
 It is also a feature 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.190
 here Thickness as a panel is 100 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.230
 Another slightly specifically say when the 60 Miku about the very following is a micro Volume 2 is 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.450
 It is a thin display 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.810
 And so that's why weight is about 10g in this approximate size 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.810
 Become 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:40.750
 First of all in the pole 4 Ehime winding
