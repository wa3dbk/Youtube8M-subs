00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.729
 al-libi brazil was like this 

00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:02.690
 brazil agency 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.020
 the most awarded at this year's Cannes Festival, we took advantage of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.320
 found responsible for this whole process until a song 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.070
 popular model at the festival will face 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.070
 have a chat with him 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.329
 will be that in Brazil we beat a superpar population as targets and with 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.850
 talking about ugt growth and creatively speaking because it is this 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.780
 growth was more than confirmed at the country's largest advertising festival. 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.219
 world the festival of cannes and there were many lions that is the only one and took 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.909
 around here 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.889
 and I'm with both of us now, and we'll talk about it, until the 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:52.830
 consecration your work 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.190
 it's a philosophy I think consecration is the word 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 will be three years old now they want to have this work 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.359
 I was missing the time to speak 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.670
 it seems but it is not 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.829
 we do not exist but as sadness of the moment when it was read 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.430
 because I presented fantasy 'cool it has enough I commune with history 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.260
 The fabric that is said tori that I think papa paulo vi brasil this festival 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.990
 the more so we want more people who are more next year the people who are 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.190
 more nice work on the street 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.400
 biden that is a speech in the senate in sÃ£o paulo 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.270
 This crowd is not so unhappy. 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.850
 because this was already this is a work that already happened that had already been 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.930
 done 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.470
 and now yes 2011 is blank a conditioned blank form page 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.650
 then the at the pcdob in thesis in bhopal foot on the floor 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.719
 and the skal portunity the agent would have to speak 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.619
 so I thought to myself without success everyone commenting on everyone talking and 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.000
 applauding 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.690
 for coutinho the truth about this work that you do with the band 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.660
 team in brazil here 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.780
 britney has an incredible job too 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.160
 ltd 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.300
 is done by the rest of the world where Brazil is behind says it is very 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.549
 cool to do with schools on January 25 when you fell victim to a year 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.539
 ney two years and a year and a half two years 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:20.229
 and is a superinteressante account without the brand tv dolls a brand 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:21.719
 recognized in the 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.619
 creatively and then we took action 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:30.069
 the blow made it mean that it is something that - yes we were accustomed to see 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.819
 the newsletter was passionate to do so 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.119
 This genius, I think, if we had a lot of 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.069
 if it were not for the commitment of the 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.139
 of creation and believes that having a good idea 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.059
 banking customer service is cool let's do it 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.159
 This is the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.309
 It's easy to come here. 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.289
 The difficult thing is that we worked 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.619
 six or seven months to do that action 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.789
 then the question of persistence 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:07.019
 It's super important last week last week. 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.479
 in the global bulletin and in an agency 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.989
 Talula in the agency 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.179
 and there she 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:18.489
 She gave the lion to us. She said look. 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.289
 in fact about fauna - is already out 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:24.949
 was also to sanction we made the militian deep traffickers and 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.829
 snacks to the markets but the cool thing is that precisely whoever wins 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.289
 like anyone 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:35.469
 6 2 it was here that we are going to do next year that will be better than 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:35.909
 that 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:36.889
 this is really cool 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.889
 predicts frost photo 3 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:43.589
 the representatives about the dean 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.629
 anyone who needs it 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.159
 Interest is the father himself. 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.639
 after winning the athletic-mg had the reduced price 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.919
 now 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.449
 by chance 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.449
 now 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.689
 the author 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.689
 the organ 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.650
 vanderlei 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.270
 I wish you two are talking a little bit 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.150
 it's true, they said they did not start lying down now there was no time 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.070
 for the year 2010 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.370
 this is how the agency wants to continue 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.870
 who if positional continues to work I think the footprint of pt continues 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.319
 making keep trying to do 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.509
 what to do with what we put in the air 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.819
 I was very happy indeed of the people 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.990
 pulling us up and I think that always improving I think so 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.469
 always the chance for you to bring someone better than you join someone else 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:34.749
 with the team 

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:38.289
 I think it's a generalized dissatisfaction with cimpor 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.289
 we arrived here nagle lived a lot where he argued that I think this year 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.620
 it's really cool just see what's possible 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.849
 so I guess 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.270
 We're going back there to win on Monday 1 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.580
 I think so galley 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.789
 will believe even more in the project already was already fishing 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.199
 I was too long trying to make it happen but now with these 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.449
 with these millions for being this year I think we stayed 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.039
 it's an achievement you believe even more 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:12.039
 that feeds that belief 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.449
 if it happens compromises even more and to do more in trip in the mother of the most 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.050
 brutal so I guess this helps everyone screamed 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.580
 even those who 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.479
 can give a little back while the world is difficult the people who should 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:29.169
 be our heart and president specificity because delicious in the 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.139
 suit jacket is where everything happens 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.139
 of the biggest advertising festival in the world wanted to thank 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:40.759
