00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:17.220
 My name is Pablo Saldarriaga I dedicate myself 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:21.770
 to the more rational side to the management with 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.770
 horses whatever their race 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.579
 this is a job that is based on the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.040
 good treatment non-violence in the handling 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.040
 of body language giving signals 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.769
 short whites that the horse can 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.989
 understand this work led 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.620
 approximately 15 years performing 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.739
 you can have the opportunity to be 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.540
 working with monty roberts pad for him 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.650
 and idea and I myself started 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.170
 develop a technique that is the management 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.119
 of rational dressage combined with what 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.390
 is the management of horses 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.390
 Colombian fine 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.790
 horses have right brains and 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.400
 left brain that is something that very 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.420
 few people know the horse in the brain 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.100
 right reacts based on your instincts 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.870
 I explain a horse in the right brain 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.180
 will react to fear will react 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.370
 aggression will react to the one that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.960
 feel attacked and we see that many 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.060
 times with the wild horses in the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.980
 prairies or in the Inca arb where are we going 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.630
 get close to a horse and the horse the 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.900
 reaction that is going to have to come out 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.900
 running away 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.719
 in the left brain do the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.549
 translation and it's where the horse starts 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.039
 to think begins to reason and to solve 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.780
 where does it start to have security and have 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.609
 trust in the people that are the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.649
 that will directly or indirectly have 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:00.119
 with the development of the animal in all its 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.600
 future life then what we will do with 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.289
 this work is to establish a fear of 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.289
 a well-being 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.390
 I do ask people to please 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.019
 man first want the animal what 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.629
 give him proper respect proper treatment 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.849
 and keep it hydrated that they check very 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.650
 well your hardware that check very well 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.870
 the brakes what they wear in the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.760
 mouth a lot of people know about that other 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.810
 people do not even know what it is 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.879
 they lend a horse and go out and start 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.680
 pull him to mistreat him make him bleed from 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.840
 your mouth then please be very 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.400
 soft and that is a cavalcade that the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.879
 they can do as a walk there's no 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.189
 need to squeeze running horses 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.739
 horses but that we're going one step 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:55.519
 where the horse can move with 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:57.770
 ease and without being without being agitated without 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.950
 to be mistreated 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.990
 and let's go down not even every 40 minutes and 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.790
 we loosen the cinch the horse we return 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.670
 and we squeeze it and we can continue the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:12.280
 March I approach him calmly with 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:16.490
 softness I do not touch it but he with his 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.290
 smell begins to register me and 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.800
 we establish a link 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.520
 of friendship trust 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:31.400
 where the important thing is mutual respect 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.400
 between horse and man 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.650
 is to try to show them what is the 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.030
 respect for animals what is the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.460
 way of one taking a horse through 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.860
 body language understanding the 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.740
 mind of the horse understanding their 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.100
 Moods understanding their fears 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.600
 and trying to translate that fear into 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.760
 welfare then in this case 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.250
 we exchange the roles and I step 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.380
 be your predator to be your friend my name 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.630
 it's Pablo Saldarriaga I hope you have them 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.180
 liked the work done today 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.180
 horses are passion and life force
