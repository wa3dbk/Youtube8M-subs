00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.350
 that was a great pity for a generation 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.010
 seven players who could not fulfill their careers as world 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.269
 but fortunately you must the 94 World Cup after the victories very 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.720
 difficult successes but a bad experience for many of us already 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.570
 from there I think it has a great display 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.519
 Roberto irresponsible but many people do not want to get close 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.649
 firefighters lot 4 d 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:27.410
 four basketball selections 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.819
 horford extraordinary situation in ecuador played the final with argentina 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:34.469
 I remember your goal with two processes of the woman and her baby alive a great 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.490
 cupbearer selection 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.890
 Many people do not accept that they think two men members for me ask me 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.160
 has a lot to see in that change of government because of Miguel Mejía Barón 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.110
 we go for that change because he asked me for intervention 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.450
 they say that like any technician of the Pyrenees 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.920
 some changes include some bones 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.620
 France said then that makes the selection 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.470
 therefore the service 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.840
 Mundial Miguel Mejía Barón 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.640
 and if you get to see the clubs that had menotti is very little jealous 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.500
 I think the surprise posture of Suarez Nacho Ambríz 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.140
 I'm going somewhere but there 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.660
 They are the only ones left 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.770
 news agency 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.299
 when going out on the street but that the great work they do well 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.790
 deal with ordinary people 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.990
 very important is considered a single ticket for the playoffs with four 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.960
 tickets what united states 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.960
 I was already described Jorge alcocer 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.630
 the goal is the goal of luis garcía 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.030
 the Spanish endesa - controlled by life 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.030
 and well I think 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.740
 we are left with that little thorn not that I think it has arrived 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.240
 but I think that, as I said 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.060
 jenkins a little left 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.710
 the olympic tournaments pole of the fifth cachirules had stayed there 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.440
 it got lost 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 at 86 'to 90 scored 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.180
 also from the context said 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.089
 the idea is to have an environment 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.089
 before leaving from August 2 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.009
 It is very serious that something has to be done 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.260
 london very difficult for you 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.949
 oil man 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.489
 but it's always handled like that but with the changes 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.219
 the little Norman varela affirmed percent 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.690
 who knows but please 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.159
 it is done very well miguel claro 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.369
 is to enter the age of the treasures of the record is the eternal discussion 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:38.369
 If there were not there 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.369
 that is the reality that possibility was the feeling of the ing 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.499
 Guano has to be respected 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.499
 percent I think this selection as he said 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.709
 the one that will put a taste in your mouth 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.609
 then came the generations said 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.309
 and at the end of the day I think that Mexico is in a very prominent place 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.309
 in peace to everything that was done 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.330
 I had more 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.509
 my life is on top of 1 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:12.119
 I believe that the previous year 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:13.089
 with temporary improvements
