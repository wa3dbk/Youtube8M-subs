him<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.700> figure<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.269> out<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.690> yeah<00:02:44.560> I'm<00:02:44.860> very

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
him to figure it out and yeah I'm very

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.340 
him to figure it out and yeah I'm very
confident<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:46.600> know<00:02:46.720> he<00:02:46.870> will<00:02:46.989> eventually

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
hard which is you know something that

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.410 
hard which is you know something that
you<00:02:54.100> really<00:02:54.190> can't<00:02:54.519> teach<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.819> kid<00:02:54.970> if<00:02:55.120> he<00:02:55.239> works
