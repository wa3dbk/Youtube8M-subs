00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
but I mean I can see it and construct it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.140 
but I mean I can see it and construct it
to<00:01:20.850> 66<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.390> huge<00:01:21.630> although<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.799> mana<00:01:23.070> now<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
to 66 is huge although for mana now the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.700 
to 66 is huge although for mana now the
thing<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.659> reason<00:01:25.020> I'll<00:01:25.110> see<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.560> in

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
thing the reason I'll see this in

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.469 
thing the reason I'll see this in
construction<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.759> we've<00:01:26.880> gotten<00:01:27.299> mark

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
construction is that we've gotten mark

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
construction is that we've gotten mark
it's<00:01:27.659> definitely<00:01:27.930> ?<00:01:28.500> yeah<00:01:28.740> well<00:01:29.100> here's<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
it's definitely ? yeah well here's the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.240 
it's definitely ? yeah well here's the
thing<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.880> 66<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.350> big<00:01:31.710> enough<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.100> deal

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
thing as a 66 it's big enough to deal

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.190 
thing as a 66 it's big enough to deal
with<00:01:32.280> rag<00:01:32.640> tusk<00:01:33.140> but<00:01:35.390> that's<00:01:36.390> almost<00:01:36.630> it's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
with rag tusk but that's almost it's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.710 
with rag tusk but that's almost it's
almost<00:01:37.409> worth<00:01:37.829> giving<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.460> look<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.390> reason

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
almost worth giving it a look the reason

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.969 
almost worth giving it a look the reason
I<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> might<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.590> playable

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
I think it might not be playable

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.289 
I think it might not be playable
constructed<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:41.909> already<00:01:42.060> had
