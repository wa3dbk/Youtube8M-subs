it's really really stressed me out and
I've<00:01:11.700> gone<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.299> why<00:01:13.080> isn't<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.590> system

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
working what has happened I think that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380 
working what has happened I think that
when<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.220> had<00:01:17.369> those<00:01:17.549> flare-ups<00:01:18.150> it's

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
when I have had those flare-ups it's

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
when I have had those flare-ups it's

products in it I started that in the
very<00:02:13.230> beginning<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:14.400> they<00:02:14.520> had<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.820> internal

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
very beginning so they had the internal

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.570

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.899 

when<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.450> recommend<00:04:01.079> this<00:04:01.200> product<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:02.610> answer

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
when I recommend this product the answer

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.179 
when I recommend this product the answer
is<00:04:03.030> yes<00:04:03.239> I<00:04:03.569> would<00:04:04.110> definitely<00:04:04.590> recommend<00:04:04.769> this

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
is yes I would definitely recommend this

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.600 
is yes I would definitely recommend this
product<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.879> think<00:04:06.599> that<00:04:06.870> out<00:04:07.140> of<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.799> lot<00:04:08.459> better

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
product I think that out of a lot better

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.550 
product I think that out of a lot better
on<00:04:08.849> the<00:04:08.970> market<00:04:09.390> at<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.629> moment<00:04:09.659> this<00:04:10.290> one

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
on the market at the moment this one

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.890 
on the market at the moment this one
seems<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.159> have<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.430> really<00:04:11.700> high<00:04:12.000> success<00:04:12.540> rate

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
seems to have a really high success rate

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.470 
seems to have a really high success rate
so<00:04:13.349> again<00:04:13.709> there<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.099> no<00:04:14.280> guarantee<00:04:14.849> even

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
so again there is no guarantee even

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.610 
so again there is no guarantee even
though<00:04:15.569> they<00:04:15.689> put<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:15.930> guarantee<00:04:16.350> on<00:04:16.530> their

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
though they put this guarantee on their

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.890 
though they put this guarantee on their
