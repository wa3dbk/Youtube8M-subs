00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
what I call our beast eyes which is

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.510 
what I call our beast eyes which is
black<00:02:20.880> with<00:02:21.239> just<00:02:21.270> like<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> white<00:02:22.020> glint<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.920> it

black with just like a white glint on it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.280

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
because if you look at a horse really

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.250 
because if you look at a horse really
they're<00:02:25.650> their<00:02:26.450> pupil<00:02:27.450> takes<00:02:27.720> up<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
they're their pupil takes up like the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.440 
they're their pupil takes up like the
entire<00:02:28.620> thing<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.280> looks<00:02:29.430> very<00:02:29.670> black<00:02:29.970> so

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
entire thing so it looks very black so

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.150 
entire thing so it looks very black so
you<00:02:30.510> can't<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.900> can't<00:02:31.110> give<00:02:31.260> animals<00:02:31.739> human
