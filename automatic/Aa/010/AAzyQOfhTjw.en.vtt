00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.050
 I have more information about the case 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.670
 elusive 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.670
 a point-blank shot in a gallery of 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.890
 because of a current 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.130
 for the other 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.230
 who is castell eric has stopped by 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.540
 possession of stolen property stopped by 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.059
 complicity and convicted for attempted 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.280
 sale of stolen merchandise is a perista 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.410
 the team is trying to sell the ruby 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.800
 starwood so he'll be looking for another 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.540
 Perista one that is not dead in 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.780
 I contract the perista we will give with the 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.780
 elusive 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.120
 felicity I need you to activate is the micro 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.440
 of the machine mobile I think the police 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.440
 has a clue about the elusive 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.840
 ah 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.120
 I've heard in the news that elusive 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.920
 escaped 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.250
 I hope the night was not bad 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.409
 all the doubts that such were cool 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.479
 great you can not lie 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.679
 the police and I went in there before 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.460
 that the elusive had the havana or 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.320
 theme changes 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.320
 that micro of yours still works 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.520
 You do not know how to have fun 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.350
 If there is still a signal, you could access the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.790
 police to see what he has stolen the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.070
 I dodge until now what do you think 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.330
 we know that guy is attracted to a guy 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.330
 very concrete antiques 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.760
 if they all look like restoration 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.080
 of the seventh decade of fernando seventh 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.450
 and this says that we do not have life or there is 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.310
 somewhere where they sell or expose 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.520
 objects of that fernando or whatever they are 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.530
 seventh I do not think the people of this vile 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.150
 city â€‹â€‹prefers the Elizabethan era the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.860
 society against cancer will hold a 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.770
 auction to collect panela funds by 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.370
 the night so we could make him leave 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.650
 although something false is not clear that the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.110
 team understands antiques not 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.880
 naughty with nothing that is not authentic 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.190
 and where are we going to get an antiquity 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.180
 Spanish you have no idea how rich 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.180
 what is it or family? 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.030

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.569

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.569
 I wanted to stay 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.270
 today I receive a good signal from the gps that I have 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.420
 put in the brooch of your family I can 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.090
 trace it and talking about more thought that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.819
 could happen if this does not work and the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.450
 ski is long with your pendants 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.400
 the symptoms have tied fatal 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.400
