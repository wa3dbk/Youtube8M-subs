few<00:00:16.260> buttons<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.710> here<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.039> that's<00:00:17.220> button<00:00:17.609> on

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
few buttons on here so that's button on

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.519 
few buttons on here so that's button on
the<00:00:17.850> top<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.660> bottom<00:00:18.990> where<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.350> would

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the top is the bottom where you would

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.710 
the top is the bottom where you would
switch<00:00:19.710> from<00:00:19.770> rotary<00:00:20.520> drawing<00:00:20.939> mode<00:00:21.090> to

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
switch from rotary drawing mode to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
hammer mode or combi tell mode so that's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.750 
hammer mode or combi tell mode so that's
how<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.869> if<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.560> speed<00:00:26.220> selector<00:00:26.550> at

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
how you do that if you speed selector at

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.630 
how you do that if you speed selector at
the<00:00:26.820> top<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.720> two<00:00:28.070> which<00:00:29.070> allows<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.609> to

a<00:00:38.790> button<00:00:39.090> first<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.230> all<00:00:40.350> you've<00:00:40.500> got<00:00:40.530> an

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
a button first of all you've got an

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.950 
a button first of all you've got an
impulse<00:00:42.110> selector<00:00:43.110> here<00:00:44.570> now<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.629> hear<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
impulse selector here now you hear the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.020 
impulse selector here now you hear the
kind<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.230> stop<00:00:46.620> start<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.579> impulse

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
kind of stop start of the impulse

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.930 
kind of stop start of the impulse
function<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.960> means<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.070> drill

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
function that means that you can drill

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.569 
function that means that you can drill
more<00:00:51.210> accurately<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.260> more<00:00:52.739> safely<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.280> to

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
more accurately and more safely and to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.850 
more accurately and more safely and to
things<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:53.879> ceramic<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.750> glass<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.649> also

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
things like ceramic and glass but also

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.250 
things like ceramic and glass but also
it<00:00:56.370> gives<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.760> much<00:00:57.000> more<00:00:57.030> control<00:00:57.300> when

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it gives you much more control when

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.290 
it gives you much more control when
you're<00:00:58.379> removing<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.129> adding<00:00:59.370> particularly

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
you're removing and adding particularly

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.110 
you're removing and adding particularly
stubborn<00:01:00.690> screws<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.160> great<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
stubborn screws so that's great with a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.960 
stubborn screws so that's great with a
EM<00:01:03.989> pulse<00:01:04.290> mode<00:01:04.589> you've<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.189> got<00:01:05.400> eleven

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
EM pulse mode you've then got eleven

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.859 
EM pulse mode you've then got eleven
selecting<00:01:07.760> modes<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
selecting modes here and that's going to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.530 
selecting modes here and that's going to
select<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.560> talk<00:01:10.920> level<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:12.030> screw

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
select the talk level that your screw

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.609 
select the talk level that your screw
driving<00:01:12.960> part<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.740> between<00:01:14.040> levels<00:01:14.729> 1<00:01:14.970> &amp;<00:01:15.270> 4

the<00:01:16.619> speed<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.159> automatically<00:01:17.909> selected<00:01:18.180> for

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the speed is automatically selected for

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.960 
the speed is automatically selected for
you<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.290> lot<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.680> automated<00:01:20.189> things<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.729> here

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
you so a lot of automated things in here

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.450 
you so a lot of automated things in here
and<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.540> goes<00:01:21.689> right<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.409> number<00:01:22.560> 11<00:01:22.890> there

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
and it goes right up to number 11 there

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.789 
and it goes right up to number 11 there
now<00:01:23.970> you'll<00:01:24.090> notice<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> LED<00:01:24.990> light<00:01:25.560> is

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
now you'll notice that the LED light is

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.890 
now you'll notice that the LED light is
on<00:01:26.100> at<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.759> moment<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> reason<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.750> on

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
on at the moment the reason that it's on

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.460 
on at the moment the reason that it's on
is<00:01:28.220> because<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.729> vibration<00:01:30.509> detected<00:01:31.110> this

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
is because the vibration detected this

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.800 
is because the vibration detected this
has<00:01:31.650> got<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> vibration<00:01:32.490> sensor<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
has got a vibration sensor and the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.780 
has got a vibration sensor and the
automatically<00:01:34.500> switch<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> LED<00:01:35.280> lights

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
automatically switch on the LED lights

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.149 
automatically switch on the LED lights
when<00:01:36.360> somebody<00:01:36.720> touches<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.380> drill<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
when somebody touches this drill so it

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.870 
when somebody touches this drill so it
means<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.430> don't<00:01:38.520> need<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> hold<00:01:39.060> down<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
means you don't need to hold down the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.819 
means you don't need to hold down the
switch<00:01:41.880> before<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> comes<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.079> you've<00:01:43.560> got

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
switch before it comes on you've got

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.359 
switch before it comes on you've got
your<00:01:44.009> belt<00:01:44.220> clip<00:01:44.520> you've<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.210> your<00:01:45.470> 5.2<00:01:46.470> ultra

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
your belt clip you've got your 5.2 ultra

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.630 
your belt clip you've got your 5.2 ultra
