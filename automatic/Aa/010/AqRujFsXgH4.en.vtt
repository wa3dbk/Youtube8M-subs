the Cape up well enough you can see how

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.230 
the Cape up well enough you can see how
he's<00:04:42.840> been<00:04:43.050> ripped<00:04:43.409> away<00:04:43.590> at<00:04:44.099> the<00:04:44.279> back<00:04:44.550> there

is also the Cape has not survived either
in<00:04:49.949> fact<00:04:50.099> I<00:04:50.280> guess<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.550> only<00:04:50.639> thing<00:04:50.759> I<00:04:50.940> really

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
in fact I guess the only thing I really

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.270 
in fact I guess the only thing I really
survived<00:04:51.479> on<00:04:51.690> him<00:04:51.870> was<00:04:52.080> his<00:04:52.169> helmet<00:04:52.560> but<00:04:52.710> his

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
survived on him was his helmet but his

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.420 
survived on him was his helmet but his
Cape<00:04:53.520> has<00:04:53.699> been<00:04:53.990> shredded<00:04:54.990> you<00:04:55.800> can<00:04:55.949> see<00:04:56.130> where

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
Cape has been shredded you can see where

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.640 
Cape has been shredded you can see where
somebody<00:04:57.240> would<00:04:57.419> have<00:04:57.449> gone<00:04:57.750> penetrated

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.219 
were discussing before but he does have
a<00:06:14.699> hinge<00:06:15.030> in<00:06:15.150> the<00:06:15.180> elbow<00:06:15.569> and<00:06:15.719> a<00:06:15.810> lot<00:06:15.990> of<00:06:16.020> this

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
a hinge in the elbow and a lot of this

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:17.659 
a hinge in the elbow and a lot of this
can<00:06:16.440> be<00:06:16.560> contributed<00:06:17.159> to<00:06:17.190> the<00:06:17.340> fact<00:06:17.520> that

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
can be contributed to the fact that

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.570 
can be contributed to the fact that
again<00:06:18.289> he<00:06:19.289> says<00:06:19.500> mangled<00:06:19.979> as<00:06:20.099> he<00:06:20.219> is<00:06:20.400> I

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
again he says mangled as he is I

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.330 
again he says mangled as he is I
wouldn't<00:06:20.940> want<00:06:21.120> that<00:06:21.180> broken<00:06:21.870> up<00:06:21.990> by<00:06:22.289> a<00:06:22.590> swivel

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
wouldn't want that broken up by a swivel

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.760 
wouldn't want that broken up by a swivel
I<00:06:23.550> would<00:06:24.300> find<00:06:24.780> to<00:06:24.900> leave<00:06:25.080> it<00:06:25.199> as<00:06:25.319> is<00:06:25.530> because

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
I would find to leave it as is because

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.890 
I would find to leave it as is because
he<00:06:26.219> does<00:06:26.370> enough<00:06:26.639> poseability<00:06:27.240> on<00:06:27.599> his<00:06:27.719> own

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
he does enough poseability on his own

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.490 
he does enough poseability on his own
that<00:06:28.139> I<00:06:28.409> don't<00:06:29.130> want<00:06:29.250> to<00:06:29.310> forfeit<00:06:30.270> design<00:06:31.080> over

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
that I don't want to forfeit design over

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.010 
that I don't want to forfeit design over
practically<00:06:32.130> a<00:06:32.159> practical<00:06:32.849> purpose<00:06:33.330> you

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
practically a practical purpose you

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.260 
practically a practical purpose you
start<00:06:34.319> adding<00:06:34.469> articulation<00:06:35.400> at<00:06:35.580> this<00:06:35.759> at<00:06:36.060> the

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
start adding articulation at this at the

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.839 
start adding articulation at this at the
sacrifice<00:06:36.960> of<00:06:37.259> sculpt<00:06:37.770> I<00:06:37.919> think<00:06:38.550> that's<00:06:38.699> the

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
sacrifice of sculpt I think that's the

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.270 
sacrifice of sculpt I think that's the
wrong<00:06:39.060> way<00:06:39.270> to<00:06:39.330> go<00:06:39.650> but<00:06:40.650> he<00:06:40.740> does<00:06:40.889> have<00:06:41.069> also

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
wrong way to go but he does have also

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.279 
wrong way to go but he does have also
the<00:06:41.490> swiveling<00:06:41.909> in<00:06:42.030> the<00:06:42.240> in<00:06:42.569> the<00:06:42.840> hands

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289 
the swiveling in the in the hands

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:45.260 
the swiveling in the in the hands
section<00:06:43.650> there<00:06:43.830> no<00:06:44.340> swiveled<00:06:44.819> waist<00:06:45.000> again

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
section there no swiveled waist again

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.020 
section there no swiveled waist again
because<00:06:45.870> the<00:06:46.020> way<00:06:46.110> he<00:06:46.139> sculpted<00:06:46.740> and<00:06:46.889> you<00:06:47.849> can

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
because the way he sculpted and you can
