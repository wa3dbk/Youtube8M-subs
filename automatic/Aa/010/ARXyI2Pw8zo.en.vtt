proud Souls a bit so if you're looking

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:33.450 
proud Souls a bit so if you're looking
at<00:00:32.440> the<00:00:32.559> stage<00:00:32.590> right<00:00:32.949> now<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:33.190> put<00:00:33.340> your

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
at the stage right now you put your

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.600 
at the stage right now you put your
thinking<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:34.750> looks<00:00:34.780> familiar<00:00:35.410> and<00:00:35.920> you

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
thinking this looks familiar and you

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.590 
thinking this looks familiar and you
probably<00:00:36.760> a<00:00:36.879> good<00:00:36.970> reason<00:00:37.030> for<00:00:37.330> that<00:00:37.420> because

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
probably a good reason for that because

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.930 
probably a good reason for that because
we're<00:00:37.989> basically<00:00:38.199> going<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:38.830> be<00:00:38.920> now<00:00:39.100> going

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
we're basically going to be now going

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.770 
we're basically going to be now going
back<00:00:40.090> for<00:00:40.150> all<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.900> levels<00:00:41.050> we<00:00:41.379> did<00:00:41.620> as<00:00:41.800> Nero

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
back for all the levels we did as Nero

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.030 
back for all the levels we did as Nero
he<00:00:43.780> probably<00:00:43.960> thinking<00:00:44.320> that's<00:00:44.800> gonna<00:00:44.920> be

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
he probably thinking that's gonna be

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.810 
he probably thinking that's gonna be
crap<00:00:45.370> well<00:00:45.760> no<00:00:46.030> no<00:00:46.540> no<00:00:46.840> no<00:00:47.380> shut<00:00:47.800> up<00:00:47.980> a<00:00:48.250> lot

people<00:00:48.910> make<00:00:49.149> that<00:00:49.300> assumption<00:00:49.570> you<00:00:49.780> think

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
people make that assumption you think

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.240 
people make that assumption you think
there's<00:00:50.140> just<00:00:50.260> gonna<00:00:50.320> be<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.500> carbon<00:00:50.860> copy<00:00:50.890> of

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
there's just gonna be a carbon copy of

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.069 
there's just gonna be a carbon copy of
everything<00:00:52.000> you<00:00:52.180> already<00:00:52.300> did<00:00:52.510> before<00:00:52.660> the

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
everything you already did before the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.770 
everything you already did before the
backwards<00:00:53.500> know<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:54.610> levels<00:00:54.940> do<00:00:55.180> change

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
backwards know the levels do change

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.709 
backwards know the levels do change
somewhat<00:00:56.649> from<00:00:57.640> when<00:00:58.239> you<00:00:58.329> paint<00:00:58.510> them<00:00:58.600> as

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
somewhat from when you paint them as

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.510 
somewhat from when you paint them as
dirty<00:00:59.140> as<00:00:59.440> for<00:00:59.739> example<00:00:59.800> as<00:01:00.100> you<00:01:00.160> can<00:01:00.280> see<00:01:00.370> now

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
dirty as for example as you can see now

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.119 
dirty as for example as you can see now
already<00:01:00.790> this<00:01:01.329> levels<00:01:01.690> different<00:01:01.840> not<00:01:02.350> hugely

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
already this levels different not hugely

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.219 
already this levels different not hugely
different<00:01:03.479> witness<00:01:04.479> but<00:01:04.600> yet<00:01:04.780> also<00:01:04.930> it's

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
different witness but yet also it's

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.040 
different witness but yet also it's
raining<00:01:05.619> but<00:01:06.369> level<00:01:06.970> itself<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.600> this<00:01:07.840> mission

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
completely different one and there's

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.020 
completely different one and there's
only<00:01:20.740> one<00:01:20.979> route<00:01:21.220> through<00:01:21.550> so<00:01:21.729> going<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.880> work

only one route through so going to work
out<00:01:22.800> it<00:01:23.800> doesn't<00:01:23.860> like<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.250> cheap<00:01:24.459> way<00:01:24.670> of

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
out it doesn't like a cheap way of

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.389

it's going to be in a direction the

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.459 
it's going to be in a direction the
opposite<00:07:07.629> which<00:07:07.870> way<00:07:08.020> the<00:07:08.139> shadows<00:07:08.439> are

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:08.469 
opposite which way the shadows are

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:10.019

facing<00:07:08.949> so<00:07:09.219> if<00:07:09.309> you<00:07:09.400> look<00:07:09.520> at<00:07:09.580> these<00:07:09.639> arches

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:10.029 
facing so if you look at these arches

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:11.790 
facing so if you look at these arches
it's<00:07:10.210> easy<00:07:10.389> you<00:07:10.719> know<00:07:10.809> this<00:07:11.199> way<00:07:11.349> it's<00:07:11.469> facing

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
it's easy you know this way it's facing

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.279 
it's easy you know this way it's facing
south<00:07:12.039> so<00:07:12.399> you<00:07:12.460> had<00:07:12.699> the<00:07:12.969> north<00:07:13.180> exit<00:07:15.029> and<00:07:16.289> then

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:17.289 
south so you had the north exit and then

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:21.209 
south so you had the north exit and then
you<00:07:17.379> come<00:07:17.559> back<00:07:17.589> out<00:07:17.919> again<00:07:18.069> and<00:07:19.680> this<00:07:20.680> time<00:07:20.740> it

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:21.219 
you come back out again and this time it

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:23.189 
you come back out again and this time it
tries<00:07:21.879> to<00:07:21.909> pay<00:07:22.270> you<00:07:22.330> around<00:07:22.599> a<00:07:22.719> bit<00:07:22.749> yes<00:07:23.110> you

00:07:31.799 --> 00:07:31.809 
and it's the right way if I remember

00:07:31.809 --> 00:07:34.110 
and it's the right way if I remember
correctly<00:07:31.839> I<00:07:32.529> think<00:07:32.589> we<00:07:33.189> go<00:07:33.460> right<00:07:33.759> this<00:07:33.909> time

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 
correctly I think we go right this time

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:40.980 
correctly I think we go right this time
yeah<00:07:35.999> some<00:07:36.999> orbs<00:07:39.419> could<00:07:40.419> do<00:07:40.509> some<00:07:40.689> all<00:07:40.809> those

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
yeah some orbs could do some all those

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:48.089 
yeah some orbs could do some all those
really<00:07:41.319> and<00:07:42.839> again<00:07:43.839> you<00:07:45.779> can<00:07:46.779> tell<00:07:47.770> it's<00:07:47.979> the

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.099 
really and again you can tell it's the

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:49.439 
really and again you can tell it's the
right<00:07:48.279> easily<00:07:48.759> by<00:07:48.879> just<00:07:48.909> looking<00:07:49.300> at<00:07:49.360> the

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:49.449 
right easily by just looking at the
