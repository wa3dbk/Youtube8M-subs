this<00:00:06.509> one's<00:00:06.720> main<00:00:06.930> point<00:00:07.259> is<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.470> switch<00:00:07.859> you

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
this one's main point is to switch you

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.740 
this one's main point is to switch you
between<00:00:08.490> levels<00:00:09.000> from<00:00:09.210> one<00:00:09.389> level<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.630> another

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
between levels from one level to another

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.200 
between levels from one level to another
but<00:00:10.620> you'll<00:00:10.769> get<00:00:10.920> some<00:00:11.160> other<00:00:11.340> cool<00:00:11.670> stuff<00:00:11.730> in

but you'll get some other cool stuff in

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.030 
but you'll get some other cool stuff in
here<00:00:12.360> such<00:00:12.630> as<00:00:12.780> rotations<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.559> whatever<00:00:13.710> else

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
here such as rotations and whatever else

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.510 
here such as rotations and whatever else
but<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.120> main<00:00:15.269> purpose<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.379> get<00:00:17.220> level

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
but the main purpose is to get level

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.790 
but the main purpose is to get level
switching<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.779> first<00:00:19.109> things<00:00:19.289> first<00:00:19.350> i<00:00:19.680> have

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
switching so first things first i have

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.380 
switching so first things first i have
two<00:00:19.949> levels<00:00:20.250> here<00:00:20.400> i've<00:00:20.550> moved<00:00:20.789> stuff<00:00:21.060> and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
two levels here i've moved stuff and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.420 
two levels here i've moved stuff and
many<00:00:21.570> stuff<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.140> currently<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.590> menu<00:00:23.160> stuff

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
many stuff I'm currently on menu stuff

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.550 
many stuff I'm currently on menu stuff
I'll<00:00:24.029> press<00:00:24.300> control<00:00:24.689> shift<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:25.080> B<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.410> bring

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
I'll press control shift of B to bring

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
I'll press control shift of B to bring
up<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> build<00:00:26.039> settings<00:00:26.279> I'll<00:00:27.210> drag<00:00:27.660> menu

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
up the build settings I'll drag menu

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.529 
up the build settings I'll drag menu
stuff<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.830> first<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.609> then<00:00:29.760> move<00:00:30.000> stuff<00:00:30.269> I

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
stuff in first and then move stuff I

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.970 
stuff in first and then move stuff I
guess<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.019> order<00:00:31.230> doesn't<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:31.590> matter

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
guess the order doesn't really matter

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.580 
guess the order doesn't really matter

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
on this cube I want to switch levels so

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.590 
on this cube I want to switch levels so
what<00:02:09.520> I'm<00:02:09.610> gonna<00:02:09.700> do<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:10.179> do<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:11.730> cursor<00:02:12.730> so<00:02:13.450> the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.840 
gonna be this cube yes and what I want
to<00:02:23.470> do<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:24.130> load<00:02:24.730> levels<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.390> load<00:02:25.780> level<00:02:26.850> or

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.790 
and then on Mouse down I want to load
the<00:02:36.400> level<00:02:36.790> was<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.510> called<00:02:37.660> it's<00:02:38.290> called<00:02:38.440> move

you<00:02:56.980> script<00:02:57.459> because<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.730> don't<00:02:57.910> need<00:02:58.090> it

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
you script because I don't need it

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.930 
you script because I don't need it
anymore<00:02:58.390> I'll<00:02:58.840> press<00:02:59.140> play<00:02:59.549> when<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:00.610> click

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
anymore I'll press play when I click

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.600 
anymore I'll press play when I click
down<00:03:01.180> on<00:03:01.390> this<00:03:01.480> guy<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:02.019> switch<00:03:02.950> scenes<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.519> now

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
down on this guy I switch scenes and now

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.460 
down on this guy I switch scenes and now
I'm<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.060> sphere<00:03:04.330> scene<00:03:04.810> where<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.230> moves

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
I'm in that sphere scene where it moves

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.380 
I'm in that sphere scene where it moves
slower<00:03:05.830> when<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.190> goes<00:03:06.370> into<00:03:06.549> this<00:03:06.760> object<00:03:06.970> if

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
slower when it goes into this object if

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.479 
slower when it goes into this object if
you<00:03:07.510> remember<00:03:09.299> so<00:03:10.709> again<00:03:11.709> I'll<00:03:11.980> just<00:03:12.010> hit<00:03:12.280> play

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
you remember so again I'll just hit play

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.539 
you remember so again I'll just hit play
there's<00:03:12.880> my<00:03:13.030> cube<00:03:13.360> click<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:15.070> goes<00:03:15.250> into

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
there's my cube click and it goes into

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.030 
there's my cube click and it goes into
the<00:03:15.820> scene<00:03:16.060> where<00:03:16.299> we<00:03:16.780> have<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.959> slow<00:03:17.170> zone<00:03:17.380> so

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
the scene where we have the slow zone so

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.680 
the scene where we have the slow zone so
that's<00:03:18.370> how<00:03:18.519> we're<00:03:18.700> able<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:19.060> switch<00:03:19.360> levels

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
that's how we're able to switch levels

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.420 
that's how we're able to switch levels
on<00:03:19.959> Mouse<00:03:20.709> town<00:03:21.900> later<00:03:22.900> on<00:03:23.110> in<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.650> series<00:03:24.010> I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
on Mouse town later on in the series I

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.660 
on Mouse town later on in the series I
will<00:03:24.489> probably<00:03:25.299> be<00:03:25.540> going<00:03:25.900> over<00:03:26.519> tutorials<00:03:27.519> on

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
will probably be going over tutorials on

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.410 
will probably be going over tutorials on
how<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:27.880> extend<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.900> scripts<00:03:29.260> it's<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.519> I

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
how to extend you scripts it's and I

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.070 
how to extend you scripts it's and I
want<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.320> add<00:03:32.470> an<00:03:32.769> on<00:03:32.980> click<00:03:33.310> down<00:03:34.090> here<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.660> so

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
want to add an on click down here and so

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.500 
want to add an on click down here and so
that<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:35.380> can<00:03:35.410> do<00:03:35.860> an<00:03:36.040> on<00:03:36.190> clicking<00:03:36.850> to<00:03:37.360> this

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
that we can do an on clicking to this

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.090 
that we can do an on clicking to this
object<00:03:37.750> so<00:03:38.110> we<00:03:38.350> know<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.769> mouse<00:03:38.890> was

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
object so we know that the mouse was

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.300 
object so we know that the mouse was
down<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.610> up<00:03:40.110> but<00:03:41.110> that's<00:03:41.590> probably<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.190> could

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
down and up but that's probably I could

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.830 
down and up but that's probably I could
have<00:03:42.549> probably<00:03:42.850> left<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.450> out<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.750> this

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
have probably left that out of this

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.800 
have probably left that out of this
whole<00:03:44.019> tutorial<00:03:44.260> but<00:03:44.980> expect<00:03:45.670> future<00:03:46.180> updates

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
whole tutorial but expect future updates

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.650 
whole tutorial but expect future updates
on<00:03:47.110> videos<00:03:47.440> on<00:03:47.920> how<00:03:48.100> to<00:03:48.130> expand<00:03:48.820> you<00:03:49.030> script<00:03:49.360> to

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
on videos on how to expand you script to

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.160 
on videos on how to expand you script to
do<00:03:49.810> cool<00:03:50.260> stuff<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.769> it<00:03:51.040> doesn't<00:03:51.640> have<00:03:52.170> and

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
do cool stuff that it doesn't have and

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.930 
do cool stuff that it doesn't have and
it's<00:03:53.380> pretty<00:03:53.590> easy<00:03:53.739> to<00:03:53.890> do<00:03:54.040> anybody<00:03:54.489> can<00:03:54.670> do<00:03:54.820> it

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
it's pretty easy to do anybody can do it

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.550 
it's pretty easy to do anybody can do it
even<00:03:55.239> if<00:03:55.329> you're<00:03:55.540> not<00:03:55.690> super<00:03:56.260> knowledgeable

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.819 
even if you're not super knowledgeable
of<00:03:57.040> programming<00:03:57.579> so<00:03:58.329> until<00:03:58.840> then<00:03:59.049> thanks<00:03:59.380> for
