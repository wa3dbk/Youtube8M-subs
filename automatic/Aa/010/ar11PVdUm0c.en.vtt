00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
it if you're on a tripod but i don't

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.859 
it if you're on a tripod but i don't
find<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:34.950> makes<00:01:35.579> an<00:01:35.790> impact<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.540> much

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
find it really makes an impact that much

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.890 
find it really makes an impact that much
on<00:01:37.939> with<00:01:38.939> what<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.210> doing<00:01:39.240> when<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:39.630> shooting

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
on with what I'm doing when I'm shooting

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.300 
on with what I'm doing when I'm shooting
so<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.220> most<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.640> time<00:01:42.829> cool<00:01:43.829> lens

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
so it's on most of the time cool lens

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.080 
so it's on most of the time cool lens
it's<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:46.070> practical<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.399> because

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
it's it's a it's practical it's because

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.940 
it's it's a it's practical it's because
of<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.329> zoom<00:01:48.960> range<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:50.009> pretty<00:01:50.240> wide<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:52.649> fits

right<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:32.900> little<00:02:33.900> dirty<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:35.210> you<00:02:36.210> know

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
right it's a little dirty but you know

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.970 
right it's a little dirty but you know
this<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.080> something<00:02:37.380> that's<00:02:37.530> going<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.770> last

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
this is something that's going to last

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.730 
this is something that's going to last
for<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.820> long<00:02:39.150> time<00:02:39.510> decades<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.650> know

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
for a long time decades that you know

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.610 
for a long time decades that you know
ken<00:02:40.920> doesn't<00:02:41.130> change<00:02:41.490> their<00:02:42.200> format<00:02:43.200> too<00:02:43.440> much

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
ken doesn't change their format too much

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.160 
ken doesn't change their format too much
so<00:02:44.180> I'm<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.720> round<00:02:45.960> for<00:02:46.110> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
so I'm going to have this round for a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.610 
so I'm going to have this round for a
long<00:02:46.320> time<00:02:46.940> good<00:02:47.940> good<00:02:48.360> sharp<00:02:48.780> high<00:02:49.080> quality

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
long time good good sharp high quality

you<00:02:54.600> can<00:02:54.750> see<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.860> zoom<00:02:56.900> here<00:02:59.000> just<00:03:00.000> like<00:03:00.210> that

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
you can see the zoom here just like that

good<00:03:23.810> weather<00:03:24.810> wise<00:03:25.050> i<00:03:25.080> do<00:03:25.530> get<00:03:26.400> occasional

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
good weather wise i do get occasional

good weather wise i do get occasional
crunchiness<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:31.760> manual<00:03:32.760> focusing<00:03:33.300> ring

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
crunchiness in the manual focusing ring

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.199 
crunchiness in the manual focusing ring
but<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.080> doesn't<00:03:34.440> affect<00:03:34.830> performance<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:36.060> it

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
but it doesn't affect performance of it

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.780 
but it doesn't affect performance of it
all<00:03:36.390> i<00:03:36.890> think<00:03:37.890> i<00:03:37.980> could<00:03:38.130> probably<00:03:38.310> just<00:03:38.520> take

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
all i think i could probably just take

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.229 
all i think i could probably just take
some<00:03:38.970> compressed<00:03:39.540> air<00:03:40.610> blow<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.790> out<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:41.970> little

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
some compressed air blow it out a little

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.699 
some compressed air blow it out a little
more<00:03:42.480> but<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:44.760> works<00:03:45.000> good<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:46.200> up-close

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
more but it works good the up-close

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.750 
more but it works good the up-close
focusing<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.580> not<00:03:47.820> great<00:03:48.180> certainly<00:03:48.690> not<00:03:49.760> an

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
focusing is not great certainly not an

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.320 
focusing is not great certainly not an

ideal macro lens long distance it's

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.040 
ideal macro lens long distance it's
awesome<00:03:54.780> right<00:03:56.180> probably<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.720> happy

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050

the low end the 24 range you can get a

the low end the 24 range you can get a

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
little bit of an image distortion it's

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.340 
little bit of an image distortion it's
relatively<00:04:11.700> easy<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:12.090> fix<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.690> photoshop<00:04:13.140> or

relatively easy to fix and photoshop or
something<00:04:13.680> like<00:04:13.770> that<00:04:13.830> but<00:04:14.340> it's<00:04:14.610> never<00:04:14.880> been

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
something like that but it's never been

something like that but it's never been

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
too bad with this with this lens all

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.449 
too bad with this with this lens all

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
around pretty good

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.189 
around pretty good

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
lens and if you're into you know this

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:28.370

type<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.500> high-end<00:04:25.949> photography<00:04:26.699> I<00:04:27.080> would<00:04:28.080> say

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
type of high-end photography I would say

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.159 
type of high-end photography I would say
that<00:04:28.410> check<00:04:29.340> this<00:04:29.520> one<00:04:29.699> out<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.270> if<00:04:31.050> you're

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
that check this one out and if you're

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.870 
that check this one out and if you're
like<00:04:31.349> me<00:04:31.560> i<00:04:31.590> don't<00:04:31.979> i<00:04:32.130> don't<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.520> carry<00:04:32.759> a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
like me i don't i don't like to carry a

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.749 
like me i don't i don't like to carry a
lot<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.240> lenses<00:04:33.979> with<00:04:34.979> me<00:04:35.160> especially<00:04:35.370> when

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
lot of lenses with me especially when

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.480 
lot of lenses with me especially when
i'm<00:04:35.970> just<00:04:36.030> traveling<00:04:36.870> around<00:04:36.900> whatever<00:04:37.889> this

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
i'm just traveling around whatever this

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.159 
i'm just traveling around whatever this
is<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.699> good<00:04:38.910> compromise<00:04:39.150> it's<00:04:39.750> still<00:04:39.960> heavy

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
is a good compromise it's still heavy

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.839 
is a good compromise it's still heavy
it's<00:04:40.590> probably<00:04:42.020> probably<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.470> pound<00:04:43.949> if<00:04:44.580> not

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
it's probably probably a pound if not

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.960 
it's probably probably a pound if not
more<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:46.039> think<00:04:47.039> about<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.819> know<00:04:47.849> you

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
more so think about that you know you

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.620 
more so think about that you know you
lug<00:04:48.449> this<00:04:48.630> thing<00:04:48.690> around<00:04:48.960> but<00:04:50.030> on<00:04:51.030> your<00:04:51.360> camera

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
lug this thing around but on your camera

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.740 
lug this thing around but on your camera
it<00:04:51.930> still<00:04:52.820> makes<00:04:53.820> your<00:04:53.970> camera<00:04:54.270> pretty<00:04:54.509> big

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
it still makes your camera pretty big

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.770 
it still makes your camera pretty big
but<00:04:55.789> relative<00:04:56.789> to<00:04:56.820> some<00:04:57.120> other<00:04:57.300> ones<00:04:57.570> out

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
but relative to some other ones out

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.110 
but relative to some other ones out
there<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:59.460> know<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.639> only<00:04:59.729> thing<00:04:59.820> really

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120
