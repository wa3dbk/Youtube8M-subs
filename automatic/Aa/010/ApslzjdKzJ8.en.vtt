00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.030 
surrounded by honey here's the other
side<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.300> frame<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.649> see<00:00:34.860> it's

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
to do because I'm putting this hive this

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.569 
to do because I'm putting this hive this
is<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> case<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.140> four<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.280> eight

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
frames that are in the hide they're just

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.490 
frames that are in the hide they're just
packed<00:00:46.770> with<00:00:46.980> eggs<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> top<00:00:48.960> root<00:00:49.289> box

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
packed with eggs I'm in the top root box

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.590 
packed with eggs I'm in the top root box
right<00:00:49.739> now

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
right now

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.270 
right now
I'm<00:00:51.600> down<00:00:51.930> into<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.199> bottom<00:00:52.559> brood<00:00:52.770> box<00:00:53.010> and

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I'm down into the bottom brood box and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.130 
I'm down into the bottom brood box and
you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:54.420> are<00:00:54.449> making<00:00:54.750> comb

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750 
you can see they are making comb
everywhere<00:00:55.590> they<00:00:55.710> can<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> queen<00:00:56.610> is

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
everywhere they can and the queen is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
laying larvae wherever she can so they

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.729 
laying larvae wherever she can so they
are<00:00:59.250> running<00:00:59.609> out<00:00:59.910> of<00:00:59.969> room<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.140> time<00:01:01.469> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
are running out of room this is time to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.119 
are running out of room this is time to
add<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:02.250> new<00:01:02.640> brood<00:01:03.600> box<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.439> hive<00:01:04.860> can

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
add a new brood box so they hive can

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.370 
add a new brood box so they hive can
continue<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.610> grow<00:01:05.760> bigger<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.869> bigger<00:01:06.930> so

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
continue to grow bigger and bigger so

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.969 
continue to grow bigger and bigger so
when<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.220> drones<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.360> split<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> hive

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
when I have drones I can split the hive

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.980 
when I have drones I can split the hive
probably<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.130> threes<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.909> don't<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.840> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
probably in threes I don't like this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.359 
probably in threes I don't like this
extra<00:01:13.320> comb<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.740> I'm<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.950> be<00:01:14.070> removing

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
all this comb and cleaning it up and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.429 
all this comb and cleaning it up and
seeing<00:01:16.259> what's<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.619> down<00:01:16.650> inside<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.280> here

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
seeing what's going down inside of here

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.289 
seeing what's going down inside of here
it<00:01:19.439> looks<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.040> see<00:01:20.220> drone<00:01:20.549> cells

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it looks like I can see drone cells

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.170 
it looks like I can see drone cells
right<00:01:21.509> down<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.960> right<00:01:22.080> now

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
right down here right now

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.700 
right down here right now
the<00:01:24.180> drone<00:01:24.450> cells<00:01:24.720> may<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.049> an<00:01:25.290> indication

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the drone cells may be an indication

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.260 
the drone cells may be an indication
that<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.220> hive<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:26.759> getting<00:01:26.970> ready<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
that this hive is are getting ready to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.210 
that this hive is are getting ready to
swarm<00:01:27.509> because<00:01:27.990> they've<00:01:28.409> run<00:01:28.619> out<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> space

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
swarm because they've run out of space

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.690 
swarm because they've run out of space
to<00:01:29.790> store<00:01:29.850> honey<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.540> lay<00:01:30.990> eggs

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
to store honey and lay eggs

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.590 
to store honey and lay eggs
all<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:32.850> I've<00:01:32.909> decided<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.390> two<00:01:33.420> things

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
first of all the queen is laying eggs

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.690 
first of all the queen is laying eggs
all<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> bottom<00:01:37.860> but<00:01:38.250> there's<00:01:38.430> lots

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
all down on the bottom but there's lots

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.510 
all down on the bottom but there's lots
of<00:01:38.909> room<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.420> them<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> store<00:01:40.259> more<00:01:41.009> honey<00:01:41.250> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
of room for them to store more honey and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.319 
of room for them to store more honey and
lay<00:01:41.640> more<00:01:41.880> eggs

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
lay more eggs

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.469 
lay more eggs
since<00:01:43.170> bees<00:01:43.470> work<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:44.159> from<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> bottom<00:01:45.299> up

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
since bees work up from the bottom up

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.170 
since bees work up from the bottom up
I'm<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> move<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.619> top<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
I'm going to move this to the top of the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.679 
I'm going to move this to the top of the
hive<00:01:48.799> this<00:01:49.799> one<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:51.060> loaded<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
hive this one here is really loaded and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.999
