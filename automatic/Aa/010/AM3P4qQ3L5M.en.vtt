00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
take a look at the inside of the train

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.279 
take a look at the inside of the train
comfortable<00:00:56.309> seats<00:00:57.230> reasonably<00:00:58.230> clean<00:00:58.649> and

comfortable seats reasonably clean and

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.039 
comfortable seats reasonably clean and
they're<00:01:01.289> facing<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:03.090> direction<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
they're facing one direction but the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.990 
they're facing one direction but the
train<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.680> stop<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.280> go<00:01:05.369> backwards<00:01:05.850> when

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
train has to stop and go backwards when

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.429 
train has to stop and go backwards when
it<00:01:06.090> gets<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> end<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> line<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.260> half

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
it gets to the end of the line so half

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.990 
it gets to the end of the line so half
the<00:01:07.500> seats<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.130> facing<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.580> way<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.909> half

the seats are facing one way and half

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.969 
the seats are facing one way and half
are<00:01:09.240> facing<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> other<00:01:09.810> way<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> get

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
are facing the other way so when you get

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.410 
are facing the other way so when you get
in<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> train<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.610> may<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.790> riding<00:01:12.180> backwards
