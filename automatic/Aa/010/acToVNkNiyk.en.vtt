00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
they offer better quality in comparison

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.240 
they offer better quality in comparison
to<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.630> hurricane<00:02:29.170> through<00:02:29.410> mind<00:02:29.680> they<00:02:30.040> are

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
to the hurricane through mind they are

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.850 
to the hurricane through mind they are
plastic<00:02:30.970> as<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.110> guys<00:02:32.260> can<00:02:32.470> see<00:02:32.530> when<00:02:32.830> we

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
plastic as you guys can see when we

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.170 
plastic as you guys can see when we
extended<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.820> layer<00:02:34.030> they<00:02:34.450> are<00:02:34.720> metal<00:02:36.180> so

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
extended the layer they are metal so

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.420 
extended the layer they are metal so
that's<00:02:37.420> one<00:02:37.810> thing<00:02:38.080> there<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.830> keep<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.220> mind

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
that's one thing there to keep in mind

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.600 
that's one thing there to keep in mind
the<00:02:40.270> build<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.290> construction<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
the build and the construction of the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.110 
the build and the construction of the
legend<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.810> should<00:02:44.020> have<00:02:44.140> been<00:02:44.230> way<00:02:44.650> better<00:02:45.120> it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
legend it should have been way better it

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.480 
legend it should have been way better it
almost<00:02:46.420> feels<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.590> pizza<00:02:48.550> studio<00:02:49.180> and

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
almost feels like the pizza studio and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.310 
almost feels like the pizza studio and
that's<00:02:51.490> not<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.970> say<00:02:52.180> that<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.690> hurricane

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
that turbine versus a revolution this is

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.260 
that turbine versus a revolution this is
one<00:04:46.009> thing<00:04:46.160> I<00:04:46.250> don't<00:04:46.310> like<00:04:46.639> guys<00:04:46.880> are<00:04:47.120> the

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
one thing I don't like guys are the

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.900 
one thing I don't like guys are the
space<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:48.440> you<00:04:48.620> save<00:04:48.889> it<00:04:49.009> to<00:04:49.130> your<00:04:49.340> head<00:04:49.639> and

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
space that you save it to your head and

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.779 
space that you save it to your head and
the<00:04:50.389> headband<00:04:50.900> you<00:04:51.860> know<00:04:51.979> I<00:04:52.009> can<00:04:52.310> fit<00:04:52.580> their

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
the headband you know I can fit their

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.820 
the headband you know I can fit their
three<00:04:53.330> fingers<00:04:53.810> and<00:04:54.080> I<00:04:54.229> don't<00:04:54.380> like<00:04:54.680> this

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
three fingers and I don't like this

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.529 
three fingers and I don't like this
based<00:04:55.160> on<00:04:55.340> that<00:04:55.520> so<00:04:55.880> that's<00:04:56.090> one<00:04:56.330> thing<00:04:56.479> to

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539
