easy<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.270> adjust<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.159> did<00:01:54.340> mess<00:01:54.579> with<00:01:54.759> the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
easy to adjust and I did mess with the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.550 
easy to adjust and I did mess with the
weights<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.210> little<00:01:55.299> bit<00:01:55.539> you<00:01:55.689> can<00:01:55.840> take<00:01:56.049> out<00:01:56.289> in

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
weights a little bit you can take out in

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.889 
weights a little bit you can take out in
the<00:01:57.219> beaters<00:01:57.549> you<00:01:57.789> can<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.240> can<00:01:58.390> adjust<00:01:58.719> with

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
the beaters you can you can adjust with

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.179 
the beaters you can you can adjust with
the<00:01:58.990> weights<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.289> can<00:01:59.409> take<00:01:59.530> one<00:01:59.740> weight<00:01:59.950> out

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
the weights you can take one weight out

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.770 
the weights you can take one weight out
I<00:02:00.520> don't<00:02:00.820> know<00:02:00.969> what<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.180> exact<00:02:01.420> weight<00:02:01.659> of

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
I don't know what the exact weight of

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.969 
I don't know what the exact weight of
each<00:02:02.280> three<00:02:03.280> grams<00:02:03.520> 3<00:02:04.030> grams<00:02:04.270> 3<00:02:05.109> grams<00:02:05.350> there

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
each three grams 3 grams 3 grams there

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.419 
each three grams 3 grams 3 grams there
you<00:02:06.100> go<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:08.200> took<00:02:08.350> like<00:02:08.500> three<00:02:08.829> grams<00:02:09.070> out

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
you go like it took like three grams out

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.360 
you go like it took like three grams out
ok<00:02:09.970> kid<00:02:10.239> I'm<00:02:10.420> like<00:02:10.450> half<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.049> pick<00:02:11.320> it<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:12.280> I
