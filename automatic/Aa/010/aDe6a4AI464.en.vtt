this<00:00:33.230> game<00:00:33.379> so<00:00:33.530> far<00:00:33.649> and<00:00:33.710> I've<00:00:33.980> just<00:00:34.010> got<00:00:34.460> this

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
this game so far and I've just got this

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.390 
this game so far and I've just got this
game<00:00:34.970> so<00:00:35.210> this<00:00:35.360> was<00:00:35.510> basically<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:36.199> second<00:00:37.100> on

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
game so this was basically to second on

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.979 
game so this was basically to second on
match<00:00:37.580> up<00:00:37.790> late<00:00:37.970> and<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.330> think<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:38.720> first

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
match up late and I think the first

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.549 
match up late and I think the first
match<00:00:39.260> up<00:00:39.440> late<00:00:39.650> with<00:00:39.829> leader<00:00:40.129> class<00:00:40.400> so<00:00:40.850> and

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
match up late with leader class so and

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.950 
match up late with leader class so and
toss<00:00:42.559> I<00:00:42.860> didn't<00:00:43.129> know<00:00:43.159> the<00:00:43.309> map<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:44.150> because

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
toss I didn't know the map and because

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.770 
toss I didn't know the map and because
was<00:00:45.140> first<00:00:45.379> on<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.530> plate<00:00:45.769> on<00:00:45.890> it<00:00:45.949> so<00:00:46.780> there's

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
was first on the plate on it so there's

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.590 
was first on the plate on it so there's
no<00:00:47.930> word<00:00:48.170> I<00:00:48.350> am<00:00:48.650> whole<00:00:49.430> anak<00:00:49.850> gone<00:00:50.180> cubes

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
no word I am whole anak gone cubes

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.560 
no word I am whole anak gone cubes
health<00:00:51.320> of<00:00:51.470> great<00:00:51.649> swear<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.570> then

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
health of great swear and then

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.510 
health of great swear and then
ammunition<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:54.530> weapons<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.430> stuff

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
ammunition and the weapons and stuff

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.490 
ammunition and the weapons and stuff
like<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.030> I<00:00:56.329> was<00:00:56.570> playing<00:00:56.840> very<00:00:56.930> cautious

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
like that so I was playing very cautious

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.310 
like that so I was playing very cautious
and<00:00:57.769> but<00:00:57.980> at<00:00:58.489> least<00:00:59.000> I<00:00:59.180> got<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.359> positive<00:00:59.960> kitty

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
and but at least I got a positive kitty

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.340 
and but at least I got a positive kitty
in<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.739> end<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.219> that's<00:01:02.059> good<00:01:02.300> I<00:01:02.510> guess<00:01:02.809> and

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
in the end so that's good I guess and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.469 
in the end so that's good I guess and
there<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:04.250> hope<00:01:04.550> you<00:01:04.670> liked<00:01:04.820> is<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.059> short<00:01:05.420> video

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
not wrong and there's a bit like like

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.550 
not wrong and there's a bit like like
every<00:03:12.850> shooter<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.390> there's<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.930> bit<00:03:14.080> of<00:03:14.110> calcd

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
every shooter and there's a bit of calcd

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.280 
every shooter and there's a bit of calcd
like<00:03:15.090> every<00:03:16.090> class<00:03:16.300> has<00:03:16.360> his<00:03:16.690> own<00:03:16.810> kill<00:03:17.020> streak

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
like every class has his own kill streak

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.280 
like every class has his own kill streak
where<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.560> can<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.570> get<00:03:19.570> more<00:03:19.750> damage<00:03:20.110> for

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
where it can and get more damage for

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.560 
where it can and get more damage for
amount<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.620> time<00:03:20.800> for<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.070> team<00:03:21.280> or<00:03:21.610> heal<00:03:22.390> up

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
amount of time for a team or heal up

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.000 
amount of time for a team or heal up
give<00:03:22.810> your<00:03:22.989> team<00:03:23.140> know<00:03:23.320> stuff<00:03:23.530> like<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.680> but

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
give your team know stuff like that but

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.100 
give your team know stuff like that but
i'm<00:03:24.190> not<00:03:24.940> too<00:03:25.090> sure<00:03:25.120> what<00:03:25.720> all<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:26.080> there

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
i'm not too sure what all is there

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.040 
i'm not too sure what all is there
around<00:03:26.500> because<00:03:27.430> i<00:03:27.610> haven't<00:03:28.540> played<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.810> match

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
around because i haven't played a match

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.479 
around because i haven't played a match
and<00:03:30.000> basically<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.180> can<00:03:31.390> think<00:03:32.370> there<00:03:33.370> are<00:03:33.459> a

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
and basically you can think there are a

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.520 
and basically you can think there are a
lot<00:03:33.580> of<00:03:33.610> kill<00:03:33.820> streaks<00:03:34.150> in<00:03:34.269> there<00:03:34.500> basically<00:03:35.500> i

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
lot of kill streaks in there basically i

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.870 
lot of kill streaks in there basically i
think<00:03:35.739> you<00:03:35.860> can<00:03:36.040> get<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.220> kill<00:03:36.430> streak<00:03:36.549> like

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
think you can get a kill streak like

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.280 
think you can get a kill streak like
when<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.150> get<00:03:37.269> three<00:03:37.510> kills<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.900> get<00:03:38.049> first

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
when you get three kills you get first

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.949 
when you get three kills you get first
in<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.830> row<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.220> then<00:03:39.700> like<00:03:39.910> five<00:03:40.480> pills<00:03:40.750> and

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
in the row and then like five pills and

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.320 
in the row and then like five pills and
then<00:03:41.080> seven<00:03:41.470> kills<00:03:41.670> so<00:03:42.670> i<00:03:42.700> don't<00:03:43.000> know<00:03:43.090> why<00:03:43.299> i

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
then seven kills so i don't know why i

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.789 
then seven kills so i don't know why i
was<00:03:43.540> shooting<00:03:43.690> here<00:03:43.989> at<00:03:44.110> my<00:03:44.290> own<00:03:44.410> teammate
