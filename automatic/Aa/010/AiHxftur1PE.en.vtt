sixteenth<00:01:29.520> notes<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.939> one-e-and-a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
sixteenth notes so one-e-and-a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.160 
sixteenth notes so one-e-and-a
two-e-and-a<00:01:31.560> three-e-and-a<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.869> that's<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.640 
so playing parallels between the ride I
try<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> whack<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> Bell<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.079> snare<00:01:40.350> drum

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
try to whack the Bell and the snare drum

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.649 
try to whack the Bell and the snare drum
nice<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.579> simple<00:01:41.790> paradiddle<00:01:42.150> pattern<00:01:42.479> and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
nice and simple paradiddle pattern and

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.139 
nice and simple paradiddle pattern and
you<00:01:43.110> end<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.470> four<00:01:43.799> whacking<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> China<00:01:44.939> boy

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you end on four whacking the China boy

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090 
you end on four whacking the China boy
and<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.509> snare<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.170> absolutely<00:01:46.829> nutty

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and your snare it's absolutely nutty

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:59.950 
and your snare it's absolutely nutty
crazy<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.119> let's<00:01:48.149> take<00:01:48.420> an<00:01:48.509> SS<00:01:48.720> low

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.540 

that's<00:02:00.960> basically<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.920> pattern<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.400> your

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
that's basically the the pattern a your

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.130 
that's basically the the pattern a your
to<00:02:02.610> play<00:02:02.790> over<00:02:03.150> top<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.390> double<00:02:03.750> bass<00:02:03.900> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
to play over top the double bass and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.140 
to play over top the double bass and
again<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> little<00:02:05.400> fill<00:02:05.640> type

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
again this is like a little fill type

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.050 
again this is like a little fill type
groove<00:02:06.540> here<00:02:07.080> think<00:02:07.470> of<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.590> de<00:02:07.740> once<00:02:08.610> again<00:02:08.850> for

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
groove here think of a de once again for

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.340 
groove here think of a de once again for
you<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.210> is<00:02:09.330> very<00:02:09.390> difficult<00:02:09.960> to<00:02:10.140> try<00:02:10.320> to

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
you this is very difficult to try to

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:23.240 
you this is very difficult to try to
understand<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:10.830> concept<00:02:11.330> yeah<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.890> little

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
understand this concept yeah so a little

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.440 
understand this concept yeah so a little
faster

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.150 

alright<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:31.020> probably<00:02:31.350> played<00:02:31.710> things<00:02:32.010> like

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
alright so I probably played things like

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.080 
alright so I probably played things like
that<00:02:32.280> before<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.760> could<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
that before and that could be in the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.280 
that before and that could be in the
middle<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.390> groove<00:02:33.600> or<00:02:33.840> middle<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.140> bead

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
middle of a groove or middle of a bead

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.440 
middle of a groove or middle of a bead
or<00:02:34.500> whatever<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.770> may<00:02:34.860> be<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.270> in<00:02:36.270> this

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
or whatever it may be but in this

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.000 
or whatever it may be but in this
particular<00:02:36.840> case<00:02:37.050> I'm<00:02:37.320> gonna<00:02:37.440> take<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
particular case I'm gonna take that and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.700 
particular case I'm gonna take that and
make<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.280> fill<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.300> middle<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.720> maybe

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
make it a fill in the middle of maybe

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.530 
make it a fill in the middle of maybe
just<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.950> straightforward<00:02:41.300> groove<00:02:42.300> where<00:02:42.450> I'm

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
just a straightforward groove where I'm

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.060 
just a straightforward groove where I'm
throwing<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.170> little<00:02:43.290> bit<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.500> double<00:02:43.620> bass<00:02:43.800> in

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
throwing a little bit of double bass in

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.560 
throwing a little bit of double bass in
you<00:02:44.490> can<00:02:44.610> play<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.820> in<00:02:44.910> anything<00:02:45.120> obviously

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
you can play it in anything obviously

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.960 
you can play it in anything obviously
but<00:02:46.020> because<00:02:46.830> I'm<00:02:47.010> counting<00:02:47.190> sixteenth<00:02:47.790> notes

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
but because I'm counting sixteenth notes

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.940 
but because I'm counting sixteenth notes
one<00:02:48.240> E<00:02:48.270> and<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.570> two<00:02:48.600> E<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.900> A<00:02:49.110> three<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.680> four

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
one E and a two E and A three and a four

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.650 
one E and a two E and A three and a four
it's<00:02:50.580> basically<00:02:51.090> what<00:02:51.270> you're<00:02:51.360> gonna<00:02:51.450> play

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
it's basically what you're gonna play

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.690 
it's basically what you're gonna play
underneath<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.170> with<00:02:52.320> your<00:02:52.470> double<00:02:52.710> bass<00:02:52.800> okay

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
underneath it with your double bass okay

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.640 
underneath it with your double bass okay
so<00:02:54.210> you're<00:02:54.330> basically<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.690> be<00:03:00.440> frank<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.530> that

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
so you're basically to be frank is that

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.040 
so you're basically to be frank is that
four<00:03:01.800> hours<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:05.340> over<00:03:05.820> top<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.450> double

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
four hours so over top of the double

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.490 
four hours so over top of the double
bass<00:03:07.260> you're<00:03:07.560> going<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.739> play<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
bass you're going to play the the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.810 
bass you're going to play the the
paradiddle<00:03:10.500> pattern<00:03:10.890> with<00:03:11.190> your<00:03:11.340> riding<00:03:11.550> or

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
paradiddle pattern with your riding or

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.900 
paradiddle pattern with your riding or
snare<00:03:12.030> or<00:03:12.570> cowbell<00:03:12.989> anyway<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:13.860> let's<00:03:14.400> try

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
snare or cowbell anyway so let's try

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:24.680 
snare or cowbell anyway so let's try
that<00:03:14.940> slowly<00:03:22.610> maybe<00:03:23.610> right<00:03:23.880> before<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.209> whack

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
that slowly maybe right before I whack

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.500 
that slowly maybe right before I whack
my<00:03:25.020> China<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:26.040> might<00:03:26.489> do<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.640> quick<00:03:26.970> double<00:03:27.270> on

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
my China I might do a quick double on

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.010 
my China I might do a quick double on
the<00:03:27.600> bass<00:03:27.780> drum<00:03:27.810> like<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.260> doo<00:03:28.950> ba<00:03:29.130> doo<00:03:29.270> ba<00:03:30.270> it

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
one E and a two E and A three and Gugu

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:48.920 
one E and a two E and A three and Gugu
bah

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.449 

so<00:03:49.930> it's<00:03:50.319> just<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.560> little<00:03:50.770> cool<00:03:51.040> thing<00:03:51.280> at<00:03:51.400> the

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
so it's just a little cool thing at the

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.460 
so it's just a little cool thing at the
end<00:03:51.610> of<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.819> groove<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.870> might<00:03:53.020> play<00:03:53.200> it's<00:03:53.410> a

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
end of a groove you might play it's a

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.050 
end of a groove you might play it's a
one<00:03:53.620> measure<00:03:53.860> Phil<00:03:54.130> obviously<00:03:54.280> ending<00:03:54.940> on

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
one measure Phil obviously ending on

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:10.320 
one measure Phil obviously ending on
four<00:03:55.360> so<00:03:55.959> one<00:03:56.230> more<00:03:56.380> time<00:04:08.099> you<00:04:09.099> can<00:04:09.130> also<00:04:09.370> not

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
four so one more time you can also not

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.970 
four so one more time you can also not
end<00:04:10.630> with<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:10.900> China<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.500> just<00:04:11.560> continue

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
end with that China and just continue

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.650 
end with that China and just continue
the<00:04:12.099> double<00:04:12.310> bass<00:04:12.459> with<00:04:12.790> playing<00:04:13.420> paired

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
the double bass with playing paired

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.970 
the double bass with playing paired
roles<00:04:13.840> over<00:04:13.930> top<00:04:14.170> of<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.349> cuz<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.709> becomes<00:04:14.920> a

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
roles over top of it cuz it becomes a

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.159 
roles over top of it cuz it becomes a
cool<00:04:15.190> little<00:04:15.340> riff<00:04:15.610> so<00:04:15.910> let's<00:04:16.690> just<00:04:16.870> play<00:04:17.079> a
