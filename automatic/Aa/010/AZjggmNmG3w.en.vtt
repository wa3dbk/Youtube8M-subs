so<00:00:11.470> as<00:00:11.650> you<00:00:11.770> can<00:00:11.890> see<00:00:12.190> here<00:00:12.670> I've<00:00:13.270> got<00:00:13.690> one<00:00:13.930> side

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
so as you can see here I've got one side

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.320 
so as you can see here I've got one side
or<00:00:14.530> laced<00:00:15.309> up<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.960> now<00:00:17.740> we<00:00:18.250> need<00:00:18.400> to<00:00:18.430> put<00:00:18.610> the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
or laced up and now we need to put the

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.890 
or laced up and now we need to put the
spokes<00:00:19.689> through<00:00:20.080> the<00:00:20.230> other<00:00:20.380> side<00:00:21.630> now<00:00:22.630> before

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
spokes through the other side now before

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.660 
spokes through the other side now before
you<00:00:23.080> do<00:00:23.290> that<00:00:23.320> you<00:00:23.830> need<00:00:23.950> to<00:00:24.099> know<00:00:24.130> the<00:00:24.340> pattern

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
you do that you need to know the pattern

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.529 
you do that you need to know the pattern
well<00:00:24.939> in<00:00:25.150> this<00:00:25.330> case<00:00:25.890> 83<00:00:26.890> cross<00:00:27.220> and<00:00:27.520> what<00:00:28.510> I

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
well in this case 83 cross and what I

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.260 
well in this case 83 cross and what I
want<00:00:28.779> to<00:00:28.869> end<00:00:29.050> up<00:00:29.260> with<00:00:29.560> is<00:00:30.400> something<00:00:30.460> like

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
want to end up with is something like

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.660 
want to end up with is something like
this<00:00:31.650> here's<00:00:32.650> one<00:00:32.920> I<00:00:32.949> made<00:00:33.190> earlier<00:00:35.489> AC<00:00:36.489> the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
this here's one I made earlier AC the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.040 
this here's one I made earlier AC the
valve<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:38.170> coming<00:00:38.980> through<00:00:39.430> the<00:00:39.610> rim<00:00:40.050> so

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
valve it's coming through the rim so

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.560 
valve it's coming through the rim so
that<00:00:41.290> underneath<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.460> valve<00:00:42.700> the<00:00:43.270> spokes

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
that underneath the valve the spokes

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.490 
that underneath the valve the spokes
don't<00:00:43.870> cross<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:45.460> you<00:00:45.550> can<00:00:45.700> see<00:00:45.910> how<00:00:46.180> in<00:00:46.660> a

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
don't cross then you can see how in a

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.920 
don't cross then you can see how in a
three<00:00:47.739> cross<00:00:48.010> pattern<00:00:48.280> you've<00:00:48.730> got<00:00:49.000> four

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
three cross pattern you've got four

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.630 
three cross pattern you've got four
spokes<00:00:50.379> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:52.469> underneath<00:00:53.469> there's<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.370> bit

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
spokes and then underneath there's a bit

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.000 
spokes and then underneath there's a bit
of<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.820> gap<00:00:55.059> I<00:00:55.450> can<00:00:56.289> wear<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:56.590> bit<00:00:56.770> you'll<00:00:56.980> see

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
of a gap I can wear a bit you'll see

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.990 
of a gap I can wear a bit you'll see
that<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.489> there<00:00:58.210> again<00:00:58.620> there's<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.770> gap<00:01:00.039> so

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
that and there again there's a gap so

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.119 
that and there again there's a gap so
that's<00:01:01.210> what<00:01:01.449> you<00:01:01.570> want<00:01:01.870> so<00:01:02.649> how<00:01:02.770> do<00:01:02.829> you<00:01:02.920> get

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
that's what you want so how do you get

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.270 
that's what you want so how do you get
that<00:01:03.309> well<00:01:05.190> here's<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.280> ring<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:09.009> rim

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
that well here's the ring and the rim

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.529 
that well here's the ring and the rim
can<00:01:09.670> be<00:01:09.850> left<00:01:10.479> all<00:01:10.810> right<00:01:11.350> handed<00:01:12.390> there's<00:01:13.390> the

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
can be left all right handed there's the

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.460 
can be left all right handed there's the
valve<00:01:13.750> hole<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.430> hole<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.869> to<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.290> left

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
valve hole and the hole just to the left

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.859 
valve hole and the hole just to the left
of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:20.140> valve<00:01:20.350> hole<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.729> rim<00:01:21.970> hold<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.600> smoke

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
of the valve hole the rim hold the smoke

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.789 
of the valve hole the rim hold the smoke
hole<00:01:23.080> is<00:01:23.530> closer<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.520> me<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.810> I<00:01:25.960> turn<00:01:26.259> it<00:01:26.530> and

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
hole is closer to me if I turn it and

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.270 
hole is closer to me if I turn it and
you<00:01:26.950> can<00:01:27.100> see<00:01:27.600> some<00:01:28.600> of<00:01:28.630> them<00:01:28.900> are<00:01:29.619> off<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.130> one

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
you can see some of them are off to one

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.609 
you can see some of them are off to one
side<00:01:30.310> every<00:01:30.880> other<00:01:30.970> one<00:01:31.180> is<00:01:31.930> off<00:01:32.229> to<00:01:32.439> one<00:01:32.590> side

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
side every other one is off to one side

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.350 
side every other one is off to one side
so<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.700> one<00:01:33.820> that's<00:01:34.030> closest<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.810> me<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:36.360> on

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
so the one that's closest to me is on

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.120 
so the one that's closest to me is on
the<00:01:37.630> left<00:01:37.840> so<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.500> means<00:01:38.740> it's<00:01:38.979> a

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
the left so that means it's a

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.990 
the left so that means it's a
left-handed<00:01:40.060> rim<00:01:41.100> most<00:01:42.100> rims<00:01:42.430> are<00:01:42.640> like<00:01:42.790> that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
left-handed rim most rims are like that

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.539 
left-handed rim most rims are like that
but<00:01:43.210> every<00:01:43.869> now<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.140> again<00:01:44.170> you'll<00:01:45.159> get<00:01:45.369> one

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
but every now and again you'll get one

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.140 
but every now and again you'll get one
that<00:01:45.960> right<00:01:46.960> handed<00:01:47.439> so<00:01:48.369> for<00:01:48.549> a<00:01:48.610> left-handed

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
that right handed so for a left-handed

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.469 
that right handed so for a left-handed
rim<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.380> I<00:01:50.500> take<00:01:50.710> one<00:01:50.920> spoke<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:54.060> then<00:01:55.060> you

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
rim and I take one spoke and then you

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.310 
rim and I take one spoke and then you
can<00:01:55.630> see<00:01:55.810> this<00:01:56.470> one<00:01:56.829> here<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:58.869> off<00:01:59.079> to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
can see this one here is going off to

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.580 
can see this one here is going off to
the<00:01:59.409> right<00:01:59.970> okay<00:02:00.970> one's<00:02:01.960> going<00:02:02.259> up<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.500> the

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
the right okay one's going up to the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.280 
the right okay one's going up to the
right<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:04.090> I'm<00:02:04.240> going<00:02:04.390> to<00:02:04.479> thread<00:02:04.720> this<00:02:05.020> one

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
right so I'm going to thread this one

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.669 
right so I'm going to thread this one
through

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.210 

and<00:02:10.679> that's<00:02:10.979> also<00:02:11.280> going<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.840> spoke

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and that's also going to have the spoke

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:22.250 
and that's also going to have the spoke
head<00:02:14.220> out<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.690> one<00:02:18.870> closest<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.800> me<00:02:21.260> is

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
head out and the one closest to me is

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.490 
head out and the one closest to me is
further<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.190> right<00:02:23.660> then<00:02:24.660> 1<00:02:24.870> i've<00:02:25.140> just

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
further to the right then 1 i've just

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.800 
further to the right then 1 i've just
threaded<00:02:26.069> through<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.930> check<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:29.810> there

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
threaded through and to check that there

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.040 
threaded through and to check that there
we<00:02:30.959> go<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:35.489> threaded<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:36.060> through<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
we go it threaded that through so the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.500 
we go it threaded that through so the
one<00:02:37.230> that's<00:02:37.440> already<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.950> there<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.510> closest

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
one that's already in there and closest

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.479 
one that's already in there and closest
to<00:02:39.660> me<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.050> a<00:02:40.290> little<00:02:40.769> bit<00:02:40.860> further<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.310> the

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
to me is a little bit further to the

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.040 
to me is a little bit further to the
right<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.530> one<00:02:43.590> pointing<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.580> right

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
right on this one pointing to the right

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.979 
right on this one pointing to the right
if<00:02:46.050> slightly<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:46.980> left<00:02:47.569> and<00:02:48.569> if<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.780> do

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
if slightly to the left and if you do

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:57.650 
if slightly to the left and if you do
that<00:02:50.600> then<00:02:51.600> you'll<00:02:51.959> end<00:02:52.260> up<00:02:52.440> with<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:57.330> valve

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
that then you'll end up with the valve
