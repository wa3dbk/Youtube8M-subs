00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 today guys to see a beautiful one 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.879
 magic entitled the man from new york 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.500
 that in Italy known as lo 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.660
 opinionating spectator 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.309
 I recommend you click I like it and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.309
 share good vision 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.920
 a while ago I met an ex 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.270
 gambler a former player of 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.610
 poker for a short time 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.260
 undertaken the career of the bar and me 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.520
 he said the real cheater was he who 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.090
 will be able to find the cards he has 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.309
 need 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.770
 inside a mixed bunch not 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.470
 imported cremations on mixed 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.800
 Italian-style lomazzo was mixed 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.300
 American 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.980
 the important thing is that if he needed to 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.620
 some cards will need to be able to 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.320
 find them then did what enough 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.390
 cleverly divided the fact about metallic 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.280
 metacarta face up above the le 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.079
 he put his face down so there 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 we find this situation with half 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.800
 cards face up the rest 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.990
 do the bass and since the sign 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.490
 they were my rightly remembered 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.720
 check the desserts but they were not 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.090
 teacher I guarantee you 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.610
 after which he begins to mix faces 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.160
 of bears together so without order ed 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.610
 finally the coup de grace on 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.580
 face where on back to super 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.110
 speed up like this I do bear together 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.170
 so we find ourselves with a composite deck 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.620
 from back to face, back to face 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.080
 counter-face of bears against back 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.760
 a bit of everything and told me it would be 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.909
 been able to find the cards of 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.119
 then needed the deck 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.960
 ask for a thick ace cut 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.060
 I'll kill another ace again 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.490
 asks for a third cut to a third ace 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.610
 it is a little the firm said yes I speak but 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.770
 there is not a great magic application e 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.700
 he told me look at the fourth ace 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.560
 I do go out magically and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.229
 obviously I looked at him he said look at that 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.970
 a 3 is not my lucky card 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:10.640
 because according to 3 1 2 3 this is the place 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.180
 It is the fourth and final ace I 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.610
 I looked at yes but it still isn't there 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.019
 this great magic and he looks at chrome 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.540
 update find in four axes a 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.159
 pass your hand snap your fingers and do 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.700
 get it all back 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:28.700
 face down the man from new york
