00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
shredder helmet looks pretty cool I like

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.150 
shredder helmet looks pretty cool I like
the<00:02:05.700> sculpt<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.329> very<00:02:06.929> nice<00:02:07.229> now<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> paint

the sculpt of it very nice now the paint
choice<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.729> actually<00:02:08.910> prefer<00:02:09.210> more<00:02:09.570> on<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
choice I actually prefer more on the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.630 
choice I actually prefer more on the
first<00:02:09.960> one<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.410> much<00:02:10.679> more<00:02:10.890> silver<00:02:11.460> I

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
first one this is much more silver I

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.330 
first one this is much more silver I
like<00:02:11.880> this<00:02:12.120> more<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.320> has<00:02:13.530> much<00:02:14.010> more<00:02:14.220> of

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
like this more so this has much more of

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.880 
like this more so this has much more of
a<00:02:14.400> flat<00:02:14.760> gray<00:02:15.330> color<00:02:15.690> over<00:02:15.990> here<00:02:16.020> but<00:02:16.710> looks

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
a flat gray color over here but looks

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.230 
a flat gray color over here but looks
very<00:02:17.160> good<00:02:17.310> especially<00:02:17.520> because<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.970> helmet

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
very good especially because the helmet

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.730 
very good especially because the helmet
is<00:02:18.300> removable<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.200> looks<00:02:19.350> like<00:02:19.410> it's<00:02:19.650> just

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
is removable so it looks like it's just

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.470 
is removable so it looks like it's just
on<00:02:19.980> there<00:02:20.160> permanently<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.060> not<00:02:21.210> and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
on there permanently but it is not and

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.500 
on there permanently but it is not and
here's<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.050> shredder<00:02:22.350> face<00:02:22.590> man<00:02:23.190> whoo<00:02:23.940> that's

applications for the most part are
pretty<00:02:54.840> clean<00:02:55.470> now<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:56.040> figure<00:02:56.340> does<00:02:56.490> have<00:02:56.670> an

pretty clean now the figure does have an
open<00:02:57.120> hand<00:02:57.300> over<00:02:57.480> here<00:02:57.660> so<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.840> can't<00:02:58.200> hold

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
open hand over here so you can't hold

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
detail right there on the belt that came

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.360 
detail right there on the belt that came
out<00:03:03.690> looking<00:03:03.930> pretty<00:03:03.960> good<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.620> don't<00:03:05.070> like<00:03:05.190> how

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
out looking pretty good I don't like how

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.190 
out looking pretty good I don't like how
you<00:03:05.430> could<00:03:05.640> see<00:03:06.000> like<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.510> paint<00:03:06.870> wearing

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
you could see like this paint wearing

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.600 
you could see like this paint wearing
off<00:03:07.320> right<00:03:07.530> here<00:03:07.710> in<00:03:07.830> these<00:03:07.950> two<00:03:08.190> joints

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
off right here in these two joints

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.850 
off right here in these two joints
that's<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.060> little<00:03:09.330> frustrating<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.530> overall

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
that's a little frustrating but overall

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.010 
that's a little frustrating but overall
I<00:03:11.220> like<00:03:11.640> how<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.850> figure<00:03:12.180> looks<00:03:12.420> looks<00:03:12.780> pretty

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
I like how the figure looks looks pretty

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.480 
I like how the figure looks looks pretty
badass<00:03:13.170> there's<00:03:13.530> more<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:13.890> cool<00:03:14.130> silver

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
badass there's more of that cool silver

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.700 
badass there's more of that cool silver
to<00:03:14.580> that<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.760> like<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.360> then<00:03:15.960> here's<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.320> shin

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
to that I like and then here's a shin

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.530 
to that I like and then here's a shin
guards<00:03:17.070> which<00:03:17.250> look<00:03:17.460> awesome<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.090> even<00:03:18.390> some

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
guards which look awesome and even some

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.940 
guards which look awesome and even some
nice<00:03:18.690> sculpting<00:03:19.140> right<00:03:19.290> here<00:03:19.470> on<00:03:19.560> his<00:03:19.710> feet

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
nice sculpting right here on his feet

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.070 
nice sculpting right here on his feet
again<00:03:20.190> here's<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.880> Cape<00:03:21.240> which<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:21.630> actually

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
again here's the Cape which is actually

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.750 
again here's the Cape which is actually
removable<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.830> like<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.520> can<00:03:23.550> just

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
removable I like that so you can just

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.060 
removable I like that so you can just
pop<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.210> off<00:03:24.450> over<00:03:24.630> here<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.410> has<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.770> peg

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
pop this off over here it has this peg

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.890 
pop this off over here it has this peg
that<00:03:26.280> sticks<00:03:26.640> out<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.270> plugs<00:03:27.570> into<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
that sticks out and that plugs into the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.330 
that sticks out and that plugs into the
back<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.350> here's<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.680> sculpting<00:03:29.130> on<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
back and here's the sculpting on the

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.460 
back and here's the sculpting on the
back<00:03:29.550> of<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.790> figure<00:03:29.970> not<00:03:30.660> too<00:03:30.870> shabby

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
back of the figure not too shabby

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.350 
back of the figure not too shabby
so<00:03:31.710> the<00:03:31.800> reticulation<00:03:32.220> on<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.550> guy<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.790> okay

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
so the reticulation on this guy is okay

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.410 
so the reticulation on this guy is okay
not<00:03:33.840> great<00:03:34.320> his<00:03:34.980> head<00:03:35.190> moves<00:03:35.370> side<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.880> side<00:03:36.120> it

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
not great his head moves side to side it

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.090 
not great his head moves side to side it
does<00:03:36.570> not<00:03:36.720> move<00:03:36.930> up<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.380> down<00:03:37.560> at<00:03:37.710> all<00:03:37.890> now<00:03:38.070> I

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
does not move up and down at all now I

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.530 
does not move up and down at all now I
graph<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.430> have<00:03:38.610> with<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.850> head<00:03:38.970> articulation

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
graph I have with the head articulation

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.180 
graph I have with the head articulation
is<00:03:39.630> when<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.990> have<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.260> helmet<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:40.710> and<00:03:40.980> the

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
is when you have the helmet on and the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.500 
is when you have the helmet on and the
cape<00:03:41.370> on<00:03:41.520> at<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.700> same<00:03:41.850> time<00:03:41.910> when<00:03:42.240> you<00:03:42.300> turn

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
cape on at the same time when you turn

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.450 
cape on at the same time when you turn
the<00:03:42.600> head<00:03:42.750> side<00:03:42.990> to<00:03:43.020> side<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.800> helmet<00:03:44.160> lists

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
the head side to side the helmet lists

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.090 
the head side to side the helmet lists
up<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:45.300> kind<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.900> sucks<00:03:46.200> then<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.620> gets<00:03:46.830> into

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
up that kind of sucks then it gets into

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.620 
up that kind of sucks then it gets into
his<00:03:47.190> eyes<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.730> everything<00:03:47.910> that's<00:03:48.270> kind<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.540> a

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
his eyes and everything that's kind of a

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.820 
his eyes and everything that's kind of a
bummer<00:03:48.840> just<00:03:49.110> like<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.290> first<00:03:49.470> shredder

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
bummer just like the first shredder

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.620 
bummer just like the first shredder
figure<00:03:50.160> he<00:03:50.310> does<00:03:50.520> have<00:03:50.730> hinges<00:03:51.150> right<00:03:51.330> here

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
figure he does have hinges right here

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.090 
figure he does have hinges right here
which<00:03:51.930> actually<00:03:52.140> do<00:03:52.530> work<00:03:52.710> a<00:03:52.740> little<00:03:52.920> bit

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
which actually do work a little bit

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.380 
which actually do work a little bit
further<00:03:53.340> than<00:03:53.490> this<00:03:53.670> one<00:03:53.850> this<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.120> kind<00:03:54.360> of

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
further than this one this is kind of

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.210 
further than this one this is kind of
just<00:03:54.510> barely<00:03:55.080> on<00:03:55.380> there<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:55.680> can<00:03:55.830> move<00:03:56.070> it

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
just barely on there you can move it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.770 
just barely on there you can move it
just<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.490> little<00:03:56.850> bit<00:03:56.970> like<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.150> but<00:03:57.600> this<00:03:57.720> is

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
just a little bit like that but this is

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.080 
just a little bit like that but this is
actually<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.260> full<00:03:58.590> on<00:03:58.740> and<00:03:59.070> genell<00:03:59.460> state<00:03:59.850> up

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
actually a full on and genell state up

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.430 
actually a full on and genell state up
if<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.360> move<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.630> up<00:04:00.810> like<00:04:00.990> that<00:04:01.020> so<00:04:01.350> that's

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
if you move it up like that so that's

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.440 
if you move it up like that so that's
pretty<00:04:01.770> cool<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.490> has<00:04:02.520> these<00:04:02.760> shoulder<00:04:03.120> joints

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
pretty cool it has these shoulder joints

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.660 
pretty cool it has these shoulder joints
that<00:04:03.570> rotate<00:04:04.020> upwards<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.250> can<00:04:05.490> rotate

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
that rotate upwards and you can rotate

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.270 
that rotate upwards and you can rotate
them<00:04:06.030> forward<00:04:06.540> he<00:04:06.930> has<00:04:07.170> no<00:04:07.560> slope<00:04:07.890> over<00:04:08.130> here

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
them forward he has no slope over here

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.610 
them forward he has no slope over here
at<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.460> bicep<00:04:08.850> none<00:04:09.240> at<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.510> elbow<00:04:09.960> he<00:04:10.380> does

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
at the bicep none at the elbow he does

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.560 
at the bicep none at the elbow he does
have<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.890> wrist<00:04:11.220> swivel<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.030> at<00:04:12.180> least<00:04:12.330> we<00:04:12.540> have

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
have a wrist swivel so at least we have

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.600 
have a wrist swivel so at least we have
that<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:13.470> does<00:04:13.710> have<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> waist<00:04:14.190> joint<00:04:14.490> over

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
that it does have a waist joint over

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.580 
that it does have a waist joint over
here<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:14.970> has<00:04:15.120> legs<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.570> move<00:04:15.780> outward<00:04:16.350> and

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
here it has legs that move outward and

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.380 
here it has legs that move outward and
you<00:04:16.830> can<00:04:17.070> rotate<00:04:17.310> them<00:04:17.640> forward<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.150> that's

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
you can rotate them forward so that's

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.039 
you can rotate them forward so that's
pretty<00:04:18.630> cool

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
pretty cool

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.720 
pretty cool
unlike<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.560> first<00:04:19.590> set<00:04:19.950> of<00:04:19.980> figure<00:04:20.280> he<00:04:20.489> does

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
unlike the first set of figure he does

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.610 
unlike the first set of figure he does
have<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:20.970> single<00:04:21.270> jointed<00:04:21.600> knee<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.020> that's

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
have a single jointed knee and that's

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.020 
have a single jointed knee and that's
about<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:23.010> that's<00:04:23.160> all<00:04:23.340> those<00:04:23.460> articulation

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
about it that's all those articulation

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.120 
about it that's all those articulation
he<00:04:24.150> does<00:04:24.390> have<00:04:24.600> hollow<00:04:24.870> feet<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.440> peg<00:04:25.860> holes

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
he does have hollow feet and peg holes

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.590 
he does have hollow feet and peg holes
at<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.400> bottom<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.760> his<00:04:26.820> feet<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.360> scale

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
at the bottom of his feet so the scale

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.390 
at the bottom of his feet so the scale
for<00:04:27.810> these<00:04:27.900> figures<00:04:28.230> isn't<00:04:28.590> too<00:04:28.740> large<00:04:28.980> this

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
for these figures isn't too large this
