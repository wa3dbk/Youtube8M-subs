where I got interested in doing equine
nutrition<00:00:56.910> because<00:00:57.360> people<00:00:57.719> came<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.350> me

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
nutrition because people came to me

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.849

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
there with problems about nutritional

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.460

things<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.699> horses<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.229> time

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
things with horses and and at that time

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.890 
things with horses and and at that time
I<00:01:04.530> formulated<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.489> mineral<00:01:05.970> program<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.720> some

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
I formulated a mineral program for some

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.859 
I formulated a mineral program for some
horses<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:07.890> worked<00:01:08.130> well<00:01:08.840> then<00:01:09.840> I

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
horses that really worked well then I

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.899 
horses that really worked well then I
kind<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> put<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> shelf<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.340> quite

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
kind of put that on the shelf for quite

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.499 
kind of put that on the shelf for quite
a<00:01:11.939> few<00:01:12.180> years<00:01:12.479> because<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.020> did<00:01:14.299> from<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a few years because I did from there I

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.320 
a few years because I did from there I
went<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.380> ruminant<00:01:17.220> nutrition<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.970> did<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> lot

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
went to a ruminant nutrition I did a lot

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.820 
went to a ruminant nutrition I did a lot
of<00:01:18.360> feedlot<00:01:18.780> work<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> lot<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.470> range<00:01:19.619> work

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
of feedlot work and a lot of range work

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.660 
of feedlot work and a lot of range work
but<00:01:20.070> about<00:01:20.250> 10<00:01:20.490> years<00:01:20.729> ago<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.619> remembered<00:01:22.670> what

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
but about 10 years ago I remembered what

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
but about 10 years ago I remembered what
I'd<00:01:23.820> done<00:01:24.090> back<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.049> had<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> lot<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
I'd done back then and I had a lot of

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.520 
I'd done back then and I had a lot of
people<00:01:25.740> talking<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.430> me<00:01:26.460> about<00:01:26.670> equine

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
people talking to me about equine

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.950 
people talking to me about equine
problems<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:28.979> started<00:01:29.540> reformulating<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
problems so I started reformulating that

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.679 
problems so I started reformulating that
program<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.799> taking<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.880> mineral<00:01:33.240> package

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
program and taking that mineral package

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.260 
program and taking that mineral package
and<00:01:33.930> expanding<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.560> into<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> complete<00:01:35.460> program

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and expanding it into a complete program

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.310 
and expanding it into a complete program
and<00:01:37.130> first<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.400> started<00:01:39.030> working<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and first I started working with a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.109 
and first I started working with a
pelleted<00:01:40.920> product<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.430> worked<00:01:41.640> great<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
pelleted product that worked great and

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.950 
pelleted product that worked great and
then<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.860> was<00:01:43.860> encouraged<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.549> try<00:01:44.960> extruding

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
then I was encouraged to try extruding

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.520 
then I was encouraged to try extruding
feed<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.979> lo<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.939> behold<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:49.049> my<00:01:49.229> basic

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
feed and lo and behold with my basic

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.280 
feed and lo and behold with my basic
mineral<00:01:50.130> package<00:01:50.820> my<00:01:51.030> vitamin<00:01:51.659> package<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
mineral package my vitamin package a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830 
mineral package my vitamin package a
coupled<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.340> extrusion<00:01:53.729> process<00:01:53.909> has

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
coupled with the extrusion process has

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.249 
coupled with the extrusion process has
come<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.560> something<00:01:56.369> that's<00:01:56.640> actually

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
come to be something that's actually

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.929 
come to be something that's actually
better<00:01:58.259> than<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.590> expected<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:59.520> far<00:01:59.790> as

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939

well<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.820> have<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> special<00:03:48.470> mineral<00:03:49.470> package

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.070 
well I have a special mineral package
and<00:03:50.160> amino<00:03:50.610> acid<00:03:50.970> package<00:03:51.330> that<00:03:51.600> helps<00:03:51.900> that

and amino acid package that helps that
that's<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:53.190> hoof<00:03:53.430> growth<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.269> hoof<00:03:54.480> texture

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
that's the hoof growth the hoof texture

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.220 
that's the hoof growth the hoof texture

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
and if you get this right you should

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.229 
and if you get this right you should
increase<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.830> hoof<00:03:59.130> growth<00:03:59.370> by<00:03:59.580> about<00:03:59.790> 50%

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
increase the hoof growth by about 50%

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.560 
increase the hoof growth by about 50%
