00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.470
 new video I bring you a bomb 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.990

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.240
 say playstation 3 and xbox360 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.270
 activision has published a press release 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.430
 talking about this and it is very possible 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.449
 as you read the title that we do not have 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.539
 dlcs in old generation is worth us 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.699
 let's get nervous we go by steps what 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.650
 what they have said is that good to a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.809
 series of people have asked them about 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.380
 agreement if they can buy the season pass 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.790
 4 since the game was announced is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.719
 available in the presale of the season 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.750
 pass that theoretically includes 4 dlcs is not 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.059
 know what they will include but they are 4 of lc and 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.160
 in the new generation more pc already 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.910
 can buy but with confirmation 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.039
 the other day of the game in james I do not know 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.109
 He said nothing about whether the season pass 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.270
 I could buy there are people who have 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.220
 directly asked activision up 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.840
 that they have wanted to answer in 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.420
 a statement and it has been 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.299
 what they have done they have said that it is not 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.119
 available presale of the armchair pass 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.939
 and they have said that we will have more 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.829
 information about the launch of the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.750
 game that is in the e3 is not going to 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.610
 talk about this and I do not know how to talk about this 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.530
 neither in the gamescom but near the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.750
 launch of the game at the most a month 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.060
 before the game comes out we can 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.130
 think with this we can not think that it 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.380
 they will mark the will of you and the one of 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.859
 well we all know that bro call of 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.750
 duty black ops 1 for example in wii in 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.479
 uy normal not away use alauÃ­ normal 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.179
 no tlc came out, only the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.539
 game without deeds call of duty ghosts 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.130
 in wii and it came out also without tlc is not 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.409
 because he also made this transition 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.200
 let's say the new generation we still had 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.149
 the old generation that was 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.950
 there you could play and so and so the tlcs 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:04.170
 they took them out for playstation 3 xbox360 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.259
 but today with this game we have been 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.549
 said that it will not affect anything that 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.259
 they had to adapt it to the 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.580
 previous generation is to say that they have 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.350
 seized 100% 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.270
 the maximum the capacities of 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.560
 next generation consoles so that 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.840
 we should not worry about what 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.280
 we are already new generation the game is going 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.410
 to leave also in old generation 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.300
 but it will not affect the new one 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.520
 generation that yes we are now 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.830
 saying that with this we are going to stay 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.360
 without dlc that's more of you too 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.130
 more the ones that you can us like a console 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.560
 of a generation you are going to be able or you are 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.140
 are going to be without tlc is in the old 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.450
 generation do not tell you what 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.280
 you think about this they have said or not 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.720
 they want to talk about the subject, 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.190
 you ask them this will not they either 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.500
 answer and have already put this 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.360
 communicated in plan let's leave this 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.910
 ok and that I assimilate a little 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.630
 this is what I think I do not and what 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.850
 what and what is in a way we mean 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.250
 confirm with him with the statement not 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.380
 you will have the statement yes yes I can 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.780
 put charly intel down there in the 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.510
 description to the fat me what they tell us 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.330
 we will not have dlcs no good no no 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.340
 the stool have no no this is not no 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.400
 it's nothing to confirm yet it's just 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.989
 a rumor is worth wandering around 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.280
 they have put enough people and so on 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.980
 etcetera etcetera 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.120
 but is that according to the season 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.380
 pass can not be bought anymore 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.420
 is that this is something that the truth is 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.250
 I do not understand, I do not understand why it is 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.530
 that if they were 100% sure that 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.480
 they are going to take out feces in the old 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.640
 generation would do like the new one 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.959
 they would pre-order the season pass and already 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.940
 you are all happy to see it 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.319
 buying and we get lined up but 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.420
 is that if you directly turn on a 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.340
 statement saying that they are not going to put 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.860
 the presale and that we will have more 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.690
 information later on that the truth 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.630
 is that it smells a little bad not because 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.900
 points more to not go for stool or 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.959
 eye that the teeth are different already 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.510
 that as we say it adapts not a 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.860
 different company in alien the game 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.989
 let's say a person has done it 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.489
 different in or based on the game 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.620
 principal that has crashed the 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.220
 treyarch workers it is possible 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.019
 that this company does of its own and makes 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.430
 your rights on your part this is not 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.139
 another theory that we'll talk more about 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.519
 ahead so we have more information in 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.680
 the e3 or little things that are filtering 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.940
 I hope that seeps please i need 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.900
 zombies 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.500
 nothing more kids I hope that I have 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.310
 out of information this and see you 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.310
 bye
