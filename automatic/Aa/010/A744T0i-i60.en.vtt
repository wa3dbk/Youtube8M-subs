barrier<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.210> sucks<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> know

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
barrier that really sucks but you know

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.899 
barrier that really sucks but you know
what<00:01:37.259> we're<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.710> trying<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.520> through<00:01:38.549> it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
what we're like trying to go through it

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.480 
what we're like trying to go through it
and<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.570> mean<00:01:40.200> adversary<00:01:40.710> builds<00:01:40.979> character<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and I mean adversary builds character I

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.899 
and I mean adversary builds character I
suppose<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.329> no<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.530> hasn't<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.369> definitely

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
suppose but no it hasn't it's definitely

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
suppose but no it hasn't it's definitely
not<00:01:45.060> been<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> brightest<00:01:45.720> road<00:01:45.960> I've<00:01:46.049> had

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
not been the brightest road I've had

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.230 
not been the brightest road I've had
I've<00:01:46.500> been<00:01:46.740> through<00:01:46.950> that's<00:01:47.460> fair<00:01:47.670> cloud<00:01:48.030> wind

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
I've been through that's fair cloud wind

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.999 
I've been through that's fair cloud wind
coming<00:01:48.570> into<00:01:48.780> an<00:01:48.869> environment<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.500> do

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
coming into an environment like this do

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
coming into an environment like this do
you<00:01:50.130> feel<00:01:50.490> do<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.850> feel<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.210> same<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.720> and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
you feel do you feel the same one and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.319 
you feel do you feel the same one and
and<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.860> feel<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.329> environment

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and do you feel like that environment

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.810 
and do you feel like that environment
can<00:01:54.540> change<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.340> didn't<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.700> was<00:01:56.759> that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
can change I didn't think it was that

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.100 
can change I didn't think it was that
bad<00:01:57.270> but<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.680> um<00:01:58.890> yeah<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.790> think<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.750> don't

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
bad but but um yeah I think we don't

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.359 
bad but but um yeah I think we don't
have<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.259> coach<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.009> when<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.340> a

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
have a coach so when we have a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.340 
have a coach so when we have a
difference<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.880> opinion<00:02:03.299> I'll<00:02:03.509> be<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.869> this

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
difference in opinion I'll be like this

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.870 
difference in opinion I'll be like this
is<00:02:04.530> how<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.680> do<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.189> key<00:02:05.490> will<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.759> like

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
is how you do it and key will be like

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.280 
is how you do it and key will be like
this<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.329> do<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.110> there's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
this is how you do it but then there's

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.490 
this is how you do it but then there's
no<00:02:07.469> person<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.610> settle<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.170> then<00:02:10.319> when

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
no person to like settle it so then when

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.990 
no person to like settle it so then when
this<00:02:10.619> conflict<00:02:11.039> comes<00:02:11.190> up<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:11.730> don't

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
this conflict comes up we just don't

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.610 
this conflict comes up we just don't
know<00:02:12.060> how<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.270> deal<00:02:12.420> with<00:02:12.450> it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
know how to deal with it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.059 
know how to deal with it
eventually<00:02:14.010> sometimes<00:02:14.519> it<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.730> lead<00:02:14.879> to<00:02:14.909> like

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
eventually sometimes it can lead to like

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.649 
eventually sometimes it can lead to like
players<00:02:17.069> like<00:02:17.360> offending<00:02:18.360> each<00:02:18.480> other

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
players like offending each other

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:19.970 
players like offending each other
because<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.319> think<00:02:19.590> they're<00:02:19.620> better<00:02:19.860> than

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
because you think they're better than

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.949 
because you think they're better than
the<00:02:20.190> other<00:02:20.340> player<00:02:20.629> saying<00:02:21.629> that<00:02:21.810> their

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
the other player saying that their

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.630 
the other player saying that their
opinions<00:02:22.290> better<00:02:22.500> right<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.129> you've<00:02:23.250> come<00:02:23.459> in

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
opinions better right and you've come in

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.940 
opinions better right and you've come in
kind<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.150> into<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.360> shock<00:02:24.659> calling<00:02:24.959> roll<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:25.530> how

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
kind of into a shock calling roll so how

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.070 
kind of into a shock calling roll so how
does<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.549> mean<00:02:26.610> that's<00:02:26.970> there<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.930> bit

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
does that I mean that's there is a bit

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.570 
does that I mean that's there is a bit
of<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> hierarchy<00:02:28.409> when<00:02:28.830> you're<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.040> game<00:02:29.280> as<00:02:29.519> a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
of a hierarchy when you're in game as a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.430 
of a hierarchy when you're in game as a
shock<00:02:30.060> collar<00:02:30.090> do<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.900> find<00:02:31.079> that<00:02:31.230> there's

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
shock collar do you find that there's

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.440 
shock collar do you find that there's
conflict<00:02:31.799> there<00:02:32.099> or<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.579> you<00:02:32.670> guys<00:02:32.790> work<00:02:33.180> well

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
conflict there or do you guys work well

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.509 
conflict there or do you guys work well
when<00:02:33.659> you're<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.260> actual<00:02:34.560> game<00:02:34.650> scenario

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
when you're in the actual game scenario

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.819 
when you're in the actual game scenario
well<00:02:35.760> like<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.030> think<00:02:36.629> everyone<00:02:37.079> pulls<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.620> bit

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
well like I think everyone pulls a bit

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.270 
well like I think everyone pulls a bit
of<00:02:37.950> shock<00:02:38.129> calling<00:02:38.519> but<00:02:38.879> and<00:02:39.980> it's<00:02:40.980> kind<00:02:41.220> of

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
of shock calling but and it's kind of

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.360 
of shock calling but and it's kind of
hard<00:02:41.519> because<00:02:42.680> everyone's<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:44.010> mixed

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
hard because everyone's have mixed

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.309 
hard because everyone's have mixed
opinions<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:45.030> usually<00:02:45.510> I'll<00:02:45.840> do<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.140> shot

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
opinions but usually I'll do the shot

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.150 
opinions but usually I'll do the shot
calling<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.859> then<00:02:48.739> everyone<00:02:49.739> just<00:02:49.769> listens

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
calling and then everyone just listens

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.460 
calling and then everyone just listens
because<00:02:50.280> no<00:02:50.519> one<00:02:50.640> else<00:02:50.870> doesn't<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.260> mind

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
because no one else doesn't really mind

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.650 
because no one else doesn't really mind
anything<00:02:52.950> right<00:02:53.579> to<00:02:53.910> go<00:02:54.060> well<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.359> is<00:02:54.480> good<00:02:54.599> i

terms<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.760> way<00:03:11.879> that<00:03:11.909> workflow<00:03:12.480> and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
terms of the way that workflow and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.970 
terms of the way that workflow and
things<00:03:13.049> operate<00:03:13.379> in<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.859> LCS<00:03:14.159> um<00:03:15.090> I<00:03:16.019> think

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
things operate in the LCS um I think

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.949 
things operate in the LCS um I think
with<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.489> mills<00:03:17.700> yes<00:03:18.120> everybody<00:03:18.630> just<00:03:18.720> kind

acting<00:03:23.400> basic<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.209> just<00:03:24.900> like<00:03:25.049> knowing<00:03:25.349> being

at<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.889> right<00:03:25.980> place<00:03:26.010> at<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.280> right<00:03:26.340> time<00:03:26.459> is

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
at the right place at the right time is

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.530 
at the right place at the right time is
really<00:03:27.389> important<00:03:27.810> um<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:30.030> biggest<00:03:30.239> thing<00:03:30.389> I
