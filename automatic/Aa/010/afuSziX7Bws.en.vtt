00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:12.699
 - near control 20 30 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.929
 between the main functions 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.230
 the interlocution 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.579
 centralizes all information 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.649
 what it was pain of the one can see everything that happens in the field 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.060
 because I have a staff that works at the station and china just cadastar da 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.169
 facebook train station operator manages to manufacture technical advice 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.710
 the child operator 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.480
 always against him is the guy who gathers all the information that 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.530
 Can you buy all this? 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.600
 so with that he got the problem just ne luti with the train broke 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.790
 What to do, dont you? 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.730
 how to lead where to take 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.770
 the book by 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.770
 Do you intend to make a new cloud? 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.340
 however for example the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.890
 operator I always give control is that I know how to conduct this maneuver 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.740
 operator that he has the resources to command practically all and with the medium 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.700
 field 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.520
 he can command 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 the change of vienna committee that the dispatch 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.400
 the subway train passed one way to another 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.560
 he can line up 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.160
 on the terminals 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.280
 one of the trains 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.280
 make a come back maneuver 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.910
 and got 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 as you are practically all as an example 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 and another very important function the control center 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.470
 circuit administrator has not been used 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.539
 for example putting the right amount of 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.350
 of places 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.710
 on the right place 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.290
 and just in time 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.620
 so we have for example the peak time 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.080
 is a very large amount of users in the room at this time 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.360
 the managed system 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.200
 the distribution of the trains so the tv is a number of places 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.170
 in the most heavily loaded stretches 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.069
 the water 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.000
 we have a variable of cultures in the political system 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.430
 the team came in very strong and a revolver 38 and 3 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:11.560
 few people 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.919
 does all the programming of 

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.919
 that the difference is 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.399
 by table training of educators and conditioning training 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.329
 due to the bayer leverkusen in the interval between the trains 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.180
 which in the end ends up defining our offer 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.099
 disclosed 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.909
 Our system was changed 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.599
 Create alert 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.819
 dr accommodation 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.239
 it's the most 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.649
 based on a network 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.159
 so we're on the floor 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.299
 because these funds 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.189
 between two for every 30 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.409
 all networked 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.019
 a client architecture 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.439
 server 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.029
 so we finish machines 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:00.099
 specific for 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.789
 the collection of information of the field the freedom is there and storage 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.009
 based on data that uses monthly maps even 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:10.169
 the specific server 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.209
 collect information from the sp field 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.099
 send commands 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.099
 the server does the basic treatment of the organist information 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.129
 and treated moscow 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.299
 but consistency of the commands 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.109
 today's operator source 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.899
 Queen emma is a route in the countryside 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:29.789
 messi 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:32.359
 servers to do 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.359
 this time the action if possible on this bike does not 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.459
 we have specific servers for advanced reissues functions 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.069
 advanced functions 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.390
 that intelligent departure from the system 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.299
 your aunt to administer 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.419
 the course started 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.629
 Care interval between the trains 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.630
 This is a machine that specifies 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.139
 I made a specific mark for this. 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.359
 and we have machines 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.359
 there and have easily dialed 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.519
 the machine that runs the scut process 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.519
 that appears on the monitors - panels 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.389
 is that all 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.509
 then they complain 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.939
 then we the servers the servers that take the information from 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:19.909
 field are 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.079
 its heavy processing are 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.400
 it's two other machines 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.000
 with two processors day 167 mega refi 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:31.969
 58 '- memory 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.860
 the dutra machines 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.730
 Thirty are used in the mma part but have a special video card 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.440
 There were people who do 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.960
 all image processing 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.349
 in parallel running a 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.349
 information 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.340
 servers that these services 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.040
 all information processed 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.969
 by server 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.969
 but the famous people think advanced discussions 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.990
 all information that is exchanged with field relation also recorded 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.129
 together administrative subject 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:12.889
 So we have where it says that the network 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:14.419
 all this information 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.819
 she consulted to be later then we want to know 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.089
 What about me 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.050
 a fault in the 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.050
 in a certain equipment we can have information 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.270
 I'm disconnected like the leaves and stems that 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.300
 indications the only equipment 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.059
 gave it to us 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:36.809
 another system 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:38.430
 it's all connected to the same network 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.050
 The system of 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.050
 who administers his part and the billing 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:46.169
 after the alert 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.409
 a ticket in the field 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:48.729
 hot water 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.509
 the ticket information to another central so we can know 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.479
 type tickets 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:56.509
 the commissioner 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.509
 were used in the attack 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.520
 ideas 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.560
 this is after all the statistical treatment that the character 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.400
 We can eat here. 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.410
 a little altered in the programs that are loaded in the 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.909
 locks 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:19.960
 block 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.250
 a fumsoft radio that he interprets fake ticket 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:26.559
 this effort and the blockade said 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:27.589
 administrative
