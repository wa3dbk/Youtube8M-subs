to<00:01:48.770> honestly<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.890> white<00:01:50.130> rice<00:01:50.370> specifically

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to honestly is white rice specifically

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.120 
to honestly is white rice specifically
jasmine<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.900> reason<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.500> jasmine<00:01:52.980> rice

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
jasmine the reason I like jasmine rice

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.700 
jasmine the reason I like jasmine rice
is<00:01:53.670> because<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.330> has<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.870> higher<00:01:55.230> amount<00:01:55.440> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
is because it has a higher amount of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.430 
is because it has a higher amount of
carbs<00:01:56.100> than<00:01:56.580> regular<00:01:56.970> white<00:01:57.420> rice<00:01:57.690> though<00:01:58.170> the

chicken<00:03:29.430> now<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.910> advantage<00:03:30.239> of<00:03:30.450> this<00:03:30.630> over

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
chicken now the advantage of this over

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.830 
chicken now the advantage of this over
chicken<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:32.130> it's<00:03:32.340> extremely<00:03:33.269> lean<00:03:33.480> so

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
chicken is that it's extremely lean so

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.110 
chicken is that it's extremely lean so
roughly<00:03:34.470> six<00:03:34.799> ounces<00:03:35.160> maybe<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.579> hundred<00:03:35.850> and

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
roughly six ounces maybe a hundred and

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.780 
roughly six ounces maybe a hundred and
fifty<00:03:36.480> calories<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.260> it's<00:03:37.799> 25<00:03:38.310> grams<00:03:38.609> of

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
fifty calories and it's 25 grams of

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.479 
fifty calories and it's 25 grams of
protein<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.389> it's<00:03:39.540> got<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> very<00:03:39.930> high<00:03:40.489> protein

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489
