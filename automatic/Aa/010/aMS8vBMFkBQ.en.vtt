second<00:01:52.520> step<00:01:52.760> is<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.630> boil<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.470> boil

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
second step is the boil and you boil

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.280 
second step is the boil and you boil
that<00:01:55.010> liquid<00:01:55.490> with<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:55.970> sugar<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.630> um<00:01:56.840> for

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
that liquid with the sugar in it um for

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.140 
that liquid with the sugar in it um for
an<00:01:57.409> hour<00:01:57.590> add<00:01:57.920> in<00:01:58.130> hops<00:01:58.369> adding<00:01:58.880> some<00:01:59.030> more

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
an hour add in hops adding some more

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.270 
an hour add in hops adding some more
sugars<00:01:59.509> so<00:01:59.840> that<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.680> get<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.950> alcohol

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
sugars so that you get the alcohol

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.340 
sugars so that you get the alcohol
content<00:02:01.759> up<00:02:02.210> because<00:02:02.689> some<00:02:02.840> more<00:02:02.990> sugar<00:02:03.110> the

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
content up because some more sugar the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.260 
content up because some more sugar the
more<00:02:03.530> alcohol<00:02:03.979> more<00:02:04.400> alkyl<00:02:04.759> it's<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.030> we<00:02:05.090> like

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
more alcohol more alkyl it's and we like

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.990 
more alcohol more alkyl it's and we like
alcohol<00:02:05.780> just<00:02:06.140> hops<00:02:06.710> included<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.580> hops<00:02:07.790> are

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
alcohol just hops included the hops are

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.960 
alcohol just hops included the hops are
included<00:02:08.509> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
included and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.490 
included and
measured<00:02:09.270> out<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.050> recipe

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
measured out for you this recipe

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.140 
measured out for you this recipe
features<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:11.190> murillo<00:02:11.490> hops<00:02:11.790> which<00:02:12.000> are

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
features are murillo hops which are

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.510 
features are murillo hops which are
really<00:02:12.330> citrusy<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.110> Columbus<00:02:14.010> hops<00:02:14.160> which

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
really citrusy and Columbus hops which

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.100 
really citrusy and Columbus hops which
are<00:02:14.760> your<00:02:15.030> bittering<00:02:15.450> hops<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.930> actually

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
are your bittering hops so it actually

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.610 
are your bittering hops so it actually
tastes<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.680> okay<00:02:17.190> that<00:02:17.520> would<00:02:17.610> happen<00:02:17.820> and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
tastes like okay that would happen and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.560 
tastes like okay that would happen and
how<00:02:19.620> much<00:02:19.830> alcohol<00:02:20.070> is<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:21.060> ends<00:02:21.450> it

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
how much alcohol is in this ends it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.110 
how much alcohol is in this ends it

honey<00:02:24.360> which<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.230> lighter<00:02:25.770> summary<00:02:26.280> theory

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
honey which is a lighter summary theory

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.040 
honey which is a lighter summary theory
with<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> little<00:02:27.270> bit<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.420> wheat<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.870> is

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
with a little bit of wheat in it is

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.960 
with a little bit of wheat in it is
still<00:02:28.320> five<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.710> a<00:02:28.740> half<00:02:28.770> percent<00:02:29.100> which<00:02:29.790> on

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
still five and a half percent which on

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.730 
still five and a half percent which on
to<00:02:30.210> put<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:30.450> perspective<00:02:30.690> Guinness<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.530> four

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
to put in perspective Guinness is four

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.240 
to put in perspective Guinness is four
percent<00:02:32.480> okay<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.990> it's<00:02:34.200> worth<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.740> there<00:02:34.920> is

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
percent okay so it's worth it there is

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.070 
percent okay so it's worth it there is
getting<00:02:35.580> right<00:02:35.820> it's<00:02:36.060> getting<00:02:36.360> better<00:02:36.540> okay

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
getting right it's getting better okay

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.970 
getting right it's getting better okay
yeah<00:02:37.410> good<00:02:38.070> so<00:02:38.850> then<00:02:39.030> after<00:02:39.660> an<00:02:40.050> hour<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.590> boils

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
yeah good so then after an hour it boils

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.470 
yeah good so then after an hour it boils
you<00:02:41.250> cool<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.580> down<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.790> little<00:02:42.060> bit<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.420> then

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
you cool it down a little bit and then

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.699 
you cool it down a little bit and then
we're<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:42.810> going<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.140> transfer<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.650> into

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
we're just going to transfer it into

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.460 
we're just going to transfer it into
this<00:02:43.980> job<00:02:44.360> which<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.390> where<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.930> funnel<00:02:46.230> comes

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
this job which is where the funnel comes

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.310 
this job which is where the funnel comes
in<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.060> where<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.300> happens<00:02:48.720> yes<00:02:49.020> this

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
in and this is where it happens yes this

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.199 
in and this is where it happens yes this
is<00:02:49.470> where<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.950> magic<00:02:50.130> happens<00:02:50.730> okay<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.030> you

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
is where the magic happens okay so you

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.970 
is where the magic happens okay so you
want<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.050> want<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.230> do<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.500> now<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.890> that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
want to you want to do that now is that

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.140 
want to you want to do that now is that
what<00:02:53.100> you're<00:02:53.220> gonna<00:02:53.280> do<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.550> show<00:02:53.820> how<00:02:53.940> that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
what you're gonna do and show how that

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.630 
what you're gonna do and show how that
happens<00:02:54.510> okay<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.650> like<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.950> do<00:02:56.070> it<00:02:56.190> into<00:02:56.520> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
happens okay you like to do it into the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.580 
happens okay you like to do it into the
sink<00:02:56.880> or<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.570> don't<00:02:57.840> go<00:02:57.959> right<00:02:58.020> everywhere<00:02:58.560> I

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
sink or so don't go right everywhere I

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.350 
sink or so don't go right everywhere I
think<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.010> looks<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.459> also<00:02:59.640> looks<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.000> it
