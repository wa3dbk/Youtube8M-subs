thanks<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.399> tip<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:27.690> my<00:01:27.990> assistant

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
thanks for that tip I know my assistant

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.650 
thanks for that tip I know my assistant
money<00:01:30.470> here<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.740> okay<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> density<00:01:33.450> of

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
money here one okay so the density of

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.620 
money here one okay so the density of
seawater<00:01:34.080> is<00:01:34.380> higher<00:01:34.890> than<00:01:35.460> pure<00:01:35.789> water<00:01:36.060> which

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
seawater is higher than pure water which

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.219 
seawater is higher than pure water which
makes<00:01:36.930> shifts<00:01:37.440> such<00:01:37.619> as<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:42.119> titanic<00:01:42.570> float

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
makes shifts such as the titanic float

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.190 
makes shifts such as the titanic float
easier<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.850> considerably<00:01:45.509> less<00:01:45.840> dense

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
easier as it is considerably less dense

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.590 
easier as it is considerably less dense
than<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> ocean<00:01:46.710> water<00:01:47.100> also<00:01:47.700> temperature

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
than the ocean water also temperature

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.749 
than the ocean water also temperature
affects<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> density<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> water<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.490> cold

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
affects the density of water the cold

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.460 
affects the density of water the cold
water<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> ocean<00:01:51.630> adds<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.289> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
water in the ocean adds on to the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.100 
water in the ocean adds on to the
density<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> water<00:01:53.149> well<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.599> temperature<00:01:55.050> of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
density of water well the temperature of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.600 
density of water well the temperature of
the<00:01:55.200> coldest<00:01:55.590> water<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> ocean<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.399> four

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the coldest water in the ocean is four

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.510 
the coldest water in the ocean is four
degrees<00:01:56.910> Celsius<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.990> fish<00:01:58.470> can<00:01:58.679> survive<00:01:58.800> but

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
degrees Celsius so fish can survive but

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:12.440 
degrees Celsius so fish can survive but

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.940 
of Titanic were crushed into huge
iceberg<00:02:39.239> there's<00:02:39.510> only<00:02:39.660> one<00:02:40.019> way<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
iceberg there's only one way that the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.350 
iceberg there's only one way that the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
that way well it's all because of the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.479 
that way well it's all because of the
colligative<00:02:44.880> properties<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.720> water<00:02:46.140> salt<00:02:47.130> and

down<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.930> water<00:03:13.140> however<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.640> ions<00:03:15.120> in

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
down to the water however the ions in

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.750 
down to the water however the ions in
the<00:03:15.569> salt<00:03:15.900> water<00:03:16.049> are<00:03:16.410> lowering<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.549> vapor

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
the salt water are lowering the vapor

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.120 
the salt water are lowering the vapor
pressure<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.209> h2o<00:03:18.690> well<00:03:19.440> since<00:03:19.920> they're

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
pressure of h2o well since they're

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.440 
pressure of h2o well since they're
trying<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.430> be<00:03:20.549> in<00:03:20.639> equilibrium<00:03:20.790> with<00:03:21.299> each

other that Isis vapor pressure has to

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.250 
other that Isis vapor pressure has to
lower<00:03:23.579> as<00:03:23.819> well<00:03:24.030> which<00:03:24.540> depreciate<00:03:25.230> the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
lower as well which depreciate the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.050 
lower as well which depreciate the
freezing<00:03:25.859> point<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.160> ice<00:03:26.340> which<00:03:26.700> makes<00:03:26.940> the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
freezing point of ice which makes the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.710 
freezing point of ice which makes the
whole<00:03:27.269> solution<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:28.049> ice<00:03:29.180> sodium<00:03:30.180> chloride

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.500 

okay<00:03:36.680> for<00:03:36.890> this<00:03:37.129> experiment<00:03:37.580> you'll<00:03:37.970> need<00:03:38.120> ice

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
okay for this experiment you'll need ice

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.540 
okay for this experiment you'll need ice
water<00:03:40.269> thermometer<00:03:41.269> awesome<00:03:42.430> let's<00:03:43.430> start

water thermometer awesome let's start

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.259 
water thermometer awesome let's start
with<00:03:43.790> putting<00:03:44.090> ice<00:03:44.450> into<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:45.170> measuring<00:03:45.440> cup<00:03:46.269> oh

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
with putting ice into a measuring cup oh

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.580 
with putting ice into a measuring cup oh
the<00:03:47.660> water<00:03:49.420> then<00:03:50.420> stick<00:03:50.989> your<00:03:51.019> handy-dandy

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
the water then stick your handy-dandy

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.750 
the water then stick your handy-dandy
thermometer<00:03:52.430> into<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.000> ice<00:03:53.299> cold<00:03:53.720> water<00:03:54.110> and

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
thermometer into the ice cold water and

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:04.240 
thermometer into the ice cold water and
you<00:03:55.760> wait<00:04:00.940> whoa<00:04:01.940> okay<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:03.560> seems<00:04:03.860> like<00:04:03.980> the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
you wait whoa okay it seems like the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.020 
you wait whoa okay it seems like the
water<00:04:04.519> evened<00:04:05.180> around<00:04:05.620> mmm<00:04:06.620> 0<00:04:07.370> give<00:04:07.730> or<00:04:07.849> take<00:04:07.970> a

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
water evened around mmm 0 give or take a

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.400 
water evened around mmm 0 give or take a
few<00:04:08.120> degrees<00:04:08.799> well<00:04:09.799> ice<00:04:10.900> water<00:04:11.900> freezes<00:04:12.319> as

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
few degrees well ice water freezes as

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.130 
few degrees well ice water freezes as
your<00:04:12.590> grace<00:04:12.980> mixes<00:04:13.579> with<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:13.790> water

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
your grace mixes with the water

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.120 
your grace mixes with the water
basically<00:04:15.140> zero<00:04:15.560> degrees<00:04:15.829> now<00:04:16.760> add<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.120> salt

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
basically zero degrees now add the salt

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:31.330 
basically zero degrees now add the salt
here<00:04:19.130> we<00:04:19.280> go<00:04:19.519> oh<00:04:20.380> look<00:04:21.380> at<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:30.039> hmm<00:04:31.039> that's

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
here we go oh look at that hmm that's

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:40.690 
here we go oh look at that hmm that's
wait<00:04:36.850> nothing<00:04:37.850> for<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.440> well<00:04:39.440> hmm<00:04:40.400> looks

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
wait nothing for that well hmm looks

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.730 
wait nothing for that well hmm looks
like<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:41.270> temperature<00:04:41.750> is<00:04:41.900> negative<00:04:42.500> 5

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
like the temperature is negative 5

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.570 
like the temperature is negative 5
degrees<00:04:43.220> Celsius<00:04:43.700> whoa<00:04:43.940> oh<00:04:44.289> really<00:04:45.370> well<00:04:46.370> I

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
degrees Celsius whoa oh really well I

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.060 
degrees Celsius whoa oh really well I
wonder<00:04:46.910> why<00:04:47.180> well<00:04:47.840> of<00:04:48.320> course<00:04:48.380> I<00:04:48.710> know<00:04:48.830> why

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
wonder why well of course I know why

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.089 
wonder why well of course I know why
just<00:04:49.130> explained<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:50.320> well<00:04:51.320> when<00:04:51.770> you<00:04:51.889> pour

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
just explained it well when you pour

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.719 
just explained it well when you pour
salt<00:04:52.400> into<00:04:52.639> the<00:04:52.729> water<00:04:52.970> the<00:04:53.660> ions<00:04:54.729> separate

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
salt into the water the ions separate

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.339 
salt into the water the ions separate
which<00:04:55.940> ones<00:04:56.210> na<00:04:57.169> sodium<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:58.010> cl<00:04:58.700> chloride

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
which ones na sodium and cl chloride

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:06.420 
which ones na sodium and cl chloride
your<00:05:00.349> sis<00:05:00.560> smart<00:05:02.470> well<00:05:04.360> when<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.479> ions<00:05:05.870> mix

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
your sis smart well when the ions mix

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.390 
your sis smart well when the ions mix
separately<00:05:07.430> in<00:05:07.940> the<00:05:08.419> water<00:05:08.810> they<00:05:09.530> lower<00:05:10.010> the

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
separately in the water they lower the

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.430 
separately in the water they lower the
vapor<00:05:10.970> pressure<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.419> the<00:05:11.510> water<00:05:11.690> but<00:05:12.320> the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
vapor pressure of the water but the

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.610 
vapor pressure of the water but the
water<00:05:12.470> is<00:05:12.770> reacting<00:05:13.729> with<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:14.900> ice<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.380> the

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
water is reacting with the ice and the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.409 
water is reacting with the ice and the
ice<00:05:15.800> is<00:05:16.130> reacting<00:05:16.580> with<00:05:16.700> the<00:05:16.729> water<00:05:17.000> as<00:05:17.180> well

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
ice is reacting with the water as well

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.230 
ice is reacting with the water as well
so<00:05:18.020> since<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.740> vapor<00:05:19.370> pressure<00:05:19.520> of<00:05:19.849> the<00:05:19.940> water

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
so since the vapor pressure of the water

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.350 
so since the vapor pressure of the water
decreases<00:05:20.770> the<00:05:21.770> ice<00:05:22.099> has<00:05:22.430> to<00:05:22.610> decrease<00:05:22.760> along

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
decreases the ice has to decrease along

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.909 
decreases the ice has to decrease along
with<00:05:23.599> the<00:05:23.780> water<00:05:23.990> because<00:05:24.380> they're<00:05:24.530> trying<00:05:24.830> to

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
with the water because they're trying to

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.380 
with the water because they're trying to
reach<00:05:25.099> equilibrium<00:05:25.400> with<00:05:26.000> each<00:05:26.030> other<00:05:26.360> so

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
reach equilibrium with each other so

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.930 
reach equilibrium with each other so
the<00:05:28.780> ice<00:05:28.990> decreases<00:05:29.530> as<00:05:29.710> well<00:05:29.950> which<00:05:30.370> is<00:05:30.400> below

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
the ice decreases as well which is below

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.240 
the ice decreases as well which is below
zero<00:05:31.240> a<00:05:31.480> good<00:05:31.960> five<00:05:32.140> degrees<00:05:32.530> so<00:05:33.220> it

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
zero a good five degrees so it

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.630 
zero a good five degrees so it
depreciate<00:05:33.820> the<00:05:33.850> freezing<00:05:34.330> point<00:05:34.510> of<00:05:34.720> water

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
depreciate the freezing point of water

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.660 
depreciate the freezing point of water
so<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.910> mixture<00:05:37.210> of<00:05:37.240> salt<00:05:37.750> water<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:39.010> ice

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
so the mixture of salt water and ice

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.550 
so the mixture of salt water and ice
forms<00:05:40.510> a<00:05:40.630> much<00:05:40.780> lower<00:05:40.990> temperature<00:05:41.530> than

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
forms a much lower temperature than

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.860 
forms a much lower temperature than
actual<00:05:42.220> zero<00:05:42.760> degrees<00:05:43.090> to<00:05:43.240> freezing<00:05:43.270> point

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
actual zero degrees to freezing point

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.910 
actual zero degrees to freezing point
water<00:05:44.110> oh<00:05:44.470> I<00:05:45.460> did<00:05:46.170> you<00:05:47.170> must<00:05:47.290> have<00:05:47.470> done<00:05:47.500> a<00:05:47.620> lot

go<00:06:00.030> I've<00:06:01.030> bill<00:06:01.330> night<00:06:01.510> in<00:06:01.660> bed<00:06:01.870> oh<00:06:02.430> you're<00:06:03.430> here

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
go I've bill night in bed oh you're here

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.980 
go I've bill night in bed oh you're here
okay<00:06:04.390> so<00:06:05.350> last<00:06:06.160> topic<00:06:06.460> of<00:06:06.670> today<00:06:06.910> be<00:06:07.180> ocean

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
okay so last topic of today be ocean

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.530 
okay so last topic of today be ocean
currents<00:06:08.350> and<00:06:08.470> weather<00:06:09.060> ocean<00:06:10.060> currents<00:06:10.420> are

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
currents and weather ocean currents are

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.300 
currents and weather ocean currents are
gigantic<00:06:11.380> movements<00:06:11.860> and<00:06:12.040> the<00:06:12.070> Earth's

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
gigantic movements and the Earth's

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.510 
gigantic movements and the Earth's
oceans<00:06:12.790> generated<00:06:13.630> by<00:06:13.690> a<00:06:13.720> few<00:06:13.930> factors

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
differences in barred mean that there

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.990 
differences in barred mean that there
are<00:06:23.080> more<00:06:23.770> dense<00:06:23.920> and<00:06:24.160> less<00:06:24.370> dense<00:06:24.640> parts<00:06:24.940> of

are more dense and less dense parts of
the<00:06:25.060> ocean<00:06:25.120> there's<00:06:26.050> the<00:06:26.590> warm<00:06:26.800> water<00:06:27.070> which

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
the ocean there's the warm water which

further<00:06:32.110> down<00:06:32.290> in<00:06:32.440> the<00:06:32.530> ocean<00:06:32.620> that<00:06:33.340> will

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
further down in the ocean that will

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.100 
further down in the ocean that will
generate<00:06:33.580> movements<00:06:34.150> and<00:06:34.270> water<00:06:34.480> and<00:06:34.660> those

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
generate movements and water and those

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.160 
generate movements and water and those
will<00:06:35.380> turn<00:06:35.560> into<00:06:35.650> currents<00:06:36.040> then<00:06:37.030> as<00:06:37.870> far<00:06:38.080> as

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
will turn into currents then as far as

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.800 
will turn into currents then as far as
whether<00:06:38.350> there's<00:06:38.650> wind<00:06:39.400> that<00:06:39.700> blows<00:06:39.940> water<00:06:40.690> in

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
whether there's wind that blows water in

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.910 
whether there's wind that blows water in
a<00:06:40.870> certain<00:06:41.050> direction<00:06:41.200> and<00:06:41.710> there<00:06:41.830> are

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
a certain direction and there are

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.160 
a certain direction and there are
certain<00:06:42.550> winds<00:06:42.820> called<00:06:43.060> trade<00:06:43.330> winds<00:06:43.600> that

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170 
certain winds called trade winds that

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.870 
certain winds called trade winds that
blow<00:06:44.470> I<00:06:44.800> always<00:06:45.160> blow<00:06:45.460> in<00:06:45.640> a<00:06:45.700> certain

blow I always blow in a certain

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.210 
blow I always blow in a certain
direction<00:06:45.990> and<00:06:46.990> then<00:06:47.140> there<00:06:47.260> they're<00:06:47.680> located

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
direction and then there they're located

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.310 
direction and then there they're located
all<00:06:48.370> around<00:06:48.700> the<00:06:48.940> Earth's<00:06:49.090> oceans<00:06:49.450> then

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
all around the Earth's oceans then

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.170 
all around the Earth's oceans then
there's<00:06:50.980> the<00:06:51.190> moon's<00:06:51.400> gravitation<00:06:52.060> which

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
there's the moon's gravitation which

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.990 
there's the moon's gravitation which
also<00:06:52.420> has<00:06:52.840> an<00:06:52.990> effect<00:06:53.290> by<00:06:53.610> pulling<00:06:54.610> the<00:06:54.820> water

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
also has an effect by pulling the water

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.760 
also has an effect by pulling the water
with<00:06:55.270> gravity<00:06:55.750> than<00:06:56.320> in<00:06:56.440> a<00:06:56.500> certain<00:06:56.680> direction

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
with gravity than in a certain direction

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.590 
with gravity than in a certain direction
which<00:06:57.250> will<00:06:57.430> also<00:06:57.670> contribute<00:06:58.030> to<00:06:58.270> currents

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
which will also contribute to currents

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.540 
which will also contribute to currents
one<00:06:59.350> important<00:06:59.770> current<00:07:00.040> is<00:07:00.130> the<00:07:00.250> Gulf<00:07:00.460> Stream

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
one important current is the Gulf Stream

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.840 
one important current is the Gulf Stream
which<00:07:00.940> runs<00:07:01.210> from<00:07:01.510> the<00:07:02.290> eastern<00:07:02.860> US<00:07:03.040> up<00:07:03.490> the

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850 
which runs from the eastern US up the

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.060 
which runs from the eastern US up the
Titanic<00:07:04.330> route<00:07:04.480> up<00:07:04.660> to<00:07:04.930> around<00:07:05.530> England<00:07:05.980> and

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
Titanic route up to around England and

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.000 
Titanic route up to around England and
northern<00:07:06.340> Europe<00:07:06.370> and<00:07:06.930> that<00:07:07.930> current<00:07:08.530> warmed

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.010 
northern Europe and that current warmed

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.090 
northern Europe and that current warmed
Northern<00:07:09.640> Europe's<00:07:09.880> up<00:07:10.270> so<00:07:10.690> much<00:07:10.870> that<00:07:11.170> well

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100 
Northern Europe's up so much that well

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.470 
Northern Europe's up so much that well
if<00:07:12.250> we<00:07:12.370> weren't<00:07:12.520> there<00:07:12.730> that<00:07:12.940> basically<00:07:13.300> be
