00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.000
 we'll see the guys but the first one 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.230

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.400
 coins to the boys to participate 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.190
 you just have to put five thousand coins 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.830
 and how this will be done, that's why I ask you 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.190
 the leader of the psn is worth it guys once 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.620
 I will be added you have me to enter 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.600
 the tournament is worth once you have put 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.460
 the comment then to see you are not in 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.430
 the tournament for the boys to be already 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.740
 in the tournament list you have to add or 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.070
 you have to add me to me and I 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.040
 tickets and so I say I will not go 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.140
 the tournament is worth it then I put a player 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.840
 mine for sale and they give me the 5000 coins 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.980
 so with every one participant worth guys 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.900
 I do not finish the coins 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.209
 I'm going to make the tournament you give me 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.730
 the coins to keep all the 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.890
 coins in the coins will stay what 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.570
 I will save in a word there are so many 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.720
 participants there are so many coins 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.790
 simply because then it sure 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.319
 If someone loses and he has to give 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.650
 coins to the other 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.230
 it's not going to be a scam and it does not establish that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.549
 the currencies of the nursery valuable for 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.099
 participate in the tournament you have to 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.810
 have added in playstation 4 and added 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.469
 me through the comment of yours and 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.150
 of vale that is, added, I tell you 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:25.209
 wants to participate yes because we have put 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.620
 bet on a comment then buy 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.689
 this player for five thousand coins that 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.819
 I will say the player is worth and already 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.519
 directly you will do in the tournament then 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.870
 as will the tournament because of what 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.209
 depends on the participants that we are 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.219
 I'll do 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.730
 a phase of first groups or if not 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:44.349
 directly sixteenths and eighths 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.000
 semifinal and final quarters depends on 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.709
 that was called the boys that will already follow 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.120
 watching then guys if you want 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.329
 participate you already know in the comments 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.480
 you put me I participate measures of ponéis and 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.340
 of psn and two points spaces and yours 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.819
 idea is worth only for playstation 4 to 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.210
 see guys 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.340
 silva 14 per tournament 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.500
 I believe that I believe that nothing else 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.080
 it's pretty clear 5000 coins are 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.310
 to participate in what I schedules 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.890
 I'm going to upload another video saying the 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.780
 schedules and another very important thing for 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.780
 the boy is very very important 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.370
 once you imagine that you have to play 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.680
 against another subscriber of mine for example 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.720
 Pepito is worth Pepito vs. Saw 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.790
 example is an example 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.440
 when you play the game because in the 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.270
 I'm not going to be able to see it 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.220
 is worth the game then another game there if 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.880
 it is already when you are in the match 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.790
 I want a picture on twitter saying 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.340
 the match for example pepito versus 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.750
 car is a picture of the screen is worth 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.270
 of the result 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.850
 I need a photo it has to be a photo 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.460
 it's worth not even a video nor 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.050
 nothing has to be a photo is worth a 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.940
 photo of the screen of how you have 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.100
 remained of the final result worth children 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.650
 If there is no photo the party does not go by 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.720
 do not give up forgiving guys there have been 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.900
 for a yúnes that I have dropped the 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.050
 mobile what I'm saying if there's no 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.870
 picture the game is not given by played 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:16.240
 and will proceed to or having to repeat 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.070
 the match or if I see that there is no answer 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.650
 of neither of the two parts of the two 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.930
 players are disqualified the 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.419
 tournament is valid and will go on to the next phase 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.240
 or it will be given to them for the next 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.850
 phase which the next group or 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.630
