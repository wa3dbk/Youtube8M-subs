to show you as the main set of blades
and<00:00:42.690> here<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.409> have<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> fly<00:00:43.769> bar<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.339> fly

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and here we have a fly bar now this fly

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.299 
and here we have a fly bar now this fly
bar<00:00:44.820> transmits<00:00:45.540> your<00:00:45.839> linear<00:00:46.710> action<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
bar transmits your linear action of the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.119 
bar transmits your linear action of the
servos<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.449> the<00:00:48.600> main<00:00:48.750> blades<00:00:49.110> by<00:00:49.409> influence

helicopter now on a flybarless

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.359 
helicopter now on a flybarless
helicopter<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:55.110> eliminate<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.710> fly<00:00:55.949> bar<00:00:56.159> and

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:56.369 
helicopter we eliminate that fly bar and

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:58.939 
helicopter we eliminate that fly bar and
sir<00:00:56.820> placed<00:00:57.119> by<00:00:57.360> three<00:00:57.750> gyros<00:00:58.049> and<00:00:58.409> the<00:00:58.589> gyros

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
sir placed by three gyros and the gyros

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.100 
sir placed by three gyros and the gyros
do<00:00:59.280> their<00:00:59.760> own<00:00:59.790> special<00:01:00.210> mixing<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.869> keep<00:01:01.019> the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
do their own special mixing to keep the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.079 
do their own special mixing to keep the
helicopter<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.589> stable<00:01:01.949> for<00:01:01.979> you<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.970> does

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
helicopter is stable for you what does

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:04.939 
helicopter is stable for you what does
that<00:01:03.119> mean<00:01:03.449> well<00:01:03.659> it<00:01:03.869> makes<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.259> simpler

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
that mean well it makes for a simpler

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.620 
that mean well it makes for a simpler
head<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.430> don't<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.820> many<00:01:05.970> linkages<00:01:06.479> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
head you don't have as many linkages of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.780 
head you don't have as many linkages of
parts<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> head<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.409> supposedly<00:01:08.280> faster

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
parts in the head and supposedly faster

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
parts in the head and supposedly faster
response<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> lot<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.080> kind<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
response now a lot of that is kind of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.980 
response now a lot of that is kind of
reliant<00:01:11.009> on<00:01:11.159> how<00:01:11.729> fast<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.210> gyros<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.720> how

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
reliant on how fast the gyros are how

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.870 
reliant on how fast the gyros are how
good<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.320> mixer<00:01:13.619> board<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.250> we've<00:01:14.640> seen

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
good that mixer board is but we've seen

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.550 
good that mixer board is but we've seen
plenty<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.360> people<00:01:15.659> take<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.200> little<00:01:16.380> guy

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
plenty of people take this little guy

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.399 
plenty of people take this little guy
through<00:01:16.799> its<00:01:16.920> paces<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.479> perform<00:01:18.479> full<00:01:18.750> 3d<00:01:19.170> in

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
through its paces and perform full 3d in

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.260 
through its paces and perform full 3d in
their<00:01:19.619> house<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.520> far<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:20.909> looking<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> be

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
their house so so far it's looking to be

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.060 
their house so so far it's looking to be
a<00:01:21.360> pretty<00:01:21.659> good<00:01:21.810> product<00:01:22.140> let's<00:01:22.590> take<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:22.830> look

a pretty good product let's take a look
again<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.270> got<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.890> binding<00:01:25.890> fly<00:01:26.070> model<00:01:26.430> from

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
again we got the binding fly model from

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.700 
again we got the binding fly model from
our<00:01:26.700> local<00:01:26.880> hobby<00:01:27.150> town<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.600> Germantown<00:01:28.050> only

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
our local hobby town in Germantown only

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.530 
our local hobby town in Germantown only
because<00:01:28.830> I<00:01:29.070> got<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> dx6i<00:01:29.760> here<00:01:30.210> behind<00:01:30.330> me

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
because I got a dx6i here behind me

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.600 
because I got a dx6i here behind me
we're<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:30.870> to<00:01:30.930> program<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:31.680> gives

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
we're going to program it to that gives

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
we're going to program it to that gives
you<00:01:32.730> a<00:01:32.760> lot<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> lot<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.780> options<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.470> far<00:01:34.650> as

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you a lot a lot of options and as far as

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
you a lot a lot of options and as far as
dual<00:01:35.070> rates<00:01:35.280> an<00:01:35.490> exponential<00:01:36.030> go<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
dual rates an exponential go on a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.600 
dual rates an exponential go on a
helicopter<00:01:37.050> like<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:38.010> fully<00:01:38.280> fully

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
helicopter like this that's fully fully

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.850 
helicopter like this that's fully fully
3d<00:01:39.060> fully<00:01:39.330> acrobatic<00:01:39.870> you<00:01:40.320> may<00:01:40.440> want<00:01:40.650> those

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
3d fully acrobatic you may want those

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
3d fully acrobatic you may want those
extra<00:01:41.159> features<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.850> buy<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.120> ready<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
extra features if you buy it ready to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.420 
extra features if you buy it ready to
fly<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.170> will<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.440> a<00:01:43.500> spectrum<00:01:43.890> radio<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
fly you will get a spectrum radio it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.250 
fly you will get a spectrum radio it
will<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.790> 4<00:01:45.090> channel<00:01:45.120> model<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.900> I<00:01:46.200> do

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
will be a 4 channel model and I do

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.660 
will be a 4 channel model and I do
believe<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.710> has<00:01:46.860> dual<00:01:47.100> rates<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.549> that's

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
believe it has dual rates and that's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.430 
believe it has dual rates and that's
about<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.940> so<00:01:48.330> here's<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.900> looks<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.200> in

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
about it so here's what it looks like in

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.710 
about it so here's what it looks like in
the<00:01:49.920> box<00:01:50.130> again<00:01:50.430> that's<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.180> spot<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the box again that's the spot for the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.969 
the box again that's the spot for the
radio<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.590> kind<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.799> looks

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
radio there that's what it kind of looks

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.100 
radio there that's what it kind of looks
so<00:01:53.130> empty<00:01:53.280> let's<00:01:54.210> pull<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.510> out<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.840> take<00:01:55.080> a

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
so empty let's pull it out and take a

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.870

down<00:03:33.989> for<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.500> backward<00:03:34.890> gives<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.190> the

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
down for and backward gives you the

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.310 
down for and backward gives you the
collective<00:03:35.670> pitch<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.209> these<00:03:36.720> are<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:36.900> nice

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
collective pitch and these are a nice

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.080 
collective pitch and these are a nice
little<00:03:37.500> upgrade<00:03:37.680> ball<00:03:38.070> bearing<00:03:38.519> linear<00:03:38.850> servo

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
little upgrade ball bearing linear servo

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.030 
little upgrade ball bearing linear servo
so<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.049> nice<00:03:40.200> little<00:03:40.230> feature<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.830> kind<00:03:41.010> of

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
so just a nice little feature to kind of

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.560 
so just a nice little feature to kind of
smooth<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.459> out<00:03:41.580> when<00:03:42.060> you're<00:03:42.180> doing<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.420> lot<00:03:42.510> of

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
smooth it out when you're doing a lot of

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.600 
smooth it out when you're doing a lot of
fast<00:03:42.870> acrobatic<00:03:43.500> maneuvers<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.340> don't<00:03:44.489> want

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
fast acrobatic maneuvers you don't want

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.430 
fast acrobatic maneuvers you don't want
any<00:03:44.730> binding<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.450> old<00:03:45.600> searles<00:03:45.959> give<00:03:46.350> you

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
any binding and the old searles give you

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.229 
any binding and the old searles give you
a<00:03:46.500> little<00:03:46.680> bit<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.860> binding<00:03:47.250> these<00:03:47.700> won't<00:03:48.030> um

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
a little bit of binding these won't um

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.210 
a little bit of binding these won't um
so<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.930> see<00:03:49.080> again<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.920> look<00:03:50.040> at<00:03:50.130> the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
so you can see again you look at the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.650 
so you can see again you look at the
rotor<00:03:50.430> head<00:03:50.670> linkage<00:03:51.030> there's<00:03:51.330> almost

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
rotor head linkage there's almost

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.060 
rotor head linkage there's almost
nothing<00:03:52.140> there<00:03:52.500> compared<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:52.920> other

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
nothing there compared to other

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.580 
nothing there compared to other
helicopters<00:03:53.610> even<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.360> blade<00:03:54.840> 120<00:03:55.200> that's<00:03:55.530> a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
helicopters even this blade 120 that's a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.830 
helicopters even this blade 120 that's a
fixed<00:03:55.890> pitch<00:03:56.100> has<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.730> lot<00:03:57.000> more<00:03:57.030> going<00:03:57.330> on<00:03:57.570> to

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
fixed pitch has a lot more going on to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.570 
fixed pitch has a lot more going on to
it<00:03:57.989> that's<00:03:58.709> kind<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.220> beauty<00:03:59.370> of

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
it that's kind of the beauty of

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.890 
it that's kind of the beauty of
flybarless<00:03:59.970> that's<00:04:00.239> another<00:04:00.450> reason<00:04:00.660> they<00:04:00.840> do

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
flybarless that's another reason they do

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.289 
flybarless that's another reason they do
it<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.620> less<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.400> break<00:04:02.610> is<00:04:02.790> what<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.060> means

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
it so less to break is what that means

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.750 
it so less to break is what that means
less<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.810> repair<00:04:04.140> less<00:04:04.380> to<00:04:04.530> worry<00:04:04.680> about<00:04:04.760> the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
less to repair less to worry about the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.820 
less to repair less to worry about the
reviews<00:04:06.120> from<00:04:06.299> this<00:04:06.480> guy<00:04:06.630> I've<00:04:06.930> got<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> chance

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
reviews from this guy I've got a chance

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.110 
reviews from this guy I've got a chance
to<00:04:07.980> hover<00:04:08.130> one<00:04:08.400> I<00:04:08.459> haven't<00:04:08.730> put<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:08.910> through

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
to hover one I haven't put it through

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.910 
to hover one I haven't put it through
its<00:04:09.150> paces<00:04:09.269> but<00:04:09.780> I've<00:04:10.019> sold<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.350> plenty<00:04:10.860> of

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
its paces but I've sold on plenty of

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.830 
its paces but I've sold on plenty of
customers<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.640> they<00:04:12.150> love<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.510> durability

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
customers and they love the durability

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.060 
customers and they love the durability
these<00:04:13.139> are<00:04:13.260> actually<00:04:13.530> turning<00:04:13.769> out<00:04:13.889> to<00:04:13.950> be

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
these are actually turning out to be

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.340 
these are actually turning out to be
really<00:04:14.489> really<00:04:14.639> tough<00:04:14.910> helicopters<00:04:15.630> again

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
really really tough helicopters again

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.930 
really really tough helicopters again
because<00:04:16.680> there's<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.010> little<00:04:17.040> going<00:04:17.549> on

again nothing to it so again even though
it<00:04:28.650> looks<00:04:28.680> simple<00:04:29.010> this<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.400> fully<00:04:29.730> 3d

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
it looks simple this is a fully 3d

it looks simple this is a fully 3d
helicopter<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.260> is<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.500> capability<00:04:32.070> of

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
helicopter this is the capability of

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.590 
helicopter this is the capability of
doing<00:04:32.250> loops<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.910> rolls<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.390> flying

inverted<00:04:34.110> anything<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:34.800> can<00:04:34.950> do<00:04:35.040> with<00:04:35.160> the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
inverted anything you can do with the

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.710 
inverted anything you can do with the
full-size<00:04:35.610> this<00:04:35.790> one<00:04:35.940> should<00:04:36.120> almost<00:04:36.330> be<00:04:36.510> able

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
full-size this one should almost be able

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.750 
full-size this one should almost be able
to<00:04:36.780> handle<00:04:36.930> small<00:04:37.800> little<00:04:38.070> tail<00:04:38.310> rotor<00:04:38.550> on<00:04:38.700> the

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
to handle small little tail rotor on the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.910 
to handle small little tail rotor on the
back<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.840> nice<00:04:40.020> little<00:04:40.200> feature<00:04:40.410> that<00:04:40.770> was

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
back and a nice little feature that was

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.220 
back and a nice little feature that was
more<00:04:41.070> necessity<00:04:41.670> was<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:42.180> little<00:04:42.720> cap<00:04:42.930> on<00:04:43.140> the

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
more necessity was a little cap on the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.630 
more necessity was a little cap on the
end<00:04:43.260> of<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.530> rotor<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:43.950> you're<00:04:44.160> flying<00:04:44.430> around

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
end of the rotor so you're flying around

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.060 
end of the rotor so you're flying around
and<00:04:44.880> crash<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.810> hit<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.170> left<00:04:46.770> side<00:04:46.950> of

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
and crash and you hit the left side of

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.680 
and crash and you hit the left side of
the<00:04:47.160> motor<00:04:47.340> on<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.610> old<00:04:47.820> models<00:04:48.270> you'd

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
the motor on the old models you'd

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.120 
the motor on the old models you'd
actually<00:04:48.840> be<00:04:49.020> hitting<00:04:49.290> that<00:04:49.380> motor<00:04:49.710> itself

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
actually be hitting that motor itself

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.440 
actually be hitting that motor itself
now<00:04:50.430> we're<00:04:50.580> hitting<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:50.820> little<00:04:51.090> protective

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
now we're hitting the little protective

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.510 
now we're hitting the little protective
cap<00:04:51.690> so<00:04:51.870> we<00:04:51.930> don't<00:04:52.110> damage<00:04:52.230> it<00:04:52.530> again<00:04:53.130> just<00:04:53.310> one

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
cap so we don't damage it again just one

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.680 
cap so we don't damage it again just one
little<00:04:53.670> feature<00:04:53.910> they<00:04:54.120> give<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.510> help

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
little feature they give you to help

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.480 
little feature they give you to help
keep<00:04:55.380> your<00:04:55.530> run<00:04:55.770> in<00:04:55.920> while<00:04:56.100> you're<00:04:56.220> out<00:04:56.340> on<00:04:56.370> the

keep your run in while you're out on the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.550 
keep your run in while you're out on the
field<00:04:56.730> really<00:04:57.540> there's<00:04:57.810> just<00:04:58.020> nothing<00:04:58.410> to

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
field really there's just nothing to

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.650 
field really there's just nothing to
this<00:04:58.710> not<00:04:58.920> a<00:04:58.950> whole<00:04:59.130> lot<00:04:59.220> to<00:04:59.370> say<00:04:59.580> one<00:05:00.420> little

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
this not a whole lot to say one little

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.120 
this not a whole lot to say one little
thing<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:00.960> notice<00:05:01.290> with<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.560> batteries<00:05:01.980> on

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
thing I notice with the batteries on

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.980 
thing I notice with the batteries on
this<00:05:02.250> model<00:05:02.490> because<00:05:03.150> it's<00:05:03.330> capable<00:05:03.690> of<00:05:03.780> such

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
this model because it's capable of such

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.690 
this model because it's capable of such
high-g<00:05:04.560> maneuver<00:05:04.590> as<00:05:05.040> it's<00:05:05.190> actually<00:05:05.460> pulling

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
high-g maneuver as it's actually pulling

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.540 
high-g maneuver as it's actually pulling
a<00:05:05.940> lot<00:05:06.750> of<00:05:06.900> force<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.440> batteries<00:05:07.860> lock<00:05:08.250> into

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
a lot of force the batteries lock into

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.490 
a lot of force the batteries lock into
the<00:05:08.700> holder<00:05:09.120> so<00:05:09.630> I<00:05:09.660> don't<00:05:09.840> you<00:05:09.900> stick<00:05:10.140> this<00:05:10.290> in

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
the holder so I don't you stick this in

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.380 
the holder so I don't you stick this in
here<00:05:10.770> you<00:05:11.160> push<00:05:11.370> it<00:05:11.520> forward<00:05:11.760> and<00:05:12.060> there's

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
here you push it forward and there's

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.060 
here you push it forward and there's
little<00:05:12.630> years<00:05:12.960> that<00:05:13.170> actually<00:05:13.530> hold<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.950> in

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
little years that actually hold it in

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.520 
little years that actually hold it in
place<00:05:14.220> locks<00:05:15.150> in<00:05:15.510> you<00:05:15.630> push<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:15.990> in<00:05:16.080> hard<00:05:16.110> and

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
place locks in you push it in hard and

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.020 
place locks in you push it in hard and
it<00:05:16.920> can't<00:05:17.100> shift<00:05:17.370> around<00:05:17.640> because<00:05:17.910> when

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
it can't shift around because when

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.490 
it can't shift around because when
you're<00:05:18.150> pulling<00:05:18.330> again<00:05:18.690> a<00:05:18.720> lot<00:05:19.020> of<00:05:19.200> crazy

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
you're pulling again a lot of crazy

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.840 
you're pulling again a lot of crazy
maneuvers<00:05:19.950> there's<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.430> chance<00:05:20.670> for<00:05:20.790> the

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
maneuvers there's a chance for the

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.460 
maneuvers there's a chance for the
battery<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.150> shift<00:05:21.480> your<00:05:21.750> center<00:05:22.290> of<00:05:22.410> gravity

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
battery to shift your center of gravity

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.930 
battery to shift your center of gravity
boots<00:05:22.830> off<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.100> on<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.460> thing<00:05:23.610> just<00:05:23.730> flies

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
boots off and on the thing just flies

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.180 
boots off and on the thing just flies
terribly<00:05:24.360> so<00:05:24.600> blade<00:05:25.500> kind<00:05:25.800> of<00:05:25.890> knowing<00:05:26.100> what

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
terribly so blade kind of knowing what

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.130 
terribly so blade kind of knowing what
they're<00:05:26.340> doing<00:05:26.640> a<00:05:26.810> little<00:05:27.810> bit<00:05:27.960> extra

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
they're doing a little bit extra

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.720 
they're doing a little bit extra
engineering<00:05:28.680> for<00:05:28.830> you<00:05:28.919> guys<00:05:29.070> kind<00:05:29.310> of<00:05:29.460> nice<00:05:29.580> to

see that so really that's all I have to
say<00:05:31.860> about<00:05:31.980> this<00:05:32.160> model<00:05:32.580> until<00:05:32.820> we<00:05:32.940> get<00:05:33.060> it

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
say about this model until we get it

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.670 
say about this model until we get it
flying<00:05:33.360> that's<00:05:33.930> what<00:05:34.080> everyone<00:05:34.320> wants<00:05:34.530> to<00:05:34.590> see
