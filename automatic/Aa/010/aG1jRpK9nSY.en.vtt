00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.560

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:37.540

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.540
 chorizo ​​and we will cut into small dice 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.809
 that's when I did my little and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.129
 chorizo 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.110
 I will put a little oil on it 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.190
 in a skillet or a sautoir for 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.739
 bring out for really who 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.619
 perfume night go it's gone 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.269
 here I put my chorizo ​​debts with 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:01.869
 a little cloves of garlic and I'm going to them 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.650
 let sweat sweetly on very soft fire 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:05.210
 quietly and during this show is going 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.520
 prepare them chicken we go 1 6 and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.189
 slightly here at the entrance to the white of 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.650
 poultry on the widest part and 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.450
 gently we will slide the finger on 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.430
 along the skin hop that's when I 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.799
 slipped my finger 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.220
 I will replace my finger in 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.220
 slices of chorizo 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.640
 but white poultry are assessed at 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.270
 strange chorizo with chorizo ​​between the skin 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.830
 and the flesh 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.510
 I will now season them 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.860
 simply salt since chorizo 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.250
 it's already a little spicy we're not going too 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.990
 load with pepper but chorizo ​​you 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.040
 remember are in the oil and even so 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.110
 I will go colorful but poultry in 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.540
 the oil with the horizon starts at 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.680
 gently color your oil is made 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.660
 be careful not to burn it enough 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.730
 quickly so we will not burn and as soon as 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.110
 it starts to color we are going now 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.160
 the long ears and we put the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:04.210
 poultry whites so we liked it 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.979
 skin side well flat in the pan and 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.900
 we will slowly cook them the most 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.890
 gently possible to get the 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.370
 programming and the solution in 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.370
 simultaneous go we turn the meat 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.969
 we will let it cook slowly 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.980
 so we will degrease a little bit 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.870
 anyway because there is still 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.830
 quite serious 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.940
 so we get rid of it 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.880
 we leave the small pieces of chorizo 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.480
 and we immediately add an onion 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.760
 finely carve and there we work it 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.590
 just a few moments to sweat 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.160
 the onion can gently to the onions 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.670
 well known and now i'm going to deglaze 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.440
 with white wine and there against 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.660
 really reduces to ice to eliminate 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.000
 the acidity of the wine and the very alcoholic side 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.850
 killer go let's go for a 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.470
 mass reduction here is the white wine and 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.600
 reduced to practically dry 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.020
 I will add a little water 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.930
 to give body to my sauce no more 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.930
 I will create but this sauce chorizo 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.460
 and off we go a nice redaction 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.360
 massot it's a good consistency but 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.180
 she is white but she has 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.250
 a lot of mud a little bit of chorizo 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.700
 just cut into small sticks 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.140
 and I'm going to spend my sauce on these 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.470
 little sticks go let's go for 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.060
 the passage through the colander 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.500
 Come on, let's get all the sauce out 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:48.120
 and to look is caught in the caricature 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:51.590
 and there simply by mixing the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.590
 chorizo ​​will gently color my sauce 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.600
 all we have to do is to draw up 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.040
 well you chorizo ​​salt we do not 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.380
 add not ordered by the EU on the 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.920
 andres poultry and it's over go 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.920
 It's yours
