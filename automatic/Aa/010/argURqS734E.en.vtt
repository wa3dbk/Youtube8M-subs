there's several things you can do about

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.369 
there's several things you can do about
this<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.420> put<00:00:48.570> lighter<00:00:48.840> strings<00:00:49.230> on

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379

your<00:00:49.410> guitar<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:50.910> recommend<00:00:51.629> starting

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
your guitar I would recommend starting

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
your guitar I would recommend starting
off<00:00:52.320> by<00:00:52.649> putting<00:00:53.010> extra<00:00:53.520> light<00:00:53.820> acoustic

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
off by putting extra light acoustic

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.790 
off by putting extra light acoustic
guitar<00:00:54.570> strings<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.140> acoustic<00:00:55.379> guitar

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
guitar strings on your acoustic guitar

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
guitar strings on your acoustic guitar
they're<00:00:56.489> thinner<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:57.510> still<00:00:57.690> sound

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
they're thinner but they still sound

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.740 
they're thinner but they still sound
good<00:00:58.309> another<00:00:59.309> option<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.940> to<00:00:59.969> put<00:01:00.270> electric

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
good another option is to put electric

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
good another option is to put electric
guitar<00:01:01.050> strings<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.590> they<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.219> sound<00:01:02.460> as

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
guitar strings on they don't sound as

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.429 
guitar strings on they don't sound as
good<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.390> put<00:01:03.600> thinner<00:01:03.840> strings<00:01:04.260> on

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
good but you can put thinner strings on

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.500 
good but you can put thinner strings on
that<00:01:04.619> way<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.400> course<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.330> always

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that way and of course you can always

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.289 
that way and of course you can always
build<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.290> thicker<00:01:07.530> strings

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
build up to thicker strings

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.960 
build up to thicker strings
another<00:01:09.299> possibility<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.830> type<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> string

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
another possibility is a type of string

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.350 
another possibility is a type of string
called<00:01:12.270> silk<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.930> steel<00:01:13.670> this<00:01:14.670> string<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.299> a

hybrid type string in between a steel
string<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.659> nylon<00:01:19.140> string<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.070> goes<00:01:20.220> on

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
string and a nylon string and it goes on

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.789 
string and a nylon string and it goes on
the<00:01:20.490> acoustic<00:01:20.880> guitar<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.960> has<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> softer

the acoustic guitar it has a softer
sound<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.729> softer<00:01:24.119> feel<00:01:24.330> some<00:01:25.170> people

sound and a softer feel some people
don't<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> sound<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.520> might<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:26.729> be

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
don't like the sound and it might not be

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.440 
don't like the sound and it might not be
the<00:01:27.799> overall<00:01:28.799> sound<00:01:29.040> solution<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the overall sound solution for you but a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.179 
the overall sound solution for you but a
good<00:01:30.689> stepping<00:01:31.049> stone<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
good stepping stone to get to the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.480 
good stepping stone to get to the
thicker<00:01:32.790> strings<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> acoustic<00:01:33.600> guitar

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
thicker strings on the acoustic guitar

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.640 
thicker strings on the acoustic guitar
another<00:01:35.490> possibility<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.600> adjust<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
another possibility is to adjust the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.530 
another possibility is to adjust the
action<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.250> your<00:01:38.369> guitar<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> mean<00:01:39.390> by

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
action of your guitar what I mean by

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.819 
action of your guitar what I mean by
that<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.869> you're<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.229> adjust<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that is you're going to adjust the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.830 
that is you're going to adjust the
strings<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.610> they're<00:01:41.759> closer<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.390> fret<00:01:42.659> of

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
strings so they're closer to the fret of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
strings so they're closer to the fret of
the<00:01:42.869> guitar<00:01:42.930> they're<00:01:43.799> closer<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> neck<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the guitar they're closer to the neck of

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.060 
the guitar they're closer to the neck of
the<00:01:45.090> guitar<00:01:45.119> which<00:01:45.930> makes<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.350> easier<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> play

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the guitar which makes it easier to play

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.270 
the guitar which makes it easier to play
now<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.390> are<00:01:48.509> several<00:01:48.720> steps<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.500> adjusting

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
now there are several steps in adjusting

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.690 
now there are several steps in adjusting
the<00:01:50.520> action<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.180> guitar<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.780> involves

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
the action of a guitar it involves

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.569 
the action of a guitar it involves
making<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.119> nut<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.780> guitar<00:01:54.869> lower<00:01:55.579> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
making the nut of the guitar lower the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.709 
making the nut of the guitar lower the
bridge<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.509> guitar<00:01:57.740> lower<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.450> the<00:02:00.450> neck

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
bridge of the guitar lower and the neck

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.620 
bridge of the guitar lower and the neck
just<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.560> right<00:02:01.740> angle<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.490> then<00:02:03.060> finally

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
just the right angle and then finally

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.109 
just the right angle and then finally
last<00:02:04.229> possibility<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.219> file<00:02:05.850> down<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
last possibility is to file down the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.169 
last possibility is to file down the
frets<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.810> they're<00:02:07.079> more<00:02:07.350> even<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.700> trick<00:02:09.000> is

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
frets so they're more even the trick is

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.029 
frets so they're more even the trick is
to<00:02:09.209> get<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> strings<00:02:09.929> as<00:02:10.110> low<00:02:10.349> as<00:02:10.530> possible

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
to get the strings as low as possible

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.070 
to get the strings as low as possible
without<00:02:11.400> buzzing<00:02:12.000> anywhere<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.780> down<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
without buzzing anywhere up and down the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.430 
without buzzing anywhere up and down the
neck

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
neck

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.900 
neck

you want to be able to press the note

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.610 
you want to be able to press the note

here and have it sound nice and clear
not<00:02:17.130> hit<00:02:17.490> one<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.880> frets<00:02:18.180> up<00:02:18.390> here<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:19.500> is

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
not hit one of the frets up here this is

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.640 
not hit one of the frets up here this is
tricky<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.880> recommend<00:02:21.470> getting<00:02:22.470> a

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
tricky and I recommend getting a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.350 
tricky and I recommend getting a
competent<00:02:23.190> guitar<00:02:23.460> repairman<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.090> do<00:02:24.210> the

competent guitar repairman to do the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.690 
competent guitar repairman to do the
work<00:02:24.570> if<00:02:24.840> you're<00:02:25.470> mechanically<00:02:25.920> inclined<00:02:26.400> and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
work if you're mechanically inclined and

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.030 
work if you're mechanically inclined and
have<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:26.970> reasonable<00:02:27.690> tolerance<00:02:28.110> for<00:02:28.230> risk<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
have a reasonable tolerance for risk you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.130 
have a reasonable tolerance for risk you
can<00:02:29.250> learn<00:02:29.430> how<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.700> do<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.090> check<00:02:30.570> out<00:02:30.720> videos

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
can learn how to do it check out videos

can learn how to do it check out videos
on<00:02:31.410> YouTube<00:02:31.950> there<00:02:32.220> are<00:02:32.250> some<00:02:32.460> good<00:02:32.640> videos

I've<00:02:33.150> seen<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.510> there<00:02:33.720> there<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:35.040> risk<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.520> if

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
I've seen on there there the risk is if

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.060 
I've seen on there there the risk is if
you<00:02:35.850> file<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.420> nut<00:02:36.630> too<00:02:36.870> low<00:02:37.050> or<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.800> bridge

you file the nut too low or the bridge

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.650 
you file the nut too low or the bridge
you're<00:02:38.820> going<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.060> have<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.240> go<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.450> get<00:02:39.600> a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
you're going to have to go out and get a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.540 
you're going to have to go out and get a
new<00:02:39.840> one<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.710> actually<00:02:41.010> over

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
new one and you can actually over

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.820 
new one and you can actually over
tighten<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.150> metal<00:02:42.660> truss<00:02:42.960> rod<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.620> neck

tighten that metal truss rod in the neck
of<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.100> guitar<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> point<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.420> even

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
of the guitar to the point you even

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.170 
of the guitar to the point you even
break<00:02:45.810> your<00:02:45.960> neck<00:02:46.170> last<00:02:46.830> thing<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.670> do<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:47.850> to

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
break your neck last thing to do is to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.670 
break your neck last thing to do is to
file<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.480> frets<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> really<00:02:49.530> tricky

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
file the frets that is a really tricky

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.520 
file the frets that is a really tricky
one<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.310> wouldn't<00:02:50.580> even<00:02:50.640> try<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.530> last

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
one and I wouldn't even try that last

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.240 
one and I wouldn't even try that last

resort is to play your guitar with sore
fingers<00:02:56.610> until<00:02:57.120> they<00:02:57.210> get<00:02:57.330> tough<00:02:57.600> now<00:02:58.200> they

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
fingers until they get tough now they

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.930 
fingers until they get tough now they
will<00:02:58.500> actually<00:02:58.890> get<00:02:58.980> tough<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.490> usually<00:02:59.760> takes

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
will actually get tough it usually takes

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.000 
will actually get tough it usually takes
about<00:03:00.030> three<00:03:00.450> or<00:03:00.690> four<00:03:00.930> weeks<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.530> some

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
about three or four weeks and some

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.130 
about three or four weeks and some
people<00:03:02.250> can<00:03:02.460> just<00:03:02.670> work<00:03:03.060> through<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
people can just work through it the

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.140 
people can just work through it the
trick<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.680> find<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.220> place<00:03:05.520> where<00:03:05.850> if

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
trick is to find that place where if

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.660 
trick is to find that place where if
it's<00:03:06.540> holding<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:06.900> back<00:03:07.050> from<00:03:07.110> practicing<00:03:07.920> do

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
it's holding you back from practicing do

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.070 
it's holding you back from practicing do
what<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:08.940> need<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.120> do<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.480> get<00:03:09.630> easier

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
what you need to do to get easier

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.020 
what you need to do to get easier
strings<00:03:10.380> on<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> guitar<00:03:10.680> if<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.850> keep

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
strings on the guitar if you can keep

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.550 
strings on the guitar if you can keep
practicing<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.720> wait<00:03:12.930> till<00:03:13.080> they<00:03:13.170> get<00:03:13.320> tough

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
practicing and wait till they get tough

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.860 
practicing and wait till they get tough
then<00:03:14.220> go<00:03:14.430> for<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.760> nothing<00:03:15.330> wrong<00:03:15.450> with<00:03:15.660> that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
then go for it nothing wrong with that

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.690 
then go for it nothing wrong with that
and<00:03:16.050> once<00:03:16.710> you<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:17.010> calluses<00:03:17.550> on<00:03:17.670> your

really<00:03:20.040> won't<00:03:20.160> have<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.400> worry<00:03:20.550> about<00:03:20.670> that

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
really won't have to worry about that

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.220 
really won't have to worry about that
much<00:03:21.060> anymore<00:03:21.330> in<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.570> future<00:03:21.600> as<00:03:21.930> long<00:03:22.110> as
