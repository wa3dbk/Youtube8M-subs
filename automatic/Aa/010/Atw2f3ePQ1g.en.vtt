 who has the class 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.009

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.510
 22 22 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.070
 the pilot is prodigious 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.650
 we in any case the choice is made we will exceed the discovery of the club with 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.140
 this 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.189
 of alfa roméo 8c competizione

 rens 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.810
 Tuesday the first division 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.240
 in this by homeo 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.100
 but his compositions as well as the finish 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.670
 and yet believable hikers all being lamu 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.860
 brush 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.339
 in bright morning carbon 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.669
 the lineage of these competitions seized 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.779
 it is engraved in the carbon log ceiling lights which is all in 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:17.809
 leather 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:22.029
 the car is great but there really his identity alfa roméo so we go 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:24.249
 not look for sportiness with this car 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.549
 text obviously has sports cars apart from looking for performance 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.519
 on the circuit 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.519
 but it's really a huge happiness 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.919
 nothing less 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.919
 the car I never heard 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.609
 yesterday when he went to the end of his fingers to fix it 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:55.350
 now you go to the full turn 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.369
 news from céline 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.529
 gold in Darfur or slow because 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:04.099
 that's what it's all about when the bodywork is all the elements are in 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.909
 carbon it's the same subcontractors that made the areq redone 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.629
 complete of the carrera gt 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.809
 king did that because it's at the afp totally carbon these cars 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:17.079
 borrow the chassis we agree advised the maserati great tourismo 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.179
 and she also borrows 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:23.509
 its actually because this diva who sing extraordinarily to a quarter 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:28.329
 time of madness it's a third of ferrari the v8 4 8 of his peers 450 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.439
 horses is not the most powerful but anyway it's not what we 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.089
 ask this car because this car is a way of life we ​​are here 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.650
 to go for a walk 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.040
 but what would make the shape and the ride then we will have just small 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.709
 defects on his cars 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.109
 which are not the least because it is still a car for a 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.689
 purse skirts 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:46.710
 field side 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.730
 we have no place at the back of the principle of pleasure to the public mende 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.389
 square 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.549
 the little blues and it's gone annoying 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.549
 it's the body that is almost non-existent 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.849
 not quite full but nothing at all we can put the floor safe foot 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:01.929
 that's it 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:03.899
 so it's grotesque 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.899
 per share against the happy owners this car 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:09.969
 for a great little gift when they buy the hand 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:13.229
 this is this little crazy for all carbon 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:14.409
 the magnificent ones 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.159
 with the description 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.969
 of the car and the full story 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.169
 the interior is anxious 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.389
 the entire carbon center console 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.150
 the carbon dashboard that is extremely rare and never counted a car 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.330
 a dashboard 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.979
 entirely in carbon 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.790
 but with pink garlic it was the only flaw 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.320
 these ashtrays writing 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.760
 haiti it is true to know the gifts hyper chic but she 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.620
 the only flaw that can be found around noon 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.940
 we decided to leave a door 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.189
 in carbon and give it we announced six seats 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:49.560
 and it's extraordinary for so much carbon 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.020
 with the small logo so to alfa roméo 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.849
 taylor charles to find them here in gerland on the same martimes alps 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.670
 the severe maserati ferrari 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.740
 alas it is overpriced it is rather nice 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.960
 for once 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.390
 a finish in an Italian because it's still supercars 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.319
 drive 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.449
 there for once 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.909
 we collected finish that is up to the height of a supercar 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.949
 at the height of a national authority listen we will continue the balad'in 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.629
 in any case in federal 1 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.629
 when she was a minor 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.530
 read in a gta people try to get a little 0% 130 times that 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.530
 is on the highway 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.490
 woodbriand the passage of reports his wooden house to say to himself that one can 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.720
 change and I believe forty votes indeed 11 euros 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.560
 a year the good box report obviously really not what to do but 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.950
 all that to say that the media voice has even deteriorated so c 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.750
 is obviously slower than last season the annoyance of the Canadian 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.750
 which has just been released but it is more than enough to marvel 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.379
 hospital today 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:09.510
 it's alfa roméo 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.510
 offered us a strong character 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.300
 sensations of exclusivity and what character 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.430
 a real character a real pleasure engine a breathtaking line 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.290
 really an original car a brandished banner took place in 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.169
 presence of presidents of misfortune but at the same time that's what makes 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.490
 an exclusivity of his car 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.330
 it's perfect in attacks in the car 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.530
 facing her continues first to the cover
