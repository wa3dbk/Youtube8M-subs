what<00:00:25.560> I'm<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.830> do<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.099> take<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.490> probe

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
what I'm going to do is take this probe

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.810 
what I'm going to do is take this probe
stick<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.380> into<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.859> ventral<00:00:29.250> area<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.230> then

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
stick it into the ventral area and then

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:41.350 
stick it into the ventral area and then
redirect<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.649> toward<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> tail

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.800 

now<00:00:42.360> my<00:00:42.510> hands<00:00:42.750> are<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.930> little<00:00:43.050> bit<00:00:44.660> there<00:00:45.660> we

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
now my hands are a little bit there we

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.130 
now my hands are a little bit there we
go

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
go

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.260 
go
and<00:00:46.230> once<00:00:47.040> you<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> into<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.880> ventral

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and once you get it into the ventral

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.600 
and once you get it into the ventral
area<00:00:48.540> insert<00:00:49.290> it<00:00:49.500> gently<00:00:50.280> oh<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.820> gently<00:00:51.690> until

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
area insert it gently oh so gently until

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.420 
area insert it gently oh so gently until
you<00:00:53.610> feel<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.050> fill<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.200> stop<00:00:55.470> take<00:00:56.100> your<00:00:56.280> index

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you feel it fill it stop take your index

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.450 
you feel it fill it stop take your index
finger<00:00:56.940> put<00:00:57.540> it<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.960> vent<00:00:58.199> pull<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.190> probe

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
finger put it on the vent pull the probe

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.110 
finger put it on the vent pull the probe
out<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.970> that<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.739> depth<00:01:02.040> that<00:01:02.910> you'll

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
out and that is the depth that you'll

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.880 
out and that is the depth that you'll
see<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.900> a<00:01:03.930> meal<00:01:04.280> again<00:01:05.280> let's<00:01:05.700> try<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.060> again

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
see with a meal again let's try it again

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.690 
see with a meal again let's try it again
take<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.130> probe<00:01:08.910> put<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.330> into<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.990> tail

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
take the probe put it into the tail

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.840 
take the probe put it into the tail
toward<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> head<00:01:13.220> divert<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.369> back<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.759> other

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
toward the head divert it back the other

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.960 
toward the head divert it back the other
direction<00:01:17.930> there<00:01:18.930> we<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.550> it's<00:01:20.550> hard<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> do

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
direction there we go it's hard to do

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:38.930 
direction there we go it's hard to do
this<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.300> video<00:01:21.810> tape

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:56.240 

here<00:01:39.940> we<00:01:40.090> go<00:01:40.830> that's<00:01:41.830> no

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.730 

my<00:01:56.850> hands<00:01:57.150> have<00:01:57.330> a<00:01:57.540> lot<00:01:57.870> of<00:01:57.960> Vaseline<00:01:58.410> on<00:01:58.560> them

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
my hands have a lot of Vaseline on them

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.390 
my hands have a lot of Vaseline on them
so<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.130> kind<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.550> hard<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.730> get<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.060> grip

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.400 

let's<00:02:05.400> get<00:02:05.580> some<00:02:05.790> more<00:02:05.940> Vaseline<00:02:06.510> on<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:09.410> this

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
let's get some more Vaseline on it this

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.540 
let's get some more Vaseline on it this
works<00:02:10.650> better<00:02:10.830> when<00:02:11.040> you<00:02:11.100> have<00:02:11.190> someone

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
works better when you have someone

tonight so so you start in this

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.110 
tonight so so you start in this
direction<00:02:18.110> making<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.260> look<00:02:19.530> very<00:02:19.800> easy

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
direction making this look very easy

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.590 
direction making this look very easy
here<00:02:21.120> we<00:02:21.270> go

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
here we go

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.980 
here we go
and<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:22.680> probe<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.670> stick<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.150> probe<00:02:24.660> into

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
and you probe you stick the probe into

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.520 
and you probe you stick the probe into
the<00:02:25.260> snake<00:02:25.530> ever<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.310> gently<00:02:27.170> until<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.260> stops

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
the snake ever so gently until it stops

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.620 
the snake ever so gently until it stops
take<00:02:29.160> your<00:02:29.310> index<00:02:29.430> finger<00:02:29.670> put<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.450> end

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
take your index finger put it on the end

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.110 
take your index finger put it on the end
of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.840> probe<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.430> distance<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:33.060> a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
of the probe that is the distance that a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.510 
of the probe that is the distance that a
male<00:02:33.390> will<00:02:33.570> probe<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:34.020> female<00:02:34.740> will<00:02:35.220> probe

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
male will probe a female will probe

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.170 
male will probe a female will probe
about<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:36.720> far<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:38.100> again<00:02:38.460> this<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.850> how<00:02:38.880> deep

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
about that far so again this is how deep

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.130 
about that far so again this is how deep
a<00:02:39.330> male<00:02:39.540> probes

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
a male probes

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.010 
a male probes
this<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.620> how<00:02:40.740> deep<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.100> female<00:02:41.490> pro's<00:02:42.020> let's

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
this is how deep the female pro's let's

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.610 
this is how deep the female pro's let's
try<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.320> again<00:02:44.600> take<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.780> probe<00:02:46.020> into<00:02:46.350> the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
try it again take the probe into the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.030 
try it again take the probe into the
snakes<00:02:46.980> ventral<00:02:47.490> area<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.620> don't<00:02:49.620> know<00:02:49.680> why<00:02:49.860> I'm

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
snakes ventral area I don't know why I'm

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.810 
snakes ventral area I don't know why I'm
having<00:02:50.250> such<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.580> hard<00:02:50.700> time<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:52.170> hey

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
probe in there but maybe you know this

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.510 
probe in there but maybe you know this
is<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> reality<00:03:48.330> it's<00:03:48.480> not<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:49.380> most<00:03:49.620> easy

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
is a reality it's not the most easy

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
technique to use but it is pretty

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.980 
technique to use but it is pretty
effective<00:03:57.830> there<00:03:58.830> we<00:03:58.950> go<00:03:59.100> again<00:03:59.880> right<00:04:00.780> into

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
effective there we go again right into
