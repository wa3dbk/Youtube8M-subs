00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.980 
let me just test this out on this zombie
I<00:02:12.250> don't<00:02:12.580> know<00:02:12.640> why<00:02:12.880> I've<00:02:13.150> had<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.540> half<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
I don't know why I've had like half the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.020 
I don't know why I've had like half the
world<00:02:14.170> isn't<00:02:14.440> even<00:02:14.680> loading<00:02:17.670> well<00:02:18.670> this

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
world isn't even loading well this

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.230 
world isn't even loading well this
thing's<00:02:19.270> really<00:02:19.480> go<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.780> get<00:02:19.900> something<00:02:21.240> yeah

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
thing's really go to get something yeah

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.320 
thing's really go to get something yeah
this<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.690> definitely<00:02:22.840> better<00:02:23.200> than<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.560> mp5k

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
this is definitely better than the mp5k

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.840 
this is definitely better than the mp5k

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.889 
well while that's happening um last but
not<00:06:16.849> least<00:06:17.119> we<00:06:17.930> have<00:06:17.959> the<00:06:18.669> baseball<00:06:19.669> bat<00:06:19.899> so

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
single zombie I think that's what it is

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.499 
single zombie I think that's what it is
is<00:06:27.259> either<00:06:27.589> four<00:06:27.979> or<00:06:28.009> five<00:06:28.219> I<00:06:28.249> cannot<00:06:28.939> remember

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
is either four or five I cannot remember

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.480 
is either four or five I cannot remember
right<00:06:29.869> now<00:06:30.050> one<00:06:30.469> two<00:06:31.069> three<00:06:31.879> four<00:06:32.889> Maya<00:06:33.889> all

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
right now one two three four Maya all

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.219 
right now one two three four Maya all
right<00:06:34.729> so<00:06:34.999> yeah<00:06:35.149> it<00:06:35.269> takes<00:06:35.449> five<00:06:35.689> to<00:06:35.719> ten<00:06:36.050> toes

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:36.229
