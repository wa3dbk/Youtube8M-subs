00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.089 

so<00:00:09.240> you've<00:00:09.360> got<00:00:09.420> these<00:00:09.750> tubes<00:00:10.110> one's<00:00:10.830> round

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
so you've got these tubes one's round

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.249 
so you've got these tubes one's round
and<00:00:11.429> one's<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.730> square<00:00:12.000> shape<00:00:12.179> well<00:00:12.870> we<00:00:13.019> want<00:00:13.200> to

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
and one's a square shape well we want to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.780 
and one's a square shape well we want to
connect<00:00:13.590> them<00:00:13.740> what's<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.280> best<00:00:14.460> way<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.639> do

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
connect them what's the best way to do

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.939 
connect them what's the best way to do
that<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.289> normal<00:00:16.289> thing<00:00:16.379> would<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.770> try

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
that a normal thing would be to try

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.800 
that a normal thing would be to try
through<00:00:17.220> curves<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.090> we're<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.630> go<00:00:18.660> over

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
through curves so we're going to go over

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.140 
through curves so we're going to go over
to<00:00:19.050> insert<00:00:19.740> mesh<00:00:20.310> surface<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.000> through

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
to insert mesh surface and through

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.120 
to insert mesh surface and through
curves<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.320> we're<00:00:22.470> going<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.650> try<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.800> normal

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
curves and we're going to try the normal

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.060 
curves and we're going to try the normal
thing<00:00:23.310> first<00:00:23.730> we'll<00:00:23.880> select<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.300> square<00:00:24.689> all

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
thing first we'll select the square all

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.460 
thing first we'll select the square all
the<00:00:26.070> edges<00:00:26.430> add<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> new<00:00:27.420> set<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.930> select<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the edges add a new set and select the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.189 
the edges add a new set and select the
edge<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> circle<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.580> oh<00:00:29.910> my<00:00:30.179> god<00:00:30.750> that's

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
edge of the circle and oh my god that's

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.630 
edge of the circle and oh my god that's
disgusting<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.660> mean<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.559> even<00:00:34.770> try<00:00:35.010> by

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
disgusting I mean you can even try by

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.990 
disgusting I mean you can even try by
points<00:00:36.210> setting<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> buy<00:00:37.230> points<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
points setting it to buy points and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.310 
points setting it to buy points and
changing<00:00:39.000> where<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> points<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.140> move

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
changing where the points are just move

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.410 
changing where the points are just move
it<00:00:40.440> out<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.800> which<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.910> know<00:00:42.000> sometimes

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it out of it which you know sometimes

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.690 
it out of it which you know sometimes
works<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.899> you're<00:00:43.110> through<00:00:43.980> curves<00:00:44.219> isn't<00:00:44.550> too

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
works if you're through curves isn't too

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.430 
works if you're through curves isn't too
twisted<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.930> even<00:00:46.050> see<00:00:46.200> it's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
twisted you can even see it's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.020 
twisted you can even see it's
smoothening<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.520> now<00:00:47.760> which<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
smoothening out right now which is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
smoothening out right now which is
pretty<00:00:48.329> good<00:00:50.239> unfortunately<00:00:51.680> sometimes<00:00:52.680> it's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
pretty good unfortunately sometimes it's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.090 
pretty good unfortunately sometimes it's
a<00:00:53.250> bit<00:00:53.430> inconvenient<00:00:54.379> takes<00:00:55.379> takes<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.949> too

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
a bit inconvenient takes takes up too

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.189 
a bit inconvenient takes takes up too
much<00:00:56.129> time<00:00:56.300> maybe<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.510> not<00:00:57.600> great<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.079> we're

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
much time maybe just not great so we're

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.250 
much time maybe just not great so we're
just<00:00:58.230> gonna<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.920> rid<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.570> so<00:01:00.570> what<00:01:01.199> I'm

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
just gonna get rid of that so what I'm

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.799 
just gonna get rid of that so what I'm
going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.590> instead<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:02.359> show<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> sketch

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
going to do instead is show the sketch

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.929 
going to do instead is show the sketch
which<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.470> made<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.769> circle<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.760> that

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
which I made of a circle and in that

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.149 
which I made of a circle and in that
sketch<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.540> have<00:01:06.990> taken<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> liberty<00:01:07.979> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
sketch I have taken the liberty of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
sketch I have taken the liberty of
converting<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> original<00:01:09.510> circle<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
converting the original circle to a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.590 
converting the original circle to a
reference<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.590> making<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.100> four<00:01:11.490> arcs<00:01:11.820> one

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
reference and making these four arcs one

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
reference and making these four arcs one
two<00:01:13.110> three<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.780> four<00:01:15.780> let's<00:01:16.560> get<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.890> right

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
two three and four let's get that right

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.370 
two three and four let's get that right
there<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.729> Thark<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.659> kind<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.140> follow

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
there for Thark that kind of follow

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.100 
there for Thark that kind of follow
where<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.650> square<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.250> all<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:21.930> we

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
where the square is all right so if we

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.789 
where the square is all right so if we
go<00:01:22.290> back<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.650> try<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.890> through<00:01:23.130> curves<00:01:23.340> again

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
go back and try it through curves again

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.080 
go back and try it through curves again
let's<00:01:25.799> go<00:01:25.920> ahead<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.970> we're<00:01:27.060> just

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
let's go ahead and do that so we're just

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.179 
let's go ahead and do that so we're just
going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> start<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.750> same<00:01:27.990> way<00:01:28.200> insert

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
going to start at the same way insert

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.130 
going to start at the same way insert
their<00:01:29.400> curves<00:01:29.670> first<00:01:30.600> we're<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> choose

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
their curves first we're going to choose

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.679 
their curves first we're going to choose
our<00:01:31.229> square<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.710> remember<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.640> sequence<00:01:33.060> you

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
our square and remember the sequence you

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.380 
our square and remember the sequence you
choose<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:34.799> edges<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> square<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.700> all

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
choose your edges of the square in all

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
choose your edges of the square in all
right<00:01:36.540> then<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.110> choose<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> circle<00:01:37.829> we're

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
right then to choose a circle we're

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.649 
right then to choose a circle we're
going<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.729> stopped<00:01:39.479> at

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
going to go to this stopped at

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.990 
going to go to this stopped at
intersection<00:01:39.810> button<00:01:40.560> up<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.159> choose

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
intersection button up there and choose

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.260 
intersection button up there and choose
the<00:01:42.210> top<00:01:42.450> edge<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> top<00:01:43.950> bark<00:01:44.220> left<00:01:45.030> one

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270

it's<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.220> good<00:01:50.460> we<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.570> even<00:01:51.990> if<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.259> want<00:01:52.500> we

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
it's so good we can even if we want we

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.950 
it's so good we can even if we want we
can<00:01:53.009> go<00:01:53.159> over<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.850> say<00:01:54.299> position

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
can go over here and say position

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.350 
can go over here and say position
