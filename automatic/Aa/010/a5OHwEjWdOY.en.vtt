00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
backpack because I don't usually take a

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.090 
backpack because I don't usually take a
lot<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.510> would<00:03:25.810> have<00:03:25.960> enough<00:03:26.290> space<00:03:26.620> and

problem so if you have any question oh
one<00:03:40.300> thing<00:03:40.330> I<00:03:40.570> forget<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:40.900> say<00:03:41.310> if<00:03:42.310> I'm<00:03:43.270> going

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
one thing I forget to say if I'm going

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.900 
one thing I forget to say if I'm going
to<00:03:43.570> make<00:03:43.690> as<00:03:43.930> always<00:03:44.770> a<00:03:44.800> small<00:03:45.190> slit<00:03:45.580> here

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
to make as always a small slit here

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.570 
to make as always a small slit here
because<00:03:46.600> they<00:03:47.020> are<00:03:47.140> pretty<00:03:47.410> easy<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.890> open<00:03:48.190> but

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
because they are pretty easy to open but

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.930 
because they are pretty easy to open but
if<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:48.910> open<00:03:49.210> that<00:03:49.240> you<00:03:50.020> can<00:03:50.230> easily<00:03:50.980> put<00:03:51.400> some

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
if you open that you can easily put some

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.240 
if you open that you can easily put some
water<00:03:52.180> inside<00:03:52.840> boiling<00:03:53.740> water<00:03:53.950> maybe

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
water inside boiling water maybe

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.240 
water inside boiling water maybe
something<00:03:54.820> i<00:03:54.910> could<00:03:54.970> add<00:03:55.270> is<00:03:55.860> those<00:03:56.860> small

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
something i could add is those small

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.970 
something i could add is those small
clips<00:03:57.610> plastic<00:03:58.360> clips<00:03:58.570> you<00:03:58.720> can<00:03:58.750> use<00:03:59.080> to<00:03:59.590> fold

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
clips plastic clips you can use to fold

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.300 
clips plastic clips you can use to fold
clothes<00:04:00.850> those<00:04:01.330> plastic<00:04:01.870> bags<00:04:02.100> once<00:04:03.100> it's

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
clothes those plastic bags once it's

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.370 
clothes those plastic bags once it's
open<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:03.850> this<00:04:04.390> is<00:04:04.510> something<00:04:04.660> pretty<00:04:05.170> clever

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
open and this is something pretty clever

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.590 
open and this is something pretty clever
I'm<00:04:06.160> just<00:04:06.430> thinking<00:04:06.970> about<00:04:07.060> i'm<00:04:07.330> going<00:04:07.540> to

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
I'm just thinking about i'm going to

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:21.210 
I'm just thinking about i'm going to
show<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:08.050> in<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:08.440> second

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.040

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
this is what I'm talking about so

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.840 
this is what I'm talking about so
because<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.380> can't<00:04:27.590> add<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:27.980> easily<00:04:28.550> inside

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
because you can't add that easily inside

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.270 
because you can't add that easily inside
