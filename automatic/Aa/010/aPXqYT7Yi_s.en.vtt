00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the clothes is on properly as long as

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.959 
the clothes is on properly as long as
she's<00:02:04.530> wearing<00:02:04.680> some<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.640> want<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> make

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.429 
she's wearing some you just want to make
sure<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.450> there<00:02:06.930> aren't<00:02:07.110> little

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
sure that there aren't little

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.949 
sure that there aren't little
distracting<00:02:08.009> things<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.270> bra<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.750> this

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
distracting things like the bra in this

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.770 
distracting things like the bra in this
case<00:02:10.229> that's<00:02:10.709> taking<00:02:11.129> us<00:02:11.250> away<00:02:11.400> from<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.270> in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
case that's taking us away from the in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.809 
case that's taking us away from the in
so<00:02:13.319> look<00:02:13.800> for<00:02:14.040> things<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.790> think

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
so look for things like that and I think

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.370 
so look for things like that and I think
there<00:02:15.120> needs<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.420> more<00:02:15.480> light<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:15.930> her<00:02:16.200> face

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
there needs to be more light on her face

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.960 
there needs to be more light on her face
either<00:02:16.560> bring<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.069> light<00:02:17.250> that's<00:02:17.430> over<00:02:17.700> here

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
either bring the light that's over here

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.020 
either bring the light that's over here
more<00:02:18.690> around<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.500> front<00:02:19.790> but<00:02:20.790> there<00:02:20.910> needs

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
more around to the front but there needs

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.490 
more around to the front but there needs
to<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.270> little<00:02:21.510> bit<00:02:21.660> more<00:02:21.810> kicked<00:02:22.110> back<00:02:22.290> in

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
to be a little bit more kicked back in

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.690 
to be a little bit more kicked back in
on<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:22.830> side<00:02:23.069> because<00:02:23.190> she's<00:02:23.400> got<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.550> very

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
on this side because she's got a very

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.220 
on this side because she's got a very
nice<00:02:23.850> face<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.300> would<00:02:24.360> be<00:02:24.480> nice<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.930> see<00:02:24.959> it

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
nice face it would be nice to see it

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.949 
nice face it would be nice to see it
more<00:02:25.920> bright<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.790> composition<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.510> right<00:02:27.720> on

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
more bright the composition is right on

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.750 
more bright the composition is right on
but<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.800> that's<00:02:29.040> what<00:02:29.220> I'd<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.550> see<00:02:29.670> is

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
but that that's what I'd like to see is

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.580 
but that that's what I'd like to see is
more<00:02:29.910> light<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.420> other<00:02:30.540> side<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.470> an

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
more light on the other side this is an

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.990 
more light on the other side this is an
interesting<00:02:31.830> photo<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.459> I'll<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.819> say<00:02:32.970> this

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.790 
image because if i can't grab the image
i'm<00:02:38.850> not<00:02:39.180> going<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.780> be<00:02:39.900> able<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.230> use<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.440> most

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
i'm not going to be able to use it most

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.680 
i'm not going to be able to use it most
likely<00:02:40.890> but<00:02:41.580> i<00:02:41.640> like<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.060> image<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.480> much

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
likely but i like this image so much

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.440 
likely but i like this image so much
that<00:02:42.900> i<00:02:42.930> did<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> screen<00:02:43.530> grab<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:44.069> use<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.700> I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
that i did a screen grab to use it I

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.630 
that i did a screen grab to use it I
thought<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:46.470> was<00:02:46.680> cool<00:02:46.950> you've<00:02:47.100> got<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.430> guy

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
thought this was cool you've got the guy

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.110 
thought this was cool you've got the guy
in<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.000> mist<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:49.500> pointing<00:02:50.459> things<00:02:50.489> out<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
in the mist just pointing things out the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.910 
in the mist just pointing things out the
only<00:02:51.330> thing<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.660> distracting<00:02:52.380> from<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.739> as<00:02:52.890> a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
only thing is distracting from this as a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.430 
only thing is distracting from this as a
critique<00:02:53.190> are<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:54.390> cars<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.959> background

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
critique are the cars in the background

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.520 
critique are the cars in the background
I<00:02:55.620> wish<00:02:56.390> let<00:02:57.390> me<00:02:57.450> get<00:02:57.569> out<00:02:57.630> my<00:02:57.690> frame<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:59.420> wish

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
I wish let me get out my frame I wish

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.030 
I wish let me get out my frame I wish
that<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.560> was<00:03:01.769> more<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.370> frame<00:03:02.810> cut<00:03:03.810> around

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
that it was more of a frame cut around

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.059 
that it was more of a frame cut around
you<00:03:05.040> know<00:03:05.130> even<00:03:05.310> here<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:07.019> here<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.530> here<00:03:07.560> to

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
you know even here to here to here to

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.800 
you know even here to here to here to
here<00:03:08.100> something<00:03:08.910> that<00:03:09.060> tight<00:03:09.300> would<00:03:09.480> be<00:03:09.600> nice

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
here something that tight would be nice

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.900 
here something that tight would be nice
it's<00:03:10.019> an<00:03:10.140> interesting<00:03:10.530> shot<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.130> do<00:03:11.190> like<00:03:11.700> it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
it's an interesting shot I do like it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.880 
it's an interesting shot I do like it
and<00:03:12.090> that's<00:03:12.600> why<00:03:12.780> it's<00:03:12.959> right<00:03:13.170> here<00:03:13.590> but

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
and that's why it's right here but

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.710 
and that's why it's right here but
that's<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.280> critique<00:03:14.640> for<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.540> is

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
that's the critique for that this is

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.960 
that's the critique for that this is
very<00:03:15.930> nice<00:03:16.140> as<00:03:16.380> well<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:17.310> really<00:03:17.730> cool<00:03:17.910> that

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
very nice as well it's really cool that

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.640 
very nice as well it's really cool that
it's<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.329> color<00:03:18.600> image<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:19.049> think<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:19.560> a

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
it's a color image I think it's a

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.800 
it's a color image I think it's a
full-out<00:03:20.220> color<00:03:20.700> image<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.360> person<00:03:21.720> is

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
full-out color image that the person is

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.229 
full-out color image that the person is
in<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.200> full-on<00:03:23.010> silhouette<00:03:23.640> with<00:03:23.820> just<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
in a full-on silhouette with just the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.509 
in a full-on silhouette with just the
wine<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.930> would<00:03:25.350> assume<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:25.799> white<00:03:26.040> wine<00:03:26.250> in

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
wine I would assume that's white wine in

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.449 
wine I would assume that's white wine in
the<00:03:26.610> glass<00:03:26.780> because<00:03:27.780> it's<00:03:27.959> not<00:03:28.110> red<00:03:28.320> thus<00:03:29.280> it

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
the glass because it's not red thus it

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.819 
the glass because it's not red thus it
could<00:03:29.610> be<00:03:29.730> right<00:03:29.970> white<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.660> think<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> nice

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
could be right white I think it's a nice

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.380 
could be right white I think it's a nice
shot<00:03:32.040> nice<00:03:32.280> job<00:03:32.579> with<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.760> shadow<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
persons in the shadow drinking out of

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.710 
persons in the shadow drinking out of
the<00:03:34.980> glass<00:03:35.190> really<00:03:35.880> nice<00:03:36.030> job<00:03:36.239> honorable

interesting froknowsphoto very creative
for<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.329> shadow<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:04.280> froknowsphoto<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.489> liked

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
for the shadow of froknowsphoto I liked

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.650 
for the shadow of froknowsphoto I liked
this<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:07.590> was<00:04:07.769> cool<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.310> obviously<00:04:09.150> printed

just really a nice shot yeah pious cat
put<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.799> up<00:04:17.010> there<00:04:17.060> they<00:04:18.060> said<00:04:18.239> they<00:04:18.359> were

put this up there they said they were

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.300 
put this up there they said they were
driving<00:04:18.840> through<00:04:18.959> PA<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.380> would<00:04:19.829> assume<00:04:20.130> that

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
driving through PA I would assume that

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.850 
driving through PA I would assume that
this<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.729> limerick<00:04:21.180> power<00:04:21.450> plant<00:04:21.870> nuclear

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
this is the limerick power plant nuclear

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.070 
this is the limerick power plant nuclear
power<00:04:23.220> plant<00:04:23.640> in<00:04:23.789> limerick<00:04:24.240> PA<00:04:24.510> i'm<00:04:24.900> outside

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
power plant in limerick PA i'm outside

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.940 
power plant in limerick PA i'm outside
of<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.530> area

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
of that area

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.490 
of that area
I<00:04:25.980> think<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.850> nuclear<00:04:27.360> blast<00:04:27.750> zone<00:04:27.960> can<00:04:28.350> all

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
I think the nuclear blast zone can all

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.920 
I think the nuclear blast zone can all
this<00:04:28.650> freaking<00:04:29.160> smoked<00:04:29.520> be<00:04:29.730> any<00:04:29.850> good<00:04:30.120> can<00:04:30.900> it

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
this freaking smoked be any good can it

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.630 
this freaking smoked be any good can it
really<00:04:31.230> can<00:04:31.680> all<00:04:31.800> these<00:04:31.950> emissions<00:04:32.400> coming

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
really can all these emissions coming

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.270 
really can all these emissions coming
out<00:04:32.850> of<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.060> power<00:04:33.240> plant<00:04:33.680> really<00:04:34.680> not<00:04:35.010> be

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
out of the power plant really not be

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.040 
out of the power plant really not be
harmful<00:04:35.640> to<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.120> environment<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.780> mean<00:04:36.900> is<00:04:37.020> it

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
harmful to the environment I mean is it

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.570 
harmful to the environment I mean is it
that<00:04:37.680> hard<00:04:37.890> I<00:04:37.980> mean<00:04:38.100> don't<00:04:38.160> have<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.370> problem

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
that hard I mean don't have a problem

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.030 
that hard I mean don't have a problem
with<00:04:38.670> nuclear<00:04:39.270> power<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:39.780> mean<00:04:40.080> yeah<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.710> do<00:04:40.830> have

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
with nuclear power I mean yeah I do have

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.890 
with nuclear power I mean yeah I do have
a<00:04:41.100> problem<00:04:41.310> with<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.550> technically<00:04:42.150> it's<00:04:42.420> it's

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
a problem with it technically it's it's

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.510 
a problem with it technically it's it's
not<00:04:43.140> very<00:04:43.350> clean<00:04:43.770> because<00:04:44.010> you've<00:04:44.190> got<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.430> do

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
not very clean because you've got to do

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.520 
not very clean because you've got to do
something<00:04:44.880> with<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.090> spent<00:04:45.600> fuel<00:04:45.720> rods<00:04:46.020> but

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
something with the spent fuel rods but

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.040 
something with the spent fuel rods but
Jesus<00:04:46.980> look<00:04:47.760> at<00:04:47.820> all<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.090> pollutants<00:04:48.570> going

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
Jesus look at all the pollutants going

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.620 
Jesus look at all the pollutants going
into<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.380> air<00:04:49.500> can't<00:04:50.160> all<00:04:50.310> be<00:04:50.340> clean<00:04:50.820> I

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
into the air can't all be clean I

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.180 
into the air can't all be clean I
thought<00:04:52.110> this<00:04:52.260> was<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.470> cool<00:04:52.650> shot<00:04:52.830> as<00:04:53.040> well

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
thought this was a cool shot as well

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.330 
thought this was a cool shot as well
really<00:04:54.000> tight<00:04:54.510> sky<00:04:54.900> really<00:04:55.410> thick<00:04:55.920> blacks

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
really tight sky really thick blacks

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.940 
really tight sky really thick blacks
really<00:04:57.270> thick<00:04:57.660> whites<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.320> just<00:04:58.560> all<00:04:58.890> around

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
really thick whites and just all around

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.610 
really thick whites and just all around
an<00:04:59.670> interesting<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.780> almost<00:05:01.110> looks<00:05:01.380> like<00:05:01.470> it

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
an interesting it almost looks like it

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.860 
an interesting it almost looks like it
was<00:05:01.680> shot<00:05:01.740> with<00:05:02.010> film<00:05:02.280> it<00:05:02.760> really<00:05:03.270> does<00:05:03.480> you

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
was shot with film it really does you

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.240 
was shot with film it really does you
know<00:05:03.990> why<00:05:04.200> this<00:05:04.260> almost<00:05:04.710> looks<00:05:04.830> like<00:05:05.010> it<00:05:05.190> was

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
know why this almost looks like it was

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.470 
know why this almost looks like it was
shot<00:05:05.310> with<00:05:05.640> film<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.060> don't<00:05:06.210> know<00:05:06.300> if<00:05:06.390> it

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
shot with film and I don't know if it

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.140 
shot with film and I don't know if it
was<00:05:06.690> because<00:05:07.110> this<00:05:07.560> right<00:05:08.220> here<00:05:08.280> looks<00:05:08.940> like

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
was because this right here looks like

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.960 
was because this right here looks like
it's<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.450> chemical<00:05:10.170> spot<00:05:10.680> on<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.100> negative<00:05:11.520> now

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
it's a chemical spot on the negative now

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.480 
it's a chemical spot on the negative now
could<00:05:12.240> just<00:05:12.420> be<00:05:12.540> dust<00:05:12.810> in<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.110> sky<00:05:13.410> but<00:05:14.220> I

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
could just be dust in the sky but I

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
could just be dust in the sky but I
thought<00:05:14.790> it<00:05:14.880> was<00:05:14.970> an<00:05:15.060> interesting<00:05:15.120> shot

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
thought it was an interesting shot

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.420 
thought it was an interesting shot
that's<00:05:15.960> why<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.140> threw<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.530> up<00:05:16.620> here<00:05:16.830> this<00:05:17.190> one<00:05:17.400> I

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
that's why I threw it up here this one I

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.950 
that's why I threw it up here this one I
have<00:05:17.610> trouble<00:05:17.850> wrapping<00:05:18.090> my<00:05:18.270> head<00:05:18.420> around<00:05:18.570> is

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
have trouble wrapping my head around is

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.490 
have trouble wrapping my head around is
this<00:05:19.140> HDR<00:05:19.710> as<00:05:19.860> it's<00:05:20.040> not<00:05:20.160> HDR<00:05:20.760> I<00:05:21.630> think<00:05:22.110> an<00:05:22.200> HDR

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
this HDR as it's not HDR I think an HDR

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.900 
this HDR as it's not HDR I think an HDR
shot<00:05:22.800> for<00:05:23.040> this<00:05:23.160> would<00:05:23.340> look<00:05:23.430> interesting

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
shot for this would look interesting

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.220 
shot for this would look interesting
it's<00:05:24.030> kind<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.240> funny<00:05:24.480> those<00:05:24.690> indoor<00:05:25.020> shots

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
it's kind of funny those indoor shots

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.170 
it's kind of funny those indoor shots
always<00:05:25.530> seem<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.430> look<00:05:26.520> interesting<00:05:27.060> which

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
always seem to look interesting which

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.470 
always seem to look interesting which
eight<00:05:27.390> with<00:05:27.660> HDR<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:28.830> was<00:05:28.920> just<00:05:29.100> a<00:05:29.160> kind<00:05:30.120> of<00:05:30.300> a

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
eight with HDR it was just a kind of a

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.080 
eight with HDR it was just a kind of a
curious<00:05:31.050> shot<00:05:31.290> for<00:05:31.560> me<00:05:31.710> but<00:05:32.550> that's<00:05:32.730> why<00:05:32.850> I<00:05:32.880> put

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
curious shot for me but that's why I put

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.630 
curious shot for me but that's why I put
it<00:05:33.210> here<00:05:33.390> this<00:05:33.900> was<00:05:34.080> interesting<00:05:34.350> too<00:05:34.770> we<00:05:35.490> got

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
it here this was interesting too we got

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.190 
it here this was interesting too we got
the<00:05:35.760> shadow<00:05:36.030> we<00:05:36.270> got<00:05:36.390> the<00:05:36.480> things<00:05:36.690> on<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.990> wall

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
the shadow we got the things on the wall

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.990 
the shadow we got the things on the wall
the<00:05:37.770> shadow<00:05:38.040> is<00:05:38.130> being<00:05:38.400> created<00:05:38.670> by<00:05:38.850> the

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
the shadow is being created by the

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.730 
the shadow is being created by the
things<00:05:39.300> on<00:05:39.480> the<00:05:39.510> wall<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:39.990> i<00:05:40.380> thought<00:05:40.530> i<00:05:40.590> would

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
things on the wall and i thought i would

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.900 
things on the wall and i thought i would
point<00:05:40.920> it<00:05:41.040> out<00:05:41.130> i'd<00:05:41.310> like<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.580> see<00:05:41.700> it<00:05:41.790> be

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
point it out i'd like to see it be

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.370 
point it out i'd like to see it be
pumped<00:05:42.270> up<00:05:42.330> a<00:05:42.450> little<00:05:42.480> more<00:05:42.780> pump<00:05:43.080> up<00:05:43.200> those

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
pumped up a little more pump up those

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.810 
pumped up a little more pump up those
kicks<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:43.770> little<00:05:43.800> more<00:05:44.100> black<00:05:44.340> a<00:05:44.370> little<00:05:44.670> more

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
kicks a little more black a little more

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.640 
kicks a little more black a little more
white<00:05:45.030> and<00:05:45.270> i<00:05:45.630> think<00:05:45.840> i<00:05:45.900> would<00:05:45.960> like<00:05:46.140> it<00:05:46.200> this

is<00:05:46.800> just<00:05:46.950> off<00:05:47.160> the<00:05:47.190> wall<00:05:47.520> I<00:05:47.790> don't<00:05:48.030> have<00:05:48.120> a

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
is just off the wall I don't have a

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.310 
is just off the wall I don't have a
problem<00:05:48.360> with<00:05:50.180> digital<00:05:51.180> manipulation<00:05:51.510> for

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
problem with digital manipulation for

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.380 
problem with digital manipulation for
these<00:05:52.620> weekend<00:05:53.370> photo<00:05:53.790> themes<00:05:54.060> if<00:05:54.240> that's

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
these weekend photo themes if that's

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.810 
these weekend photo themes if that's
what<00:05:54.600> you<00:05:54.690> feel<00:05:54.720> you<00:05:54.960> want<00:05:55.290> to<00:05:55.380> do<00:05:55.560> I<00:05:55.820> don't

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
what you feel you want to do I don't

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.910 
what you feel you want to do I don't
think<00:05:56.880> this<00:05:57.150> is<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.330> real<00:05:57.690> photo<00:05:58.140> because<00:05:58.710> of

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
think this is a real photo because of

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.650 
think this is a real photo because of
all<00:05:59.130> of<00:05:59.160> what's<00:05:59.610> going<00:05:59.850> on<00:06:00.090> in<00:06:00.240> here<00:06:00.270> I<00:06:00.390> believe

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
all of what's going on in here I believe

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.910 
all of what's going on in here I believe
it<00:06:00.750> said<00:06:00.840> it<00:06:00.930> was<00:06:00.990> taken<00:06:01.260> with<00:06:01.350> a<00:06:01.380> 16

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
it said it was taken with a 16

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.160 
it said it was taken with a 16
millimeter<00:06:02.100> fish<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.790> know<00:06:03.300> at<00:06:03.540> ten<00:06:03.750> point<00:06:03.990> five

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
millimeter fish I know at ten point five

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.840 
millimeter fish I know at ten point five
millimeter<00:06:04.470> nikon<00:06:05.070> fisheye<00:06:05.430> which<00:06:05.610> is<00:06:05.730> the

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
millimeter nikon fisheye which is the

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.940 
millimeter nikon fisheye which is the
equivalent<00:06:05.940> of<00:06:06.420> a<00:06:06.540> 16<00:06:06.990> it's<00:06:07.530> a<00:06:07.650> very

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
equivalent of a 16 it's a very

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.940 
equivalent of a 16 it's a very
interesting<00:06:08.690> manipulation<00:06:09.690> if<00:06:09.960> it's<00:06:10.740> real

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
interesting manipulation if it's real

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.430 
interesting manipulation if it's real
then<00:06:10.980> it's<00:06:11.370> amazing<00:06:12.300> but<00:06:12.900> i'm<00:06:13.020> pretty<00:06:13.200> sure

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
then it's amazing but i'm pretty sure

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.260 
then it's amazing but i'm pretty sure
it's<00:06:13.590> just<00:06:13.680> a<00:06:13.890> flat-out<00:06:14.160> manipulation<00:06:15.060> i

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
it's just a flat-out manipulation i

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.500 
it's just a flat-out manipulation i
think<00:06:16.070> at<00:06:17.070> least<00:06:17.160> i<00:06:17.310> think<00:06:17.370> so<00:06:17.580> but<00:06:18.030> i<00:06:18.060> like<00:06:18.300> it

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
think at least i think so but i like it

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.210 
think at least i think so but i like it
i<00:06:18.990> don't<00:06:19.320> have<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.470> problem<00:06:19.710> if<00:06:19.860> that's<00:06:20.070> what

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
i don't have a problem if that's what
