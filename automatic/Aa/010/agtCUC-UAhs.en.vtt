blackness<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.340> which<00:00:14.340> means<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:14.820> not

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
blackness to it which means it's not

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.109 
blackness to it which means it's not
easy<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:16.320> one<00:00:16.529> took<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.039> long<00:00:17.369> time<00:00:17.400> for<00:00:17.730> me

to<00:00:18.240> work<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.600> because<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:19.080> really<00:00:19.880> calls<00:00:20.880> on

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
to work on because it really calls on

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.040

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
interesting and is if that wasn't enough

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.800 
interesting and is if that wasn't enough
for<00:02:28.680> your<00:02:28.950> pinky<00:02:29.340> finger<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.850> think<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.540> part

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
for your pinky finger I think this part

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.630 
for your pinky finger I think this part
is<00:02:30.870> really<00:02:31.350> gonna<00:02:31.500> challenge<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:32.100> for<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.430> but

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
is really gonna challenge it for you but

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.310 
is really gonna challenge it for you but
if<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.150> take<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.450> time<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.780> practice<00:02:34.170> this

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
if you take the time and practice this

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.140 
if you take the time and practice this
the<00:02:34.530> payoff<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.040> huge

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.080 

that's<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.450> third<00:02:40.460> fret<00:02:41.460> of<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.730> third

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
that's the third fret of the third

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.910 
that's the third fret of the third
string<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:44.270> that's<00:02:45.270> before<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.020> hit<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.620> bass

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
string and that's before I hit the bass

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.950 
string and that's before I hit the bass
string<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.800> one<00:02:49.980> of<00:02:50.010> those<00:02:50.190> in-between<00:02:50.490> notes

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
on the second string B string and then

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:15.530 
on the second string B string and then
the<00:03:08.520> sixth<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.960> first<00:03:10.410> string<00:03:10.680> together

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.410 

sorry<00:03:16.290> they're<00:03:16.500> not<00:03:16.530> together<00:03:16.829> it's<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.489> the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
sorry they're not together it's the the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:28.790

first<00:03:18.750> string<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.340> then<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.430> six

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.320 

all<00:03:29.310> right<00:03:29.460> let's<00:03:29.640> take<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.790> look<00:03:29.850> at<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.090> last

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
all right let's take a look at that last

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:49.089 
all right let's take a look at that last
part<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.080> little<00:03:31.380> slowly

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.819 

okay<00:03:49.819> so<00:03:49.879> here<00:03:50.209> we<00:03:50.239> go<00:03:50.569> slowly<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.560> whole<00:03:51.709> way

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
okay so here we go slowly the whole way

00:03:51.829 --> 00:04:02.440 
okay so here we go slowly the whole way
through

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.750 

and<00:04:03.450> now<00:04:03.660> at<00:04:03.960> a<00:04:03.990> pretty<00:04:04.770> healthy<00:04:04.950> tempo<00:04:05.550> but

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
and now at a pretty healthy tempo but

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.760 
and now at a pretty healthy tempo but
still<00:04:06.000> probably<00:04:06.240> about<00:04:06.510> half<00:04:06.810> pace<00:04:07.110> for<00:04:07.410> blind

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
still probably about half pace for blind

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:15.659 
still probably about half pace for blind
Blake

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:17.979 

all<00:04:16.669> right<00:04:16.820> so<00:04:16.970> there<00:04:17.120> you<00:04:17.239> go<00:04:17.389> there's<00:04:17.660> a<00:04:17.720> cool

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
all right so there you go there's a cool

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.170 
all right so there you go there's a cool
little<00:04:18.229> Piedmont<00:04:18.829> country<00:04:19.370> blues<00:04:19.639> sort<00:04:20.030> of

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
little Piedmont country blues sort of

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.930 
little Piedmont country blues sort of
lick<00:04:20.359> that<00:04:20.630> really<00:04:21.109> works<00:04:21.320> out<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.940> the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
lick that really works out the the

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.060 
lick that really works out the the
ability<00:04:23.270> to<00:04:23.300> alternate<00:04:23.960> alternate<00:04:24.949> the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
ability to alternate alternate the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.310 
ability to alternate alternate the
baseline<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:25.850> then<00:04:25.970> also<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.510> get<00:04:26.750> your<00:04:26.900> pinky

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
baseline and then also to get your pinky

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.159 
baseline and then also to get your pinky
going<00:04:28.000> handling<00:04:29.000> some<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.360> melody<00:04:29.600> duties

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
going handling some of the melody duties

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.600 
going handling some of the melody duties
so<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:30.590> is<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.740> really<00:04:31.039> good<00:04:31.250> one<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:31.430> just

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
so this is a really good one to just

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.790 
so this is a really good one to just
practice<00:04:31.850> over<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:32.630> over<00:04:33.080> because<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.710> will

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
practice over and over because it will

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.159 
practice over and over because it will
