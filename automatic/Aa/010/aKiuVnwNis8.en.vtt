00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello friends you are on 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.589
 channel psychology health beauty and with 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.130
 you doctor psychologist tatyana ukhova and 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.219
 Today I want to talk about the possibility 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.680
 creating the perfect couple finding yourself 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.100
 the second half and how much it generally 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.720
 maybe really quite often 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.400
 have to hear from people who 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.849
 come on psychological 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.359
 counseling or therapy such 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.149
 request that there is probably some kind of person 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.300
 which is perfect for me which 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.559
 2 will be my half and I am only with him 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.829
 I can be happy 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.960
 or I can only be happy with him and 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.989
 until I find such a person I will 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 look for him and I will not create myself 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.230
 a couple and probably such a man he 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.129
 the only one in the world and here in the world 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.620
 things I always seems utopian and 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.820
 a little naive i think that at the core 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.949
 such desires 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.530
 as a rule especially if this person 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.439
 old enough mature is 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.299
 really and no desire to create a pair in 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.200
 principle because there are such 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.090
 situations when a vacant place is near 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.049
 man is already taken for example his 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.270
 parents, for example, this is a single mom 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.290
 who raised her whole life 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.110
 son and from time to time I told him everything 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.650
 I gave you and I gave you the best I live 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.140
 for your sake and then baby 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.600
 growing into an adult man somehow 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.790
 subconsciously understands that they lie 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.990
 the perfect woman she is already beside him and 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.860
 he does not need anything more society 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.229
 society requires very different things like 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.880
 you want to create a couple 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.700
 pro need to live in a pair 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.159
 and then such a man finds himself 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.079
 excuse he says to himself and 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.500
 he says to those around 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.079
 she is not the woman of the woman who 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.719
 I would fit perfectly just me 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.780
 I am in search and so he in search 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:13.110
 may be 10 20 30 40 years 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.180
 and to the end of life and even if he finds 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.310
 imagine a couple then he says well, here I am 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.250
 said this is not the perfect couple 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.920
 This is not what I was looking for and disagree with 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.500
 such a woman also happens to be women 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.720
 which in principle do not want for some 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.900
 reasons to create pairs well for example they 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.600
 have seen a bad example of their parents there 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.910
 where father for example drank and beat mom and in 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.030
 As a result, such a girl is not afraid 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.310
 create a family but still she finds 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.840
 excuse yourself that she is just 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.360
 Actively looking 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.930
 and you know even in social networks if this 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.720
 inscription marital status 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.510
 in active search this is very often 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.840
 such a thing which is a folding screen for 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.550
 just do not want to create a couple well and 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.069
 yet let's take this one 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.780
 question is there a perfect couple 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.250
 are there any other half for 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.000
 each of us what if she's true 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.410
 there is and we do not see it so if 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.180
 the second half if the person speaks 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.420
 until I find a soul mate 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.010
 until I understand that this is right here 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.540
 congruently suits me here as the second 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.400
 half i'm not gonna waste that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.920
 I have a question and what are you 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.870
 consider yourself inferior you are not a 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.440
 whole person you are only half 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.010
 that is, you have one ear, one leg, one 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.530
 arm 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.190
 one eye and the other half somewhere 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.430
 wanders imagine such a picture 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:45.720
 interesting half of the woman walks and looking 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.060
 where is where is half the man 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.160
 she actually fit me 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.040
 it seems it's just some kind of horror movie 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.519
 half woman half man 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.079
 why is it if a woman feels or 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.220
 man feel full 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.920
 only then will he find himself 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.290
 really partner and 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.650
 and probably still not a perfect live 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.840
 a real person what about the ideal 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.049
 does it exist whether che such 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.609
 the person who will understand you completely 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:19.620
 completely you will feel completely here 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.930
 each cell of your body will feel 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.740
 exactly your eye desires 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.900
 This is such a dream of many people before. 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.039
 such a person exists for sure I am here 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.840
 I'll tell you the recipe where to find it 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:38.940
 the native and you can in the mirror this you 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:41.340
 yourself, that is, if you think that there is 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.160
 man is perfect for you 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:49.410
 perfectly matched your desire 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:52.080
 and your expectation from the picture of who you are 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.940
 yourself you know yourself since childhood you 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.800
 you know what you want but the truth is not 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.750
 always but nonetheless if you are not already 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.210
 you know that you yourself want to not 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.949
 you will know what your partner wants and 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.130
 your partner won't understand exactly what you want 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.259
 because you sometimes reach the point of absurdity and 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.639
 I think I donâ€™t understand myself 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.430
 there is such a person who will understand 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:16.800
 what I want is this is complete nonsense 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:19.169
 this does not happen this is ridiculous 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.810
 waiting for this can not be necessary 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.530
 first of all understand yourself and yourself 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:30.150
 feel appreciated and end up 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:32.220
 if you are a living person if you 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.060
 really her desire to be paired you 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.940
 will be paired 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.130
 you can find yourself this pair in any 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.409
 environment in any country in any 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.970
 populated area in any populated 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:46.650
 paragraph because the desire to be paired is not 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.770
 in the surrounding people and 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.180
 laid in you and if you are nowhere 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.060
 find a pair 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.690
 do not find anywhere worthy of people 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.479
 worthy 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.080
 from your person it is probably in 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.590
 you have a desire not to create this 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.139
 a couple 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.400
 and all excuses are nothing more than 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:12.750
 excuses and a screen for this 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:14.759
 reluctance if you see that next to 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.979
 you already have some kind of person who 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.919
 you are not annoyed that you enjoy 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.530
 which you like but which is 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.659
 some flaws there somewhere he is something 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.449
 scatters somewhere he is something wrong 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:28.680
 says sniffs or something else yes 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.490
 my goodness you can put up with it 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.190
 completely calm and if there aren't any 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.730
 serious things somehow on 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:40.340
 kama is not alcoholism or scuffle then all 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.890
 the rest can be completely calm 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:47.630
 take if you feel comfortable 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:50.450
