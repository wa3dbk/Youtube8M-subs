00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello today I'll teach you to make a 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.850
 super cute gifts for this san 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.950
 valentine 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.410
 idea number 1 is inspired by the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.410
 happy pills and we will need a little bottle 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.990
 a scissors the template that can 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.150
 download from my blog glue and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.170
 candy colors first thing we will do 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.540
 will cut the template 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.900
 then we will add all the candy to 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.900
 cool 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.570
 we will stick the jar template and so 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.420
 it remains really super cute and this 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.019
 It's super easy to do for idea 2 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.799
 we will need wood sheets rule a 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:54.120
 pencil or nastic waxes glue one 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:57.800
 rope blade 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.800
 photos and hooks 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.640
 The first thing we will do is cut the 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.990
 sheets of wood at 45 centimeters 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.640
 woods can be replaced with triples 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.640
 this we will talk twice 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.260
 then we will cut the woods in half 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.210
 i 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.420
 ah 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.369
 to these trim and cutting woods to 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.060
 where in the corners I repeated this in 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.060
 the four woods 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.840
 do not 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.360
 then I am with his glue in the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.690
 corners that joined the woods forming a 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.690
 framework 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.340
 in the back stick a bit 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.910
 of wood in each corner but that this one 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.910
 do not move 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.129
 Y 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.620
 i 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.340
 and also stick the rope strips 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.120
 all this do not forget that it is because 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.120
 behind the frame 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.100
 and then in the front very 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.100
 sticking the hooks 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.159
 and decorate with photos with droplets letters 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.159
 so that this is magical 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.390
 but chocolate hearts 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.420
 we will need to treat chocolate cookies 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.710
 of vanilla we will place the chocolate 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.710
 3 minutes in the microwave 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.879
 and shredding we will make cookies from 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.379
 vanilla then well that all the 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.069
 measurements I'm leaving in the box 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.069
 of information 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.190
 in a bowl we will place the delicacy on 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.190
 chocolate cookies 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.910
 and we will create it until it forms 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.910
 a mass something like that 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.280
 with super clean hands we will make 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.410
 balls with the preparation and 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.160
 we will press a bit to then cut 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.160
 The hearts 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.380
 ah 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.520
 ah 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.650
 ah 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.569
 when we have all the hearts 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.849
 we'll put a stick of 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.690
 Pacifier and put them in the freezer 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.690
 for a few minutes 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.380
 at this moment I cut the telgopor and 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.380
 I put it in a flowerpot 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.050
 Y 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.870
 Y 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.210
 I also cut tissue paper also 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.880
 call for pools to uncover all 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.650
 the part that we do not want to see 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.650
 well 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.650
 Y 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.340
 and on one of its sides I added a 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.340
 heart ornament 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.099
 now it is now we are left to place 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:13.520
 our chocolates and will be ready to 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:13.520
 give away 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.950
 two 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.050
 they can not recreate the sea for networks 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.330
 real social 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.710
 two 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.710
