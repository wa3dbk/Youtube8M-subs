00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
can you explain how JavaScript and

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.310 
can you explain how JavaScript and
jQuery<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:11.250> different<00:00:12.170> javascript<00:00:13.170> and

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
jQuery are different javascript and

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.020 
jQuery are different javascript and
jquery<00:00:13.980> are<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> same<00:00:14.549> thing

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
jquery are the same thing

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.019 
jquery are the same thing
i<00:00:15.059> know<00:00:15.780> they<00:00:16.170> both<00:00:16.379> start<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:16.859> j<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.550> both

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
i know they both start with j and both

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.840 
i know they both start with j and both

doesn't<00:00:21.240> mean<00:00:21.390> they<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> same<00:00:22.050> thing

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
doesn't mean they are the same thing

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.920 
doesn't mean they are the same thing
you're<00:00:23.400> right<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.449> aren't<00:00:24.750> exactly

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
you're right in that they aren't exactly
