 Y 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.690
 hello everyone welcome to negrÃ­n is yes 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.840
 you want to know how to do this manicure 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.150
 with chevron tips keep looking 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.060
 you will need two enamels that combine 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.699
 it is preferable that the base be of the style 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.910
 horsehair glitter and the other dark that covers 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.360
 all right 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.960
 Adhesive tape and top coat before 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.730
 start 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 I would like to tell you that this tutorial 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.860
 is made with the collaboration of born 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.270
 brick and store that has sent me these 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.230
 glazes that took so long 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.750
 looking as you can see are enamels 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.080
 with glitter of different sizes and what 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.050
 most important has finished cream this 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.110
 box in concrete brings four enamels 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.290
 a tangerine cream with silver glitter 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.350
 dorado and salmon with glick twins salmon and 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.350
 blue 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.589
 1 light mint green with silver glitter 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.129
 and fuchsia and glee queens oranges greens and 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.129
 fuchsia 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.230
 1 lilac with silver glitter and salmon with 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.230
 glick twins golden salmon and fuchsia 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:27.490
 and a green blue with silver glitter and 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.490
 salmon and glikin golden blue and salmon 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:36.509
 they practically do not smell and in theory they are 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.399
 Five free contain 6 milliliters so 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.250
 that maybe the boats can seem like a 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.399
 little ones, of course, if not 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.750
 you can allow indies versions 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.420
 value I'd say it's a very 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.700
 good alternative if you are interested 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.500
 I leave in the information box the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.380
 link to the page and a coupon 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.720
 10% discount to start our 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.750
 design we apply the cream glaze with 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.970
 glitter the good thing about this enamel is 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.250
 that you do not have to catch the glitter but if 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.259
 we want a uniform application so 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.299
 we have to pay some attention to the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.400
 placement with the brush and review 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:14.340
 several times the same place with two 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.260
 layers has a perfect coverage by 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.470
 what is not necessary to use others 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.540
 enamels underneath and so you create better 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.540
 that cloudy cream effect above 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.280
 the glitter between layer and layer is 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.370
 convenient to let it dry well 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.880
 also if these are fine notes give 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.430
 a lot in the dry 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.650
 and the manicure with this type of enamels 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.830
 it looks great without more decorations 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.050
 so it could be left like that yes 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.570
 with this glaze I think it's convenient 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.510
 to standardize the application cast top 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.730
 coat as in my left hand and although 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.190
 although the brushstrokes in the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.710
 right hand without top coat the finish is not 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.690
 it's so thin to make the point 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.210
 triangular we cut the adhesive tape 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.070
 with a straight cut so that it is not 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.830
 saw edge making a small 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.380
 rectangle we remove the excess 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.320
 glue sticking it in our hand and 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.690
 then we stick it on the nail calculating 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.790
 that one of the peaks of the rectangle 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.400
 stay in the middle of the nail and separating 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.980
 a few millimeters from the tip fixing us 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.020
 to always leave the same distance and 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.470
 paying special attention to pasting 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.470
 borders 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.870
 we apply the dark enamel that covers in 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.959
 the tip making sure we cover 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.519
 well all the liquits we review if it is 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.989
 necessary and let dry a few seconds 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.480
 you can also make the triangles more 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.060
 open by superimposing two pieces of 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.190
 adhesive tape or even make the tip 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.640
 Straight by placing the adhesive tape 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.640
 long 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.520
 when the enamel has dried a little 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.470
 but it is not totally dry we remove 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.480
 the adhesive tape with care but to 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.700
 constant speed towards the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.740
 tip of the nail so that if they remain 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.740
 crickets do not embroider the design 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.340
 finally we throw top coat for 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.340
 Uniform and seal the design 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.389
 and our chevron-tipped manicure 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:45.560
