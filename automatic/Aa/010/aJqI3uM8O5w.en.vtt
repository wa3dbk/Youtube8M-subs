00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
most horrible things that I've noticed

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.920

from<00:05:35.639> all<00:05:35.849> these<00:05:35.969> different<00:05:36.449> groups<00:05:36.629> is<00:05:36.900> that

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
from all these different groups is that

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.360 
from all these different groups is that
they<00:05:37.110> attack<00:05:37.589> each<00:05:37.800> other

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
they attack each other

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.550 
they attack each other
I<00:05:38.400> noticed<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.479> Christians<00:05:39.960> will<00:05:40.169> attack

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
I noticed that Christians will attack

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.170 
I noticed that Christians will attack
and<00:05:40.800> try<00:05:40.919> to<00:05:41.009> destroy<00:05:41.460> each<00:05:41.639> other<00:05:41.879> just

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
and try to destroy each other just

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.760 
and try to destroy each other just
because<00:05:42.360> they<00:05:42.690> don't<00:05:42.839> agree<00:05:43.020> on<00:05:43.110> Thea's<00:05:43.529> well

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
because they don't agree on Thea's well

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.519 
because they don't agree on Thea's well
guess<00:05:43.949> what<00:05:44.279> so<00:05:44.789> does<00:05:44.940> atheism<00:05:45.599> that's<00:05:46.259> right

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:46.529 
guess what so does atheism that's right

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:48.140 
guess what so does atheism that's right
maybe<00:05:46.860> just<00:05:47.099> do<00:05:47.339> the<00:05:47.370> same<00:05:47.639> fuckin<00:05:48.120> thing

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
maybe just do the same fuckin thing

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.570 
maybe just do the same fuckin thing
there's<00:05:48.990> absolutely<00:05:49.529> no<00:05:49.830> difference<00:05:50.339> in

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
there's absolutely no difference in

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.499 
there's absolutely no difference in
atheism<00:05:51.479> and<00:05:51.599> theism<00:05:52.580> except<00:05:53.580> for<00:05:53.849> you<00:05:54.479> know

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
atheism and theism except for you know

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.769 
atheism and theism except for you know
atheism<00:05:55.379> is<00:05:55.560> a<00:05:55.979> lack<00:05:56.520> of<00:05:56.550> belief<00:05:56.849> in<00:05:57.120> God's<00:05:57.360> and

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:57.779 
atheism is a lack of belief in God's and

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.249 
atheism is a lack of belief in God's and
theism<00:05:58.500> is<00:05:58.770> a<00:05:58.830> distinct<00:05:59.629> belief<00:06:00.629> in<00:06:00.870> God<00:06:01.050> but

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
theism is a distinct belief in God but

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.019 
theism is a distinct belief in God but
other<00:06:01.409> than<00:06:01.620> that<00:06:01.770> there's<00:06:02.189> there's<00:06:02.729> no

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.029 
other than that there's there's no

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.149 
other than that there's there's no
difference<00:06:03.479> no<00:06:03.900> difference<00:06:04.289> at<00:06:04.409> all<00:06:04.529> so<00:06:05.009> when

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
difference no difference at all so when

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.820 
difference no difference at all so when
you<00:06:05.189> listen<00:06:05.639> to<00:06:05.669> that<00:06:06.080> in<00:06:07.080> mind<00:06:07.319> and<00:06:07.589> don't

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830
