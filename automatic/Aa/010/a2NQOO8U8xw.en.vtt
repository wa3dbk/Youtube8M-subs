00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
up the very end of it it's pretty

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.930 
up the very end of it it's pretty
unusual<00:00:13.889> terrain<00:00:14.700> for<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.420> 80<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:16.369> that<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.699> is

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
unusual terrain for the 80 in that it is

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.300 
unusual terrain for the 80 in that it is
pretty<00:00:18.420> much<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:18.750> farm<00:00:19.020> fields<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:22.310> it's

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
pretty much all farm fields so it's

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.470 
pretty much all farm fields so it's
unusually<00:00:24.210> flat<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.869> rocky<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.340> its<00:00:27.330> really

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
unusually flat and rocky and its really

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.950 
unusually flat and rocky and its really
nice<00:00:27.779> easy<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.250> rain<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:30.570> only<00:00:30.750> thing

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
nice easy going to rain the only thing

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.340 
nice easy going to rain the only thing
is<00:00:31.790> often<00:00:32.790> there's<00:00:32.969> not<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:33.390> much<00:00:33.570> cover<00:00:33.960> as

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
is often there's not as much cover as

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.440 
is often there's not as much cover as
there<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.829> other<00:00:35.070> places<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.850> you're

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
there are in other places so you're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.990 
there are in other places so you're
exposed<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.020> Sun<00:00:37.230> more<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.969> yesterday<00:00:38.969> I

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
exposed to the Sun more but yesterday I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.869 
exposed to the Sun more but yesterday I
was<00:00:39.149> raining<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:40.530> day<00:00:40.590> long<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.340> i<00:00:41.370> guess<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
was raining all day long so i guess that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.520 
was raining all day long so i guess that
wasn't<00:00:42.059> really<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.440> big<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.829> deal<00:00:45.530> boiling

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
wasn't really that big of a deal boiling

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
wasn't really that big of a deal boiling
springs<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> pretty<00:00:47.640> nice<00:00:47.879> town<00:00:48.180> pretty

small and the campsite or through hikers

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.229 
small and the campsite or through hikers
which<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> only<00:00:55.620> campsite<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
which is the only campsite in the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.910 
which is the only campsite in the
cumberland<00:00:57.690> valley<00:00:57.899> between<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.530> can't

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
cumberland valley between I can't

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.139 
cumberland valley between I can't
remember<00:00:59.039> what<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> shelter<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.910> in

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
remember what the shelter is in

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.830 
remember what the shelter is in
darlington<00:01:00.690> shelter<00:01:02.120> was<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.690> next

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
darlington shelter was like right next

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.030 
darlington shelter was like right next
to<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> railroad<00:01:04.229> tracks<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.640> all<00:01:06.240> night<00:01:06.570> long

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
to the railroad tracks so all night long

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.969 
to the railroad tracks so all night long
you<00:01:08.040> listen<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.520> trains<00:01:08.850> coming<00:01:09.299> by<00:01:09.860> which<00:01:10.860> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
you listen to trains coming by which is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.590 
you listen to trains coming by which is
kind<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.250> annoying<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.090> seems<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> lot

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
kind of annoying but it seems like a lot

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.380 
kind of annoying but it seems like a lot
of<00:01:12.890> places<00:01:14.390> where<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:17.090> campsites<00:01:18.090> near

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
of places where there are campsites near

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.929 
of places where there are campsites near
town<00:01:18.780> they're<00:01:19.110> often<00:01:19.409> near<00:01:19.759> railroad<00:01:20.759> tracks

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
town they're often near railroad tracks

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.600 
town they're often near railroad tracks
I<00:01:21.330> guess<00:01:21.479> because<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.869> an<00:01:22.799> undesirable

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
I guess because it's just an undesirable

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.420 
I guess because it's just an undesirable
location<00:01:24.210> generally<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.110> might<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.130> well<00:01:26.280> put

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
location generally so might as well put

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.780 
location generally so might as well put
a<00:01:26.460> campsite<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:29.460> pretty<00:01:31.790> loud

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
a campsite there right it's pretty loud

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.890 
a campsite there right it's pretty loud
night<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.850> I've<00:01:35.850> been<00:01:36.090> enjoying<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.659> flatter

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
night but I've been enjoying the flatter

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.469 
night but I've been enjoying the flatter
terrain<00:01:37.460> southern<00:01:38.460> Pennsylvania<00:01:38.610> has<00:01:39.270> been

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
terrain southern Pennsylvania has been

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.249 
terrain southern Pennsylvania has been
really<00:01:39.979> easy<00:01:41.720> compared<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.280> everything<00:01:44.280> that

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
really easy compared to everything that

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.899 
really easy compared to everything that
we've<00:01:46.259> seen<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.619> far<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.159> terms<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.549> terrain

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
we've seen so far in terms of terrain

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.660 
we've seen so far in terms of terrain
pretty<00:01:48.509> much<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> easiest<00:01:49.979> terrain<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
pretty much it's the easiest terrain and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.819 
pretty much it's the easiest terrain and
I've<00:01:50.759> heard<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.060> might<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.390> easiest<00:01:51.829> train

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
I've heard it might be the easiest train

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
I've heard it might be the easiest train
on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> whole<00:01:53.250> 80<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:56.420> actually<00:01:57.420> flat

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
on the whole 80 so it's actually flat

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.639 
on the whole 80 so it's actually flat
not<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.229> Virginia<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.750> elevation<00:02:01.259> changes

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
not like Virginia the elevation changes

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.520 
not like Virginia the elevation changes
have<00:02:01.860> slowed<00:02:02.579> down<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.820> lot<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.450> there's<00:02:04.380> been

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
have slowed down a lot and there's been

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.980 
have slowed down a lot and there's been
a<00:02:04.560> few<00:02:04.740> places<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.420> have<00:02:06.420> had<00:02:06.570> some<00:02:06.780> rock

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
a few places that have had some rock

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.940 
a few places that have had some rock
scrambles<00:02:07.560> but<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.759> general<00:02:08.789> um<00:02:09.950> much

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
scrambles but just in general um much

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.160 
scrambles but just in general um much
more

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
more

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.520 
more
gradual<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.400> miles<00:02:13.880> of<00:02:14.330> flat<00:02:15.140> terrain

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
gradual and like miles of flat terrain

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.630 
gradual and like miles of flat terrain
now<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.739> really<00:02:18.920> nice<00:02:21.640> opportunities

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
now and it's a really nice opportunities

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.280 
now and it's a really nice opportunities
to<00:02:22.940> see<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:24.430> little<00:02:25.430> break<00:02:25.849> from<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:29.290> mountains

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
to see a little break from the mountains

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.559 
to see a little break from the mountains
that<00:02:30.560> we've<00:02:30.709> been<00:02:30.890> seeing<00:02:31.130> and<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.760> little<00:02:32.390> more

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
that we've been seeing and a little more

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.140 
that we've been seeing and a little more
on<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.200> edge<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.680> civilization<00:02:34.100> so<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:34.880> see

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
on the edge of civilization so you see

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.680 
on the edge of civilization so you see
like<00:02:35.420> little<00:02:36.200> farm<00:02:36.410> houses<00:02:37.540> nestled<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.660> the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
like little farm houses nestled in the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.360 
like little farm houses nestled in the
middle<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:38.959> nowhere<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.830> then<00:02:40.040> you're

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
middle of nowhere and then you're

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.140 
middle of nowhere and then you're
causing<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:41.030> lot<00:02:42.019> of<00:02:42.050> like<00:02:42.910> highway<00:02:43.910> bridges

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
causing a lot of like highway bridges

fruit bushes that are producing fruit
right<00:03:04.880> now<00:03:05.060> like<00:03:05.680> there's<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.739> lot<00:03:06.860> of<00:03:07.060> black

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
right now like there's a lot of black

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.330 
right now like there's a lot of black
raspberries<00:03:08.810> blueberries<00:03:11.380> mulberries<00:03:12.380> some

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
raspberries blueberries mulberries some

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.120 
raspberries blueberries mulberries some
cherries<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:13.880> are<00:03:14.269> on<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.630> true<00:03:14.980> at<00:03:15.980> the

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
cherries that are on the true at the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.660 
cherries that are on the true at the
moment<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.620> can<00:03:18.620> really<00:03:20.829> get<00:03:21.829> quite<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.459> bit

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
moment so you can really get quite a bit

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.810 
moment so you can really get quite a bit
to<00:03:23.540> eat<00:03:23.600> throughout<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.049> day<00:03:24.170> if<00:03:24.530> you're

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
to eat throughout the day if you're

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.340 
to eat throughout the day if you're
willing<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:25.940> stop<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.359> pick<00:03:26.540> them<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.140> think

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
willing to stop to pick them and I think

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.890 
willing to stop to pick them and I think
it's<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.010> present<00:03:28.400> because<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.850> see<00:03:29.090> these

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
it's a present because you see these

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.289 
it's a present because you see these
bushes<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.739> seems<00:03:31.010> like<00:03:31.100> there's<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.150> ton

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
bushes and it seems like there's a ton

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.960 
bushes and it seems like there's a ton
of<00:03:32.329> people<00:03:32.660> going<00:03:32.810> by<00:03:33.079> but<00:03:33.290> nobody<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:34.670> really

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
of people going by but nobody is really

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.259 
of people going by but nobody is really
interested<00:03:35.959> in<00:03:36.079> stopping<00:03:36.410> so<00:03:37.100> I<00:03:37.400> don't<00:03:38.150> want

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
interested in stopping so I don't want

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.680 
interested in stopping so I don't want
to<00:03:38.329> take<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.630> time<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:40.430> stop<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:40.880> pick<00:03:41.450> them

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
to take the time to stop and pick them

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.150

one week and i think that it works for

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.590 
one week and i think that it works for
them<00:05:14.160> and<00:05:14.820> that<00:05:15.800> people<00:05:16.800> who<00:05:16.919> have<00:05:17.100> a<00:05:17.600> schedule

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
them and that people who have a schedule

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:25.940 
them and that people who have a schedule
they<00:05:19.520> stick<00:05:20.520> to<00:05:20.729> it<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:23.330> don't<00:05:24.560> end<00:05:25.560> up<00:05:25.710> having

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
they stick to it and don't end up having

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.659 
they stick to it and don't end up having
a<00:05:26.010> pretty<00:05:26.040> good<00:05:26.370> pace<00:05:26.610> but<00:05:27.060> at<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.870> same<00:05:28.050> time

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
a pretty good pace but at the same time

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.200 
a pretty good pace but at the same time
it's<00:05:29.669> a<00:05:29.820> little<00:05:30.090> bit<00:05:30.270> I<00:05:30.860> feel<00:05:31.860> like<00:05:32.210> whatever

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
it's a little bit I feel like whatever

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.270 
it's a little bit I feel like whatever
one<00:05:33.479> thing<00:05:33.660> that<00:05:33.810> I<00:05:33.870> like<00:05:34.140> about<00:05:34.280> through

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280

some extent but it's nice not to have to
plan<00:06:28.300> too<00:06:29.300> much<00:06:29.450> in<00:06:29.570> advance<00:06:30.700> so<00:06:31.700> I<00:06:32.770> don't<00:06:33.770> know

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180

but<00:06:35.180> it<00:06:35.360> does<00:06:35.510> seem<00:06:35.660> like<00:06:35.720> people<00:06:36.140> are<00:06:36.760> not

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
but it does seem like people are not

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.370 
but it does seem like people are not
going<00:06:38.420> out<00:06:38.630> of<00:06:38.660> their<00:06:38.840> way<00:06:38.900> to<00:06:39.050> meet<00:06:39.350> new

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.470 
going out of their way to meet new
people<00:06:39.770> would<00:06:39.860> you<00:06:39.950> understand<00:06:40.310> a<00:06:40.430> boat<00:06:40.580> but

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.630 

there's<00:06:44.480> also<00:06:44.600> a<00:06:44.750> little<00:06:44.960> bit<00:06:45.520> different<00:06:46.520> than

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
there's also a little bit different than

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.500 
there's also a little bit different than
it<00:06:46.730> was<00:06:46.760> at<00:06:47.000> the<00:06:47.090> beginning<00:06:47.740> so<00:06:49.270> it's<00:06:50.270> kind<00:06:50.450> of

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
it was at the beginning so it's kind of

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:57.400 
it was at the beginning so it's kind of
a<00:06:50.630> cultural<00:06:51.020> change<00:06:51.050> a<00:06:51.440> little<00:06:52.390> but<00:06:54.400> anyways
