 shvets 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.300
 in principle, just click the mouse 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.559
 in the box 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.989
 Prime tass as far as I understand 400 thousand 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:14.799
 reference 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.400
 28 30 bldg 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.919
 in Krasnodar 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.679
 question 2 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.759
 Donetsk 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.199
 Eastern Partnership Program 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.079
 bye for now 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.590
 the second 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.290
 I think what's right and what's not 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.290
 so on astana 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.130
 except the already mentioned media 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 enough to read 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.319
 the reason is that in the second quarter 790 rubles 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:50.319
 as the newspaper writes 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.930
 no further than that he was not given applicants for 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.569
 winning the tournament in london 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:01.319
 Nevertheless, in his opinion, it is to this 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:04.350
 date so the district prosecutor's office 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500
 it is not surprising that some private tasks 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 sees civilians 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.750
 the world according to the book 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.670
 you mentioned today 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.860
 yuan friday workers 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.869
 therefore, in his opinion it is not necessary 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.290
 Japanese as never before 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.640
 in document 0 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.430
 large enterprises of the Lukoil group 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.430
 cube 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.930
 but u can't understand 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.020
 trillion rubles 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.830
 I cant 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.820
 rub group structure group in the amount of 500 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.940
 than in the past rub 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.540
 in one plots 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.880
 like in a drop 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.159
 this is almost exactly the critical point 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.249
 5x 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.249
 it's only him 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.399
 on Friday, 2006, the defender is almost a third 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:21.479
 total pay 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.699
 m thief 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.699
 experience 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.429
 estimated by observers 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.429
 concept based on valuation of discounts 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:44.559
 besides about 22 00 to 6 8 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.359
 recall that we at least double it 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.359
 faster market recall 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.179
 besides kv program 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.559
 so few and some of them not so easy rub 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.089
 to court 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.089
 because he fails 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.650
 really so 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.650
 before in sports 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.829

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.149
 it's good 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.169
 around 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.549
 I was recently visiting 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.880

 How is he 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.339
 but she is 

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:05.189
 this in turn 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.569
 now by the way 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.139
 after all 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.139
