00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
later on you're probably going to be

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.389 
later on you're probably going to be
putting<00:00:52.540> some<00:00:52.600> type<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:52.960> TGM<00:00:53.589> system<00:00:54.040> in<00:00:54.190> this

to<00:00:54.579> help<00:00:54.760> hold<00:00:54.969> it<00:00:55.120> tight<00:00:55.300> so<00:00:55.600> you're<00:00:56.019> going<00:00:56.140> to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
to help hold it tight so you're going to

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.780 
to help hold it tight so you're going to
want<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.440> go<00:00:56.530> ahead<00:00:56.649> and<00:00:56.979> put<00:00:57.129> those<00:00:57.280> in<00:00:57.519> line

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
want to go ahead and put those in line

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.819 
want to go ahead and put those in line
them<00:00:57.970> up<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:59.079> ahead<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.379> drive<00:00:59.559> down<00:00:59.769> your

them up go ahead and drive down your
first<00:01:00.159> fastener

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.760 

now<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.600> critical<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.260> check<00:01:28.530> for<00:01:28.560> a

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
now it's critical that you check for a

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
now it's critical that you check for a
plum<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.310> level<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:30.510> you're<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
plum with your level now if you're in a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.300 
plum with your level now if you're in a
doorway<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.409> you'll<00:01:31.560> notice<00:01:31.830> that<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.070> log

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
doorway and you'll notice that this log

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.710 
doorway and you'll notice that this log
is<00:01:32.490> overhanging<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.330> bit<00:01:33.450> we're<00:01:33.600> going

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
is overhanging a little bit we're going

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.330 
is overhanging a little bit we're going
to<00:01:33.780> talk<00:01:33.930> about<00:01:34.110> moving<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.680> log<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.280> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to talk about moving a log so that it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219 
to talk about moving a log so that it
makes<00:01:35.550> your<00:01:35.700> wall<00:01:35.880> plumb<00:01:36.240> or<00:01:36.600> gets<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.020> line

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the first thing you're going to do after

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.780 
the first thing you're going to do after
driving<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.420> faster<00:01:40.520> you're<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> take

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
driving that faster you're going to take

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.680 
driving that faster you're going to take
a<00:01:41.820> sledgehammer<00:01:42.500> and<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:44.400> board<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
a sledgehammer and a board what you

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.480 
a sledgehammer and a board what you
don't<00:01:45.900> want<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.140> do<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.410> these<00:01:46.560> logs<00:01:46.800> if<00:01:47.100> you're

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
don't want to do on these logs if you're

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.580 
don't want to do on these logs if you're
especially<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.540> butt<00:01:48.960> ends<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> logs

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
especially on the butt ends of the logs

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260 
especially on the butt ends of the logs
where<00:01:50.040> you've<00:01:50.220> got<00:01:50.400> a<00:01:50.430> saddle<00:01:50.910> notch<00:01:51.030> you've

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
where you've got a saddle notch you've

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.940 
where you've got a saddle notch you've
got<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> dovetail<00:01:51.660> corner<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:52.619> want<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
got a dovetail corner you don't want to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.410 
got a dovetail corner you don't want to
take<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.280> sledgehammer<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.910> just<00:01:54.090> pound<00:01:54.270> on

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
take that sledgehammer and just pound on

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.359 
take that sledgehammer and just pound on
the<00:01:54.509> end<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.990> reason<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.979> that

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the end the reason for that is that

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.980 
the end the reason for that is that
sledgehammer<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.119> face<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.660> will<00:01:57.810> close

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
sledgehammer the face of that will close

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.420 
sledgehammer the face of that will close
the<00:01:58.170> grain<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.530> log<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.039> when<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.250> go<00:01:59.399> to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the grain of that log and when you go to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.609 
the grain of that log and when you go to
stain<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.789> log<00:02:00.149> afterwards<00:02:00.720> everywhere

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
stain that log afterwards everywhere

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.260 
stain that log afterwards everywhere
that<00:02:01.800> you've<00:02:01.950> used<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.340> face<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> log<00:02:03.000> it's

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
that you've used that face the log it's

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.520 
that you've used that face the log it's

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
all finished material so you don't want

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.169 
all finished material so you don't want
to<00:02:07.920> strike<00:02:08.160> it<00:02:08.340> especially<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:08.880> framing

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
every time you hit the log you're going

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.970 
every time you hit the log you're going
to<00:02:11.940> use<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> board<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.480> between<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.900> put<00:02:13.830> down

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
to use the board in between it put down

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.340 
to use the board in between it put down
one<00:02:14.190> fastener<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.910> way<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.690> takes<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.080> keeps

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
one fastener that way it takes it keeps

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.690 
one fastener that way it takes it keeps
the<00:02:16.470> balance<00:02:16.830> out<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.190> logs<00:02:17.370> if<00:02:17.580> you

the balance out of the logs if you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.860 
the balance out of the logs if you
weren't<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.970> put<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.239> fastener<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.750> there

going down through each one of the logs

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.480 
going down through each one of the logs
you're<00:05:25.439> getting<00:05:25.620> closer<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.009> closer<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.430> the

into<00:05:28.979> your<00:05:29.069> subfloor<00:05:29.339> so<00:05:29.729> you<00:05:30.029> want<00:05:30.150> to<00:05:30.210> make

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
into your subfloor so you want to make

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.579
