00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
the trade-off being that you do have to
dial<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.280> some<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.820> detail<00:01:48.149> settings

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
dial down some of the detail settings

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.789 
dial down some of the detail settings
and<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> frame<00:01:48.960> rates<00:01:49.140> are<00:01:49.290> not<00:01:49.380> gonna<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.680> as

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
and the frame rates are not gonna be as

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.819 
and the frame rates are not gonna be as
good<00:01:49.890> when<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:50.820> went<00:01:51.000> from<00:01:51.320> 1920<00:01:52.320> by<00:01:52.439> 1080

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
good when we went from 1920 by 1080

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.880 
good when we went from 1920 by 1080
resolution<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> wider<00:01:54.439> 2560<00:01:55.439> resolution

we<00:01:56.009> definitely<00:01:56.430> took<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.640> bit<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
we definitely took a bit of a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880 
we definitely took a bit of a
performance<00:01:57.450> hit<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.500> why<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.770> good

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
performance hit and that's why it's good

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.010 
performance hit and that's why it's good
that<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.250> decent<00:01:59.670> mid<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.630> mid<00:02:00.840> high

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that we have a decent mid to mid high
