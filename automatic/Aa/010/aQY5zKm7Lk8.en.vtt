00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
tutorial of this one is ticket and this

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.900 
tutorial of this one is ticket and this
one<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.150> an<00:00:09.420> automated<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.610> macro<00:00:11.610> rating

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
one is an automated a macro rating

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.400 
one is an automated a macro rating
system<00:00:12.300> also<00:00:12.900> turned<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.469> dust<00:00:14.219> into<00:00:15.410> all

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
system also turned that dust into all

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.210 
system also turned that dust into all
that<00:00:16.560> order<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> Duster<00:00:17.750> coal<00:00:18.750> into<00:00:19.039> gold<00:00:20.039> us

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
that order the Duster coal into gold us

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.099 
that order the Duster coal into gold us
and<00:00:20.460> all<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.640> kind<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.910> stuff<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.449> you

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
and all that kind of stuff that you

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.800 
and all that kind of stuff that you
obviously<00:00:22.650> are<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.160> need<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.689> all<00:00:24.689> of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
obviously are going to need and all of

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.120 
obviously are going to need and all of
our<00:00:24.869> system<00:00:25.260> will<00:00:25.320> make<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.650> just<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.070> much

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
our system will make it just that much

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.060 
our system will make it just that much
easier<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.840> start<00:00:28.140> off<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.380> making<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.800> little

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
easier so start off with making a little

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.200 
easier so start off with making a little
pep<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:29.400> my<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.670> power<00:00:29.880> grid<00:00:30.090> I've

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
pep that's my little power grid I've

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.849 
pep that's my little power grid I've
made<00:00:30.359> up<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.349> obviously<00:00:31.590> connect

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
made up so you can obviously connect

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.220 
made up so you can obviously connect
this<00:00:31.949> up<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.219> any<00:00:32.369> power<00:00:32.579> grid<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.420> I'll<00:00:34.079> just

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
this up to any power grid and I'll just

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.040 
this up to any power grid and I'll just
put<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.590> couple<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.870> transformers<00:00:36.870> because

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
put in a couple of transformers because

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.750 
put in a couple of transformers because
it<00:00:37.140> can't<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.440> bothered<00:00:37.620> putting<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:40.760> actual

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
it can't be bothered putting in actual

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
it can't be bothered putting in actual
transformers<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.469> use<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> transfer

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
transformers so just use a transfer

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.819 
transformers so just use a transfer
great<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.579> it'll<00:00:44.670> work<00:00:44.850> fine<00:00:45.260> now<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.320> think

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
great and it'll work fine now I think

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.270 
great and it'll work fine now I think
nine<00:00:47.129> should<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.239> fine<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.920> you<00:00:49.920> have<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
nine should be fine for this you have to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.709 
nine should be fine for this you have to
work<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.460> overclockers<00:00:51.059> because<00:00:51.329> sometimes

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
work with overclockers because sometimes

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.209 
work with overclockers because sometimes
they<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.020> stop<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.410> system<00:00:52.739> from<00:00:52.860> working

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
they can stop your system from working

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.670 
they can stop your system from working
because<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.789> too<00:00:53.940> powerful<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:58.260> for

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
because they are too powerful so for

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.750 
because they are too powerful so for
this<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.000> you<00:01:00.000> need<00:01:00.859> to<00:01:01.859> put<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.370> chest<00:01:02.550> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
this one you need to put in a chest on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.600 
this one you need to put in a chest on
the<00:01:02.789> top<00:01:03.110> with<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> wooden<00:01:04.619> pipe<00:01:04.949> connect<00:01:05.400> from

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the top with a wooden pipe connect from

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.940 
the top with a wooden pipe connect from
the<00:01:05.700> chest<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.110> redstone<00:01:07.439> engine

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the chest with a redstone engine

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.820 
the chest with a redstone engine
powering<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.640> wooden<00:01:08.909> pipe<00:01:09.619> going<00:01:10.619> down

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
powering the wooden pipe going down

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.679 
powering the wooden pipe going down
through<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.100> stone<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:11.670> anything<00:01:12.270> pipe<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
through a stone or anything pipe and

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.700 
through a stone or anything pipe and
that<00:01:12.780> will<00:01:12.869> go<00:01:12.990> through<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> top<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.590> that

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
that will go through the top and that

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.359 
that will go through the top and that
will<00:01:13.799> put<00:01:13.950> into<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.280> item<00:01:14.670> ear<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.979> from

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
will put into this item ear and from

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.200 
will put into this item ear and from
that<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.520> need<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.939> wooden<00:01:18.540> pipe<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.000 

chest<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.500> run<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.799> through<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:25.049> they

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
chest to run it through there so they

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.130 
chest to run it through there so they
have<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.850> fully<00:01:27.180> automated<00:01:27.479> Mac<00:01:27.810> rating

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
have it a fully automated Mac rating

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.810 
have it a fully automated Mac rating
system<00:01:28.500> although<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.640> watch<00:01:29.790> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
system although you have to watch it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.670 
system although you have to watch it
sometimes<00:01:30.330> because<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.890> feed<00:01:33.080> this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.109 

up<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.860> top<00:01:40.039> once<00:01:40.219> it<00:01:40.340> gets<00:01:40.460> fully<00:01:40.670> powered<00:01:40.969> it

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
up the top once it gets fully powered it

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.639 
up the top once it gets fully powered it
can<00:01:41.240> feed<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.600> faster<00:01:42.020> than<00:01:42.170> this<00:01:42.289> buggy<00:01:42.500> and

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
can feed it faster than this buggy and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.789 
can feed it faster than this buggy and
suck<00:01:42.860> out<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:43.159> that's<00:01:43.219> good<00:01:43.430> i<00:01:43.520> dare<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:44.799> just

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
suck out so that's good i dare to just

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:46.899 
suck out so that's good i dare to just
chug<00:01:45.950> it<00:01:45.979> now<00:01:46.159> that<00:01:46.310> you're<00:01:46.399> either<00:01:46.520> chucking

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
chug it now that you're either chucking

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.639 
chug it now that you're either chucking
another<00:01:47.090> chest<00:01:47.390> or<00:01:47.570> connect<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.049> up<00:01:48.110> like<00:01:48.500> i'm

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
another chest or connect it up like i'm

00:01:48.649 --> 00:02:00.380 
another chest or connect it up like i'm
gonna<00:01:48.770> do<00:01:48.890> here<00:01:51.070> just<00:01:52.070> run<00:01:52.280> up<00:01:52.399> through<00:01:52.579> there

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.960 

there<00:02:01.390> we<00:02:01.540> go<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:03.130> that<00:02:03.310> will<00:02:03.400> give<00:02:03.460> you<00:02:03.730> a<00:02:03.760> nice

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
there we go so that will give you a nice

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
there we go so that will give you a nice
so<00:02:04.510> I<00:02:04.570> need<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.750> residential<00:02:05.200> year<00:02:05.560> as<00:02:05.620> well

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.749 

you<00:02:08.560> can<00:02:08.679> always<00:02:08.800> tidy<00:02:09.099> this<00:02:09.190> up<00:02:09.250> sides<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.670> it

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
you can always tidy this up sides of it

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.690 
you can always tidy this up sides of it
later

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.229 

that's<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.510> bit<00:02:13.660> better<00:02:14.230> looking<00:02:14.879> for<00:02:15.879> example

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
that's a bit better looking for example

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.490 
that's a bit better looking for example
you'd<00:02:16.360> have<00:02:16.480> them<00:02:16.629> sucking<00:02:17.050> out<00:02:17.200> through<00:02:17.349> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
you'd have them sucking out through the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.820 
you'd have them sucking out through the
bottom<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.239> behind<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.720> or<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.680> could

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
bottom and behind it so or you could

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.900 
bottom and behind it so or you could
have<00:02:20.950> bond<00:02:21.129> that's<00:02:21.340> where<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.550> power<00:02:21.670> goes

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
have bond that's where the power goes

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.850 
have bond that's where the power goes
you<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.690> sucking<00:02:22.959> out<00:02:23.080> through<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.410> side

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
you have it sucking out through the side

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.800 
you have it sucking out through the side
here<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> teleport<00:02:25.390> planet<00:02:25.690> and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
here and then to a teleport planet and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.360 
here and then to a teleport planet and
Sony's<00:02:26.140> your<00:02:26.290> tailpipe<00:02:26.650> I've<00:02:26.800> with<00:02:27.220> no

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
Sony's your tailpipe I've with no

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.970 
Sony's your tailpipe I've with no
tailpipe<00:02:27.819> believes<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.720> chest<00:02:29.620> here<00:02:29.800> or

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
tailpipe believes to a chest here or

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.160 
tailpipe believes to a chest here or
something<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:31.300> i'll<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.569> show<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.900> how<00:02:32.110> to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
something so i'll just show you how to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.120 
something so i'll just show you how to
it<00:02:32.349> works<00:02:32.590> just<00:02:33.300> fine<00:02:34.300> cause<00:02:34.599> it's<00:02:35.500> mine<00:02:35.920> all

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
it works just fine cause it's mine all

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.830 
it works just fine cause it's mine all
there

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
there

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.830 
there
just<00:02:38.470> check<00:02:38.709> him<00:02:38.830> up<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.099> top

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
just check him up in the top

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.720 
just check him up in the top
now<00:02:41.739> as<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:41.890> can<00:02:42.010> see<00:02:42.069> this<00:02:42.250> will<00:02:42.400> go<00:02:42.489> straight

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
now as you can see this will go straight

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.059 
now as you can see this will go straight
through<00:02:42.819> here<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.840> into<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:46.180> mac<00:02:46.360> router

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
through here and into the mac router

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.199 
through here and into the mac router
which<00:02:48.069> if<00:02:48.190> I've<00:02:48.340> got<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.610> overclockers<00:02:48.940> right

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
which if I've got the overclockers right

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.509 
which if I've got the overclockers right
will<00:02:49.330> be<00:02:49.420> perfect<00:02:50.140> try<00:02:50.650> 10<00:02:52.530> see<00:02:53.530> there<00:02:54.310> we<00:02:54.400> ate

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
will be perfect try 10 see there we ate

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.570 
will be perfect try 10 see there we ate
n<00:02:54.700> works<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.120> try<00:02:55.870> 11<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:57.099> you<00:02:57.190> can<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.459> can

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
n works to try 11 so you can you can

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.070 
n works to try 11 so you can you can
just<00:02:57.610> used<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.150> play<00:02:58.420> around<00:02:58.629> with<00:02:58.780> these<00:02:58.870> ones

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
just used to play around with these ones

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.880 
just used to play around with these ones
it<00:02:59.230> 11<00:02:59.560> works<00:02:59.739> maybe<00:03:00.489> 12<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:02.500> faster<00:03:02.830> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
it 11 works maybe 12 the faster the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.570 
it 11 works maybe 12 the faster the
better<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.160> suppose<00:03:04.200> yep<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.950> we'll<00:03:06.340> just<00:03:06.370> leave

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
better I suppose yep so we'll just leave

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.000 
better I suppose yep so we'll just leave
it<00:03:06.700> at<00:03:06.790> 12<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.180> there<00:03:07.330> we<00:03:07.390> go<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:08.500> double

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
it at 12 so there we go this double

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.339 
it at 12 so there we go this double
splitting<00:03:09.280> out<00:03:09.430> rules<00:03:09.989> hopefully<00:03:10.989> fix<00:03:11.200> that

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
splitting out rules hopefully fix that

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.059 
splitting out rules hopefully fix that
up<00:03:11.379> a<00:03:11.500> little<00:03:11.620> bit<00:03:12.329> and<00:03:13.650> one<00:03:14.650> other<00:03:14.769> thing<00:03:15.040> that

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
up a little bit and one other thing that

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.550 
up a little bit and one other thing that
you<00:03:15.190> can<00:03:15.370> try<00:03:15.819> is<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:17.140> have<00:03:19.319> rental<00:03:20.319> engine

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
you can try is to have rental engine

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.699 
you can try is to have rental engine
down<00:03:20.709> here<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:22.269> one<00:03:22.420> over<00:03:22.450> there<00:03:22.780> power<00:03:23.650> up

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
down here that one over there power up

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.789 
down here that one over there power up
the<00:03:23.799> Reds<00:03:23.950> an<00:03:24.040> engine<00:03:25.379> you<00:03:26.379> can<00:03:26.530> connect

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
the Reds an engine you can connect

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.229 
the Reds an engine you can connect
straight<00:03:27.129> to<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.340> furnace<00:03:27.760> which<00:03:27.910> is<00:03:28.060> what<00:03:28.180> i'm

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
straight to a furnace which is what i'm

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.809 
straight to a furnace which is what i'm
going<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.390> do<00:03:28.540> now<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:30.430> i<00:03:30.489> don't<00:03:30.519> actually

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
going to do now and i don't actually

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.840 
going to do now and i don't actually
have<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.060> furnace<00:03:31.420> out

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.370 

so<00:03:35.510> putting<00:03:36.110> if<00:03:36.260> furnace<00:03:36.920> airy<00:03:37.100> there

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.460 

but<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.370> need<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:40.580> have<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.760> set<00:03:40.940> up

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.570 

powered

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
powered

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.540 
powered
then<00:03:46.120> you<00:03:46.270> put<00:03:46.450> from<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.690> furnace<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:47.290> put<00:03:47.500> a

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
then you put from the furnace you put a

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.550 
then you put from the furnace you put a
engine

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
engine

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.640 

pally<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.489> ain't<00:03:51.670> ready

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
pally and you ain't ready

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.030 
pally and you ain't ready
hold<00:03:54.099> on<00:03:54.189> to<00:03:54.310> their<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:56.590> chest<00:03:56.829> so<00:03:57.010> that

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
hold on to their and a chest so that

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.830 
hold on to their and a chest so that
will<00:03:57.250> be<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.340> final<00:03:57.549> chest<00:03:57.970> for<00:03:58.150> whores<00:03:58.360> and

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
will be the final chest for whores and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.090 
will be the final chest for whores and
in<00:03:59.019> goals<00:03:59.230> etc

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.220 

so<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:04.050> need<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.200> power<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:04.710> up<00:04:05.960> so<00:04:06.960> just

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
so just need a power this one up so just

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:18.210 
so just need a power this one up so just
go<00:04:07.830> from<00:04:08.040> our<00:04:08.130> power<00:04:08.310> grid

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.740 

I'm<00:04:18.730> going<00:04:18.850> to<00:04:18.910> doing<00:04:19.120> this<00:04:19.180> roughly<00:04:19.480> but<00:04:19.630> you

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
I'm going to doing this roughly but you

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.330 
I'm going to doing this roughly but you
can<00:04:19.870> always<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.320> can't<00:04:20.620> Nathan<00:04:20.920> up<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.190> could

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
can always you can't Nathan up you could

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.530 
can always you can't Nathan up you could
use<00:04:21.459> power<00:04:21.730> top<00:04:22.060> or<00:04:22.240> pipes<00:04:22.530> if<00:04:23.530> you're<00:04:23.800> using<00:04:24.010> a

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
use power top or pipes if you're using a

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.500 
use power top or pipes if you're using a
energy<00:04:25.540> link<00:04:27.030> ship<00:04:28.030> to<00:04:28.120> the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
energy link ship to the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.879 
energy link ship to the
transformers<00:04:30.510> into<00:04:30.690> their

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
transformers into their

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.800 
transformers into their
and<00:04:32.159> try<00:04:32.580> she's<00:04:33.210> like<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.449> is<00:04:33.569> mine

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.980 

they're<00:04:38.320> gonna<00:04:38.530> lose<00:04:39.100> a<00:04:39.130> fully<00:04:39.580> automated

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
they're gonna lose a fully automated

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:52.230 
they're gonna lose a fully automated
furnace<00:04:40.990> and

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.820 

there<00:04:52.810> we<00:04:52.900> go

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.730 

turn<00:04:56.130> right<00:04:56.400> off

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.200 

basically<00:05:00.740> I<00:05:00.770> have<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.400> fully<00:05:01.880> automated

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
basically I have a fully automated

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.010 
basically I have a fully automated
system<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:03.169> as<00:05:03.830> soon<00:05:03.980> as<00:05:04.100> I<00:05:04.190> put<00:05:04.810> this<00:05:05.810> one

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
system and as soon as I put this one

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.370 
system and as soon as I put this one
back
