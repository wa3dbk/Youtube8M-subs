00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
should be smoother and more responsive

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.830 
should be smoother and more responsive
now<00:00:22.500> which<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.740> obviously<00:00:23.279> great<00:00:23.670> news<00:00:24.000> as<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
to started raining now for the bug fixes

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.120 
to started raining now for the bug fixes
we<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.570> mine<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> jump<00:00:34.440> again<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:34.980> those

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
we can now mine and jump again so those

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.260 
we can now mine and jump again so those
of<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.460> were<00:00:35.579> experiencing<00:00:36.180> those

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
of you that were experiencing those

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.229 
of you that were experiencing those
issues<00:00:36.719> Luis<00:00:37.350> it's<00:00:37.590> totally<00:00:38.340> working<00:00:38.550> great

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
issues Luis it's totally working great

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.819 
issues Luis it's totally working great
in<00:00:39.390> fact<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:39.780> creative<00:00:40.379> mode<00:00:40.500> actually

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
in fact I think creative mode actually

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.770 
in fact I think creative mode actually
breaks<00:00:41.070> things<00:00:41.219> faster<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:42.000> mean<00:00:42.239> look<00:00:42.270> at<00:00:42.570> that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
breaks things faster I mean look at that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.049 
breaks things faster I mean look at that
it's<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.440> rapid-fire<00:00:44.010> those<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.760> having

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it's like rapid-fire those of you having

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.209 
it's like rapid-fire those of you having
issues<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.110> before<00:00:46.230> should<00:00:47.039> be

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
issues with it before should be

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.100 
issues with it before should be
completely<00:00:47.579> good<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:47.969> science<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.840> now<00:00:48.930> use

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
completely good now science can now use

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.000 
completely good now science can now use
all<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.590> lines<00:00:50.809> and<00:00:51.809> signs<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.770> pushed

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
all the lines and signs are not pushed

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.580 
all the lines and signs are not pushed
off<00:00:53.219> anymore<00:00:53.520> by<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> virtual<00:00:54.840> keyboard<00:00:55.379> on

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590

the screen you know and this when the
keyboard<00:00:57.030> actually<00:00:57.239> comes<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.570> sometimes<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
keyboard actually comes up sometimes it

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.080 
keyboard actually comes up sometimes it
was<00:00:58.109> pushing<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> sign<00:00:59.219> off<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.579> screen<00:00:59.879> so

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
was pushing the sign off the screen so

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.310 
was pushing the sign off the screen so
you<00:01:00.180> could<00:01:00.329> really<00:01:00.570> rude<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.809> know<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.230> you

the<00:01:17.909> sneak<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:19.200> reason

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the sneak on the right for some reason

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.260 
the sneak on the right for some reason
it<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.650> drives<00:01:19.979> me<00:01:20.159> nuts<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.090> there

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it just drives me nuts to have it there

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.480 
it just drives me nuts to have it there
but<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.229> need<00:01:22.259> jumping<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> lot<00:01:23.040> more<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
but I really need jumping a lot more and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.980 
but I really need jumping a lot more and
more<00:01:23.670> accessible<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.600> why<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.780> switched

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
more accessible so that's why I switched

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
more accessible so that's why I switched
at<00:01:25.229> all<00:01:25.320> but<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:26.280> some<00:01:26.580> people<00:01:26.610> you

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
at all but you know for some people you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
at all but you know for some people you
know<00:01:27.360> obviously<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.869> gonna<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.110> better<00:01:28.290> for

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
know obviously it's gonna be better for

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.469 
know obviously it's gonna be better for
them<00:01:28.680> snow<00:01:29.189> layers<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.700> replaced<00:01:30.180> with

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
them snow layers can be replaced with

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.140 
them snow layers can be replaced with
any<00:01:30.689> block<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:32.790> place

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
any block now and you can now place

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.929 
any block now and you can now place
dolls<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.780> top<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.170> slabs<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.759> pretty

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
dolls on top of slabs so that's pretty

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.670 
dolls on top of slabs so that's pretty
