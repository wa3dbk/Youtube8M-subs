00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
three parts the divisor the number we

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.099 
three parts the divisor the number we
are<00:00:27.779> dividing<00:00:28.380> by<00:00:29.029> the<00:00:30.029> dividend<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.900> number

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
are dividing by the dividend the number

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.280 
are dividing by the dividend the number
we<00:00:31.500> are<00:00:31.619> dividing<00:00:32.099> into<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.989> quotient

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
we are dividing into and the quotient

way<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.250> say<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.700> same<00:00:38.730> thing<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.960> say<00:00:39.989> that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
way to say the same thing is to say that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.229 
way to say the same thing is to say that
the<00:00:40.739> dividend<00:00:41.280> divided<00:00:42.239> by<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.600> divisor<00:00:43.200> is

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
the dividend divided by the divisor is

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.160 
the dividend divided by the divisor is
equal<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.020> quotient<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.719> what's<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
right of the decimal point if there are

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.080 
right of the decimal point if there are
numbers<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.280> move<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.910> decimal

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
numbers we have to move the decimal

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.599 
numbers we have to move the decimal
point<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> end<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> number<00:01:01.829> before

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
point to the end of the number before

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
beginning our division in actuality the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.380 
beginning our division in actuality the
process<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.619> not<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.280> difficult<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.180> might

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
process is not as difficult as it might

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.340 
process is not as difficult as it might
sound<00:01:10.010> suppose<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.280> want<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.700> divide<00:01:12.000> 30<00:01:12.630> by<00:01:12.810> 2

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
sound suppose we want to divide 30 by 2

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.359 
sound suppose we want to divide 30 by 2
and<00:01:14.000> 5/10<00:01:15.320> notice<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> decimal

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and 5/10 notice that we have a decimal

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.460 
and 5/10 notice that we have a decimal
point<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> divisor<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.200> there<00:01:19.350> are

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
point in the divisor and that there are

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.270 
point in the divisor and that there are
numbers<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.159> its<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:21.080> we<00:01:22.080> need<00:01:22.380> first<00:01:22.890> move

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
numbers to its right we need first move

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.859 
numbers to its right we need first move
the<00:01:23.460> decimal<00:01:23.880> point<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.360> end<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the decimal point to the end of the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.490 
the decimal point to the end of the
divisor<00:01:25.200> after<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> 5<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:27.630> balance<00:01:28.290> the

divisor after the 5 to balance the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.050 
divisor after the 5 to balance the
equation<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:29.310> need<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> move<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> decimal

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
equation we need to move the decimal

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.179 
equation we need to move the decimal
point<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.350> same<00:01:31.650> number<00:01:32.159> of

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
point to the right the same number of

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.179 
point to the right the same number of
places<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> dividend<00:01:33.799> basically<00:01:34.799> what<00:01:35.040> we

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
places on the dividend basically what we

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.770 
places on the dividend basically what we
are<00:01:35.220> doing<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.880> multiplying<00:01:36.060> both<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
are doing is multiplying both the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.550 
are doing is multiplying both the
divisor<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.680> dividend<00:01:38.310> by<00:01:38.549> 10<00:01:39.409> from<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
divisor and the dividend by 10 from a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.499 
divisor and the dividend by 10 from a
previous<00:01:41.040> lesson<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.729> will<00:01:41.850> remember<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
previous lesson you will remember that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.899 
previous lesson you will remember that
if<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.780> decimal<00:01:43.229> point<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.799> parent<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.759> is

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
if a decimal point is not a parent it is

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.230 
if a decimal point is not a parent it is
always<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.509> end<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.380> number<00:01:47.210> when<00:01:48.210> we

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
always at the end of a number when we

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.300 
always at the end of a number when we
move<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.780> decimal<00:01:48.960> point<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.619> right<00:01:49.710> we

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
move the decimal point to the right we

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.520 
move the decimal point to the right we
need<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> fill<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.909> any<00:01:51.180> blanks<00:01:51.360> created<00:01:52.350> with

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
need to fill in any blanks created with

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.149 
need to fill in any blanks created with
a<00:01:52.560> 0<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.970> only<00:01:54.570> thing<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.170> left<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.920> is

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
a 0 the only thing we have left to do is

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.520 
a 0 the only thing we have left to do is
to<00:01:56.460> divide<00:01:56.960> remembering<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.079> play<00:01:58.320> this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
to divide remembering to play this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.859 
to divide remembering to play this
decimal<00:01:59.009> point<00:01:59.399> straight<00:01:59.939> up<00:02:00.000> into<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
decimal point straight up into the

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.120 
decimal point straight up into the
quotient<00:02:02.990> look<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> example<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
quotient look at the example on the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.270 
quotient look at the example on the
screen<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:06.450> divisor<00:02:06.810> has<00:02:07.200> two<00:02:07.560> numbers<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
screen the divisor has two numbers to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.270 
screen the divisor has two numbers to
the<00:02:08.369> right<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.970> decimal<00:02:09.149> point

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
the right of the decimal point

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.589 
the right of the decimal point
therefore<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.489> decimal<00:02:11.970> point<00:02:12.239> needs<00:02:12.480> to

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
therefore the decimal point needs to

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.220 
therefore the decimal point needs to
move

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
move

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.520 
move
right<00:02:13.739> two<00:02:14.430> spaces<00:02:14.879> in<00:02:15.270> both<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.599> divisor<00:02:15.989> and

right two spaces in both the divisor and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.900 
right two spaces in both the divisor and
