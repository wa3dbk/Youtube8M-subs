00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:08.620 

got<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> bad<00:02:55.330> feeling<00:02:55.690> about<00:02:55.750> this<00:02:55.900> ship

and they have surrendered so I think we
have<00:03:13.640> no<00:03:13.820> choice<00:03:14.030> but<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.300> call<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.570> a

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
have no choice but to call that a

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.660

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:07.690 
interesting okay we're just going to
keep<00:04:06.530> looking<00:04:06.590> at<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:06.950> couple<00:04:07.099> of<00:04:07.310> those<00:04:07.370> stats

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
keep looking at a couple of those stats

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.600 
keep looking at a couple of those stats
and<00:04:08.180> betel<00:04:08.540> income<00:04:08.870> rate<00:04:09.079> was<00:04:09.860> never<00:04:10.069> that<00:04:10.310> bad

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
and betel income rate was never that bad

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.039 
and betel income rate was never that bad
which<00:04:11.230> is<00:04:12.230> kind<00:04:12.500> of<00:04:12.560> good<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:12.890> see<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:14.420> I<00:04:14.900> was

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
which is kind of good to see and I was

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.390 
which is kind of good to see and I was
going<00:04:15.290> up<00:04:15.409> against<00:04:15.680> tottenham<00:04:15.980> who<00:04:16.070> had<00:04:16.220> by

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
going up against tottenham who had by

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.259 
going up against tottenham who had by
far<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.850> best<00:04:17.090> income<00:04:17.510> once<00:04:17.870> they<00:04:18.079> went<00:04:18.290> down

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
far the best income once they went down

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.729 
far the best income once they went down
well<00:04:20.269> even<00:04:20.329> I<00:04:20.660> think<00:04:20.780> this<00:04:21.079> is<00:04:21.229> around<00:04:21.530> when<00:04:21.709> I

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
well even I think this is around when I

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.610 
well even I think this is around when I
settled<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.760> planets<00:04:23.630> in<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.840> interior

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
had a really good time doing it the game

had a really good time doing it the game
is<00:05:05.500> really<00:05:05.860> nuanced<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:06.760> has<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:06.910> lot<00:05:07.180> of

is really nuanced and has a lot of

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.370 
is really nuanced and has a lot of
subtleties<00:05:10.030> to<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.390> strategy<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:10.900> think<00:05:11.260> you

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
subtleties to the strategy I think you

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.480 
subtleties to the strategy I think you
should<00:05:11.530> really<00:05:11.710> try<00:05:11.980> it<00:05:12.100> if<00:05:12.250> you<00:05:12.340> haven't

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490
