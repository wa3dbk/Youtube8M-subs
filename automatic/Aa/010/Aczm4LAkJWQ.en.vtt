00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 The main function is a device 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.560
 of fitness that integrates what music is 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.050
 and exercise this of course has the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.750
 part of the clock in the exercise part 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.870
 for here has the music part of 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.720
 music side has 8 gigs of music 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.010
 that are to people of 4 thousand songs 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.850
 those sorted by playlists 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.770
 artists songs etcetera and synchronizes 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.580
 with motorcycles 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.980
 and what that exercise has more than 50 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.770
 disciplines that are racing 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.780
 on this elliptical walk and there 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.090
 personalized exercises in my case by 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.580
 personal example I did tennis but one 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.820
 can customize aerobic arts 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.559
 martial rather than static bicycle 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.210
 boxing and so on 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.910
 the idea of ​​this device is 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.469
 on the same computer save all the 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.059
 information that one has regarding 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.760
 to physical exercise for later 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.220
 combine it and thus look for yields 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.730
 better to please even more compete 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.110
 with oneself and improving day by day 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.600
 then that here for example show 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.220
 a race that I did on April 2 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.440
 this time it's an expression I say 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.420
 harris 58 minutes almost 9 km 700 calories 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.240
 this is the altitude from which I went to 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.580
 how much did I run each of the laps and 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.340
 finally for example the route where 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.079
 ran this is the party san miguel 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.789
 another thing that integrates this plus the 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.939
 exercise more towards music we were 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:36.359
 seeing is when one runs is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.640
 proven that the music motivates them 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.250
 then different music of beautiful rhythm 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.840
 music motivates you say so 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.850
 I was waiting for music that motivates you 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.100
 more and it allows you to store it in a 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.020
 special list that way that list 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.689
 one can put it on race day 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.770
 properly and assume that it will go a lot 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.560
 faster 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.990
 to a better person the device 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.659
 synchronizes with a 3.5 handset 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.240
 inches just like by bluetooth like 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.170
 the s10 cones that were watching 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.349
 also they have the box bracelet 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.860
 that will be connected to clock mode like this 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.540
 to connect it inside the box that 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.790
 Buy us the product will come with the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.459
 sports headphone that hangs from the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.370
 ears and with a clip to hang on the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.920
 clothing either the belt or jacket 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.840
 where one wants in a part not for 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.180
 buy a band for the roof to 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.709
 measure everything that is pulsations and 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.560
 understand in what frequency one is 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.349
 working and also other instruments 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.900
 as for example to measure to what 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.360
 speed do not go on a bicycle in 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.400
 particular way that brage of cadence and 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.340
 a support for the bicycle together with 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.379
 a support for the arm also 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.690
 the device is totally 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.870
 independent of the phones one what 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.010
 can connect to the sensors or fit 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.629
 wireless can also be 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.690
 connected to bluetooth with a player 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:04.239
 a headset sorry or you can search for networks 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.519
 wifi then one can find network 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.340
 wifi that you have already remembered for 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.900
 synchronize your data immediately

 I can add new kassian wifi networks 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.400
 anywhere we read good then 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.220
 is alone on the device looking for network

 synchronizes saves everything in a portal that 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.910
 portal has saved all the information 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.530
 one more pc format and much more this 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.370
 easy to read for the user 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.370
 what else do we have 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.090
 finally this can an integration 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.610
 with the phone in my case is another 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.260
 synchronized with my cell phone and I have the

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.980
 has timer has timer 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.980
 then one can see for example 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.670
 in a minute that I 'm doing I can 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.130
