00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
 chapter 21 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.780
 and a new heaven and a new earth 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.000
 because the first closure the first earth passed and the sea no longer existed 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.069
 plus 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.069
 and me when I saw the holy city the new jerusalem 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.480
 descend from God's heaven ready as a wife dressed for her husband 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.939
 and today a great voice from heaven that said 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.249
 here is the tabernacle of God with men and the dwelling with them and they 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.520
 they were his people and god himself will be with them as his god 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.750
 in playing God every tear from their eyes 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.270
 and there will be no more death and there will be no more anthony clamor or pain 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.950
 because the first things happened 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.370
 and the one who was sitting on the throne said 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.270
 behold, I make all things new 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.350
 and I said 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.180
 write because these words are true and true 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.350
 and he told me this fact is 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.800
 I am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.170
 so that you want to be 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.200
 and I will give you free from the source of the water of life 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.040
 he who will win and inherit all things and I will be his god 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.810
 and he will be my son 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.030
 but cowards and unbelievers 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.100
 the abominable and homicidal 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.290
 the fornicators and sorcerers 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.070
 the idolaters and all the liars will have their part in the lake that burns 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.390
 with fire and brimstone 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.070
 what is death 2Âª 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.840
 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven cups came to me 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.230
 full of the seven last plagues 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.080
 and he spoke with me saying 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.729
 come here I will show you the bride 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.750
 the wife of the lamb 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.950
 and it took me in the spirit to a big and tall mountain 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.450
 and he showed me the great holy city of jerusalem that came down from heaven 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.090
 God 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.230
 having the glory of god 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.670
 and its brightness was similar to that of a very precious stone like stone 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.400
 diaphanous jasper like crystal 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.570
 It had a large, high wall with twelve doors 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.220
 and on the doors 12 angels and registered names that are those of the twelve tribes 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.050
 of the children of israel 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.790
 to the east three doors 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.580
 north three doors 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.269
 to the south three doors to the west 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.799
 three doors 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.099
 and the city wall had 12 foundations and on them the twelve names 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.759
 of the twelve apostles of the lamb 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:23.659
 the one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city his 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.339
 doors and its wall 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:29.819
 the city has been established in square and its length is equal to its width 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.949
 and he measured the city with the reed 12 thousand stadia 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:35.040
 the length 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.079
 the height and width of them are the same 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.319
 and no god a wall 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.640
 144 man measuring co2 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.549
 which is angel 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.480
 the material of its wall was of jasper but the city was of pure gold similar to 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:50.769
 clean glass 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.760
 and the foundations of the city wall were adorned with all stone 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.909
 precious 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.889
 the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third agatha the fourth 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:02.769
 emerald 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.369
 the fifth on ice 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:06.159
 the sixth carnelian 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.649
 the seventh chrysolite the eighth order 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.399
 the ninth topaz 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:13.299
 the tenth term 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.909
 the eleventh hyacinth the twelfth amethyst 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.739
 the twelve doors were twelve pearls each of the doors was a pearl 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.659
 and the street of the city was pure gold transparent like glass 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.240
 and the temple is not coming 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.050
 because the almighty Lord God is the temple of her and the lamb 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.280
 the city does not need the sun or the moon that shine in it because the 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:39.979
 Glory of God illuminates it 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.109
 and the lamb is a luminary 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.409
 and the nations that have been saved will walk in the light of it and the 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.739
 kings of the earth will bring their glory and honor to it 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.370
 its doors will never be closed during the day 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.249
 there will be no night 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.969
 that will bring the glory and honor of the nations to her 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.709
 no unclean thing will enter it 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.889
 or who does abomination and lying 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:06.809
 if not only those who are inscribed in the book of life of the cord
