00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 at the beginning there is a will it's 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.080
 brand is a little bit like the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.179
 tattoos and all that in footballers he 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.670
 ya 7 had this desire in any case of 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.259
 stand out very I see the marrow 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.059
 illustrations of the individualism of 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.139
 more and more persistent in football and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.550
 there was a will at home to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.680
 singling out to be different from others 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.380
 the problem is that good most 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.390
 are not lights either and that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.490
 finally a copy themselves all is 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.130
 ultimately rather than being 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.599
 marginalized they are more in emulation 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.250
 collective they are all to be done 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.989
 exactly the same thing the same 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.020
 tattoo the same hair the same 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.239
 everything but it still remains autocentered 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 they are looking good bath after when you 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.210
 t'appelles cristiano ronaldo bottom one is 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.920
 there in the absolute myth of 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.020
 the individualism that is absolutely necessary 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.820
 of everyone else is around 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.510
 him but how strong he is in the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.160
 performance 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.809
 even when she is individual he 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.010
 gets to win the team by his 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.899
 crazy individualism 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.039
 he allows himself everything he has even gone 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.539
 beyond the haircut him he 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.730
 is in cosmetic surgery in 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.520
 in the eyebrows 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.989
 shave redone it and he's really in 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.670
 the star side at hollywood in 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.120
 the use of his person and his 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.040
 picture 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.110
 but when after you go down below 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.300
 and that you do not have his level his requirement 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.409
 of performance to him and that was beating 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.820
 like to come back to what was being said 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.590
 the fields 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.170
 just a guy who pays attention to his 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.820
 look to what will express on the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.040
 ground more by its appearance than either 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.660
 his athletic performance after what u little 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.220
 necessarily edgy because in fact the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.789
 deschamps phrase were innocuous which 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.920
 are in Assyria that the dude nods to 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.830
 departure at the start she said I 'm going there 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.270
 come back I know that after when when 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.470
 he says that the guy is styling 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.820
 no matter how one of the mans who marks 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.410
 we do not care 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.300
 except that when he does not score 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.130
 obviously the sentence that will come out is 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.420
 yeah band of Nazes forgot to do 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.660
 blunder to your haircut like that 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.399
 or your game of outside income 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.630
 inevitably this is over that told 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.920
 half-time because in fact there was 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.479
 many slips in the first half 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.250
 what guys are worth a good 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.990
 day but of course they are not 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.190
 all the guys you do not know but the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.630
 choose your pumps to avoid slipping 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.830
 in the field on the other hand for you 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.470
 take care of your hair strokes there you 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.789
 are there what here and there I missed 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.530
 something more and more 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.240
 frequent is amazing it's the base 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.920
 he was the beginning of the final of 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.599
 the champions league I think 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.980
 besides that the lawn had been 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.000
 watered because it's a pretty trick 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.500
 unbelievable 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.660
 my dear to our dumplings 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.099
 makes a little dumpling slip in 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.630
 the first 30 seconds only and 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.459
 well you look good it was change the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.380
 pump everything changes its bridges and it's a 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.989
 trick that drove everyone crazy 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.880
 coaches I knew and romy side 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.739
 on a bench even when it's part 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.450
 from one of the raids one of the few things they 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.730
 are not assisted you noticed that 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.230
 you give them a whole show this shorts 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.700
 do it and everything is put in their place 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.680
 and he furniture for having seen 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.629
 dressing rooms pro to have lived in the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.760
 cloakroom you care about you guys 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.260
 it slips to engine warming up is 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.730
 the guy that the guy wants to play the mold and 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.319
 year is the big thing you play and and 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.730
 you want your mates worldwide 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.440
 for no sinks it does not exist anymore 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.069
 a villain is no longer permissive anymore 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.840
 no football to take the Senate is 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.970
 than any more except that the mussels and 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.930
 kourou the longest it is that exists and 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.580
 so they want to play with their father 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.590
 usual you say it's a little 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.790
 Huawei thing but it goes it goes it 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.260
 obviously goes after three 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.879
 slip is an error that causes a 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.390
 purpose and all that is furious madness on 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.890
 the bench 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.420
 except that one of the few things one of the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.310
 rare spaces that are still evolving 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.270
 players who still devolve to the players 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.380
 ie the choice of pumps that is 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.910
 still effectively the choice of your 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.640
 material of his work tool 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.410
 that's actually hurting him and that 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.090
 it's the absolute scandal actually 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.550
 sometimes to haircuts and that's 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.440
 true that deschamps had it on there 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.290
 had enough to be furious but it's 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.580
 no wonder make sure that stuff 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.260
 higher level so it can happen 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.700
 you can make a mistake so you can 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.590
 to have a difference between the moment when 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.160
 warming up this fact and the moment the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.989
 match begins 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.069
 maybe but it's true that this is 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.069
 a pretty important point
