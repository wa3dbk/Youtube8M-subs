not<00:00:52.800> ripped<00:00:53.129> up<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.420> there<00:00:54.840> that's

not ripped up here it is there that's

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.170 
not ripped up here it is there that's
the<00:00:55.530> straight<00:00:55.770> one<00:00:55.949> if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.520> look<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.910> one

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the straight one if you look at this one

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.119 
the straight one if you look at this one
this<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.600> has<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.989> straight<00:00:58.350> corner<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:58.920> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
this one has a straight corner here a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.520 
this one has a straight corner here a
straight<00:00:59.699> corner<00:01:00.059> there<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
straight corner there the one in the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.690 
straight corner there the one in the
middle<00:01:02.449> always<00:01:03.449> has<00:01:03.780> rips<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.619> all<00:01:05.250> four<00:01:05.670> sides

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
middle always has rips on all four sides

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
middle always has rips on all four sides
of<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> one<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> middle

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
of it because it's the one in the middle

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.140 
of it because it's the one in the middle
so<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.130> gets<00:01:08.580> ripped<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.210> each<00:01:09.900> side<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> all

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
so it gets ripped on each side so all

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.440 
so it gets ripped on each side so all
you<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.689> do<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:13.350> they're<00:01:13.560> turned<00:01:13.799> over

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
you have to do when they're turned over

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.530 
you have to do when they're turned over
is<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:16.200> look<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.250> piece<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.180> ripped

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
is you look for the piece that is ripped

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.560 
is you look for the piece that is ripped
on<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.380> sides<00:01:20.210> let's<00:01:21.210> take<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.509> one

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
on all the sides let's take this one

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.899 
on all the sides let's take this one
that<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.040> still<00:01:23.280> straight<00:01:23.610> on

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
that one I can see is still straight on

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.510 
that one I can see is still straight on
this<00:01:24.330> side<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.799> know<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.159> wasn't<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
this side so I know that wasn't the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 
this side so I know that wasn't the
middle<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:27.229> either<00:01:28.229> when<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:28.650> mix<00:01:28.920> them<00:01:29.159> all

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
middle one either when they mix them all

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.020 
middle one either when they mix them all
up<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.329> someone<00:01:30.600> mix<00:01:30.930> them<00:01:31.110> up<00:01:31.759> all<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
do is break them out you don't have to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.440 
do is break them out you don't have to
put<00:01:34.770> them<00:01:34.950> back<00:01:35.100> neatly<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:36.060> spread<00:01:36.329> them

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
maybe I can feel the letter or maybe I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.230 
maybe I can feel the letter or maybe I
can<00:01:49.350> sense<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.890> but<00:01:50.190> really<00:01:50.460> all<00:01:50.490> i<00:01:50.670> did<00:01:51.000> was<00:01:51.030> i

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
can sense it but really all i did was i

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.460 
can sense it but really all i did was i
noticed<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.690> that<00:01:51.870> wasn't<00:01:52.080> one<00:01:52.260> with<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
noticed that that wasn't one with the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.500 
noticed that that wasn't one with the
rips<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.890> all<00:01:52.979> four<00:01:53.190> sides<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.150> that's

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
rips on all four sides so I know that's

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.910 
rips on all four sides so I know that's
that<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.020> know<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.800> with<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that I know that's the one with the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.740 
that I know that's the one with the
letter<00:01:56.160> once<00:01:56.790> again<00:01:56.880> I'm<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.180> goofing<00:01:57.570> off<00:01:57.690> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
letter once again I'm just goofing off a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
letter once again I'm just goofing off a
little<00:01:58.020> bit<00:01:58.170> let's<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:58.950> sense<00:01:59.400> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
little bit let's see if I can sense the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.620 
little bit let's see if I can sense the
letter<00:01:59.940> I'll<00:02:00.210> bet<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.260> is<00:02:01.530> no<00:02:01.910> up<00:02:02.910> that<00:02:03.390> one

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
letter I'll bet you it is no up that one

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.390 
letter I'll bet you it is no up that one
I'll<00:02:03.840> bet<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.260> that's<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.070> turn<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
I'll bet you that's it and I turn it

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.240 
I'll bet you that's it and I turn it
over<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.610> say<00:02:05.820> yep<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.150> found<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.100> with

over and say yep I found the one with

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.180 
over and say yep I found the one with
the<00:02:08.280> load<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.929> that's<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.740> have<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.009> do

put<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> middle<00:02:33.750> remember<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.860> odd<00:02:35.100> one

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
put in the middle remember the odd one

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.190 
put in the middle remember the odd one
out<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.820> one<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.150> doesn't<00:02:36.360> belong<00:02:36.840> is

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
out the one that doesn't belong is

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.680 
out the one that doesn't belong is
always<00:02:37.890> put<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> middle<00:02:38.700> some<00:02:39.600> other

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
always put in the middle some other

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.330 
always put in the middle some other
clever<00:02:39.989> ways<00:02:40.230> maybe<00:02:40.440> juice<00:02:40.739> fruits<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
clever ways maybe juice fruits and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.490 
clever ways maybe juice fruits and
vegetables<00:02:41.880> maybe<00:02:42.540> use<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> bunch<00:02:43.050> of<00:02:43.200> fruits

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
vegetables maybe use a bunch of fruits

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.080 
vegetables maybe use a bunch of fruits
and<00:02:43.709> then<00:02:43.920> maybe<00:02:44.130> saying<00:02:44.489> one<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.790> them<00:02:44.910> is

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
and then maybe saying one of them is

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.479 
and then maybe saying one of them is
broccoli<00:02:46.019> broccoli<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:47.040> right<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
broccoli broccoli you right in the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.160 
broccoli broccoli you right in the
middle<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.940> that's<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.750> one<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.019> you're

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
middle and that's the one that you're

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.410 
middle and that's the one that you're
going<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.350> find<00:02:49.560> all<00:02:50.400> we<00:02:50.700> go<00:02:50.880> for<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.180> piece

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
going to find all we go for the piece

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.000 
going to find all we go for the piece
that<00:02:51.690> has<00:02:52.580> jagged<00:02:53.580> edges<00:02:54.290> all<00:02:55.290> or<00:02:55.650> ripped

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
that has jagged edges all or ripped

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.880 
that has jagged edges all or ripped
edges<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:56.640> all<00:02:56.910> four<00:02:57.390> sides<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:58.140> that's<00:02:58.739> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
edges on all four sides and that's the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.130 
edges on all four sides and that's the
easiest<00:02:59.280> way<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.580> find<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.000> also<00:03:00.720> when<00:03:00.989> you're

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
easiest way to find it also when you're

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.990 
easiest way to find it also when you're
ripping<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> paper<00:03:01.890> up<00:03:02.190> one's<00:03:02.790> going<00:03:02.970> to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
