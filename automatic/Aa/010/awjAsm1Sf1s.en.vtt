00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
anything we could do is anything we

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.980 
anything we could do is anything we
could<00:01:17.700> work<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.509> he<00:01:18.570> told<00:01:18.720> us<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> only

recovering<00:02:34.340> at<00:02:34.400> all<00:02:34.519> I<00:02:34.640> just<00:02:34.819> played<00:02:34.970> at<00:02:35.090> the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
recovering at all I just played at the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.910 
recovering at all I just played at the
matches<00:02:35.480> like<00:02:35.599> I<00:02:35.689> was<00:02:35.780> supposed<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.170> because

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
matches like I was supposed to because

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.990 
matches like I was supposed to because
at<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.129> end<00:02:37.159> of<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.400> day<00:02:37.519> there<00:02:37.670> isn't<00:02:37.909> any

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
at the end of the day there isn't any

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.819 
at the end of the day there isn't any
proof<00:02:38.269> of<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.540> but<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:39.019> don't<00:02:39.409> think<00:02:39.680> that's

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
proof of it but I don't think that's

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.319 
proof of it but I don't think that's
right<00:02:40.129> because<00:02:40.489> it's<00:02:40.640> not<00:02:40.790> it's<00:02:40.970> just<00:02:41.120> it's

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
right because it's not it's just it's

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.089 
right because it's not it's just it's
just<00:02:41.510> more<00:02:41.689> like<00:02:41.959> just<00:02:42.349> lies<00:02:42.560> on<00:02:42.739> top<00:02:42.769> of<00:02:42.920> lies

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
just more like just lies on top of lies

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.979 
just more like just lies on top of lies
and<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.489> felt<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:43.940> should<00:02:44.180> have<00:02:44.480> been<00:02:44.629> you<00:02:44.900> know

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
and I felt I should have been you know

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.270 
and I felt I should have been you know
honest<00:02:45.290> about<00:02:45.409> it<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.709> should<00:02:45.859> have<00:02:45.889> told<00:02:46.159> the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
honest about it I should have told the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.830 
honest about it I should have told the
truth<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:46.730> yeah<00:02:46.879> I<00:02:47.150> could<00:02:47.510> have<00:02:47.629> told<00:02:47.750> the

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
truth and yeah I could have told the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.240 
truth and yeah I could have told the
truth<00:02:48.019> before<00:02:48.349> it<00:02:48.409> happened<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.859> did<00:02:49.040> do<00:02:49.129> it

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
truth before it happened I did do it

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.610 
truth before it happened I did do it
after<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.670> fact<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.269> penalty<00:02:50.659> was<00:02:51.379> I

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
after the fact that the penalty was I

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.589 
after the fact that the penalty was I
inflicted<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.430> we<00:02:52.670> were<00:02:52.940> fortunate<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.510> the

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
inflicted that we were fortunate in the

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.640 
inflicted that we were fortunate in the
two<00:02:53.720> matches<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.109> not<00:02:54.290> going<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.560> the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
two matches and not going to the

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.319 
two matches and not going to the
playoffs<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.069> I<00:02:55.129> thought<00:02:55.430> now<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.090> was<00:02:56.209> just

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
playoffs so I thought now I was just

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.610 
playoffs so I thought now I was just
going<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.480> be<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.629> penalty<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.989> was<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.349> but

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
going to be the penalty that was it but

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.020 
going to be the penalty that was it but
I<00:02:57.799> felt<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.370> needed<00:02:58.579> to<00:02:58.639> come<00:02:58.790> clean<00:02:59.000> and

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
I felt like I needed to come clean and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.610 
I felt like I needed to come clean and
tell<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.359> truth<00:02:59.599> I<00:02:59.780> signed<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.079> Skype<00:03:00.290> call<00:03:00.439> for

me<00:03:06.109> to<00:03:06.170> email<00:03:06.290> Jon<00:03:06.590> Nelson<00:03:06.739> about<00:03:07.129> the

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
me to email Jon Nelson about the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.309 
me to email Jon Nelson about the
situation<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.790> did<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.239> then<00:03:08.810> on<00:03:08.959> two<00:03:09.139> weeks

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
situation I did and then on two weeks

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.720 
situation I did and then on two weeks
went<00:03:09.530> by<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.680> nothing<00:03:10.040> happened<00:03:10.370> I<00:03:10.430> figured

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
went by and nothing happened I figured

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.309 
went by and nothing happened I figured
that<00:03:11.569> was<00:03:11.689> going<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.870> be<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.019> rest<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.260> the

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
that was going to be the rest of the

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.470 
that was going to be the rest of the
penalty<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.889> was<00:03:13.579> it<00:03:13.819> I<00:03:13.849> figured<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.389> was

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
penalty that was it I figured it was

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.349 
penalty that was it I figured it was
justified<00:03:15.019> we<00:03:15.290> cheated<00:03:15.889> we<00:03:16.609> got<00:03:16.760> caught<00:03:17.000> we

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
justified we cheated we got caught we

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.610 
justified we cheated we got caught we
forfeit<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.870> matches<00:03:18.199> we<00:03:18.349> didn't<00:03:18.530> go<00:03:18.590> to

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
forfeit in the matches we didn't go to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.740 
forfeit in the matches we didn't go to

a scumbag about it and I wouldn't even

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.200 
a scumbag about it and I wouldn't even
be<00:05:25.100> making<00:05:25.250> this<00:05:25.400> video<00:05:25.550> in<00:05:25.730> the<00:05:25.820> first<00:05:25.910> place

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
be making this video in the first place

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.880 
be making this video in the first place
but<00:05:26.450> I<00:05:26.660> tried<00:05:27.110> to<00:05:27.200> tell<00:05:27.380> the<00:05:27.470> truth<00:05:27.680> but<00:05:27.830> that
