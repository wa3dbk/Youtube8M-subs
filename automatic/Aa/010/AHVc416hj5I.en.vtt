00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
chapter definitely some good progression

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.180 
chapter definitely some good progression
first<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.929> all<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.349> was<00:00:13.590> diving<00:00:13.799> into<00:00:14.160> some

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
first of all it was diving into some

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.770 
first of all it was diving into some
stuff<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.700> felt<00:00:14.940> needed<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.299> be<00:00:15.389> addressed

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
stuff that I felt needed to be addressed

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.570 
stuff that I felt needed to be addressed
as<00:00:15.900> far<00:00:16.080> as<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:16.289> okay<00:00:16.410> let's<00:00:17.039> test<00:00:17.250> him<00:00:17.490> out

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
as far as like okay let's test him out

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.700 
as far as like okay let's test him out
as<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> Titan<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.480> he<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.960> can't<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
as a Titan what he can and can't do and

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.950 
as a Titan what he can and can't do and
it<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.279> showed<00:00:20.460> okay<00:00:20.760> his<00:00:21.119> limits<00:00:21.720> pretty

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
it just showed okay his limits pretty

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.529 
it just showed okay his limits pretty
much<00:00:22.109> as<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.650> guess<00:00:23.189> for<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.519> most<00:00:23.640> part<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.119> lot

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
much as I guess for the most part a lot

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.540 
much as I guess for the most part a lot
of<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.840> Titan<00:00:25.470> transformation<00:00:26.039> really<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
of the Titan transformation really is

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.370 
of the Titan transformation really is
embedded<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.240> emotions<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.109> stuff<00:00:28.260> because

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
embedded in emotions and stuff because

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.470 
embedded in emotions and stuff because
it<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.740> shown<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.279> chapter<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
it was shown in this chapter that the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.910 
it was shown in this chapter that the
moment<00:00:30.810> he<00:00:30.869> started<00:00:31.170> thinking<00:00:31.260> about<00:00:31.500> his<00:00:31.710> dad

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
moment he started thinking about his dad

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.979 
moment he started thinking about his dad
and<00:00:32.250> something<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.120> pretty<00:00:33.360> much<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.719> went<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and something it pretty much all went to

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.209 
and something it pretty much all went to
hell<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.350> after<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.710> every<00:00:34.950> time<00:00:34.980> he

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
hell and after that every time he

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.130 
hell and after that every time he
transform<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.940> got<00:00:36.149> worse<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.690> worse<00:00:36.750> because

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
transform it got worse and worse because

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.590 
transform it got worse and worse because
he<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.500> emotionally<00:00:38.460> frustrated<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.420> he

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
he was emotionally frustrated and he

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.180 
he was emotionally frustrated and he
just<00:00:39.750> couldn't<00:00:40.050> deal<00:00:40.170> with<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.500> anymore<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.040> he

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
just couldn't deal with it anymore so he

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.709 
just couldn't deal with it anymore so he
left<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.790> really<00:00:42.120> displayed<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
left and it's really displayed in the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.510 
left and it's really displayed in the
past<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.140> well<00:00:43.170> when<00:00:43.500> he<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.620> daydreaming

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
past as well when he was daydreaming

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.010 
past as well when he was daydreaming
about<00:00:44.730> leaving<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.149> walls<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.899> know

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
about leaving the walls and you know

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.630 
about leaving the walls and you know
just<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.350> lot<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.739> these<00:00:46.920> different<00:00:47.280> things<00:00:47.489> is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
just a lot of these different things is

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.490 
just a lot of these different things is
definitely<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.329> lot<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.930> do<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.379> guess

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
definitely a lot to do with I guess

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.160 
definitely a lot to do with I guess
emotions<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.219> possibly<00:00:50.579> memories<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.750> well

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
emotions and possibly memories as well

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.479 
emotions and possibly memories as well
with<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.530> chapter<00:00:52.890> really<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
with this chapter really just kind of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.910 
with this chapter really just kind of
slightly<00:00:53.850> suggests<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.410> big<00:00:55.649> thing<00:00:55.829> in

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
slightly suggests that now big thing in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
slightly suggests that now big thing in
this<00:00:56.039> chapter<00:00:56.250> first<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.030> when<00:00:57.449> Aaron

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
this chapter first of all is when Aaron

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.479 
this chapter first of all is when Aaron
is<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.050> Titan<00:00:58.410> form<00:00:58.680> he<00:00:58.890> pretty<00:00:59.070> much<00:00:59.160> writes

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
is in Titan form he pretty much writes

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.069 
is in Titan form he pretty much writes
something<00:00:59.699> along<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> lines<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.930> got

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
something along the lines of and I got

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.450 
something along the lines of and I got
by<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> way<00:01:01.410> two<00:01:01.469> different<00:01:01.920> translations

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
by the way two different translations

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.830 
by the way two different translations
for<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.270> not<00:01:03.329> really<00:01:03.570> sure

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
for this one so I'm not really sure

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.719 
for this one so I'm not really sure
which<00:01:04.019> one<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.409> believe<00:01:05.100> pretty<00:01:05.309> much<00:01:05.489> but

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
which one to believe pretty much but

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.960 
which one to believe pretty much but
with<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.240> translation<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.930> got<00:01:07.110> dad<00:01:07.439> he<00:01:08.070> did<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
with one translation I got dad he did to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.060 
with one translation I got dad he did to
me<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.720> another<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.500> pretty

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
me and then another one it was pretty

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.700 
me and then another one it was pretty
much<00:01:11.189> suggesting<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.180> did<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.500> or

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
much suggesting like I did it to that or

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.590 
much suggesting like I did it to that or
something<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.360> exactly

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
something like that so I'm not exactly

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.120 
something like that so I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:15.780> which<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.409> actually<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> legit

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
sure which one was actually the legit

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.859 
sure which one was actually the legit
one<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.759> nonetheless<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.390> definitely<00:01:18.720> has

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
one but nonetheless this definitely has

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.440 
one but nonetheless this definitely has
to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.830> fact<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.210> Aaron's<00:01:21.210> father

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
to do with the fact that Aaron's father

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.450 
to do with the fact that Aaron's father
where<00:01:21.840> he<00:01:22.020> might<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.259> he<00:01:22.650> probably<00:01:22.920> could<00:01:23.340> be

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
where he might be he probably could be

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.820 
where he might be he probably could be
good<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.119> suggesting<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.960> Aaron

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
good if it's suggesting that Aaron

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.440 
good if it's suggesting that Aaron
possibly<00:01:26.280> killed<00:01:26.490> his<00:01:26.640> father<00:01:26.850> then<00:01:27.119> that's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
possibly killed his father then that's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.819 
possibly killed his father then that's
what<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.080> honestly<00:01:28.200> wouldn't<00:01:28.680> be

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
what it is but I honestly wouldn't be

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.350 
what it is but I honestly wouldn't be
surprised<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:29.549> wherever<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
surprised if that's wherever that is

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.030 
surprised if that's wherever that is
he's<00:01:30.570> dead<00:01:30.840> Aaron<00:01:31.170> killed<00:01:31.380> his<00:01:31.590> own<00:01:31.710> father

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
he's dead Aaron killed his own father

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.830 
he's dead Aaron killed his own father
and<00:01:32.280> that's<00:01:32.610> probably<00:01:33.119> why<00:01:33.329> he<00:01:33.540> went<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and that's probably why he went and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.090 
and that's probably why he went and
saying<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> had<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.439> leave<00:01:34.560> because<00:01:34.710> his

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
saying it had to leave because his

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.679 
saying it had to leave because his
emotion<00:01:35.610> was<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.119> know<00:01:36.150> fuck<00:01:36.509> like

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
emotion was just like you know fuck like

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.969 
emotion was just like you know fuck like
oh<00:01:36.780> my<00:01:36.930> god<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> killed<00:01:37.229> my<00:01:37.470> own<00:01:37.590> dad

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
oh my god I killed my own dad

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.770 
oh my god I killed my own dad
so<00:01:38.250> that's<00:01:38.579> possible<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> was

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so that's possible what it was

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.240 
so that's possible what it was
suggesting<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.320> also<00:01:40.470> could<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:40.770> suggesting

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
suggesting it also could be suggesting

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.219 
suggesting it also could be suggesting
that<00:01:41.369> he<00:01:41.729> was<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.150> getting<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.930> flashbacks

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that he was just getting more flashbacks

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.109 
that he was just getting more flashbacks
again<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.770> his<00:01:43.920> father<00:01:44.280> holding<00:01:44.640> him<00:01:44.759> down<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
again of his father holding him down and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.910 
again of his father holding him down and
injecting<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> syringe<00:01:46.229> into<00:01:46.500> him<00:01:46.649> another

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
injecting the syringe into him another

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.620 
injecting the syringe into him another

again dealing with memories because a
lot<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.290> chapter<00:01:58.500> really<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:59.070> felt

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
lot of this chapter really just felt

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.490 
lot of this chapter really just felt
like<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.490> lot<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.060> memories<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:00.869> into<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
like a lot of memories was like into it

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.050 
like a lot of memories was like into it
and<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.860> even<00:02:02.100> look<00:02:02.340> at<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.490> was<00:02:02.670> almost<00:02:02.790> like

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and you even look at it was almost like

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.940 
and you even look at it was almost like
you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.689> symbolism<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:04.649> with

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you can see symbolism to it because with

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.560 
you can see symbolism to it because with
the<00:02:05.009> Erlin<00:02:05.340> stuff<00:02:05.549> as<00:02:05.670> well<00:02:05.850> him<00:02:06.210> thinking

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the Erlin stuff as well him thinking

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.999 
the Erlin stuff as well him thinking
back<00:02:06.810> with<00:02:07.110> memories<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.500> stuff<00:02:07.710> like<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
back with memories and stuff like that

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.680 
back with memories and stuff like that
but<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.550> into<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.149> was<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.300> okay

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
but going into this it was like okay

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020 
but going into this it was like okay
this<00:02:09.959> girl<00:02:10.289> looks<00:02:10.830> very<00:02:11.099> similar<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.550> Aaron

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
this girl looks very similar to Aaron

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.460 
this girl looks very similar to Aaron
now<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.930> possible

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
now it's a possible

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.290 
now it's a possible
that<00:02:13.770> maybe<00:02:13.980> even<00:02:14.610> has<00:02:14.790> some<00:02:15.000> sort<00:02:15.210> of

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
that maybe even has some sort of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.110 
that maybe even has some sort of
memories<00:02:16.110> from<00:02:16.560> maybe<00:02:16.740> his<00:02:16.980> mom's<00:02:17.310> youth<00:02:17.910> or

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
memories from maybe his mom's youth or

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.460 
memories from maybe his mom's youth or
something<00:02:18.420> along<00:02:18.600> lines<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.020> maybe<00:02:19.230> that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
something along lines that maybe that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.740 
something along lines that maybe that
what<00:02:19.890> he<00:02:20.040> was<00:02:20.130> remembering<00:02:20.640> was<00:02:21.060> possibly<00:02:21.540> not

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
what he was remembering was possibly not

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.940 
what he was remembering was possibly not
even<00:02:21.930> his<00:02:22.050> memories<00:02:22.380> at<00:02:22.500> all<00:02:22.530> maybe<00:02:22.800> though

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
even his memories at all maybe though

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.800 
even his memories at all maybe though
some<00:02:23.190> way<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.340> gristle<00:02:24.150> his<00:02:24.330> father<00:02:24.570> was

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
some way that gristle his father was

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.950 
some way that gristle his father was
able<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.080> transfer<00:02:25.890> some<00:02:26.450> back<00:02:27.450> memories<00:02:27.840> of

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
able to transfer some back memories of

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.480 
able to transfer some back memories of
his<00:02:28.200> mom<00:02:28.410> as<00:02:28.620> well<00:02:28.770> maybe<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.100> was<00:02:29.190> his<00:02:29.310> mom

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
his mom as well maybe that was his mom

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.220 
his mom as well maybe that was his mom
and<00:02:29.700> in<00:02:29.880> her<00:02:30.180> younger<00:02:30.420> days<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.870> maybe<00:02:30.960> this

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
and in her younger days and maybe this

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.500 
and in her younger days and maybe this
was<00:02:31.440> his<00:02:32.100> attempt<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.640> give<00:02:32.820> Erin<00:02:33.480> some

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
was his attempt to give Erin some

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.570 
was his attempt to give Erin some
knowledge<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.320> he<00:02:34.440> had<00:02:34.620> no<00:02:34.830> idea<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.400> how<00:02:35.520> to

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
knowledge that he had no idea of how to

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.160 
knowledge that he had no idea of how to
get<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.880> know<00:02:35.970> he<00:02:36.120> had<00:02:36.210> no<00:02:36.330> access<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.960> and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
get you know he had no access to and

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.050 
get you know he had no access to and
maybe<00:02:37.530> that's<00:02:37.830> why<00:02:37.980> he<00:02:38.100> slowly<00:02:38.430> remembering

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
maybe that's why he slowly remembering

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.790 
maybe that's why he slowly remembering
certain<00:02:39.180> things<00:02:39.510> because<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.440> looked<00:02:40.710> just

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
certain things because it looked just

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.650 
certain things because it looked just
like<00:02:41.070> Erin<00:02:41.550> but<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.790> was<00:02:41.880> like<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> female<00:02:42.270> and

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
like Erin but it was like a female and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.270 
like Erin but it was like a female and
his<00:02:42.900> mother<00:02:43.140> looks<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.530> him<00:02:43.740> maybe<00:02:44.010> with

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
his mother looks like him maybe with

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.220 
his mother looks like him maybe with
whatever<00:02:44.610> his<00:02:44.760> father<00:02:45.030> injected<00:02:45.660> into<00:02:45.930> him<00:02:46.080> it

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
whatever his father injected into him it

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.470 
whatever his father injected into him it
also<00:02:46.560> contained<00:02:47.160> not<00:02:47.370> only<00:02:47.430> DNA<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.030> possibly

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
also contained not only DNA but possibly

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.630 
also contained not only DNA but possibly
the<00:02:48.570> memories<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.200> something<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.340> they<00:02:50.490> had

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the memories of something that they had

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.490 
the memories of something that they had
foreseen<00:02:51.060> or<00:02:51.420> something<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.840> they<00:02:51.959> had<00:02:52.080> seen

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
foreseen or something that they had seen

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.080 
foreseen or something that they had seen
in<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.680> past<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.130> lot<00:02:53.250> definitely<00:02:53.760> could<00:02:53.910> do

isn't<00:05:30.230> able<00:05:30.350> to<00:05:30.650> do<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:30.950> hardening<00:05:31.370> effect

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
isn't able to do the hardening effect

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.160 
isn't able to do the hardening effect
what<00:05:32.090> I'd<00:05:32.210> imagine<00:05:32.660> would<00:05:32.780> be<00:05:32.870> a<00:05:32.900> better

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
what I'd imagine would be a better

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.560 
what I'd imagine would be a better
strategy<00:05:33.560> to<00:05:33.860> take<00:05:34.190> out<00:05:34.610> wall<00:05:34.940> Maria<00:05:35.090> if<00:05:35.420> he

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
strategy to take out wall Maria if he

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.170 
strategy to take out wall Maria if he
can't<00:05:35.870> do<00:05:36.110> it<00:05:36.290> necessarily<00:05:36.440> is<00:05:37.070> just<00:05:37.730> possibly

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
can't do it necessarily is just possibly

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.450 
can't do it necessarily is just possibly
he<00:05:38.360> could<00:05:38.390> use<00:05:38.750> that<00:05:39.110> ability<00:05:39.230> of<00:05:39.770> being<00:05:40.310> able

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
he could use that ability of being able

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.770 
he could use that ability of being able
to<00:05:40.610> control<00:05:40.820> times<00:05:41.180> because<00:05:41.480> if<00:05:41.570> he<00:05:41.630> can

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
to control times because if he can

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.510 
to control times because if he can
control<00:05:42.050> the<00:05:42.170> Titans<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.800> all<00:05:42.890> he<00:05:43.010> has<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.160> do

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
control the Titans and all he has to do

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.000 
control the Titans and all he has to do
is<00:05:43.730> pretty<00:05:44.090> much<00:05:44.270> control<00:05:44.960> them<00:05:45.200> put<00:05:45.710> them<00:05:45.860> at

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
is pretty much control them put them at

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.620 
is pretty much control them put them at
bay<00:05:46.220> whatever<00:05:46.640> the<00:05:46.760> case<00:05:46.910> may<00:05:47.060> be<00:05:47.090> send<00:05:47.480> them

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
bay whatever the case may be send them

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.270 
bay whatever the case may be send them
off<00:05:47.750> to<00:05:47.780> do<00:05:48.050> whatever<00:05:48.230> I<00:05:48.440> don't<00:05:48.620> know<00:05:48.710> go<00:05:48.890> eat

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
off to do whatever I don't know go eat

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.910 
off to do whatever I don't know go eat
some<00:05:49.580> fish<00:05:50.090> out<00:05:50.240> to<00:05:50.420> sea<00:05:50.900> or<00:05:51.020> some<00:05:51.230> shit<00:05:51.470> send

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
some fish out to sea or some shit send

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.680 
some fish out to sea or some shit send
them<00:05:52.040> off<00:05:52.220> and<00:05:52.430> then<00:05:52.820> go<00:05:53.000> and<00:05:53.120> plug<00:05:53.420> up<00:05:53.570> the

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
them off and then go and plug up the

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.120 
them off and then go and plug up the
whole<00:05:53.840> one<00:05:54.020> another<00:05:54.260> Boulder<00:05:54.620> like<00:05:54.770> they<00:05:54.890> did

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
whole one another Boulder like they did

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.220 
whole one another Boulder like they did
and<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.550> other<00:05:55.670> wall<00:05:55.970> so<00:05:56.210> like<00:05:56.750> that's<00:05:57.110> a

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
and the other wall so like that's a

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.780 
and the other wall so like that's a
possibility<00:05:57.920> that<00:05:57.950> they<00:05:58.160> could<00:05:58.190> use<00:05:58.460> instead

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
possibility that they could use instead

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.640 
possibility that they could use instead
of<00:05:58.910> trying<00:05:59.120> to<00:05:59.150> use<00:05:59.210> the<00:05:59.390> hardening<00:05:59.960> ability

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
of trying to use the hardening ability

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.960 
of trying to use the hardening ability
I'm<00:06:00.920> just<00:06:01.160> saying<00:06:01.430> and<00:06:01.550> the<00:06:01.640> other<00:06:01.790> the

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
I'm just saying and the other the

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.040 
I'm just saying and the other the
chapter<00:06:02.300> I'm<00:06:02.360> not<00:06:02.510> gonna<00:06:02.660> lie<00:06:02.750> got<00:06:02.930> me<00:06:03.020> a

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
chapter I'm not gonna lie got me a

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.480 
chapter I'm not gonna lie got me a
little<00:06:03.290> bit<00:06:03.410> height<00:06:03.590> because<00:06:03.860> you<00:06:03.950> see<00:06:04.130> Levi

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
little bit height because you see Levi

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.620 
little bit height because you see Levi
in<00:06:04.610> them<00:06:04.790> and<00:06:04.940> what<00:06:05.060> I<00:06:05.090> imagine<00:06:05.510> they're

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
in them and what I imagine they're

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.180 
in them and what I imagine they're
trying<00:06:05.840> to<00:06:05.870> do<00:06:06.020> is<00:06:06.140> pretty<00:06:06.350> much<00:06:06.440> now<00:06:06.980> that

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
trying to do is pretty much now that

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.230 
trying to do is pretty much now that
they<00:06:07.310> got<00:06:07.460> the<00:06:07.640> capture<00:06:08.000> they're<00:06:08.150> gonna

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
they got the capture they're gonna

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.850 
they got the capture they're gonna
probably<00:06:08.480> go<00:06:08.750> in<00:06:08.900> there<00:06:09.050> grab<00:06:09.200> those<00:06:09.440> guys<00:06:09.500> and

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
probably go in there grab those guys and

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.960 
probably go in there grab those guys and
say<00:06:09.920> you<00:06:10.040> know<00:06:10.130> what<00:06:10.280> the<00:06:10.370> fuck<00:06:10.550> it<00:06:10.670> is<00:06:10.790> that

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
say you know what the fuck it is that

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.430

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
progression we weren't staying still

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.470 
progression we weren't staying still
this<00:06:16.100> time<00:06:16.310> we<00:06:16.400> actually<00:06:16.520> move<00:06:16.910> forward<00:06:17.330> and

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
this time we actually move forward and

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.090 
this time we actually move forward and
