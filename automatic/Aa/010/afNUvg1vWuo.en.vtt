not<00:02:28.590> getting<00:02:28.770> hit<00:02:29.040> Aires<00:02:29.460> hopefully<00:02:30.030> they<00:02:30.240> do

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
not getting hit Aires hopefully they do

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.360 
not getting hit Aires hopefully they do
something<00:02:30.810> I'm<00:02:31.080> not<00:02:31.230> sure<00:02:31.290> if<00:02:31.620> they<00:02:31.800> will<00:02:32.130> do

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
something I'm not sure if they will do

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.030 
something I'm not sure if they will do
anything<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.570> two<00:02:33.870> devices<00:02:34.200> or<00:02:34.920> at

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
anything but I have two devices or at

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.700 
anything but I have two devices or at
least<00:02:35.220> three<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.050> none<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.080> them<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.560> go

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
least three and none of them can go

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.530 
least three and none of them can go
online<00:02:37.860> one<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.880> one<00:02:39.090> went<00:02:39.420> online

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
online one of this one went online

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.050 
online one of this one went online
before<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:40.890> now<00:02:41.130> one<00:02:41.490> offline<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
before and then now one offline the

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.290 
before and then now one offline the
other<00:02:42.180> one<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:43.500> never<00:02:44.070> went<00:02:44.310> online<00:02:44.490> so<00:02:45.270> I

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
other one it never went online so I

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.630 
other one it never went online so I
don't<00:02:45.930> really<00:02:46.080> know<00:02:46.350> what's<00:02:46.560> happening<00:02:47.070> they

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
don't really know what's happening they

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.390 
don't really know what's happening they
should<00:02:47.910> probably<00:02:48.420> fix<00:02:48.990> this<00:02:49.260> let<00:02:49.650> me<00:02:49.830> know<00:02:50.040> if

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
should probably fix this let me know if

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.330 
should probably fix this let me know if
you<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:51.570> have<00:02:51.690> any<00:02:51.840> idea<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.320> how<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.800> fix<00:02:53.100> this

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
you you have any idea on how to fix this

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.200 
you you have any idea on how to fix this
because<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:54.480> just<00:02:54.720> doesn't<00:02:55.110> work<00:02:55.500> for<00:02:55.560> me<00:02:55.830> and

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
because it just doesn't work for me and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.180 
because it just doesn't work for me and
again<00:02:57.210> you<00:02:57.900> could<00:02:58.050> try<00:02:58.380> if<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:58.860> your<00:02:59.010> first

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
again you could try if it's your first

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.230 
again you could try if it's your first
time<00:02:59.670> doing<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.930> because<00:03:01.200> what<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.620> saw

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
time doing it because what I saw

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.270 
time doing it because what I saw
remember<00:03:03.240> is<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.900> first<00:03:04.170> time<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.470> deleted<00:03:04.950> it

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
remember is the first time I deleted it

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.610 
remember is the first time I deleted it
it<00:03:05.580> worked<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.140> delete<00:03:07.440> your

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
it worked so you have to delete your

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.880 
it worked so you have to delete your
game<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.310> then<00:03:09.090> what<00:03:09.780> happens<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.470> what<00:03:10.800> you

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
game and then what happens is what you

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.150 
game and then what happens is what you
do<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.730> fight<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.570> enemy<00:03:13.020> up<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.590> level

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
do is you fight the enemy up to level

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.150 
do is you fight the enemy up to level
five<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.760> then<00:03:15.120> go<00:03:15.960> online<00:03:16.110> and<00:03:16.620> then<00:03:16.830> login

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
five and then go online and then login

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.960 
five and then go online and then login
or<00:03:17.730> restore<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:19.140> worked<00:03:19.710> but<00:03:20.400> now<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.760> doesn't

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
or restore it worked but now it doesn't

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.870 
or restore it worked but now it doesn't
work<00:03:21.330> so<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.290> don't<00:03:22.740> know<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.640> just<00:03:24.060> absurd

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
work so I don't know it's just absurd

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.110 
work so I don't know it's just absurd
maybe<00:03:26.880> there's<00:03:27.180> something<00:03:27.420> else<00:03:27.720> but<00:03:28.350> I

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
maybe there's something else but I

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.140 
maybe there's something else but I
probably<00:03:30.120> won't<00:03:30.600> get<00:03:31.590> areas<00:03:32.520> so<00:03:32.760> I'm<00:03:32.910> really

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
probably won't get areas so I'm really

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.540 
probably won't get areas so I'm really
disappointed<00:03:33.330> in<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.650> but<00:03:35.250> here's

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550
