came out the first thing you're going to
notice<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:22.340> suspect<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.830> it<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.610> is

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
notice I suspect is that it it is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.450 
notice I suspect is that it it is
darkened<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:32.369> reason<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.990> I

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
darkened the reason for that is that I I

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.539 
darkened the reason for that is that I I
put<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> oven<00:01:36.000> about<00:01:36.450> 325<00:01:37.290> degrees

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
put it in the oven about 325 degrees

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.950 
put it in the oven about 325 degrees
just<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> dry<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.939> out<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.180> wanted<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> put<00:01:39.840> this

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
just to dry it out I wanted to put this

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.700 
just to dry it out I wanted to put this
lasso<00:01:40.530> piece<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:43.290> wanted<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
lasso piece on here and I wanted the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.530 
lasso piece on here and I wanted the
rest<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.430> dry<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> didn't<00:01:45.270> mess<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
rest of it to be dry so I didn't mess it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.600 
rest of it to be dry so I didn't mess it
up<00:01:45.659> put<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> oven<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:47.220> went<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.520> took

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
up put it in the oven then went and took

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.530 
up put it in the oven then went and took
a<00:01:47.670> nap<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.450> darkened<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.360> would

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
a nap and it darkened but so I would

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.859 
a nap and it darkened but so I would
suggest<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.079> don't<00:01:52.290> do<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:54.210> 325

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
suggest that you don't do that the 325

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.660 
suggest that you don't do that the 325
seemed<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.380> okay<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.310> leave<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
seemed to be okay but if you do leave it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.800 
seemed to be okay but if you do leave it
too<00:01:56.820> long<00:01:57.000> give

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
too long give

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.010 
too long give

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
bit smelly in the kitchen but it did

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.660 
bit smelly in the kitchen but it did
make<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.320> easier<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> think<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:02.369> some<00:02:02.579> of

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
make it easier I think to see some of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.279 
make it easier I think to see some of
these<00:02:02.759> details<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.860> see<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.460> think<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
these details you can see I think that

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.680 
these details you can see I think that
we've<00:02:07.289> got<00:02:07.409> some<00:02:07.649> really<00:02:08.489> nice<00:02:08.929> feathers<00:02:09.929> here

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
we've got some really nice feathers here

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.890 
we've got some really nice feathers here
the<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.870> eyeball<00:02:16.470> was<00:02:17.099> just<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.599> rolled

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
the the eyeball was just a I just rolled

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.660 
the the eyeball was just a I just rolled
up<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.319> piece<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:20.010> air<00:02:20.849> dry<00:02:21.120> clay<00:02:21.180> and

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
up a piece of the air dry clay and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.449 
up a piece of the air dry clay and
brushed<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.880> some<00:02:24.239> of<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.540> water<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.459> Elmer's

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
brushed on some of the water and Elmer's

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.670 
brushed on some of the water and Elmer's
glue<00:02:26.880> solution<00:02:27.599> onto<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.340> dried<00:02:30.290> head<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
glue solution onto the dried head and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.600 
glue solution onto the dried head and
then<00:02:32.340> just<00:02:32.370> put<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.450> little<00:02:33.690> ball<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.870> there

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
then just put that little ball on there

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.759 
then just put that little ball on there
you<00:02:35.610> can<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.989> can<00:02:38.269> sand<00:02:39.269> it<00:02:39.480> I've<00:02:40.260> been<00:02:40.500> using

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
you can you can sand it I've been using

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.120 
you can you can sand it I've been using
a<00:02:40.980> 100<00:02:41.549> grit<00:02:41.730> sandpaper<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.450> sand<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.950> can

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
a 100 grit sandpaper to sand it you can

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.880 
a 100 grit sandpaper to sand it you can
also<00:02:44.280> use<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:46.310> an<00:02:47.310> exacto<00:02:47.880> knife<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.299> carve<00:02:48.690> it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
also use a an exacto knife and carve it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
also use a an exacto knife and carve it
which<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.040> rather<00:02:50.220> nice<00:02:53.060> maybe<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.299> hold

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
which is rather nice maybe if I hold

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.240 
which is rather nice maybe if I hold
onto<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.930> cap<00:02:55.170> from<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.470> watch<00:02:55.769> you'll<00:02:56.069> shut

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
onto this cap from the watch you'll shut

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.809 
onto this cap from the watch you'll shut
up<00:02:56.280> so<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:56.580> can<00:02:56.959> explain<00:02:57.959> how<00:02:58.170> this<00:02:58.319> was<00:02:58.530> done

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
up so I can explain how this was done

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.949 
up so I can explain how this was done
the<00:03:00.080> like<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.200> said<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.489> inside<00:03:02.510> was<00:03:03.510> made<00:03:03.810> the

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the like I said the inside was made the

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.780 
the like I said the inside was made the
way<00:03:04.079> I<00:03:04.109> normally<00:03:04.260> do<00:03:04.799> with<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.070> pattern<00:03:05.489> that

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
way I normally do with a pattern that

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.020 
way I normally do with a pattern that
the<00:03:06.060> cardboard<00:03:06.480> pattern<00:03:07.370> crumpled<00:03:08.370> paper<00:03:08.579> but

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
the cardboard pattern crumpled paper but

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.289 
the cardboard pattern crumpled paper but
then<00:03:09.180> because<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> was<00:03:09.750> in<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.959> hurry<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:11.299> wanted

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
then because I was in a hurry I wanted

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.610 
then because I was in a hurry I wanted
to<00:03:12.390> get<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.319> detail<00:03:13.709> part<00:03:13.980> faster<00:03:15.620> yeah

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
to get to the detail part faster yeah

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.860 
to get to the detail part faster yeah
this<00:03:17.280> was<00:03:17.430> really<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:17.760> an<00:03:18.000> experiment<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.810> I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
this was really just an experiment and I

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.590 
this was really just an experiment and I
have<00:03:19.319> another<00:03:19.680> project<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.940> I'm<00:03:21.120> working<00:03:21.150> on

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
have another project that I'm working on

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.390 
have another project that I'm working on
that<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.900> really<00:03:22.650> thought<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:22.859> should<00:03:23.130> be<00:03:23.250> doing

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
that I really thought I should be doing

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.440 
that I really thought I should be doing
instead<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.510> playing<00:03:24.780> around<00:03:24.930> so

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
instead this is playing around so

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.240 
instead this is playing around so
instead<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.510> covering<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.620> crumpled<00:03:29.040> paper

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
instead of covering the crumpled paper

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.430 
instead of covering the crumpled paper
and<00:03:29.489> masking<00:03:29.850> tape<00:03:30.090> with<00:03:30.389> paper<00:03:30.750> mache<00:03:31.019> or

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
and masking tape with paper mache or

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.420 
and masking tape with paper mache or
with<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.950> clay<00:03:32.190> which<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.670> could<00:03:32.850> do<00:03:33.049> I

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
with the clay which you could do I

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.660 
with the clay which you could do I
covered<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.549> first<00:03:35.819> with<00:03:36.090> two<00:03:36.329> layers<00:03:36.540> of

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
covered it first with two layers of

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.970 
covered it first with two layers of
plaster<00:03:38.670> cloth<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.500> since<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.560> used<00:03:40.799> a

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
plaster cloth and since I used a

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.770 
plaster cloth and since I used a
medical-grade<00:03:41.459> plaster<00:03:42.090> cloth<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.359> dries

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
medical-grade plaster cloth that dries

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.199 
medical-grade plaster cloth that dries
within<00:03:43.230> maybe<00:03:44.040> three<00:03:44.459> or<00:03:44.489> four<00:03:44.730> minutes

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
within maybe three or four minutes

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.110 
within maybe three or four minutes
within<00:03:46.079> 10<00:03:46.590> minutes<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.190> can<00:03:47.310> go<00:03:47.459> ahead<00:03:47.790> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
within 10 minutes you can go ahead and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.470 
within 10 minutes you can go ahead and
cover<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.930> with<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.319> very<00:03:49.680> thin<00:03:50.370> almost<00:03:50.790> paper

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
cover this with a very thin almost paper

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.440 
cover this with a very thin almost paper
thin<00:03:51.690> layer<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:53.160> new<00:03:53.340> air<00:03:53.549> dry<00:03:53.760> clay<00:03:54.000> and

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
thin layer of the new air dry clay and

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.960 
thin layer of the new air dry clay and
when<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.410> dries<00:03:55.769> which<00:03:56.160> goes<00:03:56.400> really<00:03:56.670> fast

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
when that dries which goes really fast

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.059 
when that dries which goes really fast
obviously<00:03:57.389> just<00:03:57.930> stick<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.650> over<00:03:58.769> in<00:03:59.040> a

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
obviously just stick it over in a

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.270 
obviously just stick it over in a
furnace<00:04:00.030> vent<00:04:00.090> or<00:04:00.569> put<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.290> fan<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.620> front<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.130> it

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
furnace vent or put a fan in front of it

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.670 
furnace vent or put a fan in front of it
or<00:04:02.459> even<00:04:02.670> just<00:04:02.819> just<00:04:03.690> air<00:04:03.870> dry<00:04:04.079> it<00:04:04.139> normally

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
or even just just air dry it normally

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.979 
or even just just air dry it normally
and<00:04:04.889> it<00:04:05.010> dries<00:04:05.250> really<00:04:05.549> quickly

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
and it dries really quickly

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.520 
and it dries really quickly
and<00:04:07.319> it<00:04:07.890> dries<00:04:08.129> really<00:04:08.489> hard<00:04:08.909> and

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
and it dries really hard and

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.520 
and it dries really hard and
then<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.800> have<00:04:11.040> within<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:12.300> know<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.530> from

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
then you have within you know you from

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.559 
then you have within you know you from
beginning<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.400> point<00:04:14.819> you<00:04:15.090> really<00:04:15.420> only

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
beginning to that point you really only

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.870 
beginning to that point you really only
have<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.959> couple<00:04:16.410> of<00:04:16.500> hours<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:16.980> work<00:04:17.280> into<00:04:17.850> it

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
have a couple of hours of work into it

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.879 
have a couple of hours of work into it
and<00:04:18.180> then<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:18.600> can<00:04:18.900> start<00:04:19.169> working<00:04:19.410> on<00:04:19.769> the

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
and then you can start working on the

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:20.509 
and then you can start working on the
details

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
details

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.720

I<00:04:20.609> do<00:04:21.060> dry<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:22.850> often<00:04:24.050> because<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:26.550> new

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
I do dry it often because the the new

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.060 
I do dry it often because the the new
air<00:04:26.940> dry<00:04:27.120> clay<00:04:27.300> is<00:04:27.570> fairly<00:04:28.110> soft<00:04:28.500> if<00:04:28.889> you're

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
air dry clay is fairly soft if you're

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.190 
air dry clay is fairly soft if you're
working<00:04:29.250> on<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.730> feathers<00:04:30.120> on<00:04:30.300> one<00:04:30.540> side<00:04:30.840> and

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
working on the feathers on one side and

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.960 
working on the feathers on one side and
then<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.620> turn<00:04:31.980> around<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.460> start<00:04:32.639> working

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
then you turn around and start working

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.480 
then you turn around and start working
on<00:04:33.120> them<00:04:33.270> somewhere<00:04:34.200> else<00:04:34.380> you're<00:04:34.919> quite

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
on them somewhere else you're quite

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.440 
on them somewhere else you're quite
likely<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.889> mess<00:04:37.889> up<00:04:38.100> your<00:04:38.130> original<00:04:38.700> work<00:04:38.940> so

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
likely to mess up your original work so

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.040 
likely to mess up your original work so
I've<00:04:40.020> been<00:04:40.860> drying<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.520> lot<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:42.630> this

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
I've been drying it a lot so this

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.320 
I've been drying it a lot so this
project<00:04:44.570> in<00:04:45.570> total<00:04:46.290> probably<00:04:47.120> I've<00:04:48.120> been

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
project in total probably I've been

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.880 
project in total probably I've been
working<00:04:48.660> on<00:04:48.780> off<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.080> on<00:04:49.290> for<00:04:49.530> a<00:04:49.590> couple<00:04:49.710> of

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
working on off and on for a couple of

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.750 
working on off and on for a couple of
days<00:04:52.310> there's<00:04:53.480> approximately<00:04:55.010> one<00:04:56.010> half<00:04:56.370> of

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
days there's approximately one half of

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.390 
days there's approximately one half of
that<00:04:56.850> recipe<00:04:57.840> for<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.380> air<00:04:58.530> dried<00:04:58.800> clay<00:04:59.070> on

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
that recipe for the air dried clay on

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.330 
that recipe for the air dried clay on
this<00:05:00.120> bird<00:05:00.450> so<00:05:00.780> obviously<00:05:01.320> not<00:05:01.500> very<00:05:01.710> much<00:05:01.979> and

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
this bird so obviously not very much and

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.240 
this bird so obviously not very much and
it's<00:05:03.030> solid<00:05:03.540> really<00:05:04.440> solid<00:05:05.300> um

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
it's solid really solid um

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.600 
it's solid really solid um
the<00:05:08.250> if<00:05:09.030> I've<00:05:09.510> noticed<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:10.050> if<00:05:10.200> you<00:05:10.580> get<00:05:11.580> a

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
the if I've noticed that if you get a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.630 
the if I've noticed that if you get a
little<00:05:11.910> bit<00:05:12.030> carried<00:05:12.300> away<00:05:12.450> on<00:05:13.640> especially

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
little bit carried away on especially

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.690 
little bit carried away on especially
like<00:05:15.150> here<00:05:15.540> on<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.960> on<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.940> legs<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.770> there's

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
like here on the on the legs and there's

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.540 
like here on the on the legs and there's
too<00:05:21.240> much<00:05:23.720> just<00:05:24.720> too<00:05:24.930> much<00:05:25.140> going<00:05:25.560> on<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:26.190> can

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
too much just too much going on you can

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.630 
too much just too much going on you can
soften<00:05:26.970> it<00:05:27.330> up<00:05:27.450> by<00:05:27.780> using<00:05:28.350> a<00:05:28.680> brush<00:05:28.919> dipped<00:05:29.430> in

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
soften it up by using a brush dipped in

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.090 
soften it up by using a brush dipped in
the<00:05:29.669> water<00:05:30.479> and<00:05:30.750> glue<00:05:31.020> solution<00:05:31.320> which<00:05:31.919> I

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
the water and glue solution which I

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.850 
the water and glue solution which I
think<00:05:32.310> it<00:05:32.430> turned<00:05:32.789> out<00:05:32.880> really<00:05:32.940> nice<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.860> had

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
think it turned out really nice I had

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.590 
think it turned out really nice I had
not<00:05:34.950> originally<00:05:35.220> intended<00:05:35.550> to<00:05:35.940> put<00:05:36.270> so<00:05:36.419> much

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
not originally intended to put so much

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.320 
not originally intended to put so much
detail<00:05:36.900> on<00:05:37.590> this<00:05:37.710> bird<00:05:38.010> but<00:05:38.880> it<00:05:39.030> was<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.270> much

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
detail on this bird but it was so much

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.640 
detail on this bird but it was so much
fun<00:05:39.479> to<00:05:39.930> do<00:05:40.169> and<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.950> know<00:05:41.360> you<00:05:42.360> can<00:05:45.650> it

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
fun to do and you know you can it

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.850 
fun to do and you know you can it
somehow<00:05:47.460> or<00:05:47.700> another<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:48.440> the<00:05:49.440> clay<00:05:49.650> took

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
somehow or another the the clay took

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.060 
somehow or another the the clay took
over<00:05:50.070> in<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:51.479> do<00:05:51.690> what<00:05:51.840> he<00:05:51.930> wanted<00:05:52.260> to<00:05:52.320> do<00:05:52.560> and

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
over in and do what he wanted to do and

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.640 
over in and do what he wanted to do and
I<00:05:53.190> ended<00:05:53.789> up<00:05:53.910> with<00:05:54.090> a<00:05:54.360> lot<00:05:54.690> more<00:05:55.110> detailing

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
I ended up with a lot more detailing

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.219 
I ended up with a lot more detailing
that<00:05:55.979> then<00:05:56.340> I<00:05:56.430> really<00:05:56.700> intended<00:05:57.210> to<00:05:57.240> it's<00:05:57.990> very

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
that then I really intended to it's very

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.659 
that then I really intended to it's very
hard<00:05:58.820> sandable<00:06:00.590> I'm<00:06:01.590> going<00:06:01.979> to<00:06:02.100> be<00:06:02.280> rather

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
hard sandable I'm going to be rather

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.170 
hard sandable I'm going to be rather
than<00:06:02.970> rather<00:06:03.810> than<00:06:03.960> just<00:06:04.830> paint<00:06:05.100> this<00:06:05.370> I<00:06:05.729> could

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
than rather than just paint this I could

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.900 
than rather than just paint this I could
just<00:06:06.930> painted<00:06:07.320> a<00:06:07.440> blue<00:06:07.650> black<00:06:07.919> and<00:06:08.250> be<00:06:08.760> done

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
just painted a blue black and be done

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.940 
just painted a blue black and be done
with<00:06:08.970> it<00:06:09.180> but<00:06:09.300> I<00:06:09.450> think<00:06:09.539> instead<00:06:10.169> what<00:06:10.830> I'm

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
with it but I think instead what I'm

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.279 
with it but I think instead what I'm
going<00:06:10.979> to<00:06:11.280> do<00:06:11.490> is<00:06:12.350> use<00:06:13.350> this<00:06:13.650> sculpt<00:06:14.039> Nouveau

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
going to do is use this sculpt Nouveau

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.700 
going to do is use this sculpt Nouveau
iron<00:06:17.120> coating<00:06:18.120> and<00:06:18.419> make<00:06:18.990> it<00:06:19.110> look<00:06:19.260> like<00:06:19.440> cast

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
iron coating and make it look like cast

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.879 
iron coating and make it look like cast
iron<00:06:19.950> which<00:06:20.760> I<00:06:20.880> think<00:06:21.030> it'd<00:06:21.120> be<00:06:21.240> kind<00:06:21.419> of<00:06:21.479> cool

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
iron which I think it'd be kind of cool

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.100 
iron which I think it'd be kind of cool
or<00:06:21.949> it<00:06:22.520> won't<00:06:22.669> be<00:06:22.849> as<00:06:22.939> dark<00:06:23.240> as<00:06:23.419> a<00:06:23.509> real<00:06:23.719> Raven

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
or it won't be as dark as a real Raven

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.589 
or it won't be as dark as a real Raven
but<00:06:24.319> I<00:06:24.949> think<00:06:25.729> it<00:06:25.789> would<00:06:25.879> be<00:06:25.939> kind<00:06:26.120> of<00:06:26.150> fun<00:06:26.389> and

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
but I think it would be kind of fun and

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:28.240 
but I think it would be kind of fun and
we'll<00:06:26.780> go<00:06:26.960> kind<00:06:27.229> of<00:06:27.259> fast<00:06:27.319> so<00:06:27.919> if<00:06:28.009> you'd<00:06:28.129> like

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
we'll go kind of fast so if you'd like

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.980 
we'll go kind of fast so if you'd like
to<00:06:28.430> see<00:06:28.639> how<00:06:28.789> that's<00:06:29.030> done<00:06:29.330> just<00:06:29.360> let<00:06:29.689> me<00:06:29.840> know

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
to see how that's done just let me know

to see how that's done just let me know
and<00:06:30.169> I'll<00:06:30.289> I'll<00:06:30.770> turn<00:06:31.009> the<00:06:31.159> camera<00:06:31.310> on<00:06:31.580> when
