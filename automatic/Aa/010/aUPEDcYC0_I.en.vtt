harvester<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:17.210> these<00:00:18.210> panels<00:00:18.750> I've<00:00:18.930> had<00:00:19.220> for

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
harvester and these panels I've had for

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.630 
harvester and these panels I've had for
a<00:00:20.250> number<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.580> years<00:00:20.670> now<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.660> very<00:00:21.869> basic<00:00:22.640> as

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
a number of years now it's very basic as

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.330 
a number of years now it's very basic as
you<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.269> I've<00:00:24.449> removed<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.199> chopper<00:00:25.470> but

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
you can see I've removed the chopper but

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.529 
you can see I've removed the chopper but
I<00:00:26.369> didn't<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.470> these<00:00:28.470> panels<00:00:28.920> fitted<00:00:29.279> in

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
I didn't have to these panels fitted in

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.479 
I didn't have to these panels fitted in
with<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.599> chopper<00:00:31.019> still<00:00:31.650> mounted<00:00:32.099> but

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
with the chopper still mounted but

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.590 
with the chopper still mounted but
lifted<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.030> out<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> road<00:00:34.790> so<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.420> is

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
lifted up out of the road so this is

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.380 
lifted up out of the road so this is
this<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> panel<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.210> been

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this is the panel it's just been

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.010 
this is the panel it's just been
manufactured<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:42.030> sit<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:44.539> I'll<00:00:45.539> get

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
manufactured to sit in there I'll get

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.869 
manufactured to sit in there I'll get
the<00:00:46.170> rest<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.030> equipment<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.420> shortly<00:00:49.350> but

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
ago was just that single panel that

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
ago was just that single panel that
you're<00:01:43.380> looking<00:01:43.710> at<00:01:43.829> now<00:01:44.039> I've<00:01:44.789> finished

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you're looking at now I've finished

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.520 
you're looking at now I've finished
putting<00:01:46.020> all<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> ten<00:01:46.590> work<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:48.049> in<00:01:49.049> dry<00:01:49.499> years

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
putting all the ten work on in dry years

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.520 
putting all the ten work on in dry years
I've<00:01:50.340> added<00:01:51.500> an<00:01:52.500> extra<00:01:53.039> plate<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.539> I<00:01:54.899> haven't

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
I've added an extra plate so I haven't

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709 
I've added an extra plate so I haven't
measured<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.130> distance<00:01:56.670> from<00:01:56.939> here<00:01:57.240> through

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
measured this distance from here through

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.289 
measured this distance from here through
to<00:01:57.929> hear<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:59.009> i<00:01:59.310> would<00:01:59.670> estimate<00:02:01.520> 500<00:02:02.520> 550

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
to hear but i would estimate 500 550

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.249 
to hear but i would estimate 500 550
Mills<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:06.500> in<00:02:07.500> imperial<00:02:08.069> measurement<00:02:09.259> just

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
Mills that in imperial measurement just

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.780 
Mills that in imperial measurement just
short<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.560> two<00:02:10.769> feet<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:12.049> off<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.319> ground<00:02:13.790> it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
short of two feet and off the ground it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.559 
short of two feet and off the ground it
would<00:02:15.090> be<00:02:15.329> about<00:02:15.900> six<00:02:16.349> or<00:02:16.500> seven<00:02:16.680> hundred<00:02:17.099> mils

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
would be about six or seven hundred mils

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:25.849 
would be about six or seven hundred mils
two<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> half<00:02:18.900> feet<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:22.940> that's<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.239> as<00:02:25.109> I

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
two and a half feet and that's it as I

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.059 
two and a half feet and that's it as I
said<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.190> these<00:02:26.370> dry<00:02:26.670> years<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.840> had<00:02:28.560> paneling

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
said in these dry years I had paneling

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.839 
said in these dry years I had paneling
on<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.489> get<00:02:29.670> an<00:02:29.790> arrow<00:02:29.970> will<00:02:30.239> win<00:02:30.660> grow<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:32.340> in

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
on to get an arrow will win grow and in

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.020 
on to get an arrow will win grow and in
this<00:02:33.000> year<00:02:33.329> once<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.410> material<00:02:35.010> hits<00:02:35.220> hits

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
this year once that material hits hits

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.000 
this year once that material hits hits
these<00:02:36.299> plates<00:02:36.690> deflects<00:02:37.410> down<00:02:37.620> onto<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
these plates deflects down onto the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.930 
these plates deflects down onto the
ground<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.569> be<00:02:39.750> narrow<00:02:40.049> was<00:02:40.940> 350

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
ground it can be narrow was 350

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.160 
ground it can be narrow was 350
millimeters<00:02:42.540> 14<00:02:43.440> inches<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.780> can<00:02:45.780> deflect

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
millimeters 14 inches so it can deflect

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.039 
millimeters 14 inches so it can deflect
down<00:02:46.530> into<00:02:46.859> a<00:02:46.889> very<00:02:47.280> narrow<00:02:47.579> strip<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.690> these

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
down into a very narrow strip in these

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.740 
down into a very narrow strip in these
lot<00:02:49.319> of<00:02:49.470> years<00:02:51.530> if<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.739> had<00:02:52.950> heavy<00:02:53.220> bulk<00:02:53.579> odd<00:02:54.090> I

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
lot of years if I had heavy bulk odd I

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.670 
lot of years if I had heavy bulk odd I
just<00:02:55.380> take<00:02:55.620> care<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.880> panel<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:58.290> panel

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
just take care this panel and this panel

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.460 
just take care this panel and this panel
off<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.720> these<00:03:00.720> couple<00:03:01.109> of<00:03:01.139> bits<00:03:01.290> of

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
off and these couple of bits of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.550 
off and these couple of bits of
c-section<00:03:02.900> just<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:05.040> as<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> bit<00:03:05.430> wider<00:03:05.959> I<00:03:06.959> also

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
c-section just so as a bit wider I also

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.150 
c-section just so as a bit wider I also
mount<00:03:08.130> a<00:03:08.840> camera<00:03:10.430> CCTV<00:03:11.430> camera<00:03:12.239> on<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:14.010> can

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
mount a camera CCTV camera on it you can

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.550 
mount a camera CCTV camera on it you can
see<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.609> there<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.780> will<00:03:16.019> be<00:03:16.200> looking

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
see that there and that will be looking

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.229 
see that there and that will be looking
down<00:03:16.819> Justin<00:03:17.819> in<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.930> area<00:03:19.849> because<00:03:20.849> when

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
down Justin in this area because when

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.379 
down Justin in this area because when
