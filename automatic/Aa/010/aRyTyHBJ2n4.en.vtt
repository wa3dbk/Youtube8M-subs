00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.290 
well so without further ado let's get
started<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> first<00:00:17.279> thing<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.880> my<00:00:18.090> face

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
started so the first thing is my face

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.240 
started so the first thing is my face
lotion<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.050> use<00:00:19.199> Cetaphil<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.949> one<00:00:20.070> has

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
lotion and I use Cetaphil this one has

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.400 
lotion and I use Cetaphil this one has
SPF<00:00:20.730> 15<00:00:21.000> which<00:00:21.359> protects<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.170> from<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
SPF 15 which protects you from the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.050 
SPF 15 which protects you from the
deadly<00:00:22.769> rays<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.130> Sun<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.670> if<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.910> have

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
deadly rays of the Sun but if you have

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.609 
deadly rays of the Sun but if you have
oily<00:00:24.390> skin<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.689> don't<00:00:24.900> recommend<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.410> because

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
oily skin I don't recommend this because

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.349 
oily skin I don't recommend this because
it<00:00:25.920> does<00:00:26.099> get<00:00:26.279> oily<00:00:26.580> throughout<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.970> day<00:00:27.119> I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
it does get oily throughout the day I

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.810 
it does get oily throughout the day I
have<00:00:27.630> dry<00:00:27.869> skin<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.160> better<00:00:29.340> for<00:00:29.640> me

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
have dry skin so it it's better for me

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.970 
have dry skin so it it's better for me
because<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.179> can<00:00:30.420> use<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> extra<00:00:31.080> moisture<00:00:31.230> so

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
because I can use the extra moisture so

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.100 
because I can use the extra moisture so
that's<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:32.430> facial<00:00:32.850> lotion<00:00:33.210> after<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.630> apply<00:00:33.930> my

or this flavor in Canada we have the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.480 
or this flavor in Canada we have the
summer<00:01:08.220> fruit<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.210> honeydew<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.770> which

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
summer fruit the honeydew and the which

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.640 
summer fruit the honeydew and the which
imma<00:01:11.729> call<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.720> mid<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.320> although<00:01:13.530> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
imma call in the mid one and although I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.380 
imma call in the mid one and although I
like<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.040> lip<00:01:14.250> balm<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.640> find<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
like the lip balm I do find that this

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.210 
like the lip balm I do find that this
shape<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> bit<00:01:16.170> impractical<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
shape is a bit impractical because you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.289 
shape is a bit impractical because you
can't<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.549> stick<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.119> pocket

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
can't really stick it in your pocket

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.149 
can't really stick it in your pocket
without<00:01:18.659> looking<00:01:19.080> silly<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:19.950> so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
without looking silly because it's so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.620 
without looking silly because it's so

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
using pencil for me is so much quicker

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.110 
using pencil for me is so much quicker
than<00:02:28.590> using<00:02:29.100> powder<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.580> that's<00:02:29.760> why<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:29.940> always

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
than using powder so that's why I always

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.150 
than using powder so that's why I always
take<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.569> on<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> go<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.500> always<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.920> hand
