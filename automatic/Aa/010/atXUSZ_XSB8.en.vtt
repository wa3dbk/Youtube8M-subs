00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.070
 that's it 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.760
 not a week that I made myself 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.760
 straighten hair 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.320
 it's a little swollen anyway 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.760
 since last week and small 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.930
 frizz at the tips 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:26.919
 particular and the hair root has 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.039
 sometimes it's very pretty 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.689
 strangely I very much want to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.820
 wash the hair find frilet all 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.260
 what I miss 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.600
 so I really want to wash myself 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.710
 hair and redo my test autun 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.970
 I will wait a little bit I will try 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.410
 still enjoy a little bit of my 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.200
 smooth hair that changes I'm not going 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:51.160
 connects her brown hair hangman 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.719
 other than that and well I see there I am 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.949
 always happy it always makes me 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.050
 little weird but it's okay I got you 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.149
 a little more used 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.469
 on the other hand like that a little curly I 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.250
 trend aside from the attachÃ©s in this 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.869
 moment to make little bugs on the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.800
 head make hairstyles with pliers 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.420
 finally I realized that 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.060
 I only had protectors 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.229
 heat that contained water by the way 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.220
 that they contain water and so who 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.689
 applies after shampooing just 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.280
 before drying hair just before 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.990
 to blow dry and there you have to 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.700
 absolutely not that I apply from back on 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.409
 my hair otherwise they will really 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.119
 recovery is so here I am a little 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.280
 limited in terms of heat protector 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.380
 other than the protective oil of loads 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.170
 for laughing to use others as I 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.990
 no longer have fantastic eye oil 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.000
 activision that I would use well 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.829
 unfortunately I could not 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.659
 take risk there I applied 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.159
 hectares of vegetable oil behind 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.780
 strength of farid abbots who is very much 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.119
 that I like a lot I also use jeans 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.250
 my curly hair is a mixture 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.280
 oil but is very light 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.770
 to whom do not strike too much hair so 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.680
 really the rendering is not serious so is 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.670
 it's pretty awesome enough for that 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.800
 against it is not indicated that it is a 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.890
 heat protector of the brothers not blow 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.940
 take a chance of dying I fire and 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.700
 so I prefer not to redo 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.520
 smoothing or curling on the hair 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.950
 in b it will be four years that I stopped 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.510
 straightening and three and a half years that 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.010
 I made you must tschopp tell me that 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.700
 can not be bad about making a book cac 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.300
 on smooth hair knowing that the 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.920
 hairdresser cut me well so called genres 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.420
 sensitive tip or something 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.370
 like that it's not very serious 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.230
 know how to push so here I make you a 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.230
 little the jac can beat google 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.910
 before a measure 35 cm on the side 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:03.599
 thirty centimeters at the back are at 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.069
 unequivocally sell short there is at 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.069
 middle level of the head 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:14.230
 its almost at 40 cm the hairdresser is going 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.880
 really equalized everything but must fall 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.820
 goatherd ends about the same 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.080
 wavelength necessarily by cons 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.630
 to say that my hair back a little 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.270
 shorter since it takes about 25 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.370
 centimeters before it takes about 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.630
 30 centimeters on the top of the head 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.090
 those who are the longest since 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.330
 talk about the money remaining so far they 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.500
 are between 35 and 40 36 m so here at 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.330
 pretty much for four years two of a 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.970
 reduced braking and really three 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.130
 years and a half the natural makes it that makes 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.510
 more than ten centimeters a year rather 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.710
 not bad like like thumbs and well 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.710
 I hope this idea apu 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.740
 we 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.670
 you 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.260
 he 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.260
 he 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.260
 we
