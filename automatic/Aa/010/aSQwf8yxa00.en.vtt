I<00:00:45.559> was<00:00:45.710> quite<00:00:45.920> fascinated<00:00:46.699> with<00:00:46.879> this<00:00:47.180> because

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
I was quite fascinated with this because

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.110 
I was quite fascinated with this because
when<00:00:48.199> you<00:00:48.350> find<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.860> right<00:00:48.890> point<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:49.699> it

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
when you find the right point you it

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.990 
when you find the right point you it
really<00:00:50.920> helps<00:00:51.920> you<00:00:52.040> be<00:00:52.190> more<00:00:52.220> expressive<00:00:52.760> as

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
really helps you be more expressive as

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.310 
really helps you be more expressive as
an<00:00:53.089> artist<00:00:53.479> because<00:00:53.720> you<00:00:53.960> don't<00:00:54.110> have<00:00:54.229> to

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
an artist because you don't have to

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.600 
an artist because you don't have to
think<00:00:54.500> about<00:00:54.710> what's<00:00:54.890> on<00:00:55.010> your<00:00:55.159> feet<00:00:55.370> you<00:00:55.580> can

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
think about what's on your feet you can

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.170 
think about what's on your feet you can
just<00:00:55.970> completely<00:00:56.860> concentrate<00:00:57.860> on<00:00:58.180> the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
just completely concentrate on the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.549 
just completely concentrate on the
choreography<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.809> what<00:01:00.140> you're<00:01:00.260> trying<00:01:00.470> to

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
choreography and what you're trying to

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.490 
choreography and what you're trying to
express<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:02.510> pair<00:01:02.750> of<00:01:02.839> pointe<00:01:03.080> shoes<00:01:03.320> that

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
express the pair of pointe shoes that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.800

you<00:01:03.589> have<00:01:03.620> for<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.129> show<00:01:04.400> can<00:01:05.330> make<00:01:05.510> a<00:01:05.540> big

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810

have a pair of shoes that are broken in

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.700 
have a pair of shoes that are broken in
just<00:01:13.729> right<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:14.450> they<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:14.990> feel<00:01:15.350> that<00:01:15.560> they

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.220 
like halfway and I like to wear my shoes
quite<00:02:12.140> soft<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.250> usually<00:02:13.850> basically<00:02:14.569> break

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
quite soft so I usually basically break

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.780 
quite soft so I usually basically break
it<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.530> lot

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.770 

and<00:02:17.909> then<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.200> can't<00:02:19.890> do<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.159> now<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.670> I'll<00:02:21.420> take

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
and then I can't do it now but I'll take

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.220 
and then I can't do it now but I'll take
this<00:02:21.989> off<00:02:22.290> cut<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.700> usually<00:02:24.209> cut<00:02:24.599> here

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
this off cut it and I usually cut here

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.449 
this off cut it and I usually cut here
so<00:02:25.799> that<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.579> doesn't<00:02:26.610> dig<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.239> my<00:02:27.420> heel<00:02:27.750> and

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
so that it doesn't dig in my heel and

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.630 
so that it doesn't dig in my heel and
then<00:02:29.459> that's<00:02:29.700> how<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.000> usually<00:02:30.450> wear<00:02:30.930> my<00:02:31.140> shoes

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
then that's how I usually wear my shoes

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.800 
then that's how I usually wear my shoes
with<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> evolution<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.390> pointe<00:02:33.629> shoe

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
with the evolution of the pointe shoe

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.559 
with the evolution of the pointe shoe
having<00:02:34.409> it<00:02:34.829> start<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.430> actually<00:02:35.909> no<00:02:36.090> box<00:02:36.329> at

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
having it start with actually no box at

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.509 
having it start with actually no box at
all<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.019> just<00:02:37.140> stiff<00:02:37.379> toes<00:02:37.620> underneath

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
all and just stiff toes underneath

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.300 
all and just stiff toes underneath
supports<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.870> idea<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> Romantic<00:02:41.099> period

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
supports the idea of the Romantic period

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.640 
supports the idea of the Romantic period
work<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.629> shoe<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:42.930> very<00:02:42.959> supple<00:02:43.379> it

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
work so the shoe is very supple it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.220 
work so the shoe is very supple it

doesn't have any sound and this year

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.710 
doesn't have any sound and this year
it's<00:02:46.709> visible<00:02:47.549> in<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:48.000> work<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.180> will<00:02:48.689> be

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
it's visible in the work that will be

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.440 
it's visible in the work that will be
done<00:02:48.870> in<00:02:49.109> lacing<00:02:49.859> feet<00:02:50.069> you<00:02:50.819> can<00:02:50.970> contrast

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
done in lacing feet you can contrast

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.360 
done in lacing feet you can contrast
that<00:02:51.569> with<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.049> classics<00:02:52.590> where<00:02:53.159> the
