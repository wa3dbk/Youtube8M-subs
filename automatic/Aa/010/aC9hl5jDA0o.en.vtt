00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 if one of those youtuber the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.890
 join in making a team who would 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.150
 you choose to do with the team 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello people why do you come to one 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.670
 Another woman's family moved in the last 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.469
 video I have a bit over 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.490
 the rules of was complained about 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.780
 it should also be a bit today 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.670
 but mainly it should go today 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.440
 to participate in was or 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.270
 the participants of the give 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.490
 list of participants is was relatively filled 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.170
 where I have also from bread market.de the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.850
 I will copy the list of participants 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.710
 here now you come in a video 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.090
 Show that you can say that's 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.070
 I know a relatively large number of participants 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.359
 think again now 60 participants there 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.949
 By now you only have to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.110
 introduce and have normal blu ray 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.559
 I think 30 or something else month 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.600
 doubles 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.700
 if not there in the first episode directly 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.860
 ten team dying which surprised 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 So fat again that's what you can say 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.890
 The project will be okay anyway 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 germans play is currently even 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.550
 host of vario and he also has 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.660
 recently a small rule change 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.980
 announced and that is the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.449
 haemorrhage rule be abolished 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.460
 People who do not know the bloodshot 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.989
 rule is that within 15 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.100
 parties must have done 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.930
 that is enough even if you 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.309
 once in arrow in the direction of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.840
 The tent was shot in the opponent 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.620
 struggle for promotion under the regulation 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.000
 abolished I think a bit 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.769
 pity I found the rule actually good 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.420
 now is the potential that the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.130
 teams are just among farmers in 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 the earth and then for five billion 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.549
 Doctors are looking for the good ones 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.080
 players who really are after all 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.490
 chase other teams and so is one 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.659
 a pity but what do you want to do 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.220
 I mean now in principle also more likely 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.450
 disturbed the rule but more passive 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.220
 maybe a little smarter 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.020
 But yes, the blood trail can shield you 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.430
 and a few minor rule changes 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.540
 were also announced 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.060
 among other things , I also heard that 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.040
 simon should be mowed so he was 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.689
 Internet has to the place where is believed 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.490
 not so that it fits so well 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.869
 time keeping on but if it does 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.119
 I would be very happy 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.740
 because somehow simon yes belongs to me 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.119
 mine because it always dare 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.409
 many organizers and and yes I want 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.430
 Really good if you can manage it 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.509
 would do with it, too 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.250
 actually a very good family force 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.200
 is a player and that a bit too 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.369
 then raise the level I would know 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.810
 not good the others and I do not know 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.640
 if anyone has trained this mode 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.320
 I think hardly anyone has this mode 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.090
 played in the past year 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.619
 otherwise if you look at the participants 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.840
 so arrives there is actually no such 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.759
 real surprises except for team 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.079
 if you like, that's two 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.820
 I have never read books about them 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.079
 I heard before and there I am 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.579
 currently somehow you get in was 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.170
 Actually, what do you have to do? 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.489
 to come in and I have the 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.470
 looked at all other participants and 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.940
 with ok ok vitamin b contacts 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.620
 teams the list of participants of 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.810
 why is 100 percent of people 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.220
 that are somehow already linked with 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.290
 any participants quite speak 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.390
 like to see this incest minecraft scene 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.400
 that all somehow together and with each other 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.480
 somehow this left is true somehow 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.950
 true that you can say that it is 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.000
 not true if all somehow 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.230
 this is like a big one 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.100
 family all together with each other 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.660
 and I mean nothing 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.010
 bad I think actually rather cool 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.170
 so that the one is so Community 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.030
 or really what can say that's that 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.830
 minecraft scene everyone knows each other there 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.700
 are the friends with each other 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.740
 Actually, it is actually a whole 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.750
 cool thing you do not have to do it now 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.250
 Negative times the term sounds in scene 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.780
 only rather negative but that is not 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.220
 as negative is meant describes 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.990
 just what it is and I am 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.000
 already says okay we are the two one 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.340
 Complicated team get in 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.709
 that was okay one was at desperado for 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.120
 34 pope among other things was with me 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.560
 the power of life 342 is enough that's enough 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.690
 to get away with it I 'm up for it 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.890
 Sofa I think its as tight as that 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.420
 Do not shit a bit if you only 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.709
 over contacts comes in because of the weather 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.360
 but actually rather the feeling that 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.010
 then the youtuber bit smaller 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.690
 but are happy to do with what 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.280
 then try with a youtuber 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.500
 befriend but only about that 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.970
 project to come and in return must 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.310
 then expect the great critic 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.780
 he is a little youtuber who rejoices 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.459
 determined with me because of the im 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.290
 Project wants to get in with it 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.640
 is totally disturbed relationship that one 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.050
 to the people though you may have 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.640
 I have to deal with personal friend of 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.840
 people would find ex ex cool in general 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.280
 I like it very much when two was such a one 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.690
 kind of wild card would give where maybe 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.459
 five six years just take part 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.500
 say something like that was the youtuber through 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.880
 who have one to 10,000 subscribers and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.580
 Let's have a drink out 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.350
 cool an unknown component if 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.880
 I'm much more exciting in the project than 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.260
 a component where you can characterize every character 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.880
 I know my times now know at the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.260
 list of participants already okay and peterle 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.209
 for example he is a bit 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.980
 poor old Steiger in minecraft 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.810
 you know, okay, probably 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.220
 the skull has longer in it is great 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.780
 great but if the unknown 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.580
 component with would come in but 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.840
 say okay, the price it is good I 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.760
 do not know the complete one was there 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.769
 last election with turbines he knew 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.269
 no one really who is that and before 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.769
 I think it's extremely well done 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.150
 videos were great to maintain 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.500
 something I would have liked quite as 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.230
 asked with whom would I be in genthin 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.459
 do 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.139
 if you get the funds now from everyone 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.850
 youtuber empowered to team up 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.410
 Who would you choose and join the team? 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.880
 The comments are if you want to do 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.560
 would be with the team if you guys 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.090
 could choose because I believe if 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.860
 I would take someone who is extremely good 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.510
 I would have been so bad too 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.770
 certain if I shit who but 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.360
 now that someone is the bad 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.740
 we know bad but I want now 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.210
 not much talent is totally me 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.660
 nice is still peterle to 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.010
 For example, the worse team they are 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.750
 I do not really go down and afterwards 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.100
 each succession how we would survive 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.660
 a success i would rather be someone of 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.280
 really bad in minecraft he is 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.060
 is about as good as me and 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.490
 maybe even a bit 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.690
 worse then I at least still 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.090
 get out better if you give it 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.370
 you bad and erwin would you take 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.750
 under yes so much too vague 3 is formed 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.289
 exact start date is actually too 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.900
 already known 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.669
 on the 18th it should start going so now in 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.050
 about a month and yes I am 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.150
 I 'm always not sure 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.440
 who i should be for i just know that 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.310
 I think it will be a cool project 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.350
 this probably the first consequence 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.300
 unbelievably many people from the right 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.949
 die and many want 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.930
 compilations come out and so on 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.160
 and it will be great and also a look 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.100
 another car is over again 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.500
 a bit more critical and therefore the 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.419
 next episode people and all that my 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.419
 Lektor and then you do not even say people
