off<00:04:54.960> if<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.440> just<00:04:55.620> turn<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.950> back<00:04:56.100> on<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.340> should

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
off if I just turn it back on I should

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.260 
off if I just turn it back on I should
have<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:56.910> same<00:04:57.090> engine<00:04:57.480> for<00:04:57.720> that<00:04:57.750> yep<00:04:59.270> they

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
have the same engine for that yep they

00:05:00.270 --> 00:06:10.909 
have the same engine for that yep they
have<00:05:00.420> done<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:00.870> actually

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919
