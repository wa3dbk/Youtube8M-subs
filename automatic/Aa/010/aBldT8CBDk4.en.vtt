00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.230
 Dirty parent to the waves in addition 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.140
 would be so dark with a bit 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.180
 I agree in the morning four times in the morning 4 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.010
 but again and the bandit has become 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.570
 again something epic on the legs 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.160
 put away what was fun again 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.469
 an hour in the sight of two in it 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.000
 is already above my main ghost needs 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.850

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.800

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.690

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.520
 I have a really nice friends 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.020

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.140
 Share around and look there comes the first 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.109
 Meets this thing I have met 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.399
 really thought or would have 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.170
 met in retrospect 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.910
 Somehow I have some time now 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.189

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.210

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.400

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.990
 that could have happened without 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.000
 shit well anyway 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.890
 long talk a short time at this point 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.509
 You have to find the middle you have to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.759
 really like one of the bond's side 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.830
 relative to the left of this radar balled 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.810
 throw and straight angles are scarce 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.310
 high above the building, straight up here 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.650

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.150
