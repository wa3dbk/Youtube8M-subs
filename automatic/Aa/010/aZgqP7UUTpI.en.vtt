00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.539 
here to where if you don't want to
listen<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.670> them<00:02:56.849> you<00:02:56.970> just<00:02:58.159> push<00:02:59.159> it<00:02:59.190> back<00:02:59.370> out

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
listen to them you just push it back out

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.880 
listen to them you just push it back out
and<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.760> raises<00:02:59.940> up<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:01.260> both<00:03:01.409> of<00:03:01.620> them<00:03:03.890> so

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
and it raises up for both of them so

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.500 
and it raises up for both of them so
there's<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.849> and<00:03:06.239> for<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.470> wire<00:03:08.450> right<00:03:09.450> here

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
there's that and for the wire right here

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:18.420 
there's that and for the wire right here
let's<00:03:10.109> untie<00:03:10.409> this<00:03:10.470> real<00:03:10.799> quick

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.660 

got<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.640> little<00:03:19.850> harder<00:03:21.340> if<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.460> does<00:03:22.580> become

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
got a little harder if it does become

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.440 
got a little harder if it does become
entangled<00:03:24.460> maybe<00:03:25.460> you<00:03:25.550> got<00:03:25.670> kind<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.030> like<00:03:26.210> a

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
entangled maybe you got kind of like a

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.660 
entangled maybe you got kind of like a
USB<00:03:26.870> plug<00:03:27.350> it<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.500> your<00:03:27.680> computer<00:03:27.800> and<00:03:28.280> then<00:03:28.610> a

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
USB plug it to your computer and then a

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.730 
USB plug it to your computer and then a
little<00:03:29.800> jack<00:03:30.800> plug<00:03:31.550> it<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.700> your<00:03:31.850> iPod<00:03:32.150> or<00:03:32.180> mp3

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
little jack plug it to your iPod or mp3

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:42.640 
little jack plug it to your iPod or mp3
so<00:03:33.740> let's<00:03:34.370> give<00:03:34.520> these<00:03:34.610> try<00:03:40.360> if<00:03:41.360> they<00:03:42.200> will<00:03:42.470> go

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
so let's give these try if they will go

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:51.330 
so let's give these try if they will go
in<00:03:42.890> correctly

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.140 

then<00:03:51.940> not<00:03:52.180> going<00:03:52.480> in<00:03:56.700> there<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:57.819> go<00:03:57.910> and

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
then not going in there you go and

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.180 
then not going in there you go and
that's<00:03:58.450> how<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.810> know<00:03:59.019> it's<00:03:59.200> on<00:03:59.379> the<00:04:00.010> little

that's how you know it's on the little
blue<00:04:00.340> light<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:02.910> let's<00:04:03.910> put<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:04.239> one<00:04:04.450> in

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.320 

let's<00:04:10.000> get<00:04:10.180> out<00:04:10.330> our<00:04:10.360> trusty<00:04:11.019> ipod<00:04:12.330> because
