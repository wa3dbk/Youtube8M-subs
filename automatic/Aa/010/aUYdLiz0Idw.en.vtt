ended<00:03:34.310> up<00:03:34.400> with<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.819> power<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.510> Black

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
ended up with the power of the Black

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.860 
ended up with the power of the Black
Lantern<00:03:36.260> ring<00:03:36.469> as<00:03:37.219> Sir<00:03:37.969> Wally<00:03:38.269> comes<00:03:38.659> online

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
Lantern ring as Sir Wally comes online

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.690 
Lantern ring as Sir Wally comes online
the<00:03:39.590> blackest<00:03:40.159> of<00:03:40.340> lanterns<00:03:40.790> himself<00:03:42.909> so

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
the blackest of lanterns himself so

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.410 
the blackest of lanterns himself so
Necron<00:03:47.170> basically<00:03:48.170> kind<00:03:48.409> of<00:03:48.500> used<00:03:48.739> him<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.420> do

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
Necron basically kind of used him to do

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.420 
Necron basically kind of used him to do
all<00:03:50.569> sorts<00:03:50.599> of<00:03:51.019> badness<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:51.620> almost<00:03:52.250> brought

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
all sorts of badness and almost brought

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.080 
all sorts of badness and almost brought
the<00:03:52.549> galaxy<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.209> its<00:03:53.359> knees<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.280> he<00:03:55.459> can<00:03:55.730> put

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
the galaxy to its knees so he can put

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.390 
the galaxy to its knees so he can put
this<00:03:56.720> little<00:03:57.049> protective<00:03:57.829> energy<00:03:58.189> around

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
this little protective energy around

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.839 
this little protective energy around
himself<00:03:59.530> he<00:04:00.530> does<00:04:00.739> obviously<00:04:00.980> shoot<00:04:01.670> the

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
himself he does obviously shoot the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.800 
himself he does obviously shoot the
laser<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:02.569> all<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.709> lanterns<00:04:03.920> do<00:04:04.750> I'm<00:04:05.750> sure

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
laser that all the lanterns do I'm sure

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.479 
laser that all the lanterns do I'm sure
if<00:04:06.079> there<00:04:06.200> was<00:04:06.349> something<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.709> dig<00:04:07.010> up<00:04:07.189> he

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
if there was something to dig up he

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.740 
if there was something to dig up he
would<00:04:08.260> potentially<00:04:09.260> have<00:04:09.439> some<00:04:09.470> death<00:04:10.750> rated

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
would potentially have some death rated

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.580 
would potentially have some death rated
kind<00:04:12.439> of<00:04:13.239> thing<00:04:14.239> to<00:04:14.540> shoot<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:17.349> what<00:04:18.349> does<00:04:18.440> he

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
kind of thing to shoot and what does he

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:29.690 
kind of thing to shoot and what does he
do<00:04:18.769> when<00:04:18.949> he<00:04:19.009> gets<00:04:19.190> bored<00:04:19.430> let's<00:04:19.789> see

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.400 

I<00:04:29.730> think<00:04:30.480> he's<00:04:30.600> just<00:04:30.690> going<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.930> stand<00:04:31.290> there

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
I think he's just going to stand there

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.850 
I think he's just going to stand there
with<00:04:31.620> his<00:04:31.770> ring<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.190> look<00:04:32.400> kind<00:04:32.670> of<00:04:32.730> stoic<00:04:33.210> so

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
with his ring and look kind of stoic so

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.690 
with his ring and look kind of stoic so
I<00:04:34.860> think<00:04:35.130> we're<00:04:35.280> going<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.430> be<00:04:35.520> a<00:04:35.550> little

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
I think we're going to be a little

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.930 
I think we're going to be a little
disappointed<00:04:36.420> in<00:04:36.600> his<00:04:36.930> performance<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.950> I

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
disappointed in his performance and I

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.230 
disappointed in his performance and I
seriously<00:04:39.360> doubt<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:39.840> he<00:04:40.110> sings<00:04:40.410> but<00:04:41.240> we'll

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
seriously doubt that he sings but we'll

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.820 
seriously doubt that he sings but we'll
check<00:04:42.480> out<00:04:42.690> in<00:04:42.840> just<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.080> moment<00:04:43.410> yeah<00:04:43.590> he's

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
check out in just a moment yeah he's

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.410 
check out in just a moment yeah he's
just<00:04:44.010> going<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.250> stand<00:04:44.490> there<00:04:44.670> some<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.360> the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
just going to stand there some of the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.630 
just going to stand there some of the
characters<00:04:45.840> have<00:04:46.020> animations<00:04:46.680> but<00:04:47.100> whatever

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
characters have animations but whatever

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.240 
characters have animations but whatever
this<00:04:48.240> one<00:04:48.450> works<00:04:48.660> out<00:04:48.840> kind<00:04:49.140> of<00:04:49.230> well<00:04:49.410> let's
