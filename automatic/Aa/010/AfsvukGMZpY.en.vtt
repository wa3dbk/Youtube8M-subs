the<00:01:03.250> five<00:01:03.520> and<00:01:04.000> lay<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.720> just<00:01:05.110> above<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.770> push

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
the five and lay it just above the push

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.290 
the five and lay it just above the push
button<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.760> then<00:01:07.659> push<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:09.640> it<00:01:09.760> does<00:01:09.790> is

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
button and then push it what it does is

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.480 
button and then push it what it does is
is<00:01:10.510> it<00:01:10.540> sends<00:01:11.050> out<00:01:11.170> there's<00:01:11.560> a<00:01:11.619> Gaussian<00:01:12.220> ring

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
is it sends out there's a Gaussian ring

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.300 
is it sends out there's a Gaussian ring
around<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:13.270> start<00:01:13.960> button<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.740> sends<00:01:15.070> out<00:01:15.280> a

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
around the start button it sends out a

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.850 
around the start button it sends out a
magnetic<00:01:15.850> field<00:01:16.240> just<00:01:16.869> enough<00:01:17.229> magnetic

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
magnetic field just enough magnetic

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.890 
magnetic field just enough magnetic
field<00:01:18.160> to<00:01:18.400> energize<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.540> get<00:01:19.750> it<00:01:19.869> to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
field to energize this to get it to

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.219 
field to energize this to get it to
recognize<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:21.160> T<00:01:21.369> in<00:01:21.580> a<00:01:21.670> way<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:21.970> goes<00:01:22.229> so

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
recognize the T in a way it goes so

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.350 
recognize the T in a way it goes so
you're<00:01:23.410> fine<00:01:23.680> so<00:01:24.009> it<00:01:24.369> will<00:01:24.490> never<00:01:24.729> leave<00:01:25.119> you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
you're fine so it will never leave you

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.240 
you're fine so it will never leave you
stranded<00:01:25.750> but<00:01:26.170> just<00:01:26.440> remember<00:01:26.950> that<00:01:27.130> that's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
stranded but just remember that that's

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.850 
stranded but just remember that that's
how<00:01:27.550> that<00:01:27.820> works<00:01:28.119> because<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.380> first<00:01:29.619> thing<00:01:29.770> I

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
how that works because the first thing I

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.310 
how that works because the first thing I
mean<00:01:30.039> normally<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.119> car<00:01:31.360> will<00:01:31.630> give<00:01:31.810> you<00:01:31.990> some

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
mean normally the car will give you some

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.200 
mean normally the car will give you some
idea<00:01:33.070> because<00:01:33.399> you<00:01:33.490> walk<00:01:33.700> up<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.910> that<00:01:34.030> door

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
idea because you walk up to that door

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.240 
idea because you walk up to that door
and<00:01:34.660> you<00:01:34.780> took<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.110> two<00:01:35.259> or<00:01:35.410> three<00:01:35.649> pulls<00:01:35.950> and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
and you took the two or three pulls and

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.090 
and you took the two or three pulls and
forward<00:01:36.580> open<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:38.259> need<00:01:38.440> to<00:01:38.560> go<00:01:38.680> find<00:01:38.920> a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
forward open you need to go find a

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.639 
forward open you need to go find a
battery<00:01:39.430> for<00:01:39.640> your<00:01:39.729> key<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.630> it's<00:01:41.050> very<00:01:41.320> easy
