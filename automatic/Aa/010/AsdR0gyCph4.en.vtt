discovered as a really sick gun I just
like<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> sights<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.730> stinger<00:00:30.570> when

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
like the sights on it stinger when

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.240 
like the sights on it stinger when
you're<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.500> higher<00:00:31.679> killstreaks

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
you're going for the higher killstreaks

helicopter<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.480> might<00:00:36.630> knock<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.020> off<00:00:37.050> like

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
helicopter that might knock you off like

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.590 
a 12 kill streak and piss you off well
if<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> scar<00:00:41.070> l<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.520> find<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.000> important

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
if the scar l I find it really important

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.660 
if the scar l I find it really important
to<00:00:42.690> use<00:00:42.809> scavenger<00:00:43.469> pro<00:00:43.739> because<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to use scavenger pro because the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.060 
to use scavenger pro because the
reloading<00:00:45.059> speed<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.539> pretty<00:00:45.870> much<00:00:46.050> um<00:00:46.530> it's

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
reloading speed is pretty much um it's

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.970 
reloading speed is pretty much um it's
pretty<00:00:47.160> fast<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:48.450> if<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.230> put<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.440> aside<00:00:49.649> by

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
pretty fast like if you put it aside by

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.439 
pretty fast like if you put it aside by
side<00:00:50.160> next<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> guns<00:00:50.850> or<00:00:51.030> reloading<00:00:51.239> feet

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
side next to the guns or reloading feet

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.830 
side next to the guns or reloading feet
is<00:00:51.570> much<00:00:51.809> faster<00:00:52.079> than<00:00:52.980> other<00:00:53.430> guns<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.780> took

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
is much faster than other guns so I took

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.319 
is much faster than other guns so I took
a<00:00:54.989> lot<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> time<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.440> okay<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.460> assassins

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
a lot of time on that okay so assassins

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
a lot of time on that okay so assassins
pro<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.899> personally<00:00:58.170> prefer<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.739> for

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
pro I just personally prefer that for

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.279 
pro I just personally prefer that for
the<00:00:59.039> higher<00:00:59.190> kill<00:00:59.489> streaks<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.059> dead<00:01:00.719> silence

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the higher kill streaks and dead silence

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.049 
the higher kill streaks and dead silence
cuz<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.859> don't<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> be<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.550> falling<00:01:02.940> off

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
cuz I don't like to be like falling off

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.490 
cuz I don't like to be like falling off
of<00:01:03.090> stuff<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.690> died<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> high<00:01:04.260> kill

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
little clip I have of me destroying

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.390 
little clip I have of me destroying
people<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> yep<00:01:12.689> okay<00:01:13.680> guys<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.189> I'm

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
people with it and yep okay guys so I'm

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.469 
people with it and yep okay guys so I'm
playing<00:01:14.909> some<00:01:15.470> domination<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.710> resistance<00:01:17.640> so

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
playing some domination on resistance so

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.289 
playing some domination on resistance so
um<00:01:19.340> domination<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.490> good<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:20.909> getting<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
um domination is good for getting the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.450 
um domination is good for getting the
higher<00:01:21.570> killstreaks<00:01:22.290> because<00:01:23.130> every<00:01:23.430> time

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
higher killstreaks because every time

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
higher killstreaks because every time
you<00:01:23.610> capture<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> flag<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.780> technically<00:01:25.590> get

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
you capture a flag you technically get

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.289 
you capture a flag you technically get
it's<00:01:26.009> called<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.310> point<00:01:26.580> streak<00:01:26.790> technically

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
it's called the point streak technically

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.719 
it's called the point streak technically
and<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.500> point<00:01:28.530> streak<00:01:29.189> which<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
and you get one point streak which is

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.630 
and you get one point streak which is
the<00:01:30.180> same<00:01:30.299> as<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> kill<00:01:30.720> streak<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> I'm<00:01:32.340> i

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the same as a kill streak so I'm i

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.730 
the same as a kill streak so I'm i
already<00:01:32.970> have<00:01:33.119> two<00:01:33.479> points<00:01:34.079> treats<00:01:34.350> while<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
already have two points treats while you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.910 
already have two points treats while you
think<00:01:34.860> make<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.280> three<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.759> kill<00:01:36.000> um

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
think make that three for that kill um

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.789 
think make that three for that kill um
two<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.159> capturing<00:01:38.549> flags<00:01:39.560> 101<00:01:40.560> for

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
two for capturing flags 101 for

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.249 
two for capturing flags 101 for
capturing<00:01:41.130> flags<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.610> 24<00:01:41.939> kills<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.170> I'm

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
capturing flags you 24 kills and so I'm

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.639 
capturing flags you 24 kills and so I'm
on<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> four<00:01:43.710> point<00:01:44.130> streak<00:01:44.369> right<00:01:44.549> now<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.649> I'm

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
on a four point streak right now and I'm

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.080 
on a four point streak right now and I'm
basically<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.040> gonna<00:01:47.220> run<00:01:47.399> around<00:01:47.520> capture

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
basically just gonna run around capture

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.230 
basically just gonna run around capture
every<00:01:48.329> single<00:01:48.360> flag<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.799> beat<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.340> that's

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
every single flag get to beat and that's

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.179 
every single flag get to beat and that's
