11.8 sorry I can't say that in a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.980 
11.8 sorry I can't say that in a
straight<00:02:03.750> face<00:02:03.960> okay<00:02:04.829> very<00:02:05.520> very<00:02:05.729> simple<00:02:06.180> let

straight face okay very very simple let

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.710 
straight face okay very very simple let
me<00:02:07.229> show<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.469> how<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:08.220> all<00:02:08.459> works<00:02:09.119> so

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
me show you how this all works so

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.710 
me show you how this all works so
basically<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.849> this<00:02:11.849> two<00:02:12.120> commands<00:02:12.450> running

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
basically and this two commands running

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.370 
basically and this two commands running
there<00:02:12.989> is

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
there is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.850 
there is
a<00:02:13.820> test<00:02:14.820> for<00:02:15.060> tests<00:02:15.630> for<00:02:15.810> entity<00:02:16.170> type<00:02:16.380> creeper

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
a test for tests for entity type creeper

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.280 
a test for tests for entity type creeper
in<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.070> radius<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.460> six<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.360> then<00:02:18.720> outputs<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
in a radius of six it then outputs a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.690 
in a radius of six it then outputs a
signal<00:02:19.680> strength<00:02:19.950> based<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.460> how<00:02:20.640> many

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
signal strength based on how many

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.090 
signal strength based on how many
creepers<00:02:21.300> there<00:02:21.510> are<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.200> I'm<00:02:22.410> testing<00:02:22.860> for

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
creepers there are so I'm testing for

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.040 
creepers there are so I'm testing for
two<00:02:23.490> creepers<00:02:24.000> okay<00:02:24.420> if<00:02:24.570> there<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.870> two

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
two creepers okay if there is two

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.560 
two creepers okay if there is two
creepers<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.710> will<00:02:26.070> then<00:02:26.190> activate<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:26.970> line

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
creepers it will then activate this line

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.710 
creepers it will then activate this line
of<00:02:27.950> repeaters<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.430> eventually<00:02:30.120> run<00:02:30.330> into

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
of repeaters that eventually run into

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.130 
of repeaters that eventually run into
this<00:02:32.000> command<00:02:33.000> block<00:02:33.090> over<00:02:33.390> here<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.690> spawns

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
this command block over here that spawns

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.190 
this command block over here that spawns
little<00:02:34.590> baby<00:02:34.920> little<00:02:35.790> baby<00:02:35.940> cuddles<00:02:36.570> however

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
little baby little baby cuddles however

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.810 
little baby little baby cuddles however
you'll<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:37.980> repeater<00:02:38.340> over<00:02:38.520> here

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
you'll see that this repeater over here

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.090 
you'll see that this repeater over here
is<00:02:38.970> locked<00:02:39.360> now<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.200> reason<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.620> lock<00:02:40.920> is

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
is locked now the reason that lock is

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.620 
is locked now the reason that lock is
locked<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.520> because<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.940> other<00:02:42.270> thing<00:02:42.540> that's

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
locked is because the other thing that's

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.190 
locked is because the other thing that's
happening<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.230> any<00:02:43.910> item<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.390> throw<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.110> a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
happening is any item that I throw in a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.180 
happening is any item that I throw in a
ten<00:02:46.440> block<00:02:46.650> radius

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
ten block radius

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.210 
ten block radius
okay<00:02:47.760> will<00:02:48.210> be<00:02:48.360> teleported<00:02:48.720> into<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.680> hopper

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
okay will be teleported into this hopper

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.610 
okay will be teleported into this hopper
underneath<00:02:50.790> yet<00:02:51.090> now<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.900> hopper<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.350> filled

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
underneath yet now this hopper is filled

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.130 
underneath yet now this hopper is filled
with<00:02:52.800> TNT<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.730> can't<00:02:54.060> put<00:02:54.420> anything<00:02:54.780> else

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
with TNT so you can't put anything else

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.010 
with TNT so you can't put anything else
in<00:02:55.740> there<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.160> can't<00:02:56.490> actually<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.120> throw

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
in there I can't actually and throw

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.690 
in there I can't actually and throw
anything<00:02:58.260> else<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.740> there<00:02:58.920> it'll<00:02:59.070> just<00:02:59.340> bounce

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
anything else in there it'll just bounce

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.880 
anything else in there it'll just bounce
up<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.120> down<00:03:00.240> because<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.870> because<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.560> it

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
up and down because it because of it

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.790 
up and down because it because of it
being<00:03:02.160> filled<00:03:03.000> with<00:03:03.240> TNT<00:03:03.450> however<00:03:04.380> if<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.620> put

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
being filled with TNT however if I put

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.370 
being filled with TNT however if I put
TNT<00:03:05.160> oh<00:03:05.370> oh<00:03:05.700> teleport<00:03:06.390> TNT<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.870> will<00:03:07.080> then<00:03:07.230> be

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
TNT oh oh teleport TNT it will then be

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.630 
TNT oh oh teleport TNT it will then be
accepted<00:03:07.890> now<00:03:08.960> when<00:03:09.960> i<00:03:09.990> teleport<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.680> two<00:03:11.130> or

accepted now when i teleport that two or

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.360 
accepted now when i teleport that two or
three<00:03:11.790> ticks<00:03:12.330> later<00:03:12.600> i<00:03:13.050> actually<00:03:13.740> kill<00:03:14.160> all

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
three ticks later i actually kill all

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.530 
three ticks later i actually kill all
items<00:03:15.470> in<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.800> three<00:03:17.490> block<00:03:17.730> radius<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:18.390> this

three blocks of this command block will

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.440 
three blocks of this command block will
be<00:03:21.540> killed<00:03:22.260> now<00:03:22.770> if<00:03:22.950> it<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.250> TNT<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.880> TNT<00:03:24.300> will

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
be killed now if it is TNT the TNT will

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.270 
be killed now if it is TNT the TNT will
go<00:03:24.690> into<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.020> hopper<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.560> will<00:03:25.740> not<00:03:26.040> be

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
go into the hopper and it will not be

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.080 
go into the hopper and it will not be
killed<00:03:26.810> okay<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:28.020> it's<00:03:28.680> not<00:03:29.100> TNT<00:03:29.700> it's<00:03:29.880> going

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
killed okay if it's not TNT it's going

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.150 
killed okay if it's not TNT it's going
to<00:03:30.180> bounce<00:03:30.420> up<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.750> down<00:03:30.870> until<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.800> command

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
to bounce up and down until this command

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.590 
to bounce up and down until this command
block<00:03:32.280> actually<00:03:32.580> kills<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.180> it'll<00:03:33.480> then

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
block actually kills it it'll then

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.860 
block actually kills it it'll then
output<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.320> signal<00:03:34.700> which<00:03:35.700> will<00:03:35.880> then<00:03:36.060> play

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
output a signal which will then play

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.840 
output a signal which will then play
that<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.740> that<00:03:38.460> angry<00:03:38.850> villager<00:03:39.830> villager

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
that and that angry villager villager

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.730 
that and that angry villager villager
particles<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.000> saw<00:03:42.470> okay

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
particles that you saw okay

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.340 
particles that you saw okay
it<00:03:43.920> will<00:03:44.280> then<00:03:44.430> also<00:03:44.970> actually<00:03:45.209> lock<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
it will then also actually lock the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.260 
it will then also actually lock the
happy<00:03:46.590> particles<00:03:47.100> so<00:03:47.730> these<00:03:47.880> are<00:03:48.060> happy

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
happy particles so these are happy

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.380 
happy particles so these are happy
particles<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.290> basically<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.340> if<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:51.150> does

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
particles so basically and if it does

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.710 
particles so basically and if it does
hop<00:03:51.600> down<00:03:51.780> there<00:03:52.520> for<00:03:53.520> four<00:03:54.030> ticks<00:03:54.240> later<00:03:54.480> it

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
hop down there for four ticks later it

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.230 
hop down there for four ticks later it
will<00:03:54.870> play<00:03:55.170> happy<00:03:55.530> happy<00:03:55.980> particles<00:03:56.490> if<00:03:56.760> it

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
will play happy happy particles if it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.140 
will play happy happy particles if it
does<00:03:57.420> delete<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:57.980> two<00:03:58.980> ticks<00:03:59.250> three<00:03:59.940> ticks

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
does delete it two ticks three ticks

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.760 
does delete it two ticks three ticks
later<00:04:00.300> it'll<00:04:00.750> actually<00:04:00.900> block<00:04:01.260> it<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.620> just

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
later it'll actually block it so it just

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.920 
later it'll actually block it so it just
stops<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.459> from<00:04:02.520> sharing<00:04:03.180> happy<00:04:03.330> particles

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
stops it from sharing happy particles

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.650 
stops it from sharing happy particles
when<00:04:04.140> it<00:04:04.290> actually<00:04:04.470> deleted<00:04:04.980> items<00:04:05.340> okay<00:04:05.880> how

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
when it actually deleted items okay how
