00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
lotta reasons law but here's the RAM

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.670 
lotta reasons law but here's the RAM
it's<00:01:13.890> an<00:01:14.189> um<00:01:14.850> looks<00:01:15.090> quite<00:01:15.600> good<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.470> do<00:01:16.530> say

Cherica<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.400> would<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:21.030> buy<00:01:21.509> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
Cherica to this I would really buy it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
Cherica to this I would really buy it
it's<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.320> 2000<00:01:22.950> mega<00:01:23.159> hug<00:01:23.479> 1.65<00:01:24.479> volts<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.220> 911

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
it's a 2000 mega hug 1.65 volts and 911

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.880 
it's a 2000 mega hug 1.65 volts and 911
927<00:01:27.000> timing<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> bus<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.439> it's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
927 timing so not the bus but it's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.380 
927 timing so not the bus but it's
pretty<00:01:29.040> good<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:29.280> its<00:01:29.549> equivalent<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.180> what<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
pretty good for its equivalent of what I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.090 
pretty good for its equivalent of what I
got<00:01:30.600> now<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.110> eight<00:01:31.259> games<00:01:31.530> instead<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.890> four

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
got now but eight games instead of four

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.830 
got now but eight games instead of four
and<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.579> black<00:01:32.880> which<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.329> going<00:01:33.540> for

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and it's all black which I'm going for

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
and it's all black which I'm going for
besides<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> copper<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.189> think<00:01:35.430> that

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
besides the copper would I think that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.789 
besides the copper would I think that
complements<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> look<00:01:36.450> i<00:01:36.720> agree<00:01:37.020> um<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> yeah

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
complements the look i agree um so yeah

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.120 
complements the look i agree um so yeah
