without tearing them apart and getting
in<00:00:39.870> there<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.020> see<00:00:40.350> what<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.650> I'm<00:00:40.950> not

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
in there to see what there is I'm not

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.130 
in there to see what there is I'm not
really<00:00:41.250> sure<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.210> back<00:00:42.330> all<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.989> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
really sure in the back all we have is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.530 
really sure in the back all we have is
preload<00:00:43.650> as<00:00:43.830> adjustability<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.820> obviously<00:00:45.420> at

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
preload as adjustability so obviously at

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.260 
preload as adjustability so obviously at
some<00:00:45.750> point<00:00:46.129> provided<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.340> forks<00:00:47.730> are<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
some point provided the forks are the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.810 
some point provided the forks are the
same<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:49.500> could<00:00:49.710> put<00:00:49.920> surrogate<00:00:50.340> Forks<00:00:50.640> into

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
same you could put surrogate Forks into

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.780 
same you could put surrogate Forks into
this<00:00:51.030> from<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.330> 675<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.230> also<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> 675<00:00:53.460> shock

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
this from the 675 and also a 675 shock

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.970 
this from the 675 and also a 675 shock
if<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.750> bolts<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.440> you've<00:00:55.560> got<00:00:55.739> pretty

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
if that bolts in then you've got pretty

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.380 
if that bolts in then you've got pretty
cheap<00:00:56.250> upgrades<00:00:56.700> and<00:00:56.880> the<00:00:56.940> bikes<00:00:57.150> fully

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
cheap upgrades and the bikes fully

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.990 
cheap upgrades and the bikes fully
adjustable<00:00:57.810> and<00:00:58.110> that<00:00:58.829> will<00:00:59.010> make<00:00:59.130> it<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.430> lot

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
adjustable and that will make it a lot

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.670 
adjustable and that will make it a lot
better<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.570> ride<00:01:00.810> so<00:01:01.110> let's<00:01:01.380> get<00:01:01.500> some

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
better of a ride so let's get some

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.040 
better of a ride so let's get some
measure<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.399> we<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:03.050> alright

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
measure in and see what we got alright

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.969 
measure in and see what we got alright
with<00:01:04.199> Dave<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.589> bike<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:04.920> 180<00:01:05.610> pounds

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
with Dave on the bike at 180 pounds

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.150 
with Dave on the bike at 180 pounds
we'll<00:01:07.979> use<00:01:08.009> in<00:01:09.050> the<00:01:10.050> end<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.440> axle<00:01:10.890> here

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
we'll use in the end of the axle here

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.440 
we'll use in the end of the axle here
and<00:01:11.369> go<00:01:11.520> into<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.910> top<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.960> heel<00:01:13.320> guard<00:01:17.450> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and go into the top of the heel guard so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.600 
and go into the top of the heel guard so
we're<00:01:19.050> at<00:01:19.229> 50<00:01:19.560> millimeters<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.220> sag<00:01:20.399> in<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
we're at 50 millimeters of sag in the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.109 
we're at 50 millimeters of sag in the
back<00:01:20.729> at<00:01:20.880> 180<00:01:21.660> pounds<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.040> that's<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.940> little

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
back at 180 pounds so that's a little

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.029 
back at 180 pounds so that's a little
bit<00:01:24.270> much<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.930> may<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.170> able<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.590> change<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
bit much you may be able to change the

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:27.559 
bit much you may be able to change the
spring<00:01:26.280> tension<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.789> bring<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> back<00:01:27.209> into

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
spring tension to bring it back into

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.380 
spring tension to bring it back into
line<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.990> 40<00:01:28.410> but<00:01:28.920> at<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.130> point<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:30.090> seems

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
line at 40 but at this point that seems

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.059 
line at 40 but at this point that seems
awfully<00:01:30.810> soft<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> spring<00:01:31.679> so<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.950> may

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:32.069 
awfully soft on the spring so you may

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.850 
awfully soft on the spring so you may
want<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> change<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.209> spring<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.679> we

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
want to change the spring and as we

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.380 
want to change the spring and as we
discussed<00:01:35.009> earlier<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.670> may<00:01:35.910> want<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.179> even

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
discussed earlier you may want to even

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.630 
discussed earlier you may want to even
see<00:01:36.569> if<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.810> stark<00:01:37.110> shock<00:01:37.410> from<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.679> 675<00:01:38.280> bolts

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
see if the stark shock from a 675 bolts

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.930 
see if the stark shock from a 675 bolts
in<00:01:38.789> onto<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> forks<00:01:40.289> well<00:01:41.220> they're<00:01:41.399> extremely

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
in onto the forks well they're extremely

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.260 
in onto the forks well they're extremely
soft<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.690> well<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.580> at<00:01:44.580> this<00:01:44.729> point<00:01:44.970> almost

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
soft as well so at this point almost

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.219 
soft as well so at this point almost
half<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.660> travels<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.319> 180<00:01:46.890> pounds<00:01:47.310> so

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
half the travels going at 180 pounds so

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.830 
half the travels going at 180 pounds so
see<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> 675<00:01:50.130> Forks<00:01:50.670> bolt<00:01:50.940> in<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.630> wheels

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
see if the 675 Forks bolt in the wheels

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.990 
see if the 675 Forks bolt in the wheels
no<00:01:52.140> doubt<00:01:52.319> the<00:01:52.530> same<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.069> then<00:01:53.670> you've<00:01:53.819> got<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
no doubt the same and then you've got a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
no doubt the same and then you've got a
completely<00:01:54.420> adjustable<00:01:54.929> bike<00:01:55.200> again<00:01:55.560> such<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
completely adjustable bike again such a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.040 
completely adjustable bike again such a
shame<00:01:56.700> for<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.970> street<00:01:57.330> bike<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.660> this<00:01:57.690> you

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
shame for a street bike like this you

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.809 
shame for a street bike like this you
think<00:01:58.229> they<00:01:58.410> keep<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.860> same<00:01:59.069> componentry

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
think they keep the same componentry

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.400 
think they keep the same componentry
but<00:02:00.179> to<00:02:00.300> get<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.479> price<00:02:00.690> point<00:02:00.929> where<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.229> is

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
but to get the price point where it is

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.350 
but to get the price point where it is
we<00:02:02.160> end<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.429> with<00:02:02.580> these<00:02:02.729> suspension

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
we end up with these suspension

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.029 
we end up with these suspension
components<00:02:04.099> now<00:02:05.099> with<00:02:05.280> Chris<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> bike<00:02:05.910> at

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
components now with Chris on the bike at

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:15.440 
components now with Chris on the bike at
240<00:02:08.039> pounds<00:02:09.349> yikes

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.420 

we're<00:02:16.450> at<00:02:16.569> 60<00:02:17.019> millimeters<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> sec<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.159> if

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
we're at 60 millimeters a sec so if

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.539 
we're at 60 millimeters a sec so if
you're<00:02:18.940> 220<00:02:19.840> or<00:02:19.959> over<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:20.440> bike<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.920> unsafe

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
discussed in the past when the back of

discussed in the past when the back of
the<00:02:33.819> bike<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.569> soft<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.440> will<00:02:36.220> extend<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
the bike is so soft it will extend the

the bike is so soft it will extend the
front<00:02:37.060> forks<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.720> make<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> sac<00:02:38.290> reading

really<00:02:39.250> not<00:02:39.579> that<00:02:39.730> appropriate<00:02:40.329> but<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:41.620> it

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
really not that appropriate but with it
