00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.830
 he is totally citizen 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.810
 competes under the modality that all 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.670
 tournament takes place in a single day with 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.769
 what to be a champion must be won 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.299
 three or four fights separated only by 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.299
 minutes one from another 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.740
 his teaching method consists of 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.170
 train the superior combat and also 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.779
 the one that occurs on the ground basically to 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.570
 through it and that is what usually 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.210
 resolve the fights 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.520
 says that this is a rope chess and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.050
 each key has its counter because the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.180
 experts know that to win it 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.960
 requires knowing how to execute techniques and that 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 the brutal violence does not help much 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.180
 I also feel that it is not just a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.690
 refined technique 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.489
 is full of blows never 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.000
 what are the ones that most wake up a 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.949
 public eager for those seconds not so from 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 those that the fight is posed as the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.930
 mentioned body chess but cristian 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.150
 I insist 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.160
 here there is no institution from 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.089
 found with orders but on hair with 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.089
 some kind of techniques 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.159
 the business of violence because it was a 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.770
 Competitor person is protected 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.490
 to copy stronger the opponent 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:23.250
 in boxing and receives 500 600 blows in 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.250
 it but 50 60 death ago in boxing 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.220
 and always all stations by 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.280
 completion here if you had control of 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.159
 your emotions 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.899
 and you 're going to lose, you 're going to lose 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.759
 within the preparation is by 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.619
 example the exhaustive reinforcement of 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.090
 neck musculature essential 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.219
 to withstand the attacks with james 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.969
 he does it by lifting first 10 kilos 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.969
 for warm up 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.930
 and then 25 kilos to strengthen you 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.180
 another part of the body that should be 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.850
 particularly trained is the quill 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.100
 a good blow of them can disarm 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.840
 a defensive position 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.549
 cristian you have special sessions for 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.650
 develop the force of your blow with 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.719
 she 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.719
 [Music] 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.730
 in the world of the greats of this 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.140
 activity the awards can arrive 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.140
 about 200,000 US dollars 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.690
 the first day of struggles is worth everything 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.599
 in Chile- organized by Christians not 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.159
 no money bag is discussed 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.170
 it just looked like there was market for 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.940
 think about investing in it 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.640
 it was a night of Ã¡vila in which the 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.140
 old club mex revived its atmosphere of 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.960
 clandestine club 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.990
 inside the center for something rude as 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.820
 want to see 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.820
 and the dream of cristian was underway 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.540
 [Applause] 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.880
 [Music] 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.840
 [Applause] 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.940
 he and a friend of his trained two groups 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.440
 I do not travel classroom but a small ring in 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.260
 half of a packed room 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.180
 [Applause] 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.830
 some precautions were taken as 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.590
 avoid in most combats that 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.230
 there would be a spike 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.650
 was made with the Russian rule of a round 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.650
 long 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.890
 I was using put two or three for the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.950
 five 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.950
 [Music] 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.740
 there were moments of undoubted high attention 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.390
 [Applause] 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.370
 [Music] 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.440
 this is barbaric combat technique to 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.680
 maximum voltage that will give type of each 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.680
 one 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.140
 [Applause] 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.460
 [Music] 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.870
 [Applause] 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.070
 with the precaution of only allowing 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.070
 adults 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.050
 the best moment of the night was 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.750
 an unequal fight between the marin 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.380
 US ninety a meter 96 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.840
 kilos 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.840
 edu high at 30 kilos below 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.069
 and knew how to hold until the touch 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.250
 He knew how to create a separate show with the 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.650
 easy analogy of the powerful versus the d 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.870
 and then he knew how to beat an exhausted 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.970
 military that did not believe that this could be 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.950
 possible 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.730
 [Applause] 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.680
 [Music] 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.570
 this sport is breaking with everyone 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.940
 the combat blows and neither does it look 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.580
 have age limit in Russia is seen 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.840
 as an activity so normal that there 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.240
 children's championships of this 33 15 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.560
 and the only major precaution is that the 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.190
 little fighters have more 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.190
 protection 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.950
 but in the USA and in many parts of 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.350
 europe simply this is seen as 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.060
 something too extreme the fighters are 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.910
 defend with the simple argument that 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.620
 unlike many other sports 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.119
 here nobody died yet 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:12.989
 [Music] 

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:15.629
 a true street fighter they 

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:17.789
 they could learn we're just trying 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.619
 we're not here for that big nose those 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.599
 bones and send people to the hospital 

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:23.639
 we are here to have a fight 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.049
 intense between two better I think that 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.329
 Our sport is completely 

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:28.529
 legitimate the reason because I feel that this 

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:30.119
 that's the way it is because I've never been 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:32.280
 seriously injured and has never hurt 

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:34.410
 seriously anyone 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.910
 the doctors who supervise this sport 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.210
 confirm that the most serious injuries 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.990
 they can be to the joints 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:46.069
 punching kicks and knees 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.069
 they do not produce so much damage 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.590
 then these people have to be 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.190
 prepared the people who come here 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.289
 it's not the people who lack a little 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.980
 more than rent to see this 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.289
 but with respect to the right now 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.419
 and I have seen it now 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.870
 has had much less impact than 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.760
 those that come out 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.160
 the patient the person who is in the 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.750
 prison much less injured than what 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.409
 I have seen 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.849
 [Music] 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.830
 but nobody says that in the future and 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.539
 some victim especially because of the speed 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.270
 with which you can hit the trachea or the 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:26.060
 nape even if prohibited 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.060
 about the idea of saying I'm now
