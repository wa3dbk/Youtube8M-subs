for on the high end here they are an

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.649 
for on the high end here they are an
absolute<00:01:24.780> bitch<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.290> sleeve<00:01:26.210> because<00:01:27.210> ones

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
absolute bitch to sleeve because ones

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.620 
absolute bitch to sleeve because ones
like<00:01:27.869> these<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> funky<00:01:29.040> 20<00:01:29.880> x<00:01:30.060> 8<00:01:30.329> pin

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
like these have the funky 20 x 8 pin

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.310 
like these have the funky 20 x 8 pin
instead<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.470> standard<00:01:31.860> straight<00:01:32.189> through

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
instead of a standard straight through

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.740 
instead of a standard straight through
24<00:01:34.320> pin<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:36.000> makes<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.329> bitch<00:01:36.509> because

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
24 pin and that makes it a bitch because

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.609 
24 pin and that makes it a bitch because
cables<00:01:37.380> loop<00:01:37.950> out<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.729> loop<00:01:39.180> back<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
cables loop out and loop back and so the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.899 
cables loop out and loop back and so the
same<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.159> connect<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> three<00:01:41.759> different

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
same one will connect to three different

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.280 
same one will connect to three different
places<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.509> kind<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.810> bitch<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.170> you're

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
places it's kind of a bitch if you're

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.740 
places it's kind of a bitch if you're
not<00:01:43.439> completely<00:01:43.950> pulling<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.090> pins<00:01:45.570> now

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
not completely pulling out all pins now

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.469 
not completely pulling out all pins now
we<00:01:45.810> did<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.909> but<00:01:47.909> still<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
we did do that here but still it's a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.550

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.520 
side and it's always a hell of a lot
easier<00:01:59.399> when<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.450> from<00:02:00.689> left<00:02:01.140> pin<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
easier when you can go from left pin to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.620 
easier when you can go from left pin to
left<00:02:01.740> pin<00:02:01.950> instead<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.520> left<00:02:02.759> pane<00:02:03.030> goes<00:02:03.299> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
left pin instead of left pane goes to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.930 
left pin instead of left pane goes to
front<00:02:04.110> right<00:02:04.409> third<00:02:05.250> from<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.490> center<00:02:05.820> pin<00:02:07.940> so

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
front right third from the center pin so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.669 
front right third from the center pin so
well<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> mean<00:02:09.810> everything<00:02:10.020> sleeves<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.590> it

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
well I mean everything sleeves and it

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.990 
well I mean everything sleeves and it
looks<00:02:10.860> okay<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.310> also<00:02:11.489> makes<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
looks okay but it also makes it a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.330 
looks okay but it also makes it a
impossible<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.870> do<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.290> sleeping<00:02:14.770> combination

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
impossible to do a sleeping combination

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.310 
impossible to do a sleeping combination
you<00:02:16.030> notice<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.360> do<00:02:16.420> not<00:02:16.570> have<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.840> same

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
you notice I do not have the same

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.840 
you notice I do not have the same
sleeping<00:02:17.830> set<00:02:17.980> over<00:02:18.160> there<00:02:18.310> as<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.550> do<00:02:18.610> over

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
sleeping set over there as I do over

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.640 
sleeping set over there as I do over
here<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.270> that's<00:02:19.450> because<00:02:19.660> obviously<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
here and that's because obviously the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.070 
here and that's because obviously the
cable<00:02:20.980> that's<00:02:21.220> on<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.180> far<00:02:22.300> left<00:02:22.540> here<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.930> not

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
cable that's on the far left here is not

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.240 
cable that's on the far left here is not
the<00:02:23.110> cable<00:02:23.410> that's<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.710> far<00:02:23.830> left<00:02:24.070> there

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the cable that's on the far left there

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.770 
the cable that's on the far left there
because<00:02:24.580> they<00:02:24.700> don't<00:02:24.850> do<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> pinouts<00:02:25.420> on<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
because they don't do the pinouts on the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.340 
because they don't do the pinouts on the
inside<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.170> power<00:02:26.290> supply<00:02:26.500> they<00:02:26.830> do<00:02:28.350> they

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
inside of the power supply they do they

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.070 
inside of the power supply they do they
do<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:30.130> conversion<00:02:30.760> from<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.690> connector

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
do the the conversion from the connector

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.199 
do the the conversion from the connector
side<00:02:32.290> which<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.590> kind<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.040> bitch<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:33.430> then

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
side which is kind of a bitch but then

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.030 
side which is kind of a bitch but then
again<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.780> have<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.080> really<00:02:35.410> nice<00:02:35.530> solid<00:02:35.890> power

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
again you have a really nice solid power

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.130 
again you have a really nice solid power
supply<00:02:36.600> that's<00:02:37.600> going<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.810> last<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.080> for

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
supply that's going to last you for

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.390 
supply that's going to last you for
quite<00:02:38.440> some<00:02:38.620> time<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.800> think<00:02:39.040> comes<00:02:39.190> with<00:02:39.370> a

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
quite some time I think comes with a

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.230 
quite some time I think comes with a
seven-year<00:02:39.850> warranty<00:02:40.020> which<00:02:41.020> is<00:02:42.060> quite<00:02:43.060> nice

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
seven-year warranty which is quite nice

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.100 
seven-year warranty which is quite nice
and<00:02:43.510> i<00:02:43.540> bet<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:43.930> system<00:02:44.380> gosh<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.930> built<00:02:46.930> this

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
and i bet this system gosh I built this

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.910 
and i bet this system gosh I built this
system<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:48.430> last<00:02:48.790> him<00:02:49.120> for<00:02:49.450> ever<00:02:49.810> or<00:02:50.200> for<00:02:50.709> quite

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
system to last him for ever or for quite

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.620 
system to last him for ever or for quite
a<00:02:50.950> bit<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.280> time<00:02:51.310> particularly<00:02:52.300> when<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:52.510> have

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
a bit of time particularly when you have

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.180 
a bit of time particularly when you have
something<00:02:52.810> as<00:02:53.020> funky<00:02:53.320> as<00:02:53.350> this<00:02:53.620> where<00:02:53.920> we<00:02:54.070> are

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
something as funky as this where we are

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.740 
something as funky as this where we are
going<00:02:54.220> the<00:02:54.550> absolute<00:02:54.940> madman<00:02:55.300> round<00:02:55.540> I've

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
going the absolute madman round I've

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.120 
going the absolute madman round I've
talked<00:02:55.959> about<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.290> a<00:02:56.410> couple<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.980> the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
talked about this in a couple of the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.100 
talked about this in a couple of the
other<00:02:57.250> videos<00:02:57.600> basically<00:02:58.600> what<00:02:58.720> we<00:02:58.810> decided

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
other videos basically what we decided

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.470 
other videos basically what we decided
to<00:02:59.200> do<00:02:59.380> here<00:02:59.830> is<00:02:59.950> this<00:03:00.400> client<00:03:00.910> had<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.180> server

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
to do here is this client had a server

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.940 
to do here is this client had a server
that<00:03:01.540> died<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.110> was<00:03:02.200> looking<00:03:02.560> for<00:03:02.739> something

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
that died and was looking for something

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.340 
that died and was looking for something
a<00:03:03.489> little<00:03:03.580> bit<00:03:04.000> odd<00:03:04.209> ball<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:05.470> use<00:03:06.370> as<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.580> server

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
a little bit odd ball to use as a server

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
a little bit odd ball to use as a server
now<00:03:08.350> we<00:03:08.410> obviously<00:03:08.650> could<00:03:09.100> have<00:03:09.190> gone<00:03:09.340> with

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
now we obviously could have gone with

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.690 
now we obviously could have gone with
you<00:03:10.030> know<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.660> normal<00:03:10.810> ATX<00:03:11.380> system<00:03:11.980> grabbed<00:03:12.550> a

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
you know a normal ATX system grabbed a

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.330 
you know a normal ATX system grabbed a
bunch<00:03:12.820> of<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.930> know<00:03:13.959> pcie<00:03:14.560> pcie<00:03:16.049> cards

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
bunch of you know pcie pcie cards

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.890 
bunch of you know pcie pcie cards
connect<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.549> but<00:03:18.700> crap<00:03:19.000> ton<00:03:19.239> of<00:03:19.420> SATA<00:03:19.600> ports

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
connect that but crap ton of SATA ports

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.820 
connect that but crap ton of SATA ports
I<00:03:19.989> mean<00:03:20.110> we<00:03:20.230> could<00:03:20.350> have<00:03:20.440> done<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.650> same<00:03:20.680> thing

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
I mean we could have done the same thing

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.259 
I mean we could have done the same thing
we've<00:03:21.040> done<00:03:21.070> here<00:03:21.370> with<00:03:21.580> SATA<00:03:21.910> drives

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
we've done here with SATA drives

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.550 
we've done here with SATA drives
essentially<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.739> we<00:03:23.769> could<00:03:24.130> have<00:03:24.220> gotten<00:03:25.560> 230

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
essentially and we could have gotten 230

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.729 
essentially and we could have gotten 230
terabytes<00:03:27.280> ish<00:03:27.549> which<00:03:28.390> they<00:03:29.110> would<00:03:29.470> have<00:03:29.560> cost

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
terabytes ish which they would have cost

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.210 
terabytes ish which they would have cost
an<00:03:29.920> absolute<00:03:30.040> fortune<00:03:30.280> but<00:03:30.820> be<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:32.530> know<00:03:32.680> it's

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
an absolute fortune but be you know it's

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.610 
an absolute fortune but be you know it's
kind<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.489> been<00:03:33.640> done<00:03:33.850> to<00:03:34.000> death<00:03:34.380> anybody<00:03:35.380> can

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
kind of been done to death anybody can

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.670 
kind of been done to death anybody can
just<00:03:35.860> grab<00:03:36.070> and<00:03:36.820> they<00:03:37.450> do<00:03:37.510> can<00:03:38.049> just<00:03:38.290> grab<00:03:38.470> as

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
just grab and they do can just grab as

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.050 
just grab and they do can just grab as
many<00:03:38.830> say<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.160> ports<00:03:39.489> as<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:39.700> want<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.000> you

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
many say to ports as you want and you

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.319 
many say to ports as you want and you
connect<00:03:40.330> up<00:03:40.450> what<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.690> want<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:43.090> know<00:03:43.180> it's

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
connect up what you want you know it's

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.930 
connect up what you want you know it's
probably<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.720> little<00:03:43.810> more<00:03:44.459> safe<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.730> do<00:03:45.820> it

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
probably a little more safe to do it

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.910 
probably a little more safe to do it
that<00:03:46.060> way<00:03:46.209> what<00:03:46.959> we<00:03:47.110> decided<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.500> do<00:03:47.680> was<00:03:47.890> a

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
that way what we decided to do was a

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.020 
that way what we decided to do was a
completely<00:03:48.489> left<00:03:48.760> field<00:03:49.120> lilly<00:03:49.540> ash<00:03:50.820> we<00:03:51.820> just

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
completely left field lilly ash we just

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.569 
completely left field lilly ash we just
dog<00:03:52.660> over<00:03:52.930> there<00:03:53.010> we<00:03:54.010> decided<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.489> go

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
dog over there we decided to go

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.789 
dog over there we decided to go
completely<00:03:54.760> left<00:03:55.329> field<00:03:55.630> with<00:03:55.840> this<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.380> just

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
completely left field with this and just

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.259 
completely left field with this and just
goes<00:03:56.980> completely<00:03:57.190> outside<00:03:57.519> of<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.730> box<00:03:57.880> as<00:03:58.180> we

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
goes completely outside of the box as we

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.970 
goes completely outside of the box as we
can<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:59.079> what<00:03:59.230> we've<00:03:59.380> literally<00:03:59.739> done

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
can and so what we've literally done

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.620 
can and so what we've literally done
here<00:04:00.280> as<00:04:00.640> I<00:04:00.760> mentioned<00:04:01.030> earlier<00:04:01.060> these<00:04:01.480> are

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
here as I mentioned earlier these are

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
one that's hard in there is the MPC the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.440 
one that's hard in there is the MPC the

chassis<00:05:38.580> in<00:05:39.580> fact<00:05:39.820> I<00:05:39.940> should<00:05:40.060> probably<00:05:40.150> show

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
chassis in fact I should probably show

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.940 
chassis in fact I should probably show
you<00:05:40.540> all<00:05:40.630> the<00:05:40.750> different<00:05:40.780> little<00:05:41.140> pieces<00:05:41.260> you

you all the different little pieces you
know<00:05:42.070> we've<00:05:42.310> got<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:43.300> side<00:05:43.600> rails<00:05:43.840> that

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
know we've got the side rails that

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.010 
know we've got the side rails that
supports<00:05:44.530> these<00:05:44.860> drives<00:05:45.480> you<00:05:46.480> notice<00:05:46.720> down<00:05:46.870> at

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
supports these drives you notice down at

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.840 
supports these drives you notice down at
the<00:05:47.110> bottom<00:05:47.380> there<00:05:47.710> there's<00:05:48.160> a<00:05:48.220> runner<00:05:48.490> those

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
the bottom there there's a runner those

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.010 
the bottom there there's a runner those
runners<00:05:49.120> go<00:05:49.330> around<00:05:49.570> the<00:05:49.630> whole<00:05:49.720> thing

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
runners go around the whole thing

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.550 
runners go around the whole thing
there's<00:05:50.800> to<00:05:51.040> support<00:05:51.460> channels<00:05:51.790> right<00:05:51.940> there

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
there's to support channels right there

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.540 
there's to support channels right there
there's<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.590> couple<00:05:53.740> of<00:05:53.950> support<00:05:54.250> channels

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
there's a couple of support channels

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.950 
there's a couple of support channels
underneath<00:05:54.850> this<00:05:54.970> power<00:05:55.210> supply<00:05:55.450> here<00:05:55.660> even

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
underneath this power supply here even

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.710 
underneath this power supply here even
though<00:05:56.050> they're<00:05:56.200> actually<00:05:56.530> not<00:05:56.560> necessary

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
though they're actually not necessary

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.120 
though they're actually not necessary
well<00:05:58.720> of<00:05:59.260> course<00:05:59.410> it's<00:05:59.590> just<00:05:59.710> all<00:05:59.860> bolts

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
well of course it's just all bolts

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.830 
well of course it's just all bolts
together<00:06:00.250> I'm<00:06:00.970> going<00:06:01.300> to<00:06:01.360> walk<00:06:01.450> around<00:06:01.600> the

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
together I'm going to walk around the

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.159 
together I'm going to walk around the
thing<00:06:01.960> then<00:06:02.669> we<00:06:03.669> come<00:06:03.850> down<00:06:04.090> I<00:06:04.450> had<00:06:05.020> these

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
thing then we come down I had these

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.590 
thing then we come down I had these
fabricated<00:06:05.830> you<00:06:06.280> know<00:06:06.370> nothing<00:06:06.790> drastic<00:06:07.450> but

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
fabricated you know nothing drastic but

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.710 
fabricated you know nothing drastic but
these<00:06:07.750> are<00:06:07.900> just<00:06:08.580> half<00:06:09.580> inch<00:06:09.790> bar<00:06:10.030> stock<00:06:10.360> that

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
these are just half inch bar stock that

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.990 
these are just half inch bar stock that
they<00:06:10.750> turn<00:06:11.020> hairpin<00:06:11.710> and<00:06:11.919> make<00:06:12.730> a<00:06:12.760> little

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
they turn hairpin and make a little

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.460 
they turn hairpin and make a little
corner<00:06:13.240> piece<00:06:13.390> out<00:06:13.540> of<00:06:13.720> and<00:06:14.169> of<00:06:14.260> course<00:06:14.410> you

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
corner piece out of and of course you

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.560 
corner piece out of and of course you
can<00:06:14.590> just<00:06:14.740> screw<00:06:14.919> those<00:06:15.070> in<00:06:15.360> since<00:06:16.360> we're

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
can just screw those in since we're

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.010 
can just screw those in since we're
dealing<00:06:16.630> with<00:06:16.780> wood<00:06:17.050> and<00:06:17.260> go<00:06:18.250> ahead<00:06:18.460> and<00:06:19.020> look

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
dealing with wood and go ahead and look

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.140 
dealing with wood and go ahead and look
under<00:06:20.380> here<00:06:20.410> I<00:06:20.740> don't<00:06:20.919> know<00:06:20.980> how<00:06:21.130> much<00:06:21.910> of<00:06:22.090> this

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
under here I don't know how much of this

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.900 
under here I don't know how much of this
really<00:06:22.480> gonna<00:06:22.570> be<00:06:22.690> able<00:06:22.810> to<00:06:22.870> see<00:06:23.190> but<00:06:24.190> the

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
really gonna be able to see but the

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:37.710 
really gonna be able to see but the
little<00:06:25.120> blinking<00:06:25.630> light<00:06:25.870> show

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.900 

so<00:06:38.770> you<00:06:39.770> know<00:06:39.860> everything<00:06:40.280> is<00:06:40.400> nice<00:06:40.580> and<00:06:40.610> neat

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
and tidy I know it probably doesn't look

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.470 
and tidy I know it probably doesn't look
like<00:06:42.560> that<00:06:42.590> right<00:06:43.100> now<00:06:43.340> and<00:06:43.640> one<00:06:44.330> of<00:06:44.420> the

like that right now and one of the

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.150 
like that right now and one of the
earlier<00:06:44.840> videos<00:06:44.990> before<00:06:45.410> it<00:06:45.650> was<00:06:45.740> there<00:06:46.100> you

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 
earlier videos before it was there you

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.830 
earlier videos before it was there you
go<00:06:46.280> get<00:06:46.460> some<00:06:46.490> blinking<00:06:46.790> light<00:06:46.970> one<00:06:47.660> of<00:06:47.750> the

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
go get some blinking light one of the

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.050 
go get some blinking light one of the
earlier<00:06:48.140> videos<00:06:48.290> before<00:06:48.620> this<00:06:48.890> was<00:06:49.100> a<00:06:49.280> four<00:06:50.030> I

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
earlier videos before this was a four I

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:54.890 
about a couple of feet where you could

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.610 
about a couple of feet where you could
get<00:06:55.040> under<00:06:55.280> it<00:06:55.310> pull<00:06:55.850> the<00:06:55.940> old<00:06:56.090> mechanic<00:06:56.620> you

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
get under it pull the old mechanic you

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.030 
get under it pull the old mechanic you
were<00:06:57.710> able<00:06:57.800> to<00:06:57.980> see<00:06:58.130> it<00:06:58.220> a<00:06:58.280> little<00:06:58.370> bit<00:06:58.580> better

17-point to tera byte array we're using

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.570 
17-point to tera byte array we're using
15.1<00:07:49.790> terabytes<00:07:50.210> of<00:07:50.330> it<00:07:50.480> right<00:07:50.630> now<00:07:50.810> and<00:07:51.580> of

drives we have 38 USB three drives all

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.630 
drives we have 38 USB three drives all
connected<00:08:00.200> and<00:08:01.630> that's<00:08:02.630> all<00:08:02.810> she<00:08:02.840> wrote<00:08:03.640> so
