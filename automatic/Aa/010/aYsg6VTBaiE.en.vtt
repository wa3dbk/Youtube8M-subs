when knitting your sock you want to stop

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.459 
when knitting your sock you want to stop
knitting<00:00:07.849> about<00:00:08.450> an<00:00:08.780> inch<00:00:09.019> and<00:00:09.230> a<00:00:09.260> half<00:00:09.289> from

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
knitting about an inch and a half from

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.310 
knitting about an inch and a half from
the<00:00:09.920> end<00:00:10.070> so<00:00:10.400> that<00:00:10.760> you<00:00:11.090> can<00:00:11.299> decrease<00:00:11.990> for<00:00:12.200> the

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
the end so that you can decrease for the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.190 
the end so that you can decrease for the
toe<00:00:12.500> as<00:00:12.940> you<00:00:13.940> can<00:00:14.059> see<00:00:14.269> on<00:00:14.389> this<00:00:14.480> finished<00:00:14.929> sock

toe as you can see on this finished sock

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.650 
toe as you can see on this finished sock
the<00:00:15.799> decreases<00:00:16.400> are<00:00:16.430> a<00:00:16.580> lot<00:00:16.820> more<00:00:16.849> drastic

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
the decreases are a lot more drastic

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.470 
the decreases are a lot more drastic
than<00:00:17.689> say<00:00:18.200> the<00:00:18.380> gusset<00:00:18.849> this<00:00:19.849> is<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:20.210> that<00:00:20.390> it

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
than say the gusset this is so that it

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.740 
than say the gusset this is so that it
gives<00:00:20.689> you<00:00:20.900> a<00:00:20.930> nice<00:00:21.619> rounded<00:00:22.369> shape<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:23.000> that

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
gives you a nice rounded shape and that

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.689 
gives you a nice rounded shape and that
really<00:00:24.039> accommodates<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:25.310> shape<00:00:25.519> of<00:00:25.640> your

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
really accommodates the shape of your

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.660 
really accommodates the shape of your
foot<00:00:26.349> we're<00:00:27.349> going<00:00:27.380> to<00:00:27.500> have<00:00:27.650> two<00:00:28.009> decreases

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
foot we're going to have two decreases

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.060 
foot we're going to have two decreases
on<00:00:28.880> each<00:00:29.660> side<00:00:29.990> for<00:00:30.349> a<00:00:30.380> total<00:00:30.410> of<00:00:30.769> four

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
on each side for a total of four

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.700 
on each side for a total of four
decreases<00:00:31.670> per<00:00:31.880> round<00:00:35.199> here's<00:00:36.199> the<00:00:36.379> sock<00:00:36.559> that

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
decreases per round here's the sock that

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.789 
decreases per round here's the sock that
I'm<00:00:36.830> working<00:00:37.250> on<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:37.930> I've<00:00:38.930> gotten<00:00:39.559> down<00:00:39.739> to

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:39.799 
I'm working on and I've gotten down to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:41.410 
I'm working on and I've gotten down to
about<00:00:40.159> an<00:00:40.460> inch<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.790> half<00:00:40.820> from<00:00:41.150> where<00:00:41.239> I

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
about an inch and a half from where I

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.039 
about an inch and a half from where I
want<00:00:41.720> to<00:00:41.809> have<00:00:42.409> that<00:00:42.559> stop<00:00:43.269> my<00:00:44.269> round<00:00:44.510> starts

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:45.049 
want to have that stop my round starts

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:50.200 
want to have that stop my round starts
at<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.739> bottom<00:00:46.040> of<00:00:46.159> my<00:00:46.190> foot<00:00:48.820> so<00:00:49.820> I'm<00:00:49.879> going<00:00:50.150> to

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
at the bottom of my foot so I'm going to

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.380 
at the bottom of my foot so I'm going to
be<00:00:50.390> doing<00:00:50.750> four<00:00:51.739> decreases<00:00:52.460> in<00:00:52.729> this<00:00:53.059> round

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
be doing four decreases in this round

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.109 
be doing four decreases in this round
and<00:00:53.720> alternating<00:00:54.619> that<00:00:54.890> with<00:00:55.159> just<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.670> knit

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:56.119 
and alternating that with just a knit

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:01.660 
and alternating that with just a knit
round<00:00:57.519> so<00:00:58.519> I'm<00:00:58.640> going<00:00:58.939> to<00:00:59.059> start<00:01:00.070> by<00:01:01.070> knitting

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
round so I'm going to start by knitting

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:15.280 
round so I'm going to start by knitting
seven<00:01:02.510> stitches

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.890 

this<00:01:16.040> won't<00:01:16.280> necessarily<00:01:16.370> be<00:01:17.060> seven<00:01:17.660> stitches

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
this won't necessarily be seven stitches

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.170 
this won't necessarily be seven stitches
in<00:01:18.230> your<00:01:18.260> pattern<00:01:18.680> just<00:01:19.400> do<00:01:19.640> what<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:19.850> pattern

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
in your pattern just do what the pattern

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.230 
in your pattern just do what the pattern
says<00:01:20.770> then<00:01:21.770> I'm<00:01:21.890> going<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.130> place<00:01:22.730> a<00:01:22.760> stitch

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
says then I'm going to place a stitch

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.240 
says then I'm going to place a stitch
marker<00:01:23.270> there<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.350> know<00:01:24.470> every<00:01:25.040> time<00:01:25.190> I

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
marker there so that I know every time I

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.590 
marker there so that I know every time I
reach<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:25.670> part<00:01:25.910> of<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.030> round<00:01:26.240> that's

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
reach that part of the round that's

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.200 
reach that part of the round that's
where<00:01:26.840> I'm<00:01:26.930> going<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.200> be<00:01:27.290> decreasing<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.210> for

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
where I'm going to be decreasing and for

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.480 
where I'm going to be decreasing and for
this<00:01:29.330> particular<00:01:29.930> one<00:01:30.200> I'm<00:01:30.650> going<00:01:31.160> to<00:01:31.370> be

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
this particular one I'm going to be

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.820 
this particular one I'm going to be
doing<00:01:31.640> an<00:01:31.940> S<00:01:32.090> KP<00:01:32.740> I'm<00:01:33.740> going<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:33.980> slip<00:01:34.280> one<00:01:35.830> and

doing an S KP I'm going to slip one and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.730 
doing an S KP I'm going to slip one and
knit<00:01:37.220> one<00:01:38.560> I'm<00:01:39.560> passing<00:01:40.190> this<00:01:40.600> stitch<00:01:41.740> back

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
knit one I'm passing this stitch back

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.060 
knit one I'm passing this stitch back
over<00:01:44.710> then<00:01:45.710> I'm<00:01:45.830> going<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.160> knit<00:01:46.550> two<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.920> that

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
over then I'm going to knit two so that

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.280 
over then I'm going to knit two so that
my<00:01:49.190> decreases<00:01:49.880> aren't<00:01:50.210> right<00:01:50.540> next<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.140> each

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
my decreases aren't right next to each

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:05.510 
my decreases aren't right next to each
other<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:57.009> knit<00:01:58.009> two<00:01:58.280> together

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:48.089 

after<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:08.660> I'm<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.080> knit<00:02:10.259> 14

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.459 

and<00:02:48.670> again<00:02:49.150> I'm<00:02:49.299> going<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.599> place<00:02:49.989> a<00:02:50.019> stitch

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:50.469 
and again I'm going to place a stitch

00:02:50.469 --> 00:03:02.449 
and again I'm going to place a stitch
marker<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:55.420> again<00:02:56.430> skp<00:02:58.079> slip

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:21.949 

pass<00:03:03.459> back<00:03:03.790> over<00:03:07.530> knit<00:03:08.530> two

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.400 

and<00:03:22.500> knit<00:03:22.680> two<00:03:22.920> together

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:44.089 

for<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.040> knit<00:03:28.250> seven

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.069 

so<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.730> important<00:03:45.150> things<00:03:45.359> to<00:03:45.599> note<00:03:45.810> about

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
so the important things to note about

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.449 
so the important things to note about
this<00:03:47.389> that<00:03:48.389> I'm<00:03:48.599> decreasing<00:03:49.409> on<00:03:49.650> both<00:03:50.129> sides

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
this that I'm decreasing on both sides

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.890 
this that I'm decreasing on both sides
of<00:03:50.639> my<00:03:50.760> sock<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.329> that<00:03:51.450> all<00:03:51.569> it'll<00:03:51.719> come

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
of my sock so that all it'll come

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.420 
of my sock so that all it'll come
together<00:03:52.549> and<00:03:53.719> I'm<00:03:55.159> decreasing<00:03:56.159> four

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
together and I'm decreasing four

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.309 
together and I'm decreasing four
stitches<00:03:57.319> per<00:03:58.319> round<00:03:59.569> again<00:04:00.569> this<00:04:00.810> is<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.139> that

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
stitches per round again this is so that

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.849 
stitches per round again this is so that
we<00:04:01.439> get<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.950> final<00:04:02.879> shape<00:04:03.120> that's<00:04:03.420> more<00:04:03.859> pointed

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
we get a final shape that's more pointed

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.550 
we get a final shape that's more pointed
and<00:04:05.099> comes<00:04:05.310> together<00:04:06.019> rather<00:04:07.019> than<00:04:07.290> something

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
and comes together rather than something

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.059 
and comes together rather than something
that's<00:04:07.739> really<00:04:08.189> gradual<00:04:09.859> there<00:04:10.859> are<00:04:10.919> a<00:04:10.950> couple

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
that's really gradual there are a couple

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.099 
that's really gradual there are a couple
of<00:04:11.189> different<00:04:11.519> ways<00:04:11.639> to<00:04:11.669> shape<00:04:12.180> sock<00:04:12.569> toes<00:04:12.840> but

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
of different ways to shape sock toes but

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.370 
of different ways to shape sock toes but
this<00:04:13.230> is<00:04:13.379> probably<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.829> easiest<00:04:14.249> and<00:04:15.199> so<00:04:16.199> that

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
this is probably the easiest and so that

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.640 
this is probably the easiest and so that
it<00:04:16.560> doesn't<00:04:16.889> just<00:04:17.609> bunch<00:04:17.940> up<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.590> go<00:04:19.590> too

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
it doesn't just bunch up and go too

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.610 
it doesn't just bunch up and go too
quickly<00:04:20.750> you're<00:04:21.750> going<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:22.079> alternate<00:04:22.530> your

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
quickly you're going to alternate your

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.400 
quickly you're going to alternate your
decrease<00:04:23.160> rounds<00:04:23.699> with<00:04:24.690> rounds<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.139> just

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
decrease rounds with rounds of just

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.450 
decrease rounds with rounds of just
plain<00:04:25.650> knitting<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:27.900> decrease<00:04:28.590> for<00:04:28.949> a<00:04:28.979> knit

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
plain knitting so a decrease for a knit

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.950 
plain knitting so a decrease for a knit
one<00:04:29.639> round<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.590> so<00:04:31.590> on<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.919> sort<00:04:32.070> of<00:04:32.160> so<00:04:32.610> forth

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
one round and so on and sort of so forth

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.390 
one round and so on and sort of so forth
until<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.020> get<00:04:34.289> down<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.949> right<00:04:35.099> number

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
until you get down to the right number

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.879 
until you get down to the right number
of<00:04:35.430> stitches<00:04:36.110> for<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.259> close<00:04:37.440> off<00:04:37.650> when

you come to this stitch marker you're

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.510 
you come to this stitch marker you're
just<00:04:40.500> going<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.800> slip<00:04:41.039> it<00:04:42.889> this<00:04:43.889> is<00:04:44.099> just<00:04:44.400> to

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
just going to slip it this is just to

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.730 
just going to slip it this is just to
indicate<00:04:44.699> where<00:04:45.419> you<00:04:45.810> begin<00:04:46.199> doing<00:04:46.590> your

decreases on each round and it's sort of

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.930 
decreases on each round and it's sort of
helpful<00:04:50.039> so<00:04:50.250> that<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.490> don't<00:04:50.729> necessarily

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
helpful so that you don't necessarily

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.170

have to count each and every time it's
always<00:04:54.240> good<00:04:54.570> to<00:04:54.599> count<00:04:55.440> just<00:04:55.949> to<00:04:56.580> make<00:04:56.759> sure

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
always good to count just to make sure

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.089 
always good to count just to make sure
you're<00:04:57.840> on<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:57.990> round<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:58.650> think<00:04:58.979> you

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
you're on the round that you think you

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.450 
you're on the round that you think you
are<00:05:00.199> but<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:02.190> stitch<00:05:02.430> marker<00:05:02.639> is<00:05:02.970> sort<00:05:03.240> of<00:05:03.330> a

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
are but the stitch marker is sort of a

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.450 
are but the stitch marker is sort of a
handy<00:05:05.460> little<00:05:05.639> tool<00:05:05.909> for<00:05:06.240> that

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.580 

so<00:05:11.030> again<00:05:11.240> you're<00:05:11.510> just<00:05:11.720> going<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:11.960> alternate

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
so again you're just going to alternate

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.360 
so again you're just going to alternate
these<00:05:12.800> rounds<00:05:14.140> until<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.380> are<00:05:15.860> down<00:05:16.100> to<00:05:16.280> the

right number of stitches for you to
graft<00:05:19.070> or<00:05:20.020> do<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.140> Kitchener<00:05:21.590> stitch<00:05:21.620> to

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
close the toe so in my case I think 16

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.970 
close the toe so in my case I think 16
stitches<00:05:28.820> is<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.900> good<00:05:30.170> amount<00:05:30.380> to<00:05:30.710> do<00:05:30.830> the
