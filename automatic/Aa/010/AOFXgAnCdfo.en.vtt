 It's a shame to show you my 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.080
 June reading that is extremely 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.309

 pride that was an incredible taste book 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 much of this reading mainly by 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.779
 end cause the book all depends on the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.279
 year he does on the team of humans 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.250

 with the month when he discovers others 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.140
 only that these humans do not 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.869
 developed as the humans of the earth 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.730
 they are basically rational animals and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.100
 The dominant race of this planet are the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.780
 primates the markets is bigger because I live 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.219
 see this human team ends 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.600
 finding monkey sensitization 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.030
 that have the same 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.160
 things that people science education and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.110

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.899
 written by brÃ¡ulio tavares which is a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.699
 great translator and fantasy writer 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.080
 Brazilian, he makes a very 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.360
 cool book some very points 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.310
 interesting then it was really cool this 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.689
 to enrich the reading of the book in this 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.909
 month for the history visitor discovers 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.490
 the secrets of the universe the big title 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.320
 Kiss in Cali, come out, I do not know what else to say. 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.360
 this man but an incredible one. 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 So beautiful story his writing is 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.720
 very very pretty talk about two 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.820
 friends in the middle of 1,170 1,180 out there 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.259
 Is the president known at the pool? 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.759
 of a club during the summer holidays 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.799
 they have personalities completely 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.930
 they kind of different complements a 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.130
 another he speaks of accepting prejudice 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.799
 a different form is not society 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.840
 not accepting something a character is 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.009
 This character does not accept this. 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.140
 I can talk a lot about what came out of 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.939
 school here but I swear later whoever reads 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.829
 this book has to do with this story 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.119
 beautiful as the deeper than the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.399
 people imagine that you can see that 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.049
 is full of brands because it has 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.759
 many beautiful things I think it's a 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.430
 of the top 10 this year another book that I 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.479
 said 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.130
 when I learned that it is not 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.899
 here or not fiction is called male de 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.880
 Mari's housekeeping tells the book about 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.460
 organization and that it is something that 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.350
 Killer I'm your messy friend but I 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.239
 I'm messed up in a way that they understand 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.920
 my mess and had a lot of fun 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.519
 let go of the truth I wanted to do 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.099

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.580
 organized of the minimum type of minimum only 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.340
 needed from the south is necessary 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.510
 only this one was really cool always denied 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.340
 this information because you like things 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.890
 it is very interesting to follow the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.989
 manual of the geek semed esse geek 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.610
 book was much talked about in the photo in many 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.410
 instagram the youtube channels that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.360
 that you have spoken about this book 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.860
 It was not there, these things, I do not know. 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.870
 because the book one way seems to be well 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.090
 larger seems has content been posted 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.769
 here I may be wrong when this was 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.630
 the name correct I did not like the name 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.069
 tradition of this book because it was a new 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.560
 girl team out there he stayed 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.410
 defended the rescue of the galaxy that would 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.810
 the thong galaxy guide the beans have 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.780
 arm is very fond of something if 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.120
 I was even hearing of the time speaking Afghan 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.010

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.260
 be the godfather a book and those to do 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.239
 pay the tec is not the same I think 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.889
 that if he had kept original 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.079
 Afghan manual should explain 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.819
 Had something to do and do a lot more 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.620
 because the audience for which it is 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.660
 facing this book you understand these 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.040
 really failed a bit but the content 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.019
 the book is interesting and me 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.090
