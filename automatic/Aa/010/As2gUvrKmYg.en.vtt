 presented today and is really one 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.519
 very interesting device 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.740
 I have a bit of order now 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.570
 played and really think it is very 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.279
 nice especially because this is in this one 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.140
 white version really very noble 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.210

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.000

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.399
 Here is a touchscreen so this is not a 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.140
 problem in that the 13 inch display if 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.690

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.290
 where is the 13-inch display has a 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.080
 resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels so 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.509
 full hd and as a processor we have here 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:20.160

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.990

 main memory and with the display 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.000
 finds her hobby camera and if we 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.619
 then to make a tablet 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.810
