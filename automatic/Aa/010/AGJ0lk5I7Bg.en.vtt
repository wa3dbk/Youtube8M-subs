great<00:03:57.750> long-term<00:03:58.050> trends<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.580> do<00:03:59.700> with

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
great long-term trends have to do with

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.690 
great long-term trends have to do with
growing<00:04:01.230> tide<00:04:01.530> towards<00:04:01.830> growing<00:04:02.010> populations

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
growing tide towards growing populations

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.600 
growing tide towards growing populations
and<00:04:03.290> also<00:04:04.290> shifting<00:04:04.709> diet<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:05.190> people<00:04:05.489> eat

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
and also shifting diet so people eat

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.010 
and also shifting diet so people eat
more<00:04:05.790> meat<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.180> puts<00:04:06.420> different<00:04:06.780> stresses

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
more meat that puts different stresses

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.520 
more meat that puts different stresses
on<00:04:07.320> on<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.100> market<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.080> there's<00:04:10.260> very

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
so as the price of oil has fallen

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.140 
so as the price of oil has fallen
they're<00:05:08.400> going<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.580> make<00:05:08.669> a<00:05:08.700> lot<00:05:08.910> of<00:05:08.940> money

besides being able to refineries the

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.450 
besides being able to refineries the
price<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.210> oil<00:05:12.300> is<00:05:12.540> an<00:05:12.660> input<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.140> that

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
price of oil is an input to that

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.520 
price of oil is an input to that
and<00:05:13.639> gasoline<00:05:14.419> prices<00:05:14.750> don't<00:05:15.020> ever<00:05:15.199> seem<00:05:15.440> to

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
fall right much loyal right so they make

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.520 
fall right much loyal right so they make
a<00:05:17.990> lot<00:05:18.169> of<00:05:18.199> money<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:19.490> yeah<00:05:19.669> that<00:05:20.440> looking<00:05:21.440> at

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530

which<00:06:14.690> we've<00:06:14.840> seen<00:06:15.080> right<00:06:15.349> right<00:06:15.710> I<00:06:16.430> think

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
which we've seen right right I think

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.879 
which we've seen right right I think
what's<00:06:17.479> going<00:06:17.690> on<00:06:17.810> Europe<00:06:18.169> is<00:06:18.289> also<00:06:18.620> something

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
what's going on Europe is also something

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:21.580 
what's going on Europe is also something
like<00:06:19.130> keeping<00:06:19.580> an<00:06:19.729> eye<00:06:19.820> on<00:06:19.849> and<00:06:20.349> actually<00:06:21.349> i

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
like keeping an eye on and actually i

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.649 
like keeping an eye on and actually i
think<00:06:21.860> in<00:06:21.949> europe<00:06:22.430> that<00:06:23.210> create<00:06:23.509> some

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:23.659 
think in europe that create some

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:24.879 
think in europe that create some
interesting<00:06:23.750> opportunities<00:06:24.500> because<00:06:24.710> there

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
interesting opportunities because there

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:27.370

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.010 
are a lot of there are some interesting
companies<00:06:27.889> are<00:06:28.009> cheap<00:06:28.310> but<00:06:29.180> have<00:06:29.570> global

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
companies are cheap but have global

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.010 
companies are cheap but have global
global<00:06:30.800> presence<00:06:31.130> and<00:06:31.639> sell<00:06:32.330> to<00:06:32.509> all<00:06:32.599> the<00:06:32.719> kind

of<00:06:33.110> markets<00:06:33.469> and<00:06:33.800> then<00:06:34.550> the<00:06:34.669> US<00:06:34.909> market<00:06:35.150> it's

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
of markets and then the US market it's

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.379 
of markets and then the US market it's
just<00:06:35.570> that<00:06:35.719> it's<00:06:35.990> run<00:06:36.370> so<00:06:37.370> strong<00:06:37.759> for<00:06:38.000> so<00:06:38.180> long

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:38.389 
just that it's run so strong for so long

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:42.040 
just that it's run so strong for so long
we<00:06:38.960> we<00:06:39.289> haven't<00:06:39.620> really<00:06:39.740> had<00:06:40.009> a<00:06:41.050> genuine

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
we we haven't really had a genuine

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.279 
we we haven't really had a genuine
correction<00:06:43.039> since<00:06:43.340> I<00:06:43.460> think<00:06:43.699> 2011<00:06:44.360> so<00:06:45.110> it's

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.289 
correction since I think 2011 so it's

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:46.629 
correction since I think 2011 so it's
always<00:06:45.440> a<00:06:45.560> concern<00:06:45.979> that<00:06:46.250> you<00:06:46.280> know<00:06:46.430> you're
