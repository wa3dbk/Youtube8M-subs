00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.889
 when the Europeans supposedly 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.770
 discovered the state of america for 15th or 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.289
 16th century we counted in Quebec 3 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.750
 Aboriginal language family 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.060
 Iroquois hien the algonquins elysées 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.950
 we and that means that it takes 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.930
 go back well before to explain 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.360
 the origin of the settlement of america 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.400
 there are several theories about it 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.230
 but the most serious one explains that 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.599
 first who chose to settle in 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.309
 ml they are nomadic hunters who 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.750
 came from asia 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.340
 thousands of years ago the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.290
 temperature on earth was a lot 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.079
 colder than today it was the 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.940
 last ice age of ice 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.870
 two kilometers of peace cover the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.489
 North of the continent 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.950
 which means that important 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.510
 amounts of water were frozen in the year 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.210
 that's what lowered the water level 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.030
 oceans making passage possible 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.180
 supported by asia and america by 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.410
 a region called Beringia 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.480
 with global warming that the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.610
 earth has known since the ices have 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.740
 melted what up the level of wolves 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.960
 to give the Bering Strait such 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.150
 we know him today once 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.070
 from emeric the nomads have come down to 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.409
 across the continent to scatter 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.930
 everywhere in the south where the 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.100
 conditions are easier 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.930
 quebec's when still there 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.799
 ice captives and it will take 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.540
 wait for it to start 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.570
 gradually to withdraw 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.420
 there are about 10 12 thousand 1 to see 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.369
 a population settle the region of 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.680
 the Arctic will be the last 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.659
 to be busy and it's around the year 1000 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.580
 against where the Inuit elders in 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.110
 the Canadian Arctic 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.270
 their Nordicity explain that they will 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.820
 stay rather behind the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.680
 other Aboriginal groups over time 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.240
 some of the nomads who live or those 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.070
 of Quebec in conditions a little 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.970
 more favorable will be able to get 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.680
 settle down these are the Iroquois there is 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.720
 verquin meaning they are between five and ten 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.090
 a thousand and live in south west quebec 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.939
 they are called Iroquois yen 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.040
 rats there are several other nations 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.630
 and rocroi yen but she lives rather in 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.090
 the Great Lakes region as per 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.560
 example will go wada or again in the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.250
 northeastern United States as the 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.070
 Iroquois is now called 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.740
 me as they move less than a 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.090
 nomadic population density among 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.040
 great means and stronger 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.960
 so they can organize their 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.480
 territory in village on a territory 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.850
 more restricted villages can 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.160
 hold up to 2000 people and are 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.290
 surrounded by palisades should know that 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.910
 a sedentary lifestyle makes it easier to fight 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.580
 they must therefore protect their 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.410
 territory of their enemy the village is 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.450
 consisting of several language houses 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.010
 made of wood in which lives a 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.560
 fifty people generally 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.060
 the extended family 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.940
 the peoples who will remain nomads make 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.250
 6th part of the Algonquin family they 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.690
 are between 10 and 20 miles to 15 cents 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.209
 in Quebec 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.040
 we can name as an example of 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.920
 Algonquin Nation the Algonquins 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.620
 themselves but where if isi limits us 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.450
 mac or wear benégui he occupies a 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.040
 vast territory that includes the 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.200
 Canadian shield as well as 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.480
 Appalachian this wide expanse 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.050
 can be explained by their semi lifestyle 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.690
 nomads 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.510
 they are hunts kaya and must be 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.370
 move to follow the libya the summer they 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.630
 live bank predicts streams in 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.160
 one 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.080
 it's a kind of time made of 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.940
 branches and bodies or even 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.790
 animal skins in which lives 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.650
 usually only one family in the winter 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.299
 however, he must go where 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.989
 find the jpy ie inside 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.390
 lands 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.510
 a small hunting group from 15 to 20 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.510
 people
