00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
piercing all around make sure it gets in

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.289

because when you're done with the inside

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730 
because when you're done with the inside
flip<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:03.060> around<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.720> already<00:02:04.080> have<00:02:04.410> a

flip it around and you already have a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.280 
flip it around and you already have a
Decepticon<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.880> do<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.150> inside<00:02:06.540> just

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
Decepticon it and do the inside just

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.710 
Decepticon it and do the inside just

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
there's a better chance that it'll be

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.520

this<00:03:32.190> is<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.459> corkscrew<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:33.270> you<00:03:33.330> want<00:03:33.480> to

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
this is the corkscrew so you want to

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.440 
this is the corkscrew so you want to
push<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.380> then<00:03:34.800> twist<00:03:35.760> it<00:03:36.120> towards

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
push it in and then twist it towards

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.400 
push it in and then twist it towards
your<00:03:36.810> face<00:03:37.200> not<00:03:37.800> towards<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:39.230> your<00:03:40.230> nose

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
your face not towards that your nose

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.590 
your face not towards that your nose
towards<00:03:40.830> your<00:03:41.190> face<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.820> keep<00:03:42.030> twisting

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
towards your face and you keep twisting

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.290 
towards your face and you keep twisting
and<00:03:42.780> I'm<00:03:43.620> pushing<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:44.280> after<00:03:44.730> each<00:03:44.910> twist

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
and I'm pushing it in after each twist

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.050 
and I'm pushing it in after each twist
and<00:03:45.720> then<00:03:46.440> eventually<00:03:46.800> get<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.280> this<00:03:47.430> step<00:03:47.760> and

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
and then eventually get to this step and

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.910 
and then eventually get to this step and
you<00:03:48.360> twist<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.780> one<00:03:48.930> more<00:03:49.080> time<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.739> should

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
you twist it one more time and it should

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.810 
you twist it one more time and it should
just<00:03:49.950> pop<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:51.200> excuse<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.350> fixing<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.190> to

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
just pop in excuse the fixing and to

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.460 
just pop in excuse the fixing and to
make<00:03:53.970> sure<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.450> can't<00:03:54.690> see<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.200> inside

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
make sure that you can't see the inside

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.600 
make sure that you can't see the inside
of<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:57.170> okay<00:03:58.170> that's<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.800> too<00:03:59.040> much<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.430> take

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
of it okay that's that too much to take

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.800 
of it okay that's that too much to take
it<00:03:59.790> out<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.560> should<00:04:01.560> up<00:04:01.800> pull<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.160> forward

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
it out you should up pull it forward

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.540 
it out you should up pull it forward
and<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:04.349> twist<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.890> in<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.099> opposite

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
and then twist it in the opposite

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.580 
and then twist it in the opposite
direction<00:04:05.700> so<00:04:06.060> away<00:04:06.660> from<00:04:06.959> your<00:04:07.140> face

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
direction so away from your face

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.320 
direction so away from your face
and<00:04:07.709> keep<00:04:07.980> twisting<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:08.940> going<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.239> a

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
and keep twisting it and going in a

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.150 
and keep twisting it and going in a
circle<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.020> eventually<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.590> should<00:04:10.620> pop<00:04:11.010> out

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.710 

so<00:04:17.160> for<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.430> one<00:04:17.549> with<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.700> ball<00:04:18.000> at<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.389> end<00:04:18.419> it

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
so for the one with a ball at the end it

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.750 
so for the one with a ball at the end it
may<00:04:18.840> be<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.019> little<00:04:19.350> bit<00:04:19.530> thicker<00:04:19.889> but<00:04:20.430> all<00:04:20.669> you

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
may be a little bit thicker but all you

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.010 
may be a little bit thicker but all you
need<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.090> do<00:04:21.329> is<00:04:21.690> find<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.260> hole<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:24.020> just

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
need to do is find the hole and just

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.680 
need to do is find the hole and just
push<00:04:25.620> really<00:04:26.010> gently<00:04:26.460> don't<00:04:26.970> try<00:04:27.419> too<00:04:27.480> hard

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
push really gently don't try too hard

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.840 
push really gently don't try too hard
maybe<00:04:28.320> wiggle<00:04:28.889> it<00:04:28.980> a<00:04:29.070> little<00:04:29.100> bit<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.730> it

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
maybe wiggle it a little bit and it

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.790 
maybe wiggle it a little bit and it
should<00:04:30.210> just<00:04:30.240> pop<00:04:30.690> in<00:04:30.990> especially<00:04:31.590> if<00:04:31.650> you've

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
should just pop in especially if you've

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.740 
should just pop in especially if you've
had<00:04:31.980> it<00:04:32.130> for<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.370> while<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.880> lot<00:04:33.180> someone<00:04:33.450> I<00:04:33.540> want

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
had it for a while a lot someone I want

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.620 
had it for a while a lot someone I want
to<00:04:33.840> show<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.410> loop<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:35.630> there's

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
to show you is the loop and there's

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.120 
to show you is the loop and there's
different<00:04:36.780> types<00:04:37.080> of<00:04:37.260> nose<00:04:37.440> hoops<00:04:37.710> but<00:04:37.979> you

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
different types of nose hoops but you

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.120 
different types of nose hoops but you
pretty<00:04:38.430> much<00:04:38.580> want<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:38.940> just<00:04:39.120> push<00:04:39.389> it<00:04:39.600> in

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
pretty much want to just push it in

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.159 
pretty much want to just push it in
twist<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:41.340> around<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.850> little<00:04:42.000> bit<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.570> it

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
twist it around a little bit and it

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.960 
twist it around a little bit and it
should<00:04:43.350> come<00:04:43.590> down<00:04:43.650> to<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.220> other<00:04:44.430> side<00:04:44.729> and

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
should come down to the other side and

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.510 
should come down to the other side and
you<00:04:45.090> just<00:04:45.300> clamp<00:04:45.660> it<00:04:45.870> together<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.590> that's

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
you just clamp it together and that's

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.879 
you just clamp it together and that's
that<00:04:49.340> okay<00:04:50.340> umm<00:04:51.060> that's<00:04:51.930> that<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.470> tried<00:04:52.860> to

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
that okay umm that's that I tried to

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.620 
that okay umm that's that I tried to
make<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.700> as<00:04:55.010> clear<00:04:56.010> as<00:04:56.190> possible<00:04:56.820> because<00:04:57.030> I

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
make it as clear as possible because I

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.320 
make it as clear as possible because I
have<00:04:58.410> long<00:04:58.710> nails<00:04:58.740> first<00:04:59.490> of<00:04:59.639> all<00:04:59.760> and<00:05:00.000> it's

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
have long nails first of all and it's

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
have long nails first of all and it's
really<00:05:00.600> hard<00:05:00.900> to<00:05:02.930> catch<00:05:03.930> them<00:05:04.229> because

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
really hard to catch them because

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.810 
really hard to catch them because
they're<00:05:04.650> really<00:05:04.830> small<00:05:05.370> that's<00:05:05.669> why<00:05:05.790> I

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
they're really small that's why I

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.670 
they're really small that's why I
couldn't<00:05:06.090> do<00:05:06.450> the<00:05:06.600> l-shape<00:05:07.050> one<00:05:07.290> because<00:05:07.560> it

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
couldn't do the l-shape one because it

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.279 
couldn't do the l-shape one because it
was<00:05:07.770> way<00:05:07.979> too<00:05:08.039> small<00:05:08.460> that<00:05:08.870> one<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:09.900> would<00:05:10.169> need

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
was way too small that one I would need

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.290 
was way too small that one I would need
to<00:05:10.410> do<00:05:10.530> with<00:05:10.620> tweezers<00:05:10.950> but<00:05:11.910> if<00:05:12.060> you<00:05:12.150> don't

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
to do with tweezers but if you don't

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.430 
to do with tweezers but if you don't
have<00:05:12.419> long<00:05:12.600> nails<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:12.990> shouldn't<00:05:13.320> be<00:05:13.410> a

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
have long nails it shouldn't be a

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.469 
have long nails it shouldn't be a
problem<00:05:13.500> it's<00:05:14.160> way<00:05:14.400> easier<00:05:14.850> than<00:05:15.090> the

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
problem it's way easier than the

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.240 
problem it's way easier than the
corkscrew<00:05:16.260> um<00:05:18.110> but<00:05:19.110> yeah<00:05:19.289> that's<00:05:19.650> that<00:05:19.830> and

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
corkscrew um but yeah that's that and

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.820 
corkscrew um but yeah that's that and
it's<00:05:21.210> hard<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.560> on-camera<00:05:22.560> show<00:05:22.770> you

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
it's hard to on-camera show you

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.260 
it's hard to on-camera show you
everything<00:05:23.370> because<00:05:23.490> I<00:05:23.700> got<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:23.970> look<00:05:24.090> in<00:05:24.180> the

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
everything because I got to look in the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.570 
everything because I got to look in the
mirror<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:25.020> got<00:05:25.200> to<00:05:25.350> do<00:05:25.979> it<00:05:26.130> all<00:05:26.280> at<00:05:26.460> the

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
mirror and I got to do it all at the

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.330 
mirror and I got to do it all at the
same<00:05:26.760> time<00:05:26.820> but<00:05:27.720> I<00:05:27.750> think<00:05:28.289> it's<00:05:28.620> better<00:05:29.010> like

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
same time but I think it's better like
