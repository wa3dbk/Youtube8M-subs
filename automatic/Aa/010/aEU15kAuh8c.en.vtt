00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
is the one-way or two-way glass you can

take any map it doesn't have to be a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.080 
take any map it doesn't have to be a
special<00:00:55.649> map<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> chicken<00:00:56.370> reflection<00:00:57.000> on

special map with a chicken reflection on

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.720 
special map with a chicken reflection on
it<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.690> when<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.930> place<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.559> glass<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
it but when you place it on glass it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.130 
it but when you place it on glass it
covers<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.149> glass<00:01:00.420> pretty<00:01:00.690> well<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.050> you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
covers up the glass pretty well so you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.439 
covers up the glass pretty well so you
can't<00:01:01.379> tell<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.820> other<00:01:03.000> side<00:01:03.270> it

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
can't tell and on the other side it

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.329 
can't tell and on the other side it
doesn't<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:04.019> glass<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.830> any

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
doesn't have to be glass but it's any

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.679 
doesn't have to be glass but it's any
block<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.090> kind<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.510> through

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
like you could do it on the sign or

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.500 
like you could do it on the sign or
whatever<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:09.150> you're<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> other

you<00:01:32.640> want<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> spy<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.150> your<00:01:33.299> friends<00:01:33.360> or<00:01:33.900> do

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
you want to spy on your friends or do

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.440 
you want to spy on your friends or do
whatever<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.979> let's<00:01:35.490> move<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
whatever but let's move on to the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.539 
whatever but let's move on to the
invisible<00:01:37.170> chests<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.799> things<00:01:38.040> now<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.400> is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
invisible chests and things now this is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.510 
invisible chests and things now this is
a<00:01:38.579> weird<00:01:38.820> trick<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.960> involves<00:01:40.470> having<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.159> map

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a weird trick that involves having a map

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.490 
a weird trick that involves having a map
that<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.939> blank<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> little

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that is blank which it can be a little

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.749 
that is blank which it can be a little
tricky<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.920> get<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.369> I'll<00:01:44.430> show<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.610> how<00:01:44.670> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
tricky to get but I'll show you how to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.340 
tricky to get but I'll show you how to
do<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.659> basically<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:46.020> place

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
do that but you can basically just place

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.149 
do that but you can basically just place
these<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:48.180> will<00:01:48.299> make<00:01:48.479> any

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
these on here and it will make any

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.830 
these on here and it will make any
semi-transparent<00:01:50.159> block<00:01:50.720> invisible<00:01:51.720> behind

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
semi-transparent block invisible behind

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.960 
semi-transparent block invisible behind
it<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.320> won't<00:01:52.500> work<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.860> solid<00:01:53.460> blocks<00:01:53.729> if

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
it like it won't work on solid blocks if

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.630 
it like it won't work on solid blocks if
I<00:01:54.090> was<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.390> try<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.689> place<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.770> map<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.219> here

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
I was to try to place this map on here

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.399 
I was to try to place this map on here
you<00:01:57.090> can't<00:01:57.360> even<00:01:57.420> see<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.780> there's<00:01:58.200> anything

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
you can't even see that there's anything

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.469 
you can't even see that there's anything
there<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:59.310> there<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> map<00:01:59.790> there<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.390> you

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
there but there is a map there but you

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.230 
there but there is a map there but you
ask<00:02:00.600> things<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:00.990> signs<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.700> chests<00:02:03.119> and

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
ask things like signs and in chests and

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.880 
ask things like signs and in chests and
stuff<00:02:03.479> chests<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.259> especially<00:02:04.770> useful

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
stuff chests are especially useful

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.410 
stuff chests are especially useful
because<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.460> hide<00:02:05.549> your<00:02:05.759> stuff<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.210> there

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
because you can hide your stuff in there

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.529 
because you can hide your stuff in there
obviously<00:02:07.320> now<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:08.099> will<00:02:08.759> go<00:02:09.119> show<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.360> guys

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
obviously now I will go show you guys

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.449 
obviously now I will go show you guys
how<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.720> make<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> you're<00:02:10.170> gonna<00:02:10.229> need<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.800> map

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
how to make it you're gonna need a map

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.819 
how to make it you're gonna need a map
like<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> fresh<00:02:12.299> map<00:02:12.569> I'll<00:02:12.870> look<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.230> be<00:02:13.439> any<00:02:13.590> map

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
like a fresh map I'll look to be any map

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.229 
like a fresh map I'll look to be any map
actually<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.340> doesn't<00:02:14.459> need<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.819> be<00:02:14.939> a<00:02:14.969> fresh

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
actually it doesn't need to be a fresh

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.640 
actually it doesn't need to be a fresh
one<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.659> could<00:02:15.840> actually<00:02:15.959> take<00:02:16.200> this

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
one I could actually take this

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.410 
one I could actually take this
just<00:02:17.040> chicken<00:02:17.219> map<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.700> do<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.909> so<00:02:18.269> we're

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
just chicken map and do it so we're

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.640 
just chicken map and do it so we're
gonna<00:02:18.480> head<00:02:18.750> into<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.019> nether<00:02:19.260> through<00:02:19.500> this

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
gonna head into the nether through this

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.759 
gonna head into the nether through this
giant<00:02:19.980> nether<00:02:20.370> portal<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.140> very<00:02:22.140> loud<00:02:22.319> portal

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
giant nether portal and very loud portal

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.319 
giant nether portal and very loud portal
sound<00:02:23.010> there<00:02:23.189> now

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
sound there now

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.569 
sound there now
you're<00:02:24.870> gonna<00:02:24.959> go<00:02:25.140> into<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.530> nether<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:25.829> you

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
you're gonna go into the nether and you

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.280 
you're gonna go into the nether and you
will<00:02:26.730> need<00:02:27.000> actually<00:02:27.510> no<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.109> make<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
will need actually no you have to make a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.839 
will need actually no you have to make a
fresh<00:02:28.560> map<00:02:28.769> in<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.040> nether<00:02:29.370> sorry<00:02:29.670> about<00:02:29.819> that

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
fresh map in the nether sorry about that

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.300 
fresh map in the nether sorry about that
I<00:02:30.180> believe<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.079> just<00:02:31.109> make<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.409> fresh<00:02:31.680> map<00:02:31.920> here

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
I believe you just make a fresh map here

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.339 
I believe you just make a fresh map here
and<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:33.389> can<00:02:33.510> test<00:02:33.689> it<00:02:33.870> with<00:02:33.989> an<00:02:34.109> already

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
and we can test it with an already

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.599 
and we can test it with an already
existing<00:02:34.469> map<00:02:34.859> I'm<00:02:35.010> pretty<00:02:35.189> sure<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.549> a

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
existing map I'm pretty sure it's a

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.610 
existing map I'm pretty sure it's a
fresh<00:02:35.909> one<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.930> doesn't<00:02:37.230> matter<00:02:37.349> how<00:02:37.530> much

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
fresh one and it doesn't matter how much

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.589 
fresh one and it doesn't matter how much
it<00:02:37.680> generates<00:02:38.159> you're<00:02:38.730> gonna<00:02:38.819> pop<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.299> into

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
it generates you're gonna pop it into

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.470 
it generates you're gonna pop it into
the<00:02:39.989> crafting<00:02:40.409> bench<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.859> expand<00:02:41.579> it<00:02:41.790> by

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the crafting bench and expand it by

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.379 
the crafting bench and expand it by
doing<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.620> or<00:02:43.889> zoom<00:02:44.129> in<00:02:44.310> sorry<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:44.849> you<00:02:45.269> will

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
doing that or zoom in sorry and you will

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.780 
doing that or zoom in sorry and you will
make<00:02:45.629> a<00:02:45.930> zoomed<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.799> one<00:02:46.950> now<00:02:47.129> don't<00:02:47.370> open<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
make a zoomed in one now don't open that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.339 
make a zoomed in one now don't open that
map<00:02:48.150> yet<00:02:48.419> I'm<00:02:48.569> gonna<00:02:48.689> try<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.019> with<00:02:49.200> this

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
map yet I'm gonna try it with this

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.780 
map yet I'm gonna try it with this
chicken<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:49.829> just<00:02:50.099> to<00:02:50.189> see<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.519> it'll<00:02:50.700> work

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
chicken one just to see if it'll work

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.119 
chicken one just to see if it'll work
but<00:02:51.659> basically<00:02:52.049> you're<00:02:52.409> going<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.829> change

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
but basically you're going to change

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.849 
but basically you're going to change
your<00:02:53.310> map<00:02:53.639> by<00:02:53.989> adding<00:02:54.989> some<00:02:55.169> paper<00:02:55.349> there<00:02:55.470> and

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
your map by adding some paper there and

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.409 
your map by adding some paper there and
now<00:02:56.069> we<00:02:56.129> have<00:02:56.430> these<00:02:56.639> new<00:02:56.939> maps<00:02:57.180> and

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
now we have these new maps and

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.000 
now we have these new maps and
accidentally<00:02:57.989> looked<00:02:58.200> at<00:02:58.409> it<00:02:58.590> actually<00:02:58.980> I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
accidentally looked at it actually I

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.379 
accidentally looked at it actually I
think<00:02:59.219> that's<00:02:59.489> fine<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.939> I<00:02:59.969> looked<00:03:00.180> at<00:03:00.299> it

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
think that's fine that I looked at it

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.500 
think that's fine that I looked at it
