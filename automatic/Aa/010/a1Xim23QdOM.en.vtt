00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.020 
you've got citizencon something you know
so<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.560> ethnic<00:01:31.890> community<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.579> getting

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
so the the ethnic community is getting

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.760 
so the the ethnic community is getting
something<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.140> haven't<00:01:34.409> had<00:01:34.740> a

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
something but you haven't had a

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.679 
something but you haven't had a
progression<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.240> shows<00:01:36.509> that

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
progression like you have shows that

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.690 
progression like you have shows that
spin<00:01:37.020> off<00:01:37.170> from<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> room<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.130> Koi<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.579> know

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
spin off from the room a Koi you know

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.190 
spin off from the room a Koi you know
you'd<00:01:38.850> think<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.329> Felix<00:01:39.689> would<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> show

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
you'd think that Felix would have a show

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.630 
you'd think that Felix would have a show
or<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.799> know<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> will<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.189> Gideon<00:01:41.520> would

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
or you know the will of Gideon would

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.550 
or you know the will of Gideon would
have<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> show<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.659> hasn't<00:01:42.840> happened<00:01:43.320> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
have a show and that hasn't happened and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.770 
have a show and that hasn't happened and
that's<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:44.340> don't<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.240> don't<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that's I don't know I don't think the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
that's I don't know I don't think the
development<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.350> went<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> far<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.280> when

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
development that went that far and when

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.550 
development that went that far and when
the<00:01:47.579> Blatt<00:01:47.729> departments<00:01:48.329> went<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.380> it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the Blatt departments went that was it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.139 
the Blatt departments went that was it
because<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.950> had<00:01:50.100> people<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.700> BBC

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
because we had people in the BBC

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.999 
because we had people in the BBC
deliberately<00:01:51.600> actively<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.619> know<00:01:52.740> making

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
deliberately actively you know making

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.069 
deliberately actively you know making
sure<00:01:53.310> things<00:01:53.520> were<00:01:53.700> happening<00:01:53.850> when<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.780> went

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
sure things were happening when it went

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.020 
sure things were happening when it went
that's<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.920> people<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.520> came<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:57.000> of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
that's when people you just came out of

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.179 
that's when people you just came out of
the<00:01:57.119> consciousness<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
the consciousness of the the

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.609 
the consciousness of the the
commissioners<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.630> so<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.750> circuit<00:02:01.530> is

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
commissioners and so the circuit is

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.050 
commissioners and so the circuit is
still<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.399> not<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:02.640> strong<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
still going it's not as strong as it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.149 
still going it's not as strong as it
used<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.469> know<00:02:04.680> people<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.040> been

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
used to be but you know people have been

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.530 
used to be but you know people have been
dissing<00:02:05.490> heartening<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.030> know<00:02:06.119> they<00:02:06.240> feel<00:02:06.390> um

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
dissing heartening you know they feel um

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.240 
dissing heartening you know they feel um
kind<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.869> well<00:02:07.229> what's<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.619> point<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.069> there's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
kind of well what's the point if there's

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.059 
kind of well what's the point if there's
no<00:02:08.459> way<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> end<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.629> what<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.739> point<00:02:10.979> in

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
no way to end up on what is the point in

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.290 
no way to end up on what is the point in
doing<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> thing<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.120> I

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
doing this and that's the thing that I

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.460 
doing this and that's the thing that I
think<00:02:12.510> is<00:02:12.629> really

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
think is really

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.040 
think is really
disappointing<00:02:13.920> same
