00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
in a thick layer of snow which we think

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.389 
in a thick layer of snow which we think
is<00:00:40.050> paid<00:00:40.260> off<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.680> actually<00:00:40.800> makes<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> sound

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
is paid off and actually makes it sound

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.799 
is paid off and actually makes it sound

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
that's on two levels it now also flows

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.189 
that's on two levels it now also flows
better<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.210> making<00:00:54.510> your<00:00:54.629> way<00:00:54.780> around<00:00:54.899> the

bigger than before and that's because of

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.260 
bigger than before and that's because of
the<00:01:10.619> vital<00:01:10.950> role<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.310> will<00:01:11.369> play<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> story
