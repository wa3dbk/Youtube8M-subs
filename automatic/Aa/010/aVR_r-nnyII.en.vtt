00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620 
use this mineral foundation that's why
I'm<00:02:04.829> using<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> tutorial<00:02:05.520> cuz<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.240> use

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
I'm using it for the tutorial cuz I use

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.999 
I'm using it for the tutorial cuz I use
this<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.930> test<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.350> how<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.560> make<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.890> so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
this to test out how to make it so

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.190 
this to test out how to make it so
basically<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.569> two<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.050> ratio

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
basically this is a two to one ratio

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.940 
basically this is a two to one ratio
look<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> take<00:02:11.640> two<00:02:12.349> scoops<00:02:13.349> what<00:02:13.680> once

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
look so you take two scoops what once

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.570 
look so you take two scoops what once
good

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
good

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.930 
good
two<00:02:15.330> scoops<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.500> your<00:02:16.890> mineral<00:02:17.250> foundation<00:02:17.670> or

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159
