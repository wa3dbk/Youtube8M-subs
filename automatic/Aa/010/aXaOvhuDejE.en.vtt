so I can go ahead and give you a little
demo<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.989> exactly<00:00:37.380> how<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:37.739> work<00:00:38.059> they

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
demo on exactly how they work they

biggest<00:00:39.660> disadvantage<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.410> unit<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.829> it

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
biggest disadvantage to this unit is it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
biggest disadvantage to this unit is it
tends<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.730> little<00:00:41.850> noisy<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
tends to be a little noisy with the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.930 
tends to be a little noisy with the
place<00:00:43.110> because<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> turns<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.550> off<00:00:44.700> pretty

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
place because it turns on and off pretty

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.760 
place because it turns on and off pretty
rapidly<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.570> sometimes<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.289> bit

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
rapidly so sometimes we get a little bit

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.619 
rapidly so sometimes we get a little bit
of<00:00:46.800> knocking<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.399> your<00:00:47.520> pipes<00:00:47.730> other<00:00:48.510> than

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
of knocking in your pipes other than

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.270 
of knocking in your pipes other than
that<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.170> does<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.530> good<00:00:49.710> job<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.100> again

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
that it does a really good job and again

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.160 
that it does a really good job and again
it<00:00:50.370> does<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> lifetime<00:00:50.940> warranty<00:00:51.170> so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it does have a lifetime warranty so

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.840 
it does have a lifetime warranty so
let's<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.530> ahead<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.800> I'll<00:00:53.460> show<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.640> how<00:00:53.789> it

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
let's go ahead and I'll show you how it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.840 
let's go ahead and I'll show you how it
works<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.840> set<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.289> our<00:00:58.500> jet<00:00:58.920> carboy

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
works so I have set up our jet carboy

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.880 
works so I have set up our jet carboy
and<00:00:59.879> bottle<00:01:00.329> washer<00:01:00.480> put<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.559> onto<00:01:01.710> our

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and bottle washer put it onto our

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.090 
and bottle washer put it onto our
kitchen<00:01:02.730> faucet<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.680> one<00:01:04.680> thing<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> want<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
kitchen faucet and one thing you want to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.380 
kitchen faucet and one thing you want to
remember<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.640> always<00:01:05.909> put<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.210> ball

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
remember to do is always put your ball

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210 
remember to do is always put your ball
over<00:01:06.840> top<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.409> bottle<00:01:07.710> runs<00:01:07.860> our<00:01:07.979> first

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
over top of the bottle runs our first

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.410 
over top of the bottle runs our first
that<00:01:08.520> way<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.760> doesn't<00:01:08.880> squirt<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.390> with

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that way it doesn't squirt you with

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.240 
that way it doesn't squirt you with
water<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.710> go<00:01:10.830> ahead<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.070> turn

water and then you can go ahead and turn
your<00:01:11.430> water<00:01:11.549> pressure<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.159> see

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
your water pressure on and you can see

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.370 
your water pressure on and you can see
just<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.610> well<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.630> races<00:01:16.020> out<00:01:16.140> our<00:01:16.409> model

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.230 

and<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.250> nice<00:01:22.369> thing<00:01:22.399> about<00:01:22.670> these<00:01:22.880> bottle

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
and the nice thing about these bottle

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.999 
and the nice thing about these bottle
washers<00:01:23.600> is<00:01:23.840> that<00:01:24.289> you<00:01:24.350> can<00:01:24.500> let<00:01:24.680> go<00:01:24.710> of<00:01:24.950> the

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
washers is that you can let go of the

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.370 
washers is that you can let go of the
pressure<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.719> bottle<00:01:26.719> rinser<00:01:27.020> will<00:01:27.140> stop

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
pressure and the bottle rinser will stop

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.350 
pressure and the bottle rinser will stop
and<00:01:27.619> then<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.039> can<00:01:28.159> go<00:01:28.250> ahead<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.399> apply<00:01:28.549> some

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
and then you can go ahead and apply some

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.539 
and then you can go ahead and apply some
more<00:01:29.479> pressure<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.860> Richer<00:01:31.130> will<00:01:31.280> start

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
more pressure and the Richer will start

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.910 
more pressure and the Richer will start
eating<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.479> it's<00:01:32.630> really<00:01:32.840> really<00:01:33.259> very<00:01:33.470> easy

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
eating so it's really really very easy

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.249 
eating so it's really really very easy
to<00:01:34.070> go<00:01:34.189> to<00:01:34.399> bottle<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:34.850> bottle<00:01:35.049> rinse<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:36.170> out

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
to go to bottle the bottle rinse it out

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.469 
to go to bottle the bottle rinse it out
quickly<00:01:36.590> get<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.189> job<00:01:37.399> done<00:01:37.429> in<00:01:38.210> no<00:01:38.390> time<00:01:40.479> so

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
quickly get the job done in no time so

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.980 
quickly get the job done in no time so
again<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:41.899> is<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.140> jet<00:01:42.649> carboy<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.990> bottle

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
again this is the jet carboy and bottle

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.749 
again this is the jet carboy and bottle
