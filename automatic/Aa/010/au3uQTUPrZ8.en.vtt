Knoll over there with a building on top
of<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.820> some<00:01:18.030> kind<00:01:18.300> of<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:19.320> coal<00:01:19.560> mine

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
of it that is some kind of a coal mine

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.650 
of it that is some kind of a coal mine
at<00:01:20.039> one<00:01:20.160> time<00:01:20.429> another<00:01:20.700> my<00:01:20.850> grandfather<00:01:21.420> and

the 30s and the 40s and the 50s nineteen

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.469 
the 30s and the 40s and the 50s nineteen
twenties<00:01:30.709> about<00:01:31.709> 2,000<00:01:32.399> feet<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.420> were

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
twenties about 2,000 feet and they were

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.570 
twenties about 2,000 feet and they were
shortened<00:01:33.959> up<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.200> Timbers<00:01:34.649> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.069> coal<00:01:35.310> mine

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
shortened up to Timbers on the coal mine

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.820 
shortened up to Timbers on the coal mine
itself<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> keep<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.050> falling<00:01:37.289> in<00:01:37.649> on

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
itself to keep it from falling in on

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.100 
itself to keep it from falling in on
them<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.550> basically<00:01:39.179> you<00:01:39.720> know<00:01:39.780> making<00:01:39.959> it

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
them and basically you know making it

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.770 
them and basically you know making it
more<00:01:40.229> sturdy<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.679> safer<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.459> him<00:01:41.550> but<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.569> did

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
more sturdy and safer for him but it did

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.050 
more sturdy and safer for him but it did
fall<00:01:43.080> in<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.440> coal<00:01:43.649> seam<00:01:43.979> did<00:01:44.190> fall<00:01:44.459> in<00:01:44.489> came

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
fall in the coal seam did fall in came

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.740 
fall in the coal seam did fall in came
in<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.739> run<00:01:46.950> around<00:01:47.069> run<00:01:47.599> out<00:01:48.599> in

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
in and so they run around run out in

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.380 
in and so they run around run out in
time<00:01:48.989> saved<00:01:49.440> everybody<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.819> they<00:01:50.940> came<00:01:51.179> back

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
time saved everybody but they came back

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.660 
time saved everybody but they came back
later<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.869> they<00:01:52.140> were<00:01:52.229> trying<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.739> get<00:01:53.550> all

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
later and they were trying to get all

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.070 
later and they were trying to get all
the<00:01:53.789> coal<00:01:54.030> out<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.630> they<00:01:54.869> found<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.530> wall<00:01:57.080> of

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
the coal out and they found a wall of

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.059 
the coal out and they found a wall of
blocks<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.770> were<00:01:59.099> polished<00:02:00.050> like<00:02:01.050> glass<00:02:01.410> and

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
blocks that were polished like glass and

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.639 
blocks that were polished like glass and
they<00:02:02.640> were<00:02:02.700> stacked<00:02:03.060> upon<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.630> another<00:02:03.929> that

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
they were stacked upon one another that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.119 
they were stacked upon one another that
run<00:02:04.890> for<00:02:05.099> 150<00:02:05.819> feet<00:02:06.000> or<00:02:06.179> four<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.679> they

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
run for 150 feet or four and they they

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.380 
run for 150 feet or four and they they
said<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.610> could<00:02:08.789> even<00:02:08.879> put<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> piece<00:02:09.360> of

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
said that you could even put a piece of

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.650 
said that you could even put a piece of
paper<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.959> between<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.440> blocks<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.879> that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
paper in between the blocks and so that

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.970 
paper in between the blocks and so that
showed<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.140> there<00:02:13.290> was<00:02:13.349> some<00:02:13.560> kind<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.860> an

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
showed that there was some kind of an

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.860 
showed that there was some kind of an
example<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.520> an<00:02:14.670> ancient<00:02:14.849> civilization<00:02:15.780> in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
example of an ancient civilization in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.940 
example of an ancient civilization in
this<00:02:16.020> area<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:17.099> lived<00:02:17.790> 2,000<00:02:18.450> feet<00:02:18.569> in<00:02:18.750> that

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
this area that lived 2,000 feet in that

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.410 
this area that lived 2,000 feet in that
hill<00:02:19.950> over<00:02:20.129> there<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.459> guess<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:21.030> don't<00:02:21.209> know<00:02:21.360> I

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
hill over there I guess I don't know I

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.930 
hill over there I guess I don't know I
couldn't<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.930> know<00:02:22.020> all<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.379> but<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.980> did<00:02:23.730> go

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
couldn't you know all that but I did go

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.339 
couldn't you know all that but I did go
over<00:02:24.090> there<00:02:24.239> I<00:02:24.270> did<00:02:24.540> find<00:02:24.810> out<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> chunk<00:02:25.200> of

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
over there I did find out a chunk of

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.940 
over there I did find out a chunk of
coal<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:25.890> have<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.340> chunk<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.730> coal<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:27.950> know

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
coal I do have that chunk of coal I know

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.860 
coal I do have that chunk of coal I know
for<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> fact<00:02:29.430> my<00:02:29.879> father<00:02:30.180> told<00:02:30.480> me<00:02:30.599> that<00:02:30.750> they

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
for a fact my father told me that they

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.450 
for a fact my father told me that they
did<00:02:31.349> haul<00:02:31.530> out<00:02:31.739> there<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.219> I

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
did haul out there and I

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.460 
did haul out there and I
lemare<00:02:32.850> find<00:02:33.120> all<00:02:33.300> kinds<00:02:33.570> of<00:02:33.660> just<00:02:34.020> before

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
lemare find all kinds of just before

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.730 
lemare find all kinds of just before
they<00:02:34.710> built<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.130> thing<00:02:35.240> right<00:02:36.240> now

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
they built that thing right now

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.190 
they built that thing right now
so<00:02:38.000> they<00:02:39.000> said<00:02:39.210> it<00:02:39.360> was<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> very<00:02:39.660> hard

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
so they said it was a very hard

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.460 
so they said it was a very hard
substance<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.880> there's<00:02:42.120> affidavits<00:02:42.810> on

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470
