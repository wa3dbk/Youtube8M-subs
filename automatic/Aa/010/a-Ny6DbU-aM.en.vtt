00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.270
 you have before you a model of the solar system 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.790
 that I present for that 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.669
 she permits 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:07.870
 to understand very simply 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.210
 a whole series of numbers of goals the figure that otherwise are 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.829
 unbearable 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.269
 this model was scale 1 billion 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.089
 everyone knows what a billion is 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:21.890
 I explained it to you quickly 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.510
 if you have won a billion lotto and when you pay in savings 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:26.579
 euros 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.779
 it means that you have won 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.419
 a billion people 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.960
 each piece weighing 7 and a half grams 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.580
 so you have to win 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.730
 7 billion 500 million grams 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.390
 put 100 kilos I think it must be 7500 tons you need 750 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.510
 10 ton truck 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.320
 to carry your billion 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.940
 it gives you another idea of ​​what an enormity of a billion 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.050
 so here we are at the 1 billion scale 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.190
 so me sun but swear 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.620
 to put 40 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.240
 because the true it measures 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.890
 one million three hundred and ninety-two thousand kilometers in diameter 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.270
 it's easy and it shows right away 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.200
 that becomes the earth at the same scale so you just got 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.350
 tears 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.490
 at the same scale 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.820
 Earth 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.730
 the little blue planet 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.860
 in fact almost 13 millimeters 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.870
 of diameter 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.510
 12 08 me approximately 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.670
 and not the other end of the board at home another neighbor the victim the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.380
 Moon 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.900
 I respected 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.020
 At scale 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.800
 the dimensions of the moon in relation to the earth 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.380
 and I respected the earth-moon distance 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.030
 compared to the sun so if I put 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.260
 Earth 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.660
 at this place 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.660
 in this city has generated new blood to the earth 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.430
 and if I'm twice the distance between the moon and the moon 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
 I can get out of the sun 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.150
 France measures 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.480
 millimeters from north to south 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.430
 and to say that there are people who think they are important people 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.700
 turner planet earth 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.920
 in its place and the third from the sun and so I put here 

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:10.809
 mercury 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:14.359
 4 millimeters 8 on the model citadis to 4800 km in space 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:20.049
 and next to the distance and marked 58 that is to say 58 master on the 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:20.759
 model 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.759
 58 million 2 km in space 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:25.689
 Venus 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.379
 12 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.379
 m twelve millimeters which opposed the 12000 km 

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.929
 the 110 meters that is to say without the millions in space 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.869
 the third company has raised m 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:38.739
 150 meters from the sun 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.739
 that is to say 150 million km in space 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.369
 then I will have my spring 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.529
 to 228 meters french 

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:51.149
 which is almost 8 millimeters in diameter 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.289
 almost 8000 km 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.289
 we will report undergoing term 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:00.969
 of 228 meters for March we compensate at almost 1,800 meters for julie 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.129
 Earth 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.290
 kiffer was 143 millimeters in diameter 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.099
 the earth its phrases by theme 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.309
 in switzerland the saturn assets 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.779
 the beautiful saturn 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:14.169
 active and sandals 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.629
 May 1120 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.249
 millimeters on the model 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:20.179
 one hundred and twenty thousand kilometers in space was ten times the 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:21.609
 diameter of the earth 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.059
 and his ring 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:25.829
 if you see it in my telescope at night 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.739
 it's all beautiful tiny everything cute because saturn state a billion three 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.999
 hundred million kilometers from us in space 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:35.759
 so one kilometer censuring mock 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.369
 and that at this distance to the deal seems very small 

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:40.129
 but it's up to our laws 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.129
 just bad luck between the earth and the moon 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.829
 the views from afar it looks very small then we have a little further and uranus 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.279
 and neptune 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:53.099
 it takes four times the diameter of the earth each 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.789
 52 '1000 km 49 thousand kilometers south of europe 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:57.870
 distance 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.059
 we said 1 km3 for here we come to 2 km 5 4 km 8 

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:04.859
 and then we will finish 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.469
 not the little one rather than we eliminated serious planets 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.169
 I do not know if you see the tiny dot on it 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.989
 2003 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.709
 that is to say 1300 km in space 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.120
 efforts with me they file is to bring fondettes to 7km to that 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.599
 in space and press 7 billion kilometers 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.599
 here you have an idea existence in the solar system 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.659
 so that the children could be evaluated remotely a little better 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.389
 and their parents too 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.699
 I bought a concorde crashed from the plane that circulate 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.469
 I had bought on occasion there are only mobile engines in 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:42.550
 more than a thousand favelas 1 km per second 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.550
 so easy to remember 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.550
 that is 3600 kilometers an hour 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.480
 I join street at 9,370 bonhams speed 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.699
 in the space is ridiculous 3600 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.169
 at 3600 kilometers an hour 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.169
 from the earth to the moon it takes five days 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.139
 we talk about it a little further 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.599
 at the same wild state until jupiter at erevan at 10 800 million 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:07.909
 kilometers 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.899
 still the same speed you could parents it's 23 years old to go 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.689
 in fact go on fire to the evasions 5th openair theory is retired 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.020
 saturate his 42 years to go 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.050
 84 'return one kilometer seconds 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.539
 rather since they arrived at pluton 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.909
 these century reminders to go 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.569
 training for the return 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.759
 and if we want to leave the solar system to go to the most star 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:35.310
 close 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.350
 I do not speak of ours has no sun 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.430
 another star 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.110
 the closest to us is called proxima 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.479
 in French the word proximity 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:44.639
 it's the closest 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.339
 because by chance effect the same dimensions as the sun 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.949
 so for people do a red bull like this one 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.949
 and if I want to respect the distance 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.819
 on the model I have 38 centimeters between the earth and the moon 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.869
 on the model 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:03.199
 the nearest star would not be 38 thousand kilometers on the model 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.749
 when here at 38 centimeters 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:10.680
 and at that distance 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.120
 11 super concorde that only took two centuries to go to earlier 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.909
 you do not need a million two hundred thousand years 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:19.629
 to go to the nearest star 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:20.960
 dissensions 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.729
 astronomical and there really 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.599
 the word for all its value 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.180
 if it was tolerated the nearest 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.740
 it means that others are further away 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.089
 for example the two twins 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:35.110
 his talent 36 light-years and 45 light-years 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.320
 we see them next to each other 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.779
 with our eyes 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:43.439
 and 36 light-years away 45 light-years not add say that 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:46.710
 it was a light-years and it's very simple 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.860
 with the matching mans 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.090
 a single year of light 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.249
 ask him 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:54.599
 three hundred thousand 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.229
 I said 300 million 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:57.949
 for a light year 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.129
 and as the nearest star is at 4 4 3 12 I told you just now 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.119
 one million two hundred thousand years 

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:05.789
 it means that two gemini to another 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:08.789
 concord and nearly two million seven hundred million 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:12.649
 now you have an idea of ​​what a new 

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.099
 model of the solar system
