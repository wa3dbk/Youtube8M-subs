00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.030

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.350
 do you have a transfer in tripoli and then yes 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.479

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.680
 make connections between nations 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.390
 Africa is a society that already 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.149

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.759

 invested in setting up one 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.940
 important international

 viaducts especially the had that and that 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.420

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.280
 I hardly know the airport then 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.410
 I first went there when it was 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.660
 there was another aviation and bar codes then 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.200

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.840
 attack that libya was suspected of 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.110
 but from the airport I know it now 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.610

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:27.620
 opinion and Gaddafi wanted a nice one there 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.480

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.360
 Dubai we wanted to transform it and it 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.450
 pieces of rich land with a lot of oil money loop 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.160
 to a sore of 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.890
 morning we were kicked by the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.170
 messages from libya that there is one 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.450
 plane crash occurred on this 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.490
 moment we think of victims 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.150
 we to relatives and relatives 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.590
 friends who are now in uncertainty 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.470
 Embassy employees are ter 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.709
 spot to offer help to check 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.270
 how the situation on the ground is 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.430
 has a crisis team been formed or 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.230
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.520
 thijs ministerial council has miss hagen 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.190
 us of course always informed 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.480
 loved what was known 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.030
 You can be assured of that 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.410
 Foreign Affairs will do everything to 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.150
 provide assistance where possible to 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.800
 provide support 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.140
 but at the moment we think of course 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.450
 to the fate of all those in 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.580
 uncertainty and it is about 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.650
 as the now looks at the large group 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.960
 Dutch and that is sad in and out 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.360
 message on this day go the next 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.890
 case first happen the embassy 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.310
 employees are able to place one 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:43.050
 of course to offer help where possible 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.360
 light crisis team checks which one 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.919
 person it is going to be information 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.450
 provided 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:50.669
 There is also a phone number 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.710
 relatives or acquaintances and a can 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.390
 call to get information 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.040
 and of course you'll have to make the 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.410
 repatriation identification of 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.040
 victims these things that ask 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.040
 had full attention 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.210
 II know I can remember 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.759
 a few years ago a message in the 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.979
 newspaper also read a nigerian 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.710
 but plane on Schiphol Airport 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.960
 chain was laid because the tail lift with 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.789
 had tied up an iron wire 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.590
 so yes the 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.139
 in general it doesn't get whole 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.909
 much maintenance on that device 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.449
 committed and I think it is true 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.289
 that the nigerian 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.930
 airlines each time from 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:38.919
 buy an old bore in america for 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.569
 $ 100,000 that seems about the 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.460
 price and that's where she flies 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.650
 for a while until this no longer does and 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.210
 then they buy a new my libi 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.430
 is that very different arms that lead 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.770
 Quite prosperity is the richest 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.680
 country of africa its princes 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.169
 the united nations yes you interpret that 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.120
 is it with the facade in rules 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.039
 libians not so good nobody knows 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.860
 in libya also what is what the rules 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.990
 exactly its purpose if you are there 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.360
 even if you want a visa 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.830
 for libya the rules 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.830
 change every few months
