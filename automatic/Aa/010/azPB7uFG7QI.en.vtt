00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.170
 precisely my audience so of these two 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.640
 range of characters we mounted everything 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.830
 the show with the most numbers 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.050
 stronger than them we had the goal of the game 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.140
 was precisely to propose for for a 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.600
 public enough large so we'll go from 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.920

 we also have singers 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.340
 dancers and singers that we 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.070
 found during dinner and for the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.690
 great review on Saturday night it was not 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.950
 badly of research already around all this 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.510
 which is being done at the level of 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.940
 review cabaret little bit everywhere in 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.320
 France abroad 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.900
 the idea was to succeed in having a 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.420
 friendly atmosphere very festive but 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.450
 on a really prestigious screen with 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.830
 very beautiful costumes 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.820
 the idea was really to dream 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.290
 people because people today we 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.870
 gives us to have fun dreaming 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.130
 the idea was to succeed in leading 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.150
 really 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.310
 to be a little bit all the arts at 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.140
 level of this show to do a 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.120
 review with great classics of 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:52.010
 cabaret but also with a lot 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:54.140
 of originality charm humor sensuality 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.820
 original music and costumes make up 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.920
 this magazine carried by artists 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.420
 warm all in one atmosphere 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.340
 festive and friendly 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.260
 the goal is to pass a good 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.730
 moment to everyone we take 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.730
 pleasure in giving pleasure to people 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.890
 and I think that's the most important 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.890
 rhinestones glitter and dream 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.799
 but 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.169
 there is a lot used to launch on 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.000
 can judge appreciate the quality of this 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.610
 we could and here I say a big congratulations 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.240

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.370

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.680
 really it was missing and the bowl at illÃ©la 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.620

 we were very happy with all the 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.960
 programs 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.199
 obviously for me it was very good 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.340
