hello and welcome to my tutorial on how

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.090 
hello and welcome to my tutorial on how
to<00:00:02.700> use<00:00:02.850> video<00:00:03.179> motion<00:00:03.510> traction<00:00:04.020> blender<00:00:04.440> if

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
to use video motion traction blender if

to use video motion traction blender if
you've<00:00:05.879> ever<00:00:06.089> tried<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.450> before<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:06.810> failed

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
you've ever tried this before and failed

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.640 
you've ever tried this before and failed
it's<00:00:07.589> because<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.429> builds<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.510> Python<00:00:10.320> script

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
it's because the builds of Python script

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.640 
it's because the builds of Python script
that<00:00:10.769> voodoo<00:00:11.370> uses<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.120> outdated<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.960> today's

version<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.219> blender<00:00:14.690> this<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.809> how<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> fix

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
version of blender this is how to fix

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.980 
version of blender this is how to fix
that<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.130> first<00:00:17.310> get<00:00:17.789> your<00:00:17.940> camera<00:00:18.330> because<00:00:18.510> we

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
that so first get your camera because we

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.279 
that so first get your camera because we
need<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.350> make<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> sequence<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.609> images<00:00:21.289> so

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
need to make a sequence of images so

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.660 
need to make a sequence of images so
it's<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> resolution<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.340> image<00:00:23.519> that

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
it's the resolution of the image that

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.900 
it's the resolution of the image that
you're<00:00:23.789> using<00:00:24.740> I'm<00:00:25.740> not<00:00:26.010> sure<00:00:26.160> if<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.580> don't

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
you're using I'm not sure if the I don't

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.550 
you're using I'm not sure if the I don't
think<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> frame<00:00:27.510> rate<00:00:27.539> matters<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.289> I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
think that the frame rate matters but I

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.479 
think that the frame rate matters but I
do<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.949> habit<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:32.960> we<00:00:33.960> don't<00:00:34.110> need<00:00:34.200> it

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
do it out of habit and we don't need it

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.229 
do it out of habit and we don't need it
let's<00:00:35.489> go<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.739> go<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.070> movie<00:00:38.610> set<00:00:39.030> this

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
let's go here you go to movie set this

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.369 
let's go here you go to movie set this
to<00:00:39.540> 1<00:00:40.250> 2<00:00:41.390> here<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.719> choose<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> movie<00:00:43.260> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
to 1 2 here and choose the movie that

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.799 
to 1 2 here and choose the movie that
you<00:00:43.500> want<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.420> set<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
you want and this and set it to the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.889 
you want and this and set it to the
number<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.950> frames<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.340> want<00:00:50.899> you'll

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
number of frames that you want you'll

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.290 
number of frames that you want you'll
have<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.260> go<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.590> because<00:00:52.980> sometimes<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
have to go here because sometimes the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.099 
have to go here because sometimes the
last<00:00:54.629> frames<00:00:54.930> are<00:00:55.140> black<00:00:56.660> gives<00:00:57.890> add<00:01:00.109> assume

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
last frames are black gives add assume

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.080 
last frames are black gives add assume
it's<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.350> frame<00:01:01.620> rate<00:01:01.770> issue<00:01:02.070> from<00:01:02.340> converting

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it's a frame rate issue from converting

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.649 
it's a frame rate issue from converting
this<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.680> converting<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> video<00:01:05.299> but<00:01:06.299> those

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
this I converting the video but those

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.190 
this I converting the video but those
frames<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:08.689> they<00:01:09.689> are<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.710> functional<00:01:11.400> so

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
frames but they are not functional so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.620 
frames but they are not functional so
see<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.939> I<00:01:16.490> don't<00:01:17.490> know<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.770> yeah<00:01:19.770> so

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
see this and I don't know what I yeah so

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.880 
see this and I don't know what I yeah so
if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.900> manage<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> not<00:01:22.560> make<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> mistake

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
if you manage to not make the mistake

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.039 
if you manage to not make the mistake
that<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.340> made<00:01:23.430> there<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.090> can<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
that I made there you can go here and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.249 
that I made there you can go here and
then<00:01:25.680> find<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.250> folder<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> put<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.240> images<00:01:28.080> in

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
then find a folder to put the images in

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.069 
then find a folder to put the images in
have<00:01:28.950> them<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.250> PNG<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.689> find<00:01:30.930> that

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
have them in PNG because I find that

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.539 
have them in PNG because I find that
that's<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.979> best<00:01:32.490> quality<00:01:33.270> soon<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.490> want<00:01:35.490> to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that's the best quality soon I want to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.300 
that's the best quality soon I want to
be<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> highest<00:01:35.970> quality<00:01:36.119> possible--<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
be the highest quality possible-- and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.280 
be the highest quality possible-- and
render<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:39.450> should<00:01:39.689> look<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:39.960> like

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
render it and it should look just like

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.760 
render it and it should look just like
the<00:01:40.890> image<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.850> already<00:01:42.540> did<00:01:42.869> render<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> before

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the image I already did render it before

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.039 
the image I already did render it before
so<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.540> through<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> entire

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
so I don't have to go through the entire

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.620 
so I don't have to go through the entire
process<00:01:46.369> then<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.729> open<00:01:47.939> video<00:01:48.299> when

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
process then you have to open video when

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.960 
process then you have to open video when
you've<00:01:48.750> finished<00:01:49.700> give<00:01:50.700> us<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.090> load<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.820> press

ctrl s to open an image sequence browse
and<00:01:59.570> find<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.399> just<00:02:02.399> click<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> first

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
and find it so just click on the first

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.469 
and find it so just click on the first
image<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.610> it'll<00:02:05.610> show<00:02:05.790> how<00:02:05.969> many<00:02:06.149> images

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
image and I it'll show how many images

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.440 
image and I it'll show how many images
it<00:02:06.899> has<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.799> sequence

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
it has in the sequence

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.180 
it has in the sequence
and<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:10.349> rendered<00:02:10.800> 300<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.459> them<00:02:11.640> because<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
and I rendered 300 of them because the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.990 
and I rendered 300 of them because the
599<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.790> bit<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.989> than<00:02:16.200> I'd<00:02:16.349> need<00:02:16.849> then<00:02:17.849> you

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
599 is a bit more than I'd need then you

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.729 
599 is a bit more than I'd need then you
press<00:02:18.209> track<00:02:18.630> but<00:02:18.989> I've<00:02:19.080> already<00:02:19.260> tracked

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
press track but I've already tracked

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.690 
press track but I've already tracked
this<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.310> stop<00:02:20.640> tracking<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.800> will<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.459> should

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
this so stop tracking I will you should

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.610 
this so stop tracking I will you should
leave<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.239> tracking<00:02:24.720> until<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.200> thing

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
leave a tracking until the thing

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.460 
leave a tracking until the thing
disappears<00:02:26.600> but<00:02:27.600> then<00:02:27.780> when<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.020> go<00:02:28.200> through

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
disappears but then when you go through

this before so I'll just say how but it

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.930 
this before so I'll just say how but it
won't<00:03:07.200> actually<00:03:07.440> be<00:03:07.680> pressing<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.400> replace

won't actually be pressing the replace

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.000 
won't actually be pressing the replace
button<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.870> have<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.200> find<00:03:10.470> all<00:03:10.860> occurrences

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
button you have to find all occurrences

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.750

replace<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.239> with<00:03:18.269> nothing<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:19.859> do

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
replace it with nothing so and you do

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.160 
replace it with nothing so and you do
that<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.340> will<00:03:20.549> delete<00:03:20.910> one<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.329> should<00:03:21.630> have

had with this track that doesn't usually

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.170 
had with this track that doesn't usually
happen<00:03:55.260> maybe<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.640> new<00:03:56.790> version<00:03:56.970> of

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
happen maybe it's the new version of

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.080 
happen maybe it's the new version of
blender<00:03:57.440> but<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.530> will<00:03:58.650> say<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.640> might

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
blender but it will say that that might

blender but it will say that that might
say<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.690> depending<00:04:01.230> on<00:04:01.290> your<00:04:01.470> track<00:04:01.650> added

out lens underscore unit equals degrees

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.210 
out lens underscore unit equals degrees
and<00:04:05.400> quotations<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.329> an<00:04:06.630> issue<00:04:06.950> so<00:04:07.950> I'll<00:04:08.040> just

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
and quotations is an issue so I'll just

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.020 
and quotations is an issue so I'll just
delete<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.579> I<00:04:09.060> tried<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:09.959> before<00:04:10.170> it

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
delete that I tried this before it

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.870 
delete that I tried this before it
deleting<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.150> didn't<00:04:12.389> really<00:04:12.569> seem<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:12.959> have

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
deleting that didn't really seem to have

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.969 
deleting that didn't really seem to have
an<00:04:14.880> effect<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.780> track<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.289> so<00:04:16.320> works<00:04:16.769> just

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
an effect on the track it so works just

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.399 
an effect on the track it so works just
fine<00:04:17.269> except<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.450> notice<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:18.780> there<00:04:19.019> are<00:04:19.109> two

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
fine except I notice that there are two

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:22.950 
fine except I notice that there are two
of<00:04:19.769> these<00:04:20.130> empties<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.959> empty<00:04:22.260> is

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
of these empties so the empty is

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.249 
of these empties so the empty is
disky<00:04:23.740> parent<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:25.330> camera<00:04:25.690> is<00:04:25.750> parented<00:04:26.229> to

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
disky parent the camera is parented to

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.360 
disky parent the camera is parented to
it<00:04:26.530> is<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.370> camera<00:04:27.729> is<00:04:28.320> keyframes<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.620> move

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
it is the camera is keyframes to move

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.969 
it is the camera is keyframes to move
along<00:04:30.850> with<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.240> camera<00:04:31.539> in<00:04:31.840> real<00:04:32.050> life<00:04:32.199> well

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
along with the camera in real life well

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.100 
along with the camera in real life well
this<00:04:33.310> is<00:04:33.490> not<00:04:33.669> keyframes<00:04:34.240> so<00:04:34.419> you<00:04:34.570> move<00:04:34.840> this

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
this is not keyframes so you move this

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.680 
this is not keyframes so you move this
and<00:04:35.380> then<00:04:35.949> that's<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:37.000> new<00:04:37.150> place<00:04:37.389> for<00:04:37.419> your

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
and then that's a new place for your

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.890 
and then that's a new place for your
camera<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.080> start<00:04:38.350> I<00:04:40.800> said<00:04:41.800> this<00:04:42.009> I<00:04:42.900> should

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
camera to start I said this I should

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.749 
camera to start I said this I should
turn<00:04:44.169> on<00:04:44.289> screencast<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.190> you<00:04:45.280> so<00:04:45.430> you<00:04:45.520> can<00:04:45.610> see

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
turn on screencast to you so you can see

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.170 
turn on screencast to you so you can see
what<00:04:45.880> I'm<00:04:45.970> doing<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:47.699> then<00:04:48.699> there<00:04:49.000> are<00:04:49.060> these

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
what I'm doing and then there are these

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.420 
what I'm doing and then there are these
little<00:04:49.660> dots<00:04:49.930> which<00:04:50.350> you<00:04:50.740> can<00:04:50.919> delete<00:04:51.190> if<00:04:51.310> you

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
little dots which you can delete if you

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.510 
little dots which you can delete if you
want<00:04:51.610> but<00:04:51.910> I<00:04:52.380> would<00:04:53.380> like<00:04:53.500> to<00:04:53.560> keep<00:04:54.009> them<00:04:54.280> and

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
want but I would like to keep them and

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.330 
want but I would like to keep them and
rotate<00:04:55.360> them<00:04:55.599> by<00:04:55.810> 90<00:04:56.259> degrees<00:04:56.590> negative<00:04:57.070> 90

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
rotate them by 90 degrees negative 90

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.740 
rotate them by 90 degrees negative 90
degrees<00:04:58.080> because<00:04:59.080> if<00:04:59.800> you<00:05:00.160> do<00:05:00.460> this<00:05:00.910> you<00:05:01.570> can

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
degrees because if you do this you can

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.010 
degrees because if you do this you can
see<00:05:02.020> what<00:05:02.320> they<00:05:02.530> are<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:04.150> go<00:05:04.270> here<00:05:05.400> open<00:05:06.400> and

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
see what they are to go here open and

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.740 
see what they are to go here open and
not<00:05:09.030> here<00:05:10.030> and<00:05:10.289> now<00:05:11.910> so<00:05:12.910> this<00:05:13.030> background<00:05:13.240> and

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
not here and now so this background and

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.659 
not here and now so this background and
you<00:05:13.930> can<00:05:13.960> see<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:14.470> these<00:05:14.830> are<00:05:14.889> the<00:05:15.250> same

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
you can see that these are the same

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.670 
you can see that these are the same
points<00:05:16.060> that<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.360> can<00:05:16.389> see<00:05:16.690> tracts<00:05:17.229> in<00:05:17.380> the

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
points that you can see tracts in the

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.790 
points that you can see tracts in the
Voodoo<00:05:18.130> file<00:05:19.199> let's<00:05:20.199> go<00:05:20.349> to<00:05:20.530> background

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
Voodoo file let's go to background

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.450 
Voodoo file let's go to background
images<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:21.610> make<00:05:21.789> this<00:05:21.970> more<00:05:22.509> opaque<00:05:22.810> and

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
images and make this more opaque and

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.760 
images and make this more opaque and
area<00:05:24.460> those<00:05:25.180> are<00:05:25.210> little<00:05:25.780> reference<00:05:26.259> points

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
area those are little reference points

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.800 
area those are little reference points
so<00:05:27.490> if<00:05:27.729> you're<00:05:27.940> outside<00:05:28.240> of<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:28.389> camera<00:05:28.659> view

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
so if you're outside of the camera view

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.810 
so if you're outside of the camera view
you<00:05:29.770> might<00:05:29.949> be<00:05:30.159> able<00:05:30.250> to<00:05:30.430> see<00:05:30.550> what<00:05:30.699> you're

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
you might be able to see what you're

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.029 
you might be able to see what you're
doing

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
doing

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:35.490 
doing
now<00:05:33.039> as<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:33.340> can<00:05:33.460> see<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:34.330> 3d<00:05:34.930> cursor<00:05:35.020> right

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
now as you can see the 3d cursor right

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.100 
now as you can see the 3d cursor right
there<00:05:35.970> will<00:05:36.970> stay<00:05:37.449> in<00:05:37.630> the<00:05:37.720> same<00:05:37.900> place

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
there will stay in the same place

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.810 
there will stay in the same place
although<00:05:38.740> it<00:05:38.949> might<00:05:39.220> be<00:05:39.370> a<00:05:39.400> little<00:05:39.550> different

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
although it might be a little different

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.689 
although it might be a little different
because<00:05:40.180> it<00:05:40.930> lags<00:05:41.229> a<00:05:41.470> little<00:05:41.680> because<00:05:42.159> it's<00:05:42.639> a

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
because it lags a little because it's a

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.820 
because it lags a little because it's a
lot<00:05:42.849> of<00:05:42.880> information<00:05:43.240> to<00:05:43.570> process<00:05:43.720> and<00:05:44.139> the

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
lot of information to process and the

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.200 
lot of information to process and the
resolution<00:05:45.340> isn't<00:05:45.580> even<00:05:46.389> at<00:05:46.539> the<00:05:46.870> right<00:05:47.680> scale

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
resolution isn't even at the right scale

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.710 
resolution isn't even at the right scale
there<00:05:50.580> now<00:05:51.580> everything<00:05:52.090> should<00:05:52.120> move<00:05:52.479> just

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
there now everything should move just

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.189 
there now everything should move just
fine

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 
fine

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:54.960 
fine
the<00:05:53.440> 3d<00:05:53.830> cursor<00:05:53.979> should<00:05:54.340> be<00:05:54.520> in<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:54.759> same

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
the 3d cursor should be in the same

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.399 
the 3d cursor should be in the same
place<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:56.099> if<00:05:57.099> not<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.789> can<00:05:57.820> try<00:05:58.419> again<00:05:58.900> or

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
place and if not you can try again or

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.219 
place and if not you can try again or
you<00:05:59.650> can<00:05:59.800> try<00:06:00.099> using<00:06:00.370> the<00:06:00.729> blender<00:06:01.240> internal

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
you can try using the blender internal

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:03.899 
you can try using the blender internal
motion<00:06:02.680> tracking<00:06:02.889> the<00:06:03.340> reason<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:03.639> you<00:06:03.729> want

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
motion tracking the reason that you want

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.600 
motion tracking the reason that you want
to<00:06:04.030> do<00:06:04.150> this<00:06:04.300> is<00:06:04.539> because<00:06:04.690> it's<00:06:05.680> automatic<00:06:06.070> so

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
to do this is because it's automatic so

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.930 
to do this is because it's automatic so
it<00:06:07.449> will<00:06:07.690> free<00:06:07.990> up<00:06:08.169> some<00:06:08.620> time<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:09.190> you<00:06:09.220> can<00:06:09.460> do

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
it will free up some time so you can do

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.730 
it will free up some time so you can do
something<00:06:10.210> else<00:06:10.419> maybe<00:06:10.990> on<00:06:11.169> the<00:06:11.289> computer

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
something else maybe on the computer

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.060 
something else maybe on the computer
maybe<00:06:12.009> we<00:06:12.099> can<00:06:12.220> just<00:06:12.610> leave<00:06:12.909> and<00:06:13.770> do<00:06:14.770> something

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
maybe we can just leave and do something

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.950 
maybe we can just leave and do something
else<00:06:15.190> entirely<00:06:15.490> but<00:06:15.789> what<00:06:16.270> I<00:06:16.300> found<00:06:16.509> is<00:06:16.720> voodoo

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
else entirely but what I found is voodoo

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.600 
else entirely but what I found is voodoo
although<00:06:17.919> it<00:06:18.220> does<00:06:18.669> say<00:06:19.030> in<00:06:19.300> the<00:06:20.169> program<00:06:20.610> it

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
although it does say in the program it

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.629 
although it does say in the program it
loads<00:06:22.560> that<00:06:23.560> it<00:06:23.740> does<00:06:23.889> have<00:06:24.099> free<00:06:24.430> move

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639

tracking<00:06:25.000> add<00:06:25.630> to<00:06:26.409> my<00:06:26.530> knowledge<00:06:26.889> that

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
tracking add to my knowledge that

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.730 
tracking add to my knowledge that
doesn't<00:06:27.490> work<00:06:27.669> if<00:06:28.360> you<00:06:28.509> like<00:06:28.630> your<00:06:28.810> free<00:06:29.560> move

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
doesn't work if you like your free move

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.649 
doesn't work if you like your free move
if<00:06:30.280> that's<00:06:30.550> when<00:06:30.759> you're<00:06:30.909> moving<00:06:31.210> forward<00:06:31.450> or

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:31.659 
if that's when you're moving forward or

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.070 
if that's when you're moving forward or
backwards<00:06:32.340> it<00:06:33.340> doesn't<00:06:33.700> seem<00:06:34.300> to<00:06:34.450> work<00:06:34.539> for<00:06:34.960> me

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
backwards it doesn't seem to work for me

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.690 
backwards it doesn't seem to work for me
but<00:06:35.860> I<00:06:35.919> did<00:06:36.130> find<00:06:36.400> that

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
but I did find that

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.670 
but I did find that
camera<00:06:37.420> on<00:06:37.510> tripod<00:06:37.630> it<00:06:38.020> doesn't<00:06:38.500> need<00:06:38.650> a

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
camera on tripod it doesn't need a

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.460 
camera on tripod it doesn't need a
tripod<00:06:39.210> for<00:06:40.210> example<00:06:40.690> this<00:06:41.620> video<00:06:42.750> here<00:06:43.750> was

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
tripod for example this video here was

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.340 
tripod for example this video here was
just<00:06:44.550> handheld<00:06:45.690> they<00:06:46.690> just<00:06:46.870> held<00:06:47.110> the<00:06:47.200> camera

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
just handheld they just held the camera

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.190 
just handheld they just held the camera
just<00:06:47.530> if<00:06:47.770> you<00:06:48.430> do<00:06:48.550> that<00:06:48.730> try<00:06:49.150> to<00:06:49.210> have<00:06:49.480> a<00:06:49.720> second

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
just if you do that try to have a second

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.580 
just if you do that try to have a second
hand<00:06:50.320> to<00:06:50.560> keep<00:06:50.740> the<00:06:50.800> camera<00:06:51.730> steady<00:06:52.590> because

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
hand to keep the camera steady because

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.590 
hand to keep the camera steady because
if<00:06:54.070> it<00:06:54.220> moves<00:06:54.430> forwards<00:06:54.880> or<00:06:55.030> backwards<00:06:55.060> or

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
if it moves forwards or backwards or

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.450 
if it moves forwards or backwards or
shakes<00:06:55.840> too<00:06:56.080> much<00:06:56.230> you<00:06:56.440> might<00:06:56.620> get<00:06:56.830> some

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
shakes too much you might get some
