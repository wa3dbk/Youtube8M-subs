I was all he's only just come on
this<00:01:09.870> isn't<00:01:10.170> an<00:01:10.260> excuse<00:01:10.700> tebbit's<00:01:12.320> well<00:01:13.320> back

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
to the right Jason park just had to put

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.180 
to the right Jason park just had to put
the<00:01:15.900> brakes<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.590> avoid<00:01:17.010> stepping<00:01:17.370> on<00:01:17.610> side

I think we went with the wrong option
there<00:01:22.050> because<00:01:22.320> Welbeck<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> better<00:01:23.220> fall

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760
