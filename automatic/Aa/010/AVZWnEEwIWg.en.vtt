going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.510> show<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.810> step-by-step<00:00:22.230> how<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.859> do

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
going to show you step-by-step how to do

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.750 
going to show you step-by-step how to do
another<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:25.680> one<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.920> I'm<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.580> do

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
another one the one that I'm going to do

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.589 
another one the one that I'm going to do
though<00:00:27.470> I<00:00:28.470> already<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.730> lot<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.269> different

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
though I already have a lot of different

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.170 
though I already have a lot of different
varying<00:00:31.019> colors<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.890> generally<00:00:32.460> they'll

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
varying colors and generally they'll

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.970 
varying colors and generally they'll
have<00:00:34.430> either<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.180> color<00:00:36.510> or<00:00:36.980> sometimes

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
have either all one color or sometimes

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.760 
have either all one color or sometimes
they'll<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.879> upper<00:00:39.270> petals<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.530> top

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
they'll have the upper petals the top

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.660 
they'll have the upper petals the top
part<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:42.090> be<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.570> color<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:44.370> bottom

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
part will be one color and the bottom

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.930 
part will be one color and the bottom
part<00:00:44.879> will<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> different<00:00:45.750> color<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
part will be a different color so the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.279 
part will be a different color so the
example<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.450> I'm<00:00:48.600> going<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> show<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.050> today

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
is a two-tone one one that's right on

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.610 
is a two-tone one one that's right on
top<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.489> working<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:53.969> bottom<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.620> you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
top and it working on bottom and you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.990 
top and it working on bottom and you
know<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> have<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> chance<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.760> look

know if you have a chance you can look
in<00:00:57.649> gardening<00:00:58.649> books<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> things<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.579> just

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
in gardening books and things and just

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.310 
in gardening books and things and just
kind<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.210> an<00:01:00.329> idea<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> different

from<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.430> our<00:01:08.460> system<00:01:09.200> now<00:01:10.200> we're<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
from with our system now we're going to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.850 
from with our system now we're going to
make<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.220> two<00:01:11.430> parts<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.479> top<00:01:12.750> part<00:01:13.140> will

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
make this in two parts the top part will

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.950 
make this in two parts the top part will
go<00:01:14.040> first<00:01:14.720> we'll<00:01:15.720> start<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:17.390> with<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.689> white

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
go first we'll start it with a white

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.240 
go first we'll start it with a white
petal<00:01:19.490> my<00:01:20.490> petals<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.600> time<00:01:21.900> are<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
petal my petals this time are going to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.840 
petal my petals this time are going to
be<00:01:24.020> not<00:01:25.020> light<00:01:25.380> bulb<00:01:25.680> shaped<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> had<00:01:26.670> on

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
be not light bulb shaped like I had on

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.810 
be not light bulb shaped like I had on
tulips<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.479> daffodils<00:01:28.040> this<00:01:29.040> one<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.520> kind<00:01:29.759> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
tulips and daffodils this one is kind of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.569 
tulips and daffodils this one is kind of
a<00:01:29.939> teardrop<00:01:30.420> shape<00:01:31.040> without<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.369> little

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
a teardrop shape without the little

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.289 
a teardrop shape without the little
point<00:01:32.820> at<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> top<00:01:34.369> so<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.729> very<00:01:35.939> simple

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
point at the top so it's very simple

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
point at the top so it's very simple
pattern<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.829> cut

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
pattern all you have to do is just cut

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.859 
pattern all you have to do is just cut
your<00:01:38.460> pattern<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.090> then<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.630> this

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
your pattern and then you can use this

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.800 
your pattern and then you can use this
to<00:01:40.200> make<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.829> your<00:01:41.130> petals<00:01:41.820> you'll<00:01:42.570> need

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
to make all of your petals you'll need

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.999 
to make all of your petals you'll need
to<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.170> eight<00:01:43.439> petals<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.490> together<00:01:45.710> in<00:01:46.710> my

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
to have eight petals all together in my

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.830 
to have eight petals all together in my
case<00:01:47.280> here<00:01:47.610> I'm<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> use<00:01:48.119> four<00:01:48.479> white

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
case here I'm going to use four white

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.300 
case here I'm going to use four white
and<00:01:49.530> four<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> orchid<00:01:50.850> color<00:01:51.060> once<00:01:52.310> so

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and four of the orchid color once so

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.350 
and four of the orchid color once so
we're<00:01:54.119> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.329> use<00:01:54.509> our<00:01:55.189> pleating<00:01:56.360> again

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
we're going to use our pleating again

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.600 
we're going to use our pleating again
like<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.840> did<00:01:58.020> before<00:01:59.299> in<00:02:00.299> order<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:01.490> put<00:02:02.490> our

like we did before in order to put our

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.760 
like we did before in order to put our
petals<00:02:03.030> up<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.719> let's<00:02:03.990> start<00:02:04.350> out<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
petals up so let's start out with the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.529 
petals up so let's start out with the
first<00:02:04.979> one<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.799> place<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.280> bottom<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.809 
first one and I place the bottom of it
just<00:02:10.019> kind<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.289> pinch<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.709> together<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:17.640> we're

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
just kind of pinch it together and we're

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:30.309 
just kind of pinch it together and we're
going<00:02:17.909> to<00:02:17.969> do<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.719> two<00:02:18.959> on<00:02:19.260> either<00:02:19.530> side<00:02:19.980> next

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
can probably find them at craft stores

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.349 
can probably find them at craft stores
and<00:02:50.639> things<00:02:52.099> these<00:02:53.099> are<00:02:53.159> just<00:02:53.459> very<00:02:53.700> handy<00:02:54.150> for

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
and things these are just very handy for

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.899 
and things these are just very handy for
using<00:02:55.519> when<00:02:56.519> you're<00:02:56.639> doing

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909

three-dimensional artwork on bulletin

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.429 
three-dimensional artwork on bulletin
boards<00:02:58.950> because<00:02:59.579> it's<00:03:00.239> just<00:03:00.540> very<00:03:00.930> simple<00:03:01.319> to

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
boards because it's just very simple to

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.659

is the ones that are going to show
toward<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.349> front

toward the front
our<00:04:23.280> design<00:04:24.080> have<00:04:25.080> a<00:04:25.110> little<00:04:25.680> tiny<00:04:25.980> piece<00:04:26.340> of<00:04:26.610> a

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
our design have a little tiny piece of a

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.720 
our design have a little tiny piece of a
pipe<00:04:27.120> cleaner<00:04:27.390> the<00:04:27.900> yellow<00:04:28.170> pipe<00:04:28.410> cleaner<00:04:28.730> I

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
pipe cleaner the yellow pipe cleaner I

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.110 
pipe cleaner the yellow pipe cleaner I
hot-glued<00:04:30.300> this<00:04:30.720> on<00:04:30.990> it's<00:04:31.980> very<00:04:32.400> simple<00:04:32.790> to<00:04:32.940> do

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
hot-glued this on it's very simple to do

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.040 
hot-glued this on it's very simple to do
and<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:34.320> reason<00:04:34.650> why<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:35.190> did<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.430> is<00:04:35.850> that

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
and the reason why I did that is that

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.610 
and the reason why I did that is that
irises<00:04:37.700> have<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:39.030> little<00:04:39.630> what<00:04:39.930> they<00:04:40.020> call<00:04:40.050> beer

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
irises have a little what they call beer

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.360 
irises have a little what they call beer
on<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.280> lower<00:04:41.490> petals<00:04:42.330> of<00:04:42.810> their<00:04:42.990> flowers<00:04:43.500> so

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
on the lower petals of their flowers so

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.130 
on the lower petals of their flowers so
this<00:04:44.550> is<00:04:44.730> going<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:44.970> service<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.810> beard<00:04:46.080> for

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
this is going to service the beard for

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.540 
this is going to service the beard for
our<00:04:46.410> iris<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:48.650> we're<00:04:49.650> going<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:49.830> use<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.930> same

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
our iris and we're going to use the same

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.540 
our iris and we're going to use the same
method<00:04:53.550> of<00:04:53.580> just<00:04:54.480> kind<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.870> pleating<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.310> top

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
method of just kind of pleating the top

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.970 
method of just kind of pleating the top
of<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:56.880> again<00:04:57.230> just<00:04:58.230> like<00:04:58.380> we've<00:04:58.590> been<00:04:58.620> doing

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
of it again just like we've been doing

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.710 
of it again just like we've been doing
on<00:04:59.100> some<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.400> our<00:04:59.520> others<00:05:00.440> leave<00:05:01.440> this<00:05:02.720> this

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
on some of our others leave this this

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:17.110 
on some of our others leave this this
one<00:05:03.990> look<00:05:04.230> up<00:05:04.380> down<00:05:15.620> okay

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
one look up down okay

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.840 
one look up down okay
then<00:05:18.120> we're<00:05:18.330> going<00:05:18.450> to<00:05:18.510> go<00:05:18.720> ahead<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:19.700> put<00:05:20.700> our

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
then we're going to go ahead and put our

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:52.020 
then we're going to go ahead and put our
other<00:05:22.040> side<00:05:23.040> pieces<00:05:23.370> on

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.170 

get<00:05:53.030> those<00:05:53.270> on<00:05:53.569> we<00:05:53.930> can<00:05:54.110> kind<00:05:54.380> of<00:05:54.440> focus<00:05:55.180> shape

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
get those on we can kind of focus shape

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.409 
get those on we can kind of focus shape
a<00:05:56.419> little<00:05:56.810> bit<00:05:57.220> you<00:05:58.220> think<00:05:58.610> about<00:05:58.819> touch<00:05:59.180> there

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
a little bit you think about touch there

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.719 
a little bit you think about touch there
is<00:05:59.660> it<00:05:59.930> it's<00:06:00.080> bendable<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:00.889> it<00:06:01.069> will<00:06:01.280> be<00:06:01.639> able

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
is it it's bendable so it will be able

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.540 
is it it's bendable so it will be able
conform<00:06:02.300> to<00:06:02.539> the<00:06:03.289> movements<00:06:03.800> that<00:06:03.830> we<00:06:04.099> need<00:06:04.430> to

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
conform to the movements that we need to

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.499 
conform to the movements that we need to
do<00:06:04.729> to<00:06:04.880> make<00:06:05.090> it<00:06:05.270> rounded<00:06:07.030> okay<00:06:08.030> our<00:06:08.240> final

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
do to make it rounded okay our final
