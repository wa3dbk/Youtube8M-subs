00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.450 

one<00:01:15.900> thing<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.170> would<00:01:16.230> recommend<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:17.130> with<00:01:17.310> your

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
one thing I would recommend is with your

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
one thing I would recommend is with your
bacon<00:01:17.940> when<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.240> go<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> cut<00:01:18.690> your<00:01:18.900> big<00:01:19.110> and

bacon when you go to cut your big and
the<00:01:19.380> best<00:01:19.560> thing<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:20.010> is<00:01:20.130> actually<00:01:20.370> stick

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the best thing to do is actually stick

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.670 
the best thing to do is actually stick
it<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.180> freezer<00:01:21.540> for<00:01:22.260> about<00:01:22.290> five
