00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello how about friends to your friend jose today 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.740
 I bring you the analysis of the rom and today 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 for our good xtrail without more 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.279
 We are going to analyze the clothes that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.349
 they treated us precisely 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.119
 time to turn on the rom 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.310
 let's find a style of 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.020
 unlocking completely different to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.059
 which it has been default xperia 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.410
 if we can see it brings a ring 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.360
 slider that I'm pressing what 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.040
 can say to the dial was the camera to the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.050
 messages or precisely unblock what 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.610
 is what we mostly use this good 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.980
 we just enter the rom 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.850
 we can see that it brings new applications 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.219
 new tones in new themes and sound 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.010
 is new that does not come precisely from 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.530
 sony and also in the night that we are 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.079
 talking about that launcher of mine and who's coming 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 being by developers now if 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.460
 we go to the tricks we can see 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.559
 that brings the touches section that would be 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.149
 precisely so that we can 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.170
 activate some things that we do not want 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.990
 for example wifi 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.930
 background vibrate the silence and so on 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.610
 good brings the suggestions that you can 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.710
 send a suggestion to the developer 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.130
 of this rom precisely for you to read it 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.799
 and you can implement it in your role 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.140
 also bring if you want to recommend it the 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.950
 top box that brings the weather widget 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.320
 but it is in Chinese and it brings the time 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.970
 bring this rom apps we can see 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.560
 that brings a cleaner that 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.960
 applications that are in the background 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.550
 they close precisely the album is by 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.100
 defect that come xperia 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.050
 the topics for precisely this is that 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.180
 be connected to wifi if they go to free 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.580
 We can find the topics that are 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.830
 precisely free and once 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.570
 downloaded the topics are going to local by 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.340
 example they give to one and they give apply and 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.440
 the subject will change well that's already a 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.520
 I like you more if you do not 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.670
 let's go to tools we can see what 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.130
 they bring music that would be precisely for 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.130
 that we can listen to songs 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.860
 what else does he bring, let's analyze a little 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.820
 plus the adjustments to the display settings 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.399
 adjustments has not changed absolutely 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.410
 nothing else we can see the tone that 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.940
 has a diamond style if we do not go 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.450
 to screen to move the bravia engine 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.760
 one and two that work together and in this 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.120
 nothing newer section brings this rom 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.950
 now brings the fill explorer in 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.400
 tools we can see the settings of the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.400
 launcher 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.599
 precisely does not bring anything else news and 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.390
 only time they have changed the 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.950
 icons style nothing new 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.950
 notes that is coming from me today and 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.799
 there is also the normal notes we follow 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.599
 watching the radio the clock of mine and 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.209
 there is also the clock or normal in the 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.580
 tool section and precisely 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.190
 this rom has nothing new only 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.900
 of the style that has changed very well and 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.239
 some things that have been implemented or 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.250
 improved something good this I think is the 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.110
 first version that has come out and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.810
 let's hope they keep updating since 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.510
 as we can see is a rom that is very 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.460
 well defined so to speak 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.350
 physically 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.110
 well that has been the analysis of this 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.480
 rom because it just does not bring anything more 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.640
 nothing else brings it so to speak 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.930
 currently brings that has been a change 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:24.230
 which has been precisely physical as well 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.630
 to say it physically in my I met in those 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:32.140
 things and in launcher nothing better in 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:34.930
 performance we're going to give a 8.9 already 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.270
 in interface as we can see the interface 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.120
 It is very fluid and very fast and it is also 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.360
 It has a very nice style we are going to 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.100
 give a 9 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:50.530
 a 9 and precisely in 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.600
 fluency a 9.5 why 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.280
 and say hello right now until I get back 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.260
 if we realize we enter 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.350
 to the adjustments we can see that it enters 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.330
 very quickly without taking anything or almost 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.830
 nothing good has been the analysis of 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.890
 this rom I hope you liked it 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.200
 forget to subscribe later I like I have 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.209
 thought of opening a section that is going to be 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.239
 for the exposÃ© so that we can 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.269
 avoid our xperia and for that 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.700
 We need to have the rom of 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.470
 factory so that we 'll see in 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.940
 another video and why not upload videos 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.530
 previously because I was 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.390
 vacation and I had to take some time 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.400
 the same to be able to analyze very well 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.200
 when greeting and what things to implement and 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.110
 upload so I hope you liked it 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.580
 the video has been a very short video and 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.000
 precisely for that reason it has been short 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.080
 because this rom brings more things and that's what 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.430
 only one that brings good I hope that you 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.200
 liked the video does not want to subscribe to 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.200
 lemme like and goodbye
