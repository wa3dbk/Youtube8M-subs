00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:08.329
 crazy bright of an intelligence 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:12.400
 superior there is a better dispute he hits 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:15.450
 the other player sees the blood 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.630
 when the look says good 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.689
 I'm going home, I'm going to the front and the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.900
 fight good boys today's match is 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.210
 blood green go for the party and its 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.520
 thinking apart he goes to sleep with the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.369
 head full of things and the bed of 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.920
 does a post donations like this can not 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.739
 believe no one because I do not ask you 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.219
 opined and said that ineffective the way 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.130
 that we defend then we 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.989
 we defend attacking by winning 2 to 0 and 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.140
 they leave for late count it takes two 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.200
 actions and attacks if that then the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.390
 temptation to seal all roads 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.220
 of rival's arrival also means 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.560
 multiply the number of balls the 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.739
 that are going to have criticized the nobility 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.019
 instead of and proposed speculation and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.820
 if you speculate the same clean you 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.180
 impact is going to be criticized the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.700
 speculation and claimed nobility by 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.740
 which all this conversation is useless 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.310
 understand me because you know that the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.920
 next time we speculate they will not see 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.689
 a reference to the recommendation of 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.010
 speculation that closes this 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.430
 conversation 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.610
 there will be a criticism and easy to put 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.350
 young players and increase the list 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.180
 of debutantes what needs to be done is 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.640
 put young players who do not fail 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.740
 because putting young players for 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.230
 prove that they serve us that is not the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.960
 function the function is to put players 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.960
 young people to show that if they serve 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.790
 he asked us one by one if we knew that 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.830
 he called them in the lot and of course 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.840
 everything makes us good fools no no no 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.850
 a friend of mine told him if you want 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.759
 by the way it has to work the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.910
 human beings must when they succeed but 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.800
 usually they develop combats of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.370
 strength and 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 and earn from time to time from time to time 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.450
 when you look if you do not reward a 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.950
 process 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.069
 who got less than he got 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.940
 if you do not reward it there is not much risk but 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.710
 if you reward a process that what 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.440
 got 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.930
 he did it undeservedly if there 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.050
 much risk crossing the garden 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.970
 Menotti poetry avoiding the angle of 90 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.130
 degrees treads the flower and arrives faster 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.230
 the one that travels the 90 degree angle 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.450
 It takes longer but does not damage the flower in 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.610
 Catholic I ask a million dollars to 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.140
 I have brought her for her pass and she says and 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.450
 you know it's not worth that money is not 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.580
 true he is good no profession I'm not worth 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.440
 that money so it does not go away is not done in 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.840
 peace sat with me eyes way and 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.670
 He told me I do not want you to know and 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.800
 It is convinced that is not worth a million 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.850
 dollars I've professed I know that it's not going 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.140
 a million dollars 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.760
 go calm in having the 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.200
 recognition to the family was in 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.910
 function that I had done for 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.000
 get that car there was family that 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:23.540
 parents and children worked and 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.760
 they bought it and there was family that 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.480
 they had won the lottery and they bought 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:32.420
 a Mercedes Benz that is not evaluated what 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.530
 achieved but what is deserved then 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.040
 imagine yourself 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.860
 a team that deserves to win justly 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.410
 that attacks the whole party that loses the 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.260
 ball near the rival arch that arrives 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.900
 that uses all the variants got no 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.209
 got deserved if he deserved that they are 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.080
 the quality of the resources that he used 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.660
 noble then clear if that is 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.510
 pitiful 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.180
 cold gray floppy obviously missing idea 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.850
 the criteria that I have for evaluation 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.850
 they are not the same as those that prevail 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.590
 I solve public things in 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.730
 public in private was much more difficult 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.640
 solve what we had to solve 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.310
 this year we get what we got the 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.040
 last year's success and failure 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.400
 come out dressed 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.160
 the outfit with which these 22 depart 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.980
 players facing the future is a lot 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.110
 better than the dress with which 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.440
 the 22 players came out after the 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.770
 success understand me we did not know I did not know 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.890
 manage success if I knew how to manage the 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.950
 adversity I told the whole truth but I 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.810
 I've known for a long time that the truth is 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.320
 said when one has a role of 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.770
 driver if the effect of saying it better 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.380
 the collective does not improve the person who 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.620
 who says it, I say much less things 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.830
 of which I know and of which I know and 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.450
 a lot of truth that I do not express 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.550
 just because one only has 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.040
 to tell the truth not so that the 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.500
 repercussion of the truth that says improve 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.080
 his own image but to improve the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.000
 collective beyond 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.880
 professional admiration I keep so 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.280
 human example 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.030
 my wife one day told me one thing that no 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.040
 I'm going to forget her, she said, I'd like to be 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.440
 cow flirted look they talk a lot yes but 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.470
 they never say what does not correspond 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.750
 also like everything as every virtue has 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.580
 defect is not true the one that never says 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.650
 what does not correspond many times omits 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.530
 tell the truth and that is a by-product 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.410
 unwanted of discretion let's say no 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:54.430
 I thought I had done things 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.800
 well when he later analyzed it I have 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.720
 done everything wrong I do not remember very well the 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.760
 reason for the talk which was not but I 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.280
 I remember that at that moment that 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.900
 recorded I was with my mouth open 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.550
 sure we were dumbfounded of what it is 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.650
 what you are fighting we have the skin of 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.810
 chicken when we already knew that I had 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.760
 broken the crusader good to say I had a 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.849
 talk very 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.539
 [Music] 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:18.069
 very emotional because well I think that 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.709
 I was learning a lot with him 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.889
 there is also an image of the barge of 

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:26.499
 in there and always because he tells us 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.899
 how nice it would be to be there but all 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:31.499
 life has a good time but at the most 

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:31.499
 has everything 

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:38.740
 marcelo is to fly 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.740
 [Music] 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:45.289
 we spent days together we tried 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:48.169
 do your best 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:57.229
 they attack a lot and then recover them with the 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:59.629
 illusion that I already know that this is 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.879
 cheap philosophy said by an Argentine 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:04.759
 who has the opportunity to express himself 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:06.999
 He understands me but I believe in that guy 

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.999
 of things 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.999
 [Music] 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.140
 yes
