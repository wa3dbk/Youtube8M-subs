look that you'd see in some of the

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.619 
look that you'd see in some of the
passenger<00:00:54.199> trains<00:00:54.679> of<00:00:54.859> old<00:00:55.010> days<00:00:55.219> or<00:00:55.489> even

observation deck and these clear hinge

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.280 
observation deck and these clear hinge
windows<00:01:04.370> those<00:01:04.730> are<00:01:04.940> rare<00:01:05.360> pieces<00:01:05.690> I<00:01:06.080> think

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
windows those are rare pieces I think

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.900 
windows those are rare pieces I think
they<00:01:06.440> were<00:01:06.530> only<00:01:06.680> made<00:01:06.980> in<00:01:07.160> the<00:01:08.050> club<00:01:09.050> car<00:01:09.230> sets

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
they were only made in the club car sets

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.220 
they were only made in the club car sets

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.020 
little sloped piece here with the
stripes<00:01:14.750> that's<00:01:15.410> that<00:01:16.100> was<00:01:16.280> unique<00:01:16.580> to<00:01:16.610> these

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
stripes that's that was unique to these

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.750 
stripes that's that was unique to these
sets<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:18.260> rest<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.620> this<00:01:18.740> here<00:01:19.070> is<00:01:19.220> all<00:01:19.430> a

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
sets the rest of this here is all a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.620 
sets the rest of this here is all a
build<00:01:20.390> with<00:01:20.600> plates<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:22.310> doors<00:01:22.610> are<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.360> same

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
build with plates the doors are the same

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.360 
build with plates the doors are the same
doors<00:01:24.080> as<00:01:24.350> you<00:01:24.380> see<00:01:24.710> in<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.480> Metroliner<00:01:27.370> and

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
doors as you see in the Metroliner and

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.220 
doors as you see in the Metroliner and
some<00:01:28.640> good<00:01:29.120> train<00:01:29.420> windows<00:01:29.780> with<00:01:29.930> stripes

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.600 
there but this does open up the top
opens<00:01:34.040> up<00:01:34.540> these<00:01:35.540> are<00:01:35.750> hinges<00:01:36.430> so<00:01:37.430> that's

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
opens up these are hinges so that's

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.060 
opens up these are hinges so that's
pretty<00:01:37.820> cool<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:39.140> we<00:01:39.260> can<00:01:39.410> take<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.590> look<00:01:39.800> at<00:01:39.980> the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
pretty cool so we can take a look at the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.820 
pretty cool so we can take a look at the
top<00:01:40.280> layer<00:01:40.840> which<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:42.110> seating<00:01:42.440> area<00:01:42.770> with

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
top layer which is the seating area with

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.680 
top layer which is the seating area with
tables<00:01:43.430> and<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:46.040> can<00:01:46.220> hold<00:01:46.430> size<00:01:46.640> people<00:01:46.910> and

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
tables and you can hold size people and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.320 
tables and you can hold size people and
then<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.710> piece<00:01:48.950> comes<00:01:49.310> out<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.630> and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
then this piece comes out like so and

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.970 
then this piece comes out like so and
then<00:01:53.330> it<00:01:53.600> has<00:01:54.400> beds<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:55.910> sinks<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.590> we<00:01:57.740> see

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
then it has beds and sinks and we see

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.700 
then it has beds and sinks and we see
some<00:01:58.370> of<00:01:58.400> our<00:01:58.580> passengers<00:01:59.230> taking<00:02:00.230> a<00:02:00.290> nap<00:02:00.470> in

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
some of our passengers taking a nap in

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.080 
some of our passengers taking a nap in
the<00:02:01.040> club<00:02:01.250> car<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:02.300> that<00:02:02.420> was<00:02:02.570> pretty<00:02:02.720> good<00:02:02.960> I

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
the club car so that was pretty good I

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.609 
the club car so that was pretty good I
really<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.510> use<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.870> windows<00:02:08.619> with

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
really like the use of the windows with

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.110 
really like the use of the windows with
this<00:02:09.769> set<00:02:10.069> that's<00:02:10.280> really<00:02:10.579> what<00:02:10.700> makes<00:02:10.879> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
this set that's really what makes the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.289 
this set that's really what makes the
set<00:02:11.359> I<00:02:11.390> think<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:11.900> these<00:02:12.170> hinge<00:02:12.709> windows

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
set I think is these hinge windows

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.559 
set I think is these hinge windows
they're<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:15.680> really<00:02:15.920> neat<00:02:16.189> looking<00:02:16.489> set

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
they're just really neat looking set

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.929 
they're just really neat looking set
and<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.709> would<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.159> go<00:02:20.310> ahead<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.700> show<00:02:20.879> you

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
a very cool passion to train I've seen

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.610 
a very cool passion to train I've seen
some<00:03:37.760> with<00:03:38.000> even<00:03:38.269> more<00:03:38.450> Club<00:03:38.780> cars<00:03:39.019> I<00:03:39.230> only<00:03:39.379> got

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
some with even more Club cars I only got

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.089 
some with even more Club cars I only got
the<00:03:39.739> two<00:03:40.780> but<00:03:41.780> these<00:03:41.900> Lego<00:03:42.230> motors<00:03:42.709> they<00:03:43.040> were

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
the two but these Lego motors they were

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.610 
the two but these Lego motors they were
not<00:03:43.340> designed<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.970> really<00:03:44.269> carry<00:03:44.660> long<00:03:45.019> trains

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
not designed to really carry long trains

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.850 
not designed to really carry long trains
I<00:03:46.040> mean<00:03:46.310> they<00:03:46.400> can<00:03:46.550> pull<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:46.870> but<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.500> heavier

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
I mean they can pull it but the heavier

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.970 
I mean they can pull it but the heavier
the<00:03:49.099> train<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.700> more<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.959> will<00:03:51.019> burn<00:03:51.530> up<00:03:51.739> you

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the train the more it will burn up you

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.100 
the train the more it will burn up you
usually<00:03:52.160> never<00:03:52.519> saw<00:03:52.849> a<00:03:52.879> lego<00:03:53.330> train<00:03:53.629> set<00:03:53.900> with

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
usually never saw a lego train set with

more<00:03:54.379> than<00:03:54.530> three<00:03:54.860> cars<00:03:55.629> because<00:03:56.629> they<00:03:56.750> knew

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900
