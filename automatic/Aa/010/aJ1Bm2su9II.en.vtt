00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
you've mastered the laser which lots of

you've mastered the laser which lots of
our<00:00:37.989> boats<00:00:38.140> are<00:00:38.260> from<00:00:38.409> Simon<00:00:38.739> River<00:00:38.920> sports

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
our boats are from Simon River sports

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.660 
our boats are from Simon River sports
they<00:00:40.269> are<00:00:40.960> out<00:00:41.110> of<00:00:41.140> Quebec<00:00:42.040> I<00:00:42.370> think<00:00:42.550> the

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
a trainer plastic side rail and then

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:51.149 
a trainer plastic side rail and then
there's<00:00:49.239> cirrus<00:00:49.750> which<00:00:50.440> is<00:00:50.559> kind<00:00:50.890> of<00:00:50.920> like<00:00:51.040> an

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
there's cirrus which is kind of like an

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.900 
there's cirrus which is kind of like an
open<00:00:51.280> we<00:00:52.030> use<00:00:52.539> one<00:00:52.719> now<00:00:52.809> nose<00:00:53.019> back<00:00:53.519> what<00:00:54.519> lck

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
open we use one now nose back what lck

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.660 
open we use one now nose back what lck
see<00:00:54.969> the<00:00:55.570> same<00:00:55.750> thing<00:00:55.930> so<00:00:56.309> we're<00:00:57.309> hoping<00:00:57.609> that

have to flip a few times more
conservative<00:05:45.860> people<00:05:45.920> tend<00:05:46.220> to<00:05:46.280> take<00:05:46.430> longer

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
conservative people tend to take longer

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.380 
conservative people tend to take longer
yeah<00:05:47.510> it<00:05:47.750> is<00:05:47.900> not<00:05:48.080> as<00:05:48.200> deep<00:05:48.350> as<00:05:48.470> it<00:05:48.560> looks<00:05:49.390> it's

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
yeah it is not as deep as it looks it's

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.790 
yeah it is not as deep as it looks it's
pretty<00:05:50.600> high<00:05:50.780> though<00:05:50.990> we're<00:05:51.500> kind<00:05:51.650> of<00:05:51.680> going

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
pretty high though we're kind of going

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.960 
pretty high though we're kind of going
we're<00:05:52.040> going<00:05:52.190> through<00:05:52.310> a<00:05:52.370> drought<00:05:52.640> in<00:05:52.910> the

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
southeastern United States they put us

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.450 
southeastern United States they put us
under<00:05:55.640> a<00:05:55.840> federal<00:05:56.840> aid<00:05:57.380> or<00:05:57.920> something<00:05:58.340> they
