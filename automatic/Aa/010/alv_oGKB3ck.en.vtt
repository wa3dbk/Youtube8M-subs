itself<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.179> plug<00:02:09.530> which<00:02:10.530> kind<00:02:11.100> of<00:02:11.130> strangely

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
itself the plug which kind of strangely

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.400 
itself the plug which kind of strangely
does<00:02:11.910> not<00:02:12.060> look<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.300> it's<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.810> meant<00:02:13.230> for

American<00:02:13.770> soil<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> think<00:02:14.970> they<00:02:15.330> might

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
American soil now I think they might
