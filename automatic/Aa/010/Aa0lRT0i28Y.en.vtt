00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
same as before but clearly it was just a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.939 
same as before but clearly it was just a
fraction<00:01:03.059> fraction<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.930> quicken<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.379> maybe<00:01:04.799> a

fraction fraction to quicken and maybe a

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.670

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
fraction too late on the steering so

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.469
