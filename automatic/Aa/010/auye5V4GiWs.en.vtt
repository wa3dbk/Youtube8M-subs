00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.490 
deglaze the bottom of the pan and see
how<00:04:07.949> it<00:04:08.310> looks<00:04:08.879> now<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.900> see<00:04:10.199> how<00:04:10.349> it's

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
how it looks now you see how it's

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.050 
how it looks now you see how it's
shaping<00:04:10.709> up<00:04:10.949> to<00:04:10.980> look<00:04:11.069> like<00:04:11.220> gravy<00:04:11.609> but<00:04:11.940> it's

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
shaping up to look like gravy but it's

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.069 
shaping up to look like gravy but it's
extra<00:04:12.750> think<00:04:13.099> so

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
extra think so

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.849 
extra think so
now<00:04:16.699> if<00:04:17.699> you<00:04:17.880> don't<00:04:18.030> know<00:04:18.120> how<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.269> make<00:04:18.449> gravy

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
now if you don't know how to make gravy

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.289 
now if you don't know how to make gravy
this<00:04:19.859> is<00:04:20.039> issue<00:04:20.280> those<00:04:20.699> of<00:04:20.849> you<00:04:20.940> who<00:04:21.030> know<00:04:21.180> how

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
this is issue those of you who know how

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.909 
this is issue those of you who know how
to<00:04:21.329> make<00:04:21.539> ready<00:04:21.780> you're<00:04:22.229> probably<00:04:22.470> taking<00:04:22.680> up

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
to make ready you're probably taking up

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.649 
to make ready you're probably taking up
a<00:04:23.010> while<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.370> got<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.520> do<00:04:23.669> is<00:04:23.789> this<00:04:23.970> but<00:04:24.510> that's

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
a while you got to do is this but that's

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.000 
a while you got to do is this but that's
an<00:04:24.840> issue<00:04:24.960> if<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.260> don't<00:04:25.440> know<00:04:25.560> how<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.830> make

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
an issue if you don't know how to make

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.800 
an issue if you don't know how to make
gravy<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:26.699> what<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.090> do<00:04:27.210> is<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:27.449> add<00:04:27.599> more

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
gravy so what you do is you add more

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.200 
gravy so what you do is you add more
liquid<00:04:28.020> if<00:04:28.260> it's<00:04:28.409> too<00:04:28.560> thick<00:04:29.930> okay

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.960 

so<00:04:34.050> I'm<00:04:34.110> going<00:04:34.289> to<00:04:34.350> add<00:04:34.500> more<00:04:34.740> liquid<00:04:34.970> that's

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
so I'm going to add more liquid that's

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.680 
so I'm going to add more liquid that's
probably<00:04:36.330> another<00:04:37.009> hmm<00:04:38.009> fourth<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.120> cup<00:04:39.150> or

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
probably another hmm fourth of a cup or

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.600 
probably another hmm fourth of a cup or
maybe<00:04:40.289> a<00:04:40.410> little<00:04:40.530> bit<00:04:40.710> more<00:04:40.860> than<00:04:41.039> 1/4<00:04:41.160> of<00:04:41.490> a

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
maybe a little bit more than 1/4 of a

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.189 
maybe a little bit more than 1/4 of a

probably half half a cup right there um

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.080 
probably half half a cup right there um
what<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:16.020> could<00:05:16.259> do<00:05:16.500> is<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:17.370> could<00:05:17.580> make<00:05:17.849> this

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
what you could do is you could make this

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.290 
what you could do is you could make this
and<00:05:18.419> then<00:05:18.800> just<00:05:19.800> use<00:05:20.039> that<00:05:20.070> or<00:05:20.849> either<00:05:20.970> mix

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
and then just use that or either mix

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.140 
and then just use that or either mix
that<00:05:21.509> in<00:05:21.810> at<00:05:22.080> this<00:05:22.259> point<00:05:22.560> with<00:05:23.280> on<00:05:23.639> some<00:05:23.880> rice

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
that in at this point with on some rice

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.210 
that in at this point with on some rice
and<00:05:24.630> make<00:05:24.990> some<00:05:25.139> kind<00:05:25.349> of<00:05:25.380> creamy<00:05:25.680> rice<00:05:25.919> with

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
and make some kind of creamy rice with

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.969 
and make some kind of creamy rice with
it<00:05:26.430> um<00:05:26.669> you<00:05:27.570> can<00:05:27.720> add<00:05:27.900> more<00:05:28.080> liquid<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.440> stretch

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
it um you can add more liquid to stretch

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.600 
it um you can add more liquid to stretch
this<00:05:29.340> but<00:05:30.090> this<00:05:30.780> looks<00:05:31.139> more<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:31.770> like<00:05:32.310> what<00:05:32.580> I

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
this but this looks more so like what I

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.320

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
though I just did like three or four

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.779 
though I just did like three or four
pinches<00:06:03.930> there<00:06:04.620> were<00:06:04.710> very<00:06:04.889> small<00:06:05.190> pinches<00:06:05.669> I

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
pinches there were very small pinches I

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.279 
pinches there were very small pinches I
didn't<00:06:06.030> take<00:06:06.150> a<00:06:06.180> really<00:06:06.539> good<00:06:06.750> pinch<00:06:07.020> so

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
didn't take a really good pinch so

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.260 
didn't take a really good pinch so
that's<00:06:08.009> not<00:06:08.190> a<00:06:08.220> whole<00:06:08.430> lot<00:06:08.610> of<00:06:08.639> salt<00:06:08.970> for<00:06:09.150> those

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270
