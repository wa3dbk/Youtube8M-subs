00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.760
 welcome to the carbonara spaghetti 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.000
 on Italian home cooking for one of the 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.020
 most known and loved recipes of 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.510
 kitchen of central italy very easy e 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.430
 fast to do youth allowance 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.850
 perhaps the first thing I learned to 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.170
 cook for girlish friends for 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.050
 prepare it 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.469
 you need a good pillow like that 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.909
 I'm slicing pecorino e eggs 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:40.719
 of course we put spaghetti on 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:43.839
 boil the spaghetti as always 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:48.879
 they will go into a pot of salted water 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:50.739
 pretty full without adding others 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.899
 fat that the pillow has enough 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.359
 of his own 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.749
 sautÃ© the pillow while the 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:02.319
 pasta cooks and we grate naturally 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:05.830
 with pecorino cheese if you don't find the 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:09.460
 pillow you can solve using 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.579
 of good quality tiredness perhaps 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.250
 a mixture of lard and pancetta to which 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:17.770
 add a pinch of chilli and 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.229
 a pinch of pepper to approach the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.380
 as much as possible to what the perfume is 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.530
 and the taste of the pillow 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.180
 we come to the eggs which of course seen 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:34.179
 what we eat cruz and will have to be 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:37.600
 beautiful slices we will use one whole and one 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:41.579
 yolk don't just use yolk otherwise 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.579
 the carbonara live it soupy 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 beat the eggs well and add the 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.400
 grated pecorino cheese 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:00.340
 if it is not refused by Janus a little will come 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:05.740
 sweeter we have to create a cream that 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:10.110
 both well homogeneous 6 cheese does not create the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.900
 cream then the pasta does not take sauce 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:20.020
 then add the le until not 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:23.410
 you will have another dense one as you see 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.500
 a good part of the pillow has melted and 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.040
 another part if the pasta is toasted 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.140
 and almost cooked for which we are at a good point 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.950
 I'm continuing to work 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.920
 my egg cream the pecorino you see 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:46.090
 which is really very very dense because 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:52.420
 joining the pillow then it will melt in 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:57.510
 part we pour the drained pasta e 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.510
 immediately the hot bacon 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:07.989
 we just have to mix very well of 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.750
 bring our carbonara to the table 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.520
 accompanied by a little pepper from 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.360
 grind fresh for those who wanted it 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.360
 to add
