 Hi everyone I am Kiro from Melamorsicata.it and today I want to talk to you about this case 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.074
 for iPhone 4 and 4S it's called BookBook 

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:19.120
 I wanted to try it for some time because it's very pretty, it's in the shape of a book 

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:27.918
 it is made by Twelve South this is the case with a good packaging 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.830
 very accurate with cardboard 

00:00:32.697 --> 00:00:35.185
 this is the case here 

00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:39.532
 it is made of leather 

00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:49.041
 it's brown but if I'm not mistaken it's available in different variants inside there is this section 

00:00:49.041 --> 00:01:00.599
 where you can insert your credit cards here is a section that is theoretically made for the driving license but you can use it as you wish 

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:04.765
 then there is an inside pocket where you can insert money 

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:09.730
 here you put the iPhone you pull this tab which is a kind of bookmark 

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:22.043
 and pull this cardboard iPhone away and I have my iPhone 4S to try 

00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:24.536
 so I insert it 

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:31.780
 here it is 

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:42.510
 the nice thing is this profile, among other things very nice, because these sections are in relief 

00:01:43.434 --> 00:01:49.300
 so it looks like an old book from the 1800s 

00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:59.230
 I tried it for a few days and I can tell you the pros and cons of this case 

00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:09.230
 first and foremost, the skin is very good, even the scent of leather, it is therefore very good original leather 

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:18.960
 the thing I would improve is that here, as you can see, there is no hole for the camera 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:32.610
 so when you have to take a picture, you have to lift the tongue, get the phone out and take pictures so that this photo section comes out 

00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:36.280
 and photographers 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:41.880
 even if, in theory, I can make a home-made hole 

00:03:17.493 --> 00:03:29.020
 here the work is finished, I made this sort of flower with that instrument and a hole for the camera came out 

00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.860
 although I would have preferred it to have been done by the company 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:42.450
 the hole seems to work, so now it's possible to take pictures even without taking out the camera and this is very important 

00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:52.780
 another thing I wanted to tell you is the fact that, obviously, as a closed book you will have to open it 

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:59.800
 and bring it back. This means that when talking on the phone this section is exposed to the public 

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:09.450
 therefore I suggest you not to insert documents with sensitive data, such as credit cards, where the code could be read 

00:04:10.878 --> 00:04:20.420
 even if someone, but I have not verified, could be afraid of seeing the credit cards demagnetized in contact with the radiation of the iPhone 

00:04:21.108 --> 00:04:25.780
 but this is a subjective thing, I don't know if the phenomenon is connected 

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:39.860
 another thing I wanted to change ... do you see this area with the + and - buttons of the volume? They are designed on this side of the case 

00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:49.010
 and I would have preferred there to be holes, because this effect of raised skin is not very nice to see 

00:04:50.167 --> 00:05:02.650
 otherwise it is a very beautiful case. In his pocket he does not occupy who knows how much space, besides the skin is beautiful to touch 

00:05:02.653 --> 00:05:05.390
 she's very pretty 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:14.190
 you can find it on the BookBook store, the price is $ 59.99 and they also ship in Italy with FedEX 

00:05:14.194 --> 00:05:17.880
 that's all, at the next review on Melamorsicata.it. Thank you
