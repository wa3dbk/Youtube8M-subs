straight on the road and I really didn't

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.369 
straight on the road and I really didn't
get<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.430> chance<00:04:46.669> to<00:04:46.849> spend<00:04:47.719> the<00:04:47.810> time<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.199> give

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
get a chance to spend the time and give

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.740 
get a chance to spend the time and give
the<00:04:48.500> buck<00:04:48.680> as<00:04:49.039> much<00:04:49.219> time<00:04:49.430> to<00:04:49.580> heal<00:04:49.759> but<00:04:50.000> you

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
the buck as much time to heal but you

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.659

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
over and you know to do it was the

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.469 
over and you know to do it was the
studio<00:04:57.590> a<00:04:57.620> bit<00:04:57.830> able<00:04:58.099> to<00:04:58.189> do<00:04:58.280> surgery<00:04:58.460> but<00:04:58.729> it

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
studio a bit able to do surgery but it

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.659

there's<00:05:02.030> a<00:05:02.150> lot<00:05:02.180> of<00:05:02.389> a<00:05:02.449> lot<00:05:02.599> of<00:05:02.659> thinking<00:05:03.050> and

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
there's a lot of a lot of thinking and

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.749 
there's a lot of a lot of thinking and
then<00:05:03.349> meaning<00:05:03.919> after<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.219> World<00:05:04.400> Cup<00:05:04.460> then

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.519 
in between and you still have the test
crickets<00:05:41.330> do<00:05:41.449> you<00:05:41.509> think<00:05:41.690> that<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:41.960> calendars

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:42.529 
crickets do you think that the calendars

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.379 
crickets do you think that the calendars
perhaps<00:05:43.250> are<00:05:43.430> a<00:05:43.460> bit<00:05:43.729> too<00:05:43.879> crammed<00:05:44.120> would<00:05:44.330> you

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
perhaps are a bit too crammed would you

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.879 
perhaps are a bit too crammed would you
like<00:05:44.509> to<00:05:44.629> see<00:05:44.750> some<00:05:44.930> breathing<00:05:45.379> space<00:05:45.409> on<00:05:45.830> the

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
like to see some breathing space on the

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.409 
like to see some breathing space on the
calendars<00:05:46.310> to<00:05:46.699> give<00:05:46.849> the<00:05:46.940> cricketers<00:05:47.300> a

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
calendars to give the cricketers a

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.629 
calendars to give the cricketers a
chance<00:05:47.750> to<00:05:47.870> be<00:05:47.930> with<00:05:48.050> a<00:05:48.110> family<00:05:48.259> some<00:05:48.650> more<00:05:48.830> and

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
chance to be with a family some more and

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.980 
chance to be with a family some more and
I<00:05:49.789> think<00:05:49.969> that's<00:05:50.089> important<00:05:50.569> to<00:05:50.659> be<00:05:50.750> honest

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
I think that's important to be honest

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.300 
I think that's important to be honest
