stitch<00:00:47.260> all<00:00:47.949> you're<00:00:48.430> going<00:00:48.549> to<00:00:48.610> do<00:00:48.790> is<00:00:49.059> take

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
stitch all you're going to do is take

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.130 
stitch all you're going to do is take
your<00:00:50.019> right<00:00:50.229> needle<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:52.120> into<00:00:52.479> the<00:00:52.629> front<00:00:52.989> of

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
your right needle go into the front of

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.500 
your right needle go into the front of
the<00:00:53.350> next<00:00:53.710> stitch<00:00:53.920> on<00:00:54.280> your<00:00:54.339> left<00:00:55.119> needle<00:00:56.220> and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the next stitch on your left needle and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.969 
the next stitch on your left needle and
then<00:00:58.510> wrap<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.960> yarn<00:00:58.989> counterclockwise

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
then wrap the yarn counterclockwise

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:06.420 
then wrap the yarn counterclockwise
around<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:01.239> right<00:01:01.420> needle<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:06.100> slide

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
around the right needle and then slide

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.610 
around the right needle and then slide
that<00:01:06.610> stitch<00:01:06.909> off<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.270> left<00:01:07.659> needle

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.100 

so<00:01:12.160> in<00:01:12.460> through<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.030> front<00:01:13.330> of<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.840> stitch

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
so in through the front of the stitch

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.030 
so in through the front of the stitch
wrap<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:16.150> yarn<00:01:16.360> counterclockwise<00:01:17.230> and<00:01:20.040> then

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
wrap the yarn counterclockwise and then

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:39.010 
wrap the yarn counterclockwise and then
off<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.580> left<00:01:21.820> needle

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.740 

so<00:01:39.560> it's<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.799> lot<00:01:40.039> slower<00:01:40.369> for<00:01:41.000> me<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:41.539> way

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
so it's a lot slower for me this way

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.630 
so it's a lot slower for me this way
than<00:01:42.049> it<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.289> in<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.770> continental<00:01:43.280> method

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
than it is in the continental method

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.410 
than it is in the continental method
that's<00:01:43.909> why<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.119> don't<00:01:44.560> really<00:01:45.880> knit<00:01:46.880> using<00:01:47.329> the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
that's why I don't really knit using the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.050 
that's why I don't really knit using the
English<00:01:47.750> method<00:01:48.110> very<00:01:48.320> often<00:01:48.880> but<00:01:49.880> it's

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
English method very often but it's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.870 
English method very often but it's
always<00:01:50.329> good<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.600> know<00:01:51.310> how<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.369> do<00:01:52.640> things

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
always good to know how to do things

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.020 
always good to know how to do things
more<00:01:53.270> than<00:01:53.329> one<00:01:53.659> way<00:01:56.979> but<00:01:57.979> it's<00:01:58.250> not<00:01:58.310> hard<00:01:58.729> just

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
more than one way but it's not hard just

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:33.320 
more than one way but it's not hard just
a<00:01:59.509> little<00:01:59.750> bit<00:01:59.869> different

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.100 

and<00:02:33.870> that's<00:02:34.110> it

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
and that's it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.440 
and that's it
you<00:02:36.740> can<00:02:36.920> see<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:37.250> get<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.490> same<00:02:37.700> results<00:02:38.270> as

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
you can see you get the same results as

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.120 
you can see you get the same results as
you<00:02:38.630> do<00:02:38.810> with<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.230> continental<00:02:39.740> method<00:02:40.040> of

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
you do with the continental method of

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.070 
you do with the continental method of
knitting<00:02:40.460> it's<00:02:41.030> just<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.450> different<00:02:41.780> way<00:02:41.960> to

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
knitting it's just a different way to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.590 
knitting it's just a different way to
get<00:02:42.350> there
