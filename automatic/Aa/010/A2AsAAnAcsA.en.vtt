00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:19.910 

yes<00:00:02.179> Judea

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.680 

this<00:00:20.920> is<00:00:21.070> one<00:00:21.220> of<00:00:21.250> those<00:00:21.490> classic<00:00:21.730> games<00:00:22.360> I

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:22.690 
this is one of those classic games I

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.840 
this is one of those classic games I
think<00:00:22.750> it<00:00:23.289> was<00:00:23.490> great

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
think it was great

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.179 
think it was great
two<00:00:25.390> great<00:00:25.600> games<00:00:25.869> playing<00:00:26.410> hard<00:00:26.680> waterfall

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
two great games playing hard waterfall

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.519 
two great games playing hard waterfall
from<00:00:27.580> the<00:00:27.670> beginning<00:00:28.000> to<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.240> end<00:00:28.270> is<00:00:29.170> a<00:00:29.230> great

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
from the beginning to the end is a great

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.480 
from the beginning to the end is a great
game<00:00:29.710> to<00:00:29.860> watch

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
game to watch

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.990 
game to watch
I<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:31.689> it's<00:00:31.930> not<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.169> greatest<00:00:32.500> game<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:32.920> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
I think it's not a greatest game to a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.520 
I think it's not a greatest game to a
coach<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:35.110> it's<00:00:35.350> a<00:00:35.410> gradient<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.920> watch<00:00:37.530> both

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
coach but it's a gradient to watch both

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.820 
coach but it's a gradient to watch both
these<00:00:38.710> were<00:00:38.949> ready<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.640> play<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:41.140> offenses<00:00:41.710> of

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
these were ready to play the offenses of

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.900 
these were ready to play the offenses of
both<00:00:42.010> these<00:00:42.160> were<00:00:42.340> excellent<00:00:42.640> in<00:00:42.820> the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
both these were excellent in the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.840 
both these were excellent in the
beginning<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:44.350> toward<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.710> end<00:00:44.800> both<00:00:45.640> these

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
beginning then toward the end both these

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.530 
beginning then toward the end both these
play<00:00:46.090> better<00:00:46.420> defense<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:48.190> at<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.239> end<00:00:49.269> I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
play better defense but at the end I

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.799 
play better defense but at the end I
think<00:00:49.600> he<00:00:50.320> really<00:00:51.280> wanted<00:00:51.549> it<00:00:51.699> more<00:00:52.089> I<00:00:52.330> think

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
think he really wanted it more I think

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.399 
think he really wanted it more I think
