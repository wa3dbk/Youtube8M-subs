00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.849
 Hey guys 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.710
 that is a very clear 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.330
 We can see jobs 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.900
 Not missing, they start a bit 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.660

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.680

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.869
 I just cut it that way 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.970
 And of course I have the pumpkin before 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.560
 I also washed the crown 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.090
 removed and I wanted you again 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.550
 to point out that they are on 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.350
 your fingers pay attention because you can 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.110
 very weakly cut because of the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.370
 Oberliga is a bit tough is exactly 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.290
 if she should not get ahead 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.239
 just tear one apart 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.940
 then you take a spoon and wrap 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.760
 the trip tips explained that he through 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.129
 made quickly and we then set 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.320
 on the smooth side so we put it in 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.500
 fine stripes cut here once in the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.500
 rapidly scrolling 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.240
 I forgot the little towns 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.720
 down there 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.030
 we just cut them off and that 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.000
 So we fill it again and again 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.510
 also comes to the top now I want 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.790
 just a neck so 0 5 liters of water 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.640
 on about everything really now 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.980
 implemented and mix the whole with 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.620
 vegetable stock I added about two 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.510
 offender led to even if it is a 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.150
 but I poured a little bit 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.550
 do that more often I have a feeling 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.180
 mix it all up and just give it 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.180
 even more 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.229
 right now we are putting our part in this way 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.170
 to 20 minutes that's usually enough 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.360
 and do so meanwhile that the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.250
 Potato finished I got earlier 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.700
 always before some potatoes hang this 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.060
 but disgusting people they are still good 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.599
 nicely done and a little one 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.209
 Household energy was the shell on the 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.310
 strength side with the wet side can 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.190
 your stainless steel surfaces very well 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.040
 So clean the potatoes had 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.200
 we will now roll the dice and give them 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.040
 We will be with the body as well 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.370
 are still one with accident 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.030
 best time of 15 minutes and the wait 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.290
 we just leave 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.540
 I have that a bit 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.459
 accelerated as you can see is here 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.190
 already finished everything after 15 minutes sees 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.040
 that's about as hokkaido 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.370
 actually always done pretty quickly 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.820
 is so nice and good 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.160
 Okay now end this to the side and mix 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.120
 that with our start mixa I leave 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.980
 I like a few more 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.230
 Freedom tastes that tastes so full 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.180
 was not super delicious then we take 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.970
 our coconut milk and mix the 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.670
 Once again, please sit down 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.320
 Cover must firmly take care of that and 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.450
 then we go the whole 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.190
 Do not add cobus and mix it all up 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.220
 again I would go back to the 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.080
 want to put heart because a kiss with 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.250
 you can not do that well 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.870
 fast abdominal pain 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:26.860

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.850
 salt and pepper the whole thing 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.040
 little and tastes all from it 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:38.920
 It really tastes of the fit I got 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.420
 no fear of exactly the whole thing 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.890
