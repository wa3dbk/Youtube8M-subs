well<00:00:18.690> for<00:00:18.960> some<00:00:19.109> reason<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.650> steps<00:00:20.250> appear<00:00:20.580> to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
well for some reason the steps appear to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.800 
well for some reason the steps appear to
be<00:00:20.730> roped<00:00:20.939> off<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.359> I'm<00:00:21.420> going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.570> go<00:00:21.689> around

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
cool so here's an interesting phenomenon

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.020 
cool so here's an interesting phenomenon

this<00:00:45.780> row<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.969> wonder<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.620> well

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
this row I wonder what that's about well

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.959 
this row I wonder what that's about well
the<00:00:49.739> answer<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:50.280> are<00:00:50.309> these<00:00:50.730> rooms

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the answer is these are these rooms

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.510 
the answer is these are these rooms
along<00:00:51.210> along<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.230> lawn<00:00:52.530> which<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
along along the lawn which is this is

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.360 
along along the lawn which is this is
the<00:00:53.670> lawn<00:00:54.050> facing<00:00:55.050> half<00:00:55.199> there<00:00:55.620> are<00:00:55.770> 48<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the lawn facing half there are 48 of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.279 
the lawn facing half there are 48 of
these<00:00:56.489> rooms<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.690> therefore<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
these rooms and therefore the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.029 
these rooms and therefore the
fourth-year<00:00:58.649> students<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.660> guess<00:01:01.039> having

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
fourth-year students and I guess having

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.100 
fourth-year students and I guess having
a<00:01:02.129> barbecue<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.180> porch<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> pretty

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
a barbecue on your porch is a pretty

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.289 
a barbecue on your porch is a pretty
good<00:01:04.260> idea<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.189> great<00:01:05.309> idea<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.670> fact<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
good idea it's a great idea in fact and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.700 
good idea it's a great idea in fact and
honestly<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> college<00:01:07.530> campus

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
honestly what is a college campus

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.440 
honestly what is a college campus
without<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.189> long<00:01:08.460> game<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.909> Frisbee<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.630> on

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
without a long game of Frisbee going on

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.750 
without a long game of Frisbee going on

and the Cabell which is an auditorium
thing<00:01:36.960> down<00:01:37.110> there<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.040> let's<00:01:38.280> see<00:01:38.460> what<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.579> can

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
thing down there so let's see what I can

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
thing down there so let's see what I can
actually<00:01:39.119> see<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.290> take<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
actually see I'm just going to take a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.620 
actually see I'm just going to take a
wild<00:01:40.680> guess<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.040> that's<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.090> chapel<00:01:42.600> of

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
wild guess that that's the chapel of

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.719 
wild guess that that's the chapel of
there<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.950> library<00:01:44.310> time<00:01:44.490> complex<00:01:45.360> should<00:01:45.540> be

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
there so library time complex should be

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.249 
there so library time complex should be
somewhere<00:01:47.729> over<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.060> way<00:01:48.270> wow<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:49.140> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
