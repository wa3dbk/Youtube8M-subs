00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.420
 hello hunters welcome to the channel 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.610
 barbie licÃ­a because today we bring you a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.130
 analysis of armor and this time 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.370
 because it has touched the armor of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.760
 spin flavor 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:30.680
 and well, this armor is weird 5 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.910
 has a basic defense per piece of 54 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:37.400
 which makes a total of 270 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.030
 and well, the maximum of armor that 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.180
 you can get per piece they would be 110 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.590
 if we get 210 per piece then 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.460
 we could have a total of 550 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.620
 as we always do this look this 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.630
 sub goes forward and backward from 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.420
 up to down and down up so that 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.530
 you can see in detail how is the 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.690
 armor of certain 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.290
 and once this is done we will move on to 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:10.340
 elementary resistances well then this 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:15.170
 armor has minus 20 at fire 15 a 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.370
 water minus 25 to turn 15 to ice and 0 to 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.160
 dragon 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.800
 once seen the resistances 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.970
 elementary as always we will move to 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.530
 take a look at the skills 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.840
 the first one is carnivore allows to consume 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.140
 raw meat and increases the effectiveness of 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.020
 meat objects the second is attack 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.670
 ice plus one affects the power of 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.850
 ice attacks and shots 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.410
 freezers and the third is the negative 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.770
 hunger that affects the speed of 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.350
 maximum resistance expenditure we are going to 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.510
 see now the table distributed by 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.090
 points that he gives to each one of the 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.560
 pieces and here the order changes a bit 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:05.450
 because the first one would be ice attack + 1 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:08.119
 the second would be carnivore and the third 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.100
 active would be the negative hunger but 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.709
 we have two more that are not active 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.410
 that give us six dots each and that 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.360
 it would be the first destroyer that increases 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.810
 the ability to injure body parts 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.540
 of the monsters and the second one would be 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.440
 consume affects the speed of 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.490
 consumption of meat and other objects 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.340
 well seen already the skills we are going to 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.550
 give way as always to the part of the 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 piece by piece 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.670
 we start with the first of the pieces 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.910
 that is the helmet the helmet we see that it has 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.430
 a slot and you know how it works 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.430
 this we are going through the little screens 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.230
 get to this one here that tell us how 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.180
 it has good points that it gives us 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.690
 each of the skills that we 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.000
 grant this part of the armor 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.640
 there is a slot for the helmet and 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 we go to the second piece which is the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.550
 Chest the chest also gives us a slot 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.740
 and well we went the little screens 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.380
 get to the distribution of the 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.140
 points that they give us in the skills and 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.160
 you already know that in the lower part of the 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.890
 screen 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.300
 we put them translated in order of 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.300
 appearance from top to bottom 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:32.340
 let's move on to the third piece that are 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.700
 gloves and gloves have two 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.700
 Slots 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.650
 and what we have said is going to happen 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.260
 pantallitas then that of the description 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.900
 active skills and 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.129
 skills and their points that this 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.129
 piece in concrete 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.720
 completed the gloves let's move on to 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.860
 the fourth piece that is the belt and the 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.840
 belt also gives us two slots 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.490
 I also remember that in the piece 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.620
 piece on the bottom of the 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.180
 screen we also put the points 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.920
 that they give us in each of the 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.920
 elementary resistors 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.920
 these are the skill points 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.920
 which gives us the belt 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.730
 and let's move now to the last of the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.920
 pieces that would be the pants and in 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.190
 this case this piece also gives us a 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.190
 groove 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.360
 this time all the pieces have 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.120
 given some slot and well let's go 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.510
 passing the little screens of the latter 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.720
 piece until we reach the points that we 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.380
 They give for the skills and I'm leaving 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.540
 saying goodbye to you, I hope that you 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.110
 have liked this analysis of the 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.740
 shark zawahiri armor 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.680
 ice of monster hunter 4 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.780
 and with this last exterior look that 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.270
 we're going to make the armor and 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.910
 only hunters I want to wish 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.979
 as it is customary that you have 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.370
 good houses and you know we're leaving 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:15.240
 watching in upcoming videos so up 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.240
 then hunters
