00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:19.770
 flop hit me later are people this 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.689
 week I could not read as much as 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.550
 I wish I could not follow my 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.260
 air tv then i ended up getting a lot of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 other books that were not in my 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.650
 list of books I wanted in the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.199
 moratorium and it was all a big mess 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.120
 but I'm reading wonderful books and 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.110
 It's them I 'm going to start with. 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.950
 red fury but people were worth it 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.620
 every day I lost in this book for 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.510

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.129

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.300
 You talking everything I liked everything. 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.949

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.020
 book but I can already say that 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.760

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.920
 red fury that is like a 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.830
 floral games on Mars only that much more 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.290

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.790
 curses and no love triangle that the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.470
 People are from Brazil, it 's very cool. 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.330
 Review about it I have to show 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.610

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.759
 part of the week I left all this book 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.710
 that's just another Saturday for reading 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.650
 and I ended up getting a way for myself and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.869
 It was Dona Monica's lesson if you ever read it. 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.970
 Class Monica's ties this one are 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.070
 same actors as the local stage win 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.810
 so I'll bring myself some time 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.700
 some references to sounds 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.409
 more lessons is also so great 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.329
 how much society there is my favorite 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.939
 Because it touched me so much, it made me cry. 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.500
 more lessons, it's very very cool this 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.630

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.310

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.229
 end up pointing out a situation in the school 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.570

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.690
 start all of them stay punished and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.660
 was punished for a week and in this 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.070
 in the week we see a development 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.540
 individual within the personality of 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.400
 each of these characters 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.320
 The text of this story here is very 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.540
 very sensitive very beautiful teaches 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.490
 really many lessons for us and if 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.260
 You just as I grew up reading class 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.420
 I'm sure you will. 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.250
 I love this painting here and how 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.110
 reading that went very quickly in the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.360
 I did not take the two worlds and the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.520
 jones suite yes thats the first 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.230
 iesc book published here in brazil and 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.360
 It's the first one I remember from her, I already 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.920
 I spent it I think it 's 60% I think 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.480
 I have 70 percent more or less 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.280
 so I can not talk much about it 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.590
 because I'm not finished yet 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.570
 but what I can tell you is that I am 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.160
 loving writing in this woman folks 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.590
 this book, which intersperses 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.090
 two native narrative of the protagonist 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.890
 which is made of homs where it goes 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.540
 counting on all the problems of the day 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.070
 a day of it and everything and all 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.600
 situations that are happening and 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.220
 same time every once in a while you have some 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.350
 native characters that are of other characters 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.150
 are passengers of airplanes that are 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.190
 passing in the sky and each is kind of 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.990
 a personal account and these reports of the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.510
 passengers to a certain extent relate 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.160
 with the history of the jonas city I already 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.260
 I'm sure I 'll want to read more 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.000
 heskey books because her writing 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.190
 at the same time it is a very 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.050
 powerful and very funny writing 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.730
 so there are several laughs over 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.650
 this book and I will not talk more seriously 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.270

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.330
