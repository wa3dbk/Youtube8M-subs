00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.320
 mercury and argos is one of the few 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.620
 but wonderful works he paints 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.590
 Vel치zquez in the 1650s and one of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.960
 the last of his life 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.210
 it is easy to imagine that such a format 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.830
 elongated and narrow would condition the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.650
 composition and would limit 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.200
 possibilities of the painter maybe that's why 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.620
 the balance of the 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.980
 hardly surmountable scene 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.450
 they have other mythological paintings 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.460
 Vel치zquez conceives the work in a way 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.670
 peculiar with an air of reality 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.410
 everyday and great naturalness results 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.270
 interesting to compare this box with the 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.420
 version about the same episode painted 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.370
 by rubens in the latter is represented 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.710
 the most dramatic moment in history 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.770
 when mercury stands and with the sword 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.880
 in high will kill argos is a scene 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.150
 energetic very baroque on the other hand 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.670
 Vel치zquez and Silent Mercury Advance 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.690
 towards argos almost kidnapping and with stealth 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.180
 so as not to wake him up 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.920
 The painter also takes into account the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.050
 place of destination of the box at the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.040
 apply the technique then to be on 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.210
 windows was going to look backlit 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.900
 I had previously used a 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.420
 technical sketched but this time 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.180
 arrives at unthinkable daring limits 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.520
 in a 17th century painter 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.190
 it's incredibly free there's no 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.530
 definition everything is suggested with touches 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.450
 of master brush applied in the 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.550
 exact site and in the right way 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.710
 to get the effect you are looking for 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.870
 the space where the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.570
 mercury and argos has singular 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.190
 importance for other aspects the 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.590
 redecoration of the hall of mirrors 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.040
 I was being coordinated by my own 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.070
 Vel치zquez there they were going to hang paintings 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.050
 of rubens de tiziano was an ideal setting 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.050
 to measure yourself with the great masters
