00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.900
 we take a round brush and this 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.720
 color that is like brick and we're going to 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.720
 put in the sunken area of ​​the eye 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.650
 remember to go slow and leave a good 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.950
 area below the eyebrow then we're going 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.550

 a brush if it gives thin to make a 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.830
 little more precise and we will try to 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.840
 do this only at the end of the eye 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:02.330
 with a round brush and that is not 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.330
