00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello, people, I am presenting a 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.450
 extracting the second part of the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.069
 history of the pendulum clock I forgot 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.870
 mention that in each part I will 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.259
 retake the last of the previous chapter 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.940
 but without further warning we continue 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.980
 open your eyes was lying on the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.170
 bed everything was normal I listened to the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.510
 tick tock of that the red clock as if 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.640
 nothing had happened to me reassure 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.310
 I assumed that everything had been just one 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.859
 nightmare I went back to bed and I fell asleep 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.590
 again when I again heard the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.210
 tick tock of that red clock until 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.100
 in a moment it stopped and I went back to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.980
 listen to the voice you said you have a 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.350
 I woke up a little bit scared 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.360
 what I had dreamed I turned on the lights and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.969
 if the red clock and the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.940
 pendulum had stopped but it was 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.890
 marking 2 hours and the number 1 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.840
 it was no longer in its place it was just a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.390
 reddish and intense stain like the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 color of the watch I thought it was a stain 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.320
 made with accident and that's why the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.300
 hidden with the number 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.640
 I went to the clock to see what it was 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.320
 what had happened to him and he was looking for 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.030
 I floor the number 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.670
 look around the clock and without 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.500
 find him 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.229
 on the ground to see below said 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.060
 clock but could not see anything in 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.700
 that I was looking for I heard that the clock 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.310
 again he was doing his tic but it sounded 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.170
 that was hitting something I thought that 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.690
 was crashing with what was obstructing him 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.420
 when looking for a couple of drops 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.970
 in my head when I turned up to see 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.860
 it was I jumped back and fell when I saw 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.810
 that the crystal that covered the pendulum 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.670
 it was open with a head inside 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.189
 as if his body was on the other 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.259
 side of the watch that made guillotine and 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.880
 every time the pendulum went one way 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.950
 the other one hit him in the throat 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.649
 causing more and more blood to come out 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.869
 I went to the clock and tried to stop it 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.060
 grabbing the vehicle but at the moment 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.520
 in that I grab it burn my hands which 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.310
 made him release it since the pendulum 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.319
 silver was red hot but not what 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.070
 I noticed since I thought it was the reflection of 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.020
 the wood in the metal 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.090
 the marks of burns in my 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.640
 hands intimidate me when trying to stop 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.440
 the pendulum again but I was forced 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.690
 to stop it since after burning 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.020
 I saw the face of the person who was 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.450
 being decapitated and my mother was equal 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.310
 that my father with his eyes closed but 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.650
 despite the cuts I received 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.600
 He made a noise of complaint to see that 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.150
 she was the person who was about 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.520
 of dying I made another attempt to stop the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.620
 pendulum to try to stop it but 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.990
 to avoid getting burned and I put on my shirt 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.570
 in my hands I grabbed the pendulum to 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.520
 try to stop him but he could not 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.010
 seeing it was so strong that for more 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.989
 trying to stop him could not move 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.180
 in a moment the shirt that I had in my 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.010
 hands lit up in flames and I started to 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.380
 burn my hands but despite the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.120
 fire in my hands my euphoria and 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.670
 despair towards you will ignore the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.130
 pain to try to stop the vehicle 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.050
 but my efforts were in vain 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.910
 see that my mother's head fell to 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.990
 floor and rolled leaving a trail of blood 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.610
 where did he go 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.370
 I released the pendulum and took off my shirt 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.410
 that was on fire from my hands and there 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.320
 I noticed the severe burns in all the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.300
 hand but despite the ardor I walked 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.730
 the head of my mother that remained mouth 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.030
 up when I was one step away from the 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.890
 head started to burn in flames there 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.050
 it was the moment when I could see that it opened 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.900
 eyes and let out the loudest cry that 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.330
 I had never heard of the scare I went 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.000
 back until it touched the wall I 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.860
 I sat leaning against the wall and grabbed 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.260
 legs and I closed my eyes to not see 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.600
 that image but I could follow 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.430
 listening to the scream that one until 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.100
 I heard the blow marked the time of 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.560
 clock again everything went dark 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.930
 open my eyes and I was again in 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.630
 flames as if nothing had happened 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.120
 I gave my hands that were normal without 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.740
 the burns that I felt I heard the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.380
 direct watch 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.200
 now if I could not get to sleep for 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.150
 avoid another nightmare but still awake 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.280
 I had heard that the clock had 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.410
 stopped by the voice coming back to me 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.690
 I said you have an hour now I did not go to 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.240
 see what he had gone through the 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.310
 fear of what might happen but now 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.770
 I heard how some kind of 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.080
 liquid I thought it had not closed well 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.239
 the kitchen water faucets taking 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.550
 that as a pretext to no longer be in 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.530
 that room so I turned on the 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.420
 lights to put on my sandals and to 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.790
 turn on the lights my surprise and I 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.590
 I expected the room was 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.320
 filling with water that came out of that 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.960
 red clock that now marked all three and 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.940
 numbers one and two were no longer there but 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.800
 instead they were a reddish spot and 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.650
 intense as the color of the watch 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.170
 red the water had approximately 30 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.720
 centimeters deep but that's not 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.180
 was what scared me the most was in between 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.250
 from my room I could see a person with 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.710
 arms crossed like a dead man in his 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.390
 coffin but even more scared gave me to see 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.970
 that it was my grandfather that person who 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.860
 I was in the background I got up to go to him 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.860
 but the water burned like an acid 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.050
 it burned me to the contact outlet water and 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.180
 I saw the body of my grandfather was beginning 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.669
 to undo by the acidic water doing 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.500
 that started to bleed and the water started 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.210
 to take a reddish hue that 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.099
 allowed to see everything that was 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.139
 immersed in it to see that picture 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.419
 dantesco call to flight in the middle of that 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.550
 book always completely removed you 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.620
 did risk my body is to get it out of 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.569
 my bed I jumped to the center of the room where 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.639
 There was my grandfather and my legs 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:26.620
 contact and enter in such a way that 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.719
 they circled and I almost fell to my knees 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.150
 but when you see the water try to fall from 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:34.000
 knees walk where my grandfather was 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.770
 I submerged my hands to the reddish figure and 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.349
 I picked up my grandfather and put him in my 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.509
 arms and I walked towards my table 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.879
 since the acid that came out of that clock 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.009
 my bed had been sunk, I put my 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.139
 grandfather at the table I also climbed 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:49.180
 the same to get out of acid water my 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.250
 impression was inside scream for the pain 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.990
 of my legs and the see that 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.360
 they were practically in the bones 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.699
 turn to see my grandfather who was worse 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.680
 that my legs could see organs 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.200
 beating and his whole face was made a 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.270
 skeleton tries to grab his face 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.580
 the hands when at that time the table 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.290
 where we were the acid was given 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.300
 devastated the legs and could not stand 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.160
 our step we fell my grandfather and I of 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.170
 filled with acidic water and I went into the 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.120
 eyes which made them open to the point 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.250
 to lose sight and with me will continue 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.170
 I walked where I could but I stumbled 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.910
 with the body of my grandfather who was 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.280
 down mine what so I went back to 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.990
 sinking into the acidic water touched everything 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.300
 my body when I managed to stop I could 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.550
 listen to a tick tock but it was not 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.680
 watch when I followed the noise I discovered that 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.570
 it came from me and by touching my chest 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.520
 I noticed that it was my heartbeat that 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.260
 he was exposed with the bones of 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.660
 my ribs in lime conditions 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:43.000
 eaten I let out a scream when I felt this 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.800
 but the moment I fell into the liquid and 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.080
 that my legs had been so lime 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.850
 meals that did not support my weight and 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.770
 they broke up and again I immersed myself in 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.840
 that water and when I could lift the 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.930
 head out of the acid liquid only 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.940
 I heard the gift of the clock 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.770
 agitated I got up again I was in 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.520
 bed my body and my eyes were 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.069
 normal as if nothing had happened 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.289
 good people here ends this part of 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.240
 the story I will not be doing this 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.979
 way two numbers per part to have 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.840
 more control of the project that I want 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.879
 perform but now what will happen to 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.220
 our protagonist what atrocious things 

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:18.080
 will happen to family members and who 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.180
 are those who follow these and other 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.610
 questions or I can answer them 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.889
 because I do not write anymore but keep 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.020
 tuning this channel next time 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:29.919
 to see what surprises prepares us 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.919
 pendulum clock
