00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.620
 Well what kind of content was this matter 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.770
 When the Masu navy 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.820
 Hey you 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.019
 Oh dear 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:16.880
 In the flow of the story, Yokoyama Green 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.370
 People are standing I really lecturer 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.860
 Against the green of the arrow 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:27.520
 Ne 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:31.570
 If there is such a program, and there is such a program, I received an invitation to go out 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.870
 I Yappa because you mon are indebted to that person 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:41.469
 As Yokoyama Midori came out on the broadcast 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:44.040
 If you go to the broadcast and then go to the broadcast in a very away situation 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:52.860
 I was told that it was Maam 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:54.740
 I and I say to that I was allowed to sleep the worse Away state is and Tsuyoshi Yoshida 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.390
 a way 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:06.690
 It seems that the green of the side is telling that it was mc 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:11.729
 From a flow of even ne me clearly to get it Nen'ne Australia's says talk Yoshida still 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:16.170
 Well, for example, I don't know that at all, but Ushidako is a human being like Yokoyama Green 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:20.380
 Not to say so I should know also it has been also informed that come 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.979
 Suddenly, it was a part of it and it was part of it that was among them 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:28.630
 When it comes to how people come in 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:33.220
 Well then if you 're from that person maybe you 've put on a mask somewhere 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:37.640
 If you become a celebrity via internet delivery then you did something interesting 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:42.740
 There is nothing but an image of what I say 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.830
 It is kind of remarks against Yokohama green interesting something Please refer to the interesting something 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.409
 Say that please talk 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:56.320
 It seems that I paid such a word 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:02:01.570
 On the other hand, if you say what Midori Yokoyama said or I'm not a comedian 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:05.190
 I always say Nante it interesting that because only amateur of you wants to know such a funny thing 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:11.910
 It would and said Son'namuja bra Shissu I Ja Ne I thing 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:15.750
 Well then feather I mean Tsuyoshi Yoshino against it that I not it stand to this ne professional field 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.390
 It is not the case that it is summarized by such remarks 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:25.950
 I Well, this I'm really legitimate I'm say 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:27.010
 So originally if Yokoyama Midori was the moment I heard that statement but I'm back home 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.769
 When 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:38.349
 But Tteyuu I'm the saw broadcast to endure because I want to make the face of the person who is introduced to the 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:43.420
 I gotta I did you say it to the end in the not say every time mess complain When was it 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:47.000
 Let Arise any belly's Sommer 's should piercing trying to do it but 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.350
 I could not have been asked for myself 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.070
 Would not mean I'm for example do comedy and horticultural facts but would be what, but to the place that you do not match 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.750
 Come on 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:59.910
 You can refuse to be invited, for example, it's a completely different genre. 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.090
 For example Well there is a draw-based practice to fit Nechotto 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:08.100
 Exactly the network if Midori Yokoyama 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:12.480
 It's not a situation that hasn't been involved before, so it's Away for yourself 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:17.100
 And invited the Ranger such things always can be much that there taste photo 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.710
 Required is I at home Kedomo was invited to is can not die nothing to speak it away place to say so 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.830
 And I think that it can not also be interesting to not be 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.010
 But that's why I received it 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.090
 Thank you for bringing me a baby or ridge like this 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.239
 But it's village ne events 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:37.480
 Hey, I wasn't there at first 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:39.100
 Did you feel that you were going to leave some track record for the event ? 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:44.590
 I think I participated 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:49.150
 If it makes you to look at the people of the people 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:53.110
 I'm was to do me what was said if there since the building whether it was the introduction to Date 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.920
 Because not that we laugh lawmakers not say so When was I that what I described can not be funny 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.310
 'S nice to 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.280
 If you said to me doing interesting things it was said Nette not interesting in doing full his seminal 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:04.319
 It will study such as to seem 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.430
 So I I'm I think that was good is not out of the first I if I do not I can it 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.020
 Good Tashi was 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:14.069
 What Once was I say it has been found only or the last I So When was I went out to the people of 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.610
 You should be patient if you are told that there is only contradiction when you can not do it anymore 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:20.620
 It is 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:26.170
 The original or I is not you or I think did not return because there is a reason I face of the person to think so 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:28.370
 I him eventually from Tsubushiru but that in're talking like a formulate person who has his own introduction 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.419
 'S not passed Nan'nimo 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:37.280
 Yourself you were going to make cancer I will have to say what is to be put up 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.600
 It the person is that his When was I could not be standing on the other side of the arena I say it 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.000
 'S should reflect on the bad 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:48.360
 It is not an amateur or a professional who does not understand the meaning of thinking that it is an amateur. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.960
 It is Teru NiÃ±o it much Nyokuaruto 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.830
 Have it read by you a 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:59.040
 If you can not do it, think that your ability is not enough, so it is better to reflect 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:04.800
 I understand the meaning of cutting there 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:08.230
 So I feel that the contradiction there is a great introduction of the person's face is crushed Yane Yokoyama green 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.969
 Such an impressive thing that nobody gets 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:16.309
 Hey real battle problem seat 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:21.889
 I got a channel on Nico Nico Live Broadcasting, I got a channel only for myself 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:23.899
 I'm doing paid broadcasts , I think that the radiator chair is covering the spring and it 's interesting and money 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:29.009
 It will mean that broke the money paid 

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:33.110
 Money isn't it either, isn't it Markspro that I will deliver and do? 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:37.100
 Aoiso I can't say it's different I can't say I'm an amateur 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:40.020
 On the other But ze Internet's it I do not know the meaning of their own I layman as possible refers to yoga 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:45.180
 It 's better when you get it for delivery 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:49.680
 It certainly Kirapasu me say in, for example, it is I that interesting I think you said it Kirapasu 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:54.270
 Oh what's that interesting thing is, but 8 ej for myself 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:59.169
 It was said that it wasn't interesting that I slipped grain 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:02.189
 I say that I will gather and study again , then I wonder if the green of Yokoyama was beaten 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.189
 I can not beat you 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:12.220
 Well, if you have a problem with how to hate and sway while listening and guiding at the gate 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:17.020
 Even if you don't have video in mind 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:20.729
 Because there is a problem in how to pretend Ruano Nante problem to no'll pretend how is 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:24.059
 Hey you can't reverse anything 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:28.289
 I wonder if there is no excuse for the problem or that we went out 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:30.150
 So not a good If the ball lands in will do anything to do it Ja was good do it anything Sukedo
