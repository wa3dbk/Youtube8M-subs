00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.119
 small measure center stock 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.479

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.599
 Cherkasov meters 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.880
 what feared 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.960
 but it's easier for us to be there 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.470
 o got up like that 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.419
 but b answers being edge 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:27.649
 Bogdan Butko 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.279
 I do not know why change the whistle 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.109
 so bridge there 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.880
 and there 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.600
 that's how we can't imagine 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.830
 how much time I spent on mining 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.120
 call 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.890
 table plans 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.890
 Cupriks to the sides 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.260
 and together typing better put all 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.020
 what is the composition of the year 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.700
 then probably still return Alexey them 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.790
 holt 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.790
 flock 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.160
 but 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.110
 I understand that I came 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.229
 it was an attempt to make a home 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.229
 that's simple 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.210
 on sunday the other day topic 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.360
 although your item 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.890
 that it was only the trustee of this 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.200
 year accompanied 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 simply 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.480
 knock knock knock knock 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.480
 so for example of course about 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.400
 jesters and quotations 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.840
 like rub 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 and there are none 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.970
 ovechkin 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.960
 sheep stallion yes 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.960
 bathe 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.939
 then the prime minister wanted to do it through 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.130
 him 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.159
 but he looked review in china english 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.500
 counters 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 I have a mistake 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.889
 what god what with it was here we only 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:15.889
 if any in this 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.540
 the only question is this is nonsense 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.329
 that children are near the entrance 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:26.249
 for mother 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.249
 just endlessly pigs and ran 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.129
 Well, let Putin 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.929
 so if of course the door 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.749
 go 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.749
 this is my pride just 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:43.339
 in the beds everything is here 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.959
 he danced chikunova them books cake 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.339
 computer 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:51.619
 movement does not work electricity does not 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:53.009
 failed 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.189
 here 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.189
 mother is so simple 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.889
 here frs it took me six months 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.329
 tolerant of flowers and lay 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.329
 it seems that only 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.360
 typical square almost everything 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.479
 but 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.039
 minimum amount of time 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.829
 spent 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.120
 here so as in a network bears and a computer 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.779
 also computer 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:26.119
 here is a certificate but no matter how rushing it 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.389
 why do zombies appear 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.409
 the hosts abandoned 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.859
 and your house 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.859
 g there year glowing screens 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.309
 now substances 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.659
 site about the fact that that shines 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:42.650
 then 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.650
 which burns including 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.709
 and then you still got to go 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.079
 farther 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.079
 here the construction of shopping center TCs remain 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:55.669
 so is it 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.399
 from the beginning there was an observation post 

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:58.559
 then it 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:59.769
 spilled out 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.419
 I mean, school is absolutely safe with 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:03.659
 English 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.069
 lamps 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.019
 so in death 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.019
 here it was here 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.019
 everything here was just afraid of spiders 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.019
 so there you can climb this link 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.209
 also I know I tried 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:25.999
 we are here too yes 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:29.139
 already at least 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.879
 so the point of rest 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.879
 no, that's why mini beautiful house 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.800
 just because the same term danger 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.930
 early ideally stood 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.930
 tractor tractor 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.759
 here 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.969
 a button 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:52.969
 earlier 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.360
 so in the pillar is built 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.719
 actually so 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.789
 okay water is in there 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.819
 this is not a joke 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.039
 but since then this one has not been adopted 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.300
 a chain of gas Karaev just
