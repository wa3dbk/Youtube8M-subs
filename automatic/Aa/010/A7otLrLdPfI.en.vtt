the same thing applies to reboots one of

the same thing applies to reboots one of
the<00:00:48.250> other<00:00:48.370> levels<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.850> second<00:00:49.239> level<00:00:49.420> is<00:00:49.600> the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
the other levels the second level is the

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.810 
the other levels the second level is the

now<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.670> reason<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.090> you<00:00:55.239> learn<00:00:55.449> this<00:00:55.690> one

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
now the reason that you learn this one

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.439 
now the reason that you learn this one
second<00:00:56.320> ball<00:00:56.530> is<00:00:57.010> simply<00:00:57.400> because<00:00:57.730> it<00:00:58.239> gives

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
second ball is simply because it gives

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.000 
second ball is simply because it gives
you<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.629> degree<00:00:58.840> of<00:01:00.480> extension<00:01:01.480> and<00:01:01.570> stability

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you a degree of extension and stability

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.350 
you a degree of extension and stability
beyond<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.220> which

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
beyond that which

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.060 
beyond that which
very<00:01:05.810> easy

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
very easy

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.660 
very easy
have<00:01:08.060> bad<00:01:08.300> stains<00:01:08.860> still<00:01:09.860> be<00:01:10.040> feeling<00:01:10.250> fell

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
have bad stains still be feeling fell

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.400 
have bad stains still be feeling fell
as<00:01:12.120> soon<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.480> pick<00:01:12.660> up<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.930> poem<00:01:13.200> you've

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
as soon as you pick up the poem you've

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.980 
as soon as you pick up the poem you've
got<00:01:13.590> bad<00:01:13.800> spoons<00:01:14.370> we<00:01:14.910> find<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.870> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
got bad spoons we find it can to the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.200 
got bad spoons we find it can to the
motion<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.190> it's<00:01:17.340> very<00:01:17.460> important<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.120> the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
motion so it's very important with the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.410 
motion so it's very important with the
power<00:01:18.450> form<00:01:21.890> to<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.280> extension<00:01:24.180> that

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
power form to have that extension that

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.090 
power form to have that extension that
balance<00:01:24.840> where<00:01:25.320> you're<00:01:25.500> extending<00:01:25.860> your

balance where you're extending your

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.960 
balance where you're extending your
energy<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:26.760> beyond

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:57.210 

this<00:01:41.960> relates<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.649> element

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.110 

and<00:01:57.670> fire<00:01:58.390> this<00:01:59.080> one's<00:01:59.320> too<00:01:59.740> -<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.280> lot<00:02:00.880> more

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
and fire this one's too - a lot more

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:15.540 
and fire this one's too - a lot more
strength

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.040 

this<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.820> teacher<00:02:17.090> viability<00:02:17.720> and

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
this is the teacher viability and

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.430 
this is the teacher viability and
flexibility<00:02:19.720> just<00:02:20.720> goes<00:02:20.870> through<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.200> form

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
flexibility just goes through the form

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.250 
flexibility just goes through the form
now<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:23.180> I'll<00:02:23.300> do<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.480> slowly

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
now and I'll do it slowly

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.260 
now and I'll do it slowly
