00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.540
 hi what are these girls how are they good 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.090
 I tell them to stop by the store where 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.949
 I buy my products to make the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.260
 crafts and I loved that with this 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.000
 I said I loved this form of 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.830
 heart and I wrapped him with these 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.600
 wires to make it for a pendant 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.250
 but in the howling but what else 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.489
 loved this is the combination that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.890
 has these colors between sky blue and 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.680
 green then I decided to take it to my 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.380
 nails as you see here I made this design and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.600
 well I will show you how I did it is 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.510
 very easy I hope you like it and that you 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.129
 inspire if they have any object that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.960
 love the color too and can 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.270
 bring your nails I want to give you the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.649
 thanks for the subscriptions and I want 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.539
 thank you for your comments 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.579
 also good to have a nice day 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.879
 see you until next time take care 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.879
 bye 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.090
 first of all we are going to select a 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.130
 nail shine that we have already old or 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.920
 that we do not want to use more 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.950
 to be able to do the mixing effect 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.990
 the two column tones the color of the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.000
 background is this 296 color level we expect 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.390
 let it dry, give it two layers of 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.630
 this color and then with the green tone 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.720
 This rythm 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.770
 what is the 230 shades like pearl 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.110
 that I liked for the design effect 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.170
 we put a generous layer in a room 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.570
 of the unit an activist layer for 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.000
 power with the brightness then that does not 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.920
 we want 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.590
 let's do as a sweeping effect 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.210
 inward from the nail but without reaching 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.180
 to the birth of water 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.260
 until you see that both the two unions of 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.260
 colors makes sun 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.970
 for the little boats I'm using this 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.970
 copper color of the 932 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.480
 they only take a couple of droplets and 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.849
 If you do not have the tool to do 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.040
 the little dots did not matter burst the 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:58.590
 posterity and salts but if you do not have it 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.590
 can cost a stick with cloths 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.860
 and mosques are made by not being 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.860
 matter make up the rooms 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.720
 i 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.900
 and 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.900
 ah 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.160

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.420
