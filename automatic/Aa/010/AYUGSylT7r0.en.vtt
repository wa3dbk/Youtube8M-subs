roots and begin to blow-dry it now the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.259 
roots and begin to blow-dry it now the
reason<00:02:47.040> why<00:02:47.130> you're<00:02:47.310> able<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.640> use<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.060> cool

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
reason why you're able to use the cool

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.449 
reason why you're able to use the cool
air<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.660> because<00:02:49.080> your<00:02:49.290> hair<00:02:49.500> isn't<00:02:49.800> as<00:02:50.190> wet

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
air is because your hair isn't as wet

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.699 
air is because your hair isn't as wet
it's<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:51.120> damp<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:52.170> means<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.560> we

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
it's just damp so that means that we

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.100 
it's just damp so that means that we
don't<00:02:52.860> need<00:02:53.040> all<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.340> hot<00:02:53.850> air<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.540> evaporate

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
don't need all that hot air to evaporate

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.680 
don't need all that hot air to evaporate
the<00:02:55.260> water<00:02:55.290> off<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.739> strands<00:02:56.330> now<00:02:57.330> grab<00:02:57.660> that
