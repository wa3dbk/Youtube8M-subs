00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
little careful as I mentioned the first

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:14.709 
little careful as I mentioned the first
part<00:00:13.580> is<00:00:13.639> kind<00:00:13.789> of<00:00:13.850> in<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.030> open<00:00:14.330> so<00:00:14.539> they<00:00:14.629> have

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
part is kind of in the open so they have

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.499 
part is kind of in the open so they have
to<00:00:14.920> figure<00:00:15.920> out<00:00:16.040> how<00:00:16.129> to<00:00:16.189> engage<00:00:16.880> that<00:00:17.270> enemy

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:17.509 
to figure out how to engage that enemy

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:19.510 
to figure out how to engage that enemy
without<00:00:17.599> just<00:00:18.020> being<00:00:18.080> easy<00:00:18.680> target<00:00:19.130> so

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
without just being easy target so

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.260 
without just being easy target so
they're<00:00:19.640> kind<00:00:19.730> of<00:00:19.849> working<00:00:20.090> their<00:00:20.180> way<00:00:20.210> over

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
get you'll get mobbed pretty bad but

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:34.959 
get you'll get mobbed pretty bad but
they<00:00:34.219> as<00:00:34.399> long<00:00:34.520> as<00:00:34.579> they<00:00:34.700> work<00:00:34.820> together

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
they as long as they work together

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:36.310 
they as long as they work together
they'll<00:00:35.360> be<00:00:35.450> they'll<00:00:35.630> be<00:00:35.750> just<00:00:35.899> fine<00:00:35.960> now<00:00:36.200> on

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
this map there's another new secondary

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.150 
this map there's another new secondary
objective<00:00:38.629> this<00:00:38.750> one<00:00:38.899> is<00:00:38.960> timed<00:00:39.200> as<00:00:39.350> well<00:00:39.530> it

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
objective this one is timed as well it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.800 
objective this one is timed as well it
says<00:00:40.340> destroy<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.820> fuel<00:00:41.210> shipments<00:00:41.510> and

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
they've got three minutes to do it

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.980 
they've got three minutes to do it

minutes<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.170> objective<00:00:51.560> is<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:51.710> go<00:00:51.800> blow<00:00:52.010> up

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
minutes the objective is to go blow up

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.069 
minutes the objective is to go blow up
the<00:00:52.520> fuel<00:00:53.120> tanks<00:00:53.360> on<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.570> train<00:00:53.810> before<00:00:53.930> it

the fuel tanks on the train before it

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.130 
the fuel tanks on the train before it
gets<00:00:54.230> out<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.410> there<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:55.870> because<00:00:56.870> it's<00:00:57.020> so

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
gets out of there and because it's so

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.690 
gets out of there and because it's so
far<00:00:57.350> back<00:00:57.530> in<00:00:57.560> the<00:00:57.739> map<00:00:57.950> is<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.250> situation

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
far back in the map is the situation

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.920 
far back in the map is the situation
where<00:00:58.790> you<00:00:58.880> kind<00:00:59.060> of<00:00:59.120> want<00:00:59.270> one<00:00:59.329> of<00:00:59.420> those<00:00:59.570> fast

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
where you kind of want one of those fast

get<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.100> objective<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.610> get<00:01:04.729> out<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:04.970> there

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
get that objective and get out of there

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.330 
get that objective and get out of there
ideally<00:01:05.509> without<00:01:05.600> getting<00:01:05.960> shot<00:01:05.990> nice<00:01:06.649> this

an<00:01:08.720> afd<00:01:08.899> with<00:01:09.229> them<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.040> they're<00:01:10.189> gonna<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.430> a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
an afd with them so they're gonna have a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.770 
an afd with them so they're gonna have a
little<00:01:10.640> tougher<00:01:10.880> time<00:01:11.090> all<00:01:11.240> these<00:01:11.390> vehicles<00:01:11.600> a

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
little tougher time all these vehicles a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.149 
little tougher time all these vehicles a
little<00:01:11.960> bit<00:01:12.049> larger<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:12.409> slower<00:01:12.649> not

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
little bit larger and slower not

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:14.800 
little bit larger and slower not
necessarily<00:01:13.609> suited<00:01:14.060> for<00:01:14.240> making<00:01:14.509> kind<00:01:14.719> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.169 
necessarily suited for making kind of
that<00:01:14.929> that<00:01:15.889> spy<00:01:16.189> run<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.579> the<00:01:16.670> back<00:01:16.850> there<00:01:17.090> to

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
that that spy run to the back there to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.959 
that that spy run to the back there to
take<00:01:17.329> those<00:01:17.479> out<00:01:17.659> but<00:01:18.380> see<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:19.219> can<00:01:19.399> imagine

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
take those out but see you can imagine

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:28.170 
take those out but see you can imagine
pull<00:01:20.329> that<00:01:20.450> off

different shells are going to have

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.780 
different shells are going to have
different<00:02:08.810> mechanics<00:02:09.410> we<00:02:09.950> do<00:02:10.070> simulate<00:02:10.550> kind

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
different mechanics we do simulate kind

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.670 
different mechanics we do simulate kind
of<00:02:10.850> what<00:02:11.000> these<00:02:11.120> shells<00:02:11.390> do<00:02:11.660> real<00:02:12.440> work

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
of what these shells do real work

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.979 
of what these shells do real work
how<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.950> interactive<00:02:13.549> an<00:02:13.670> armor<00:02:13.939> so<00:02:14.599> there's

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
how the interactive an armor so there's

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.660 
how the interactive an armor so there's
some<00:02:15.140> some<00:02:15.439> pros<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.890> cons<00:02:16.099> of<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.400> different

some some pros and cons of the different
choices<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:16.969> have<00:02:17.000> available<00:02:17.329> this<00:02:17.689> tank<00:02:17.870> is

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
choices you have available this tank is

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.179 
choices you have available this tank is
actual<00:02:18.140> about<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.349> fire<00:02:18.530> an<00:02:18.650> anti-tank<00:02:19.040> guided

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
actual about to fire an anti-tank guided

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.280 
actual about to fire an anti-tank guided
missile<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.629> thing<00:02:20.930> is<00:02:21.049> you<00:02:21.170> can

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
missile and the thing is you can

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.690 
missile and the thing is you can
actually<00:02:21.319> guide<00:02:21.739> that<00:02:21.950> missile<00:02:22.250> he<00:02:22.340> tried<00:02:22.579> to

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
actually guide that missile he tried to

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.860 
actually guide that missile he tried to
hook<00:02:22.849> it<00:02:22.939> around<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.209> corner<00:02:23.540> there<00:02:23.689> and<00:02:23.780> get

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
hook it around the corner there and get

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.089 
hook it around the corner there and get
that<00:02:23.900> vehicle<00:02:24.140> but<00:02:24.379> was<00:02:24.469> backing<00:02:24.769> up<00:02:24.829> I<00:02:24.950> don't

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
that vehicle but was backing up I don't

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.349 
that vehicle but was backing up I don't
think<00:02:25.250> he<00:02:25.340> actually<00:02:25.549> managed<00:02:25.879> to<00:02:25.909> pull<00:02:26.090> it<00:02:26.120> off

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
think he actually managed to pull it off

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.720 
think he actually managed to pull it off
but<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:27.500> have<00:02:27.620> seen<00:02:27.799> some<00:02:27.980> pretty<00:02:28.129> crazy<00:02:28.370> trick

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
shots possible with those guided

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.550 
shots possible with those guided
missiles<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.099> and<00:02:31.689> then<00:02:32.689> and<00:02:33.049> then<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.319> he

looks like most lots are for like
repairing<00:02:43.680> potential<00:02:44.340> yeah<00:02:44.549> so<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.909> the<00:02:45.000> other

this the horsepower of his engine he's
also<00:02:56.519> got<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> repair<00:02:57.090> kit<00:02:57.299> he's<00:02:57.540> got<00:02:57.719> a<00:02:57.750> fire

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
also got a repair kit he's got a fire

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.449 
also got a repair kit he's got a fire
scene<00:02:58.260> where<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.590> vehicles<00:02:58.920> can<00:02:59.069> be<00:02:59.099> set<00:02:59.430> on

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
a lot of Cambay that makes sense yes

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.089 
a lot of Cambay that makes sense yes
that<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.870> what<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.170> fire<00:03:10.379> extinguisher<00:03:10.530> will<00:03:11.010> be

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
first aid kit there to try and get him

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.750 
first aid kit there to try and get him
back<00:03:19.139> on<00:03:19.290> your<00:03:19.409> feet<00:03:19.590> get<00:03:20.430> on<00:03:20.519> through<00:03:20.609> the

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
back on your feet get on through the

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.940 
back on your feet get on through the
match<00:03:23.959> so<00:03:24.959> they<00:03:25.200> didn't<00:03:25.409> manage<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.650> get<00:03:25.829> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
match so they didn't manage to get the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.220 
match so they didn't manage to get the
secondary<00:03:26.340> objective<00:03:26.730> either<00:03:26.900> not<00:03:27.900> batting<00:03:28.200> a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
secondary objective either not batting a

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.809 
secondary objective either not batting a
thousand<00:03:28.650> here<00:03:28.799> on<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.159> optional<00:03:29.700> objectives

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
thousand here on the optional objectives

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.149 
thousand here on the optional objectives
but<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:31.319> what<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.590> would<00:03:31.680> have<00:03:31.709> happened<00:03:31.859> is

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
but so what it would have happened is

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.379 
but so what it would have happened is
that<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.519> train<00:03:32.730> actually<00:03:33.030> pulled<00:03:33.209> out<00:03:33.359> of

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
that the train actually pulled out of

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.849 
that the train actually pulled out of
the<00:03:33.510> station<00:03:33.540> at<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.290> time<00:03:34.560> limit

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
the station at the time limit

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.039 
the station at the time limit
opportunity<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.639> take<00:03:35.849> it<00:03:35.969> out<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.629> pretty

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
opportunity to take it out is pretty

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.470 
opportunity to take it out is pretty
much<00:03:37.109> gone<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.379> background<00:03:38.090> if<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.239> have<00:03:39.329> it

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
much gone a background if you have it

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.360 
much gone a background if you have it
take<00:03:39.689> all<00:03:40.169> the<00:03:40.439> fuel<00:03:40.620> shipments<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:41.159> whole

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
take all the fuel shipments the whole

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.460 
take all the fuel shipments the whole
enemy<00:03:42.120> armies<00:03:42.450> just<00:03:42.629> completely<00:03:42.930> fueled<00:03:43.290> up

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
enemy armies just completely fueled up

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.309 
enemy armies just completely fueled up
yeah<00:03:43.829> it's<00:03:44.099> like<00:03:44.190> way<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.489> go<00:03:44.549> guys<00:03:45.139> that's<00:03:46.139> so

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
their final objective here is pretty

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.229 
their final objective here is pretty
much<00:03:55.979> to<00:03:56.159> clear<00:03:56.400> up<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.699> rest<00:03:56.909> of<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.209> the

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
much to clear up the rest of the the

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.330 
much to clear up the rest of the the
vehicles<00:03:57.780> inside<00:03:58.049> the<00:03:58.169> refinery<00:03:58.620> there's<00:03:59.250> a

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
vehicles inside the refinery there's a

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.250 
vehicles inside the refinery there's a
capture<00:03:59.879> circle<00:04:00.060> in<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.359> center<00:04:00.510> they<00:04:01.019> get<00:04:01.169> on

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
capture circle in the center they get on

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.429 
capture circle in the center they get on
that<00:04:01.379> hold<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:01.889> for<00:04:02.310> about<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.549> minute<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.439> as

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
that hold it for about a minute and as

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.839 
that hold it for about a minute and as
long<00:04:04.650> as<00:04:04.739> they<00:04:04.799> don't<00:04:04.889> take<00:04:05.099> any<00:04:05.250> damage<00:04:05.370> at

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
long as they don't take any damage at

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.399 
long as they don't take any damage at
Walter<00:04:06.329> for<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.599> duration<00:04:06.750> then<00:04:07.229> they'll

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
Walter for that duration then they'll

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.509 
Walter for that duration then they'll
have<00:04:07.560> succeed<00:04:07.889> in<00:04:07.979> the<00:04:08.040> mission<00:04:08.250> obviously

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
have succeed in the mission obviously

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.280 
have succeed in the mission obviously
the<00:04:08.579> easy<00:04:08.759> way<00:04:08.939> to<00:04:09.000> pull<00:04:09.209> that<00:04:09.299> off<00:04:09.359> ideal<00:04:10.169> way

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
the easy way to pull that off ideal way

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.420 
the easy way to pull that off ideal way
to<00:04:10.319> pull<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.620> off<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.889> to<00:04:10.979> take<00:04:11.099> out<00:04:11.250> all<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
to pull that off is to take out all the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.059 
to pull that off is to take out all the
vehicles<00:04:12.470> sometimes<00:04:13.470> players<00:04:13.650> figure<00:04:13.979> out

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
vehicles sometimes players figure out

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.289 
vehicles sometimes players figure out
some<00:04:14.189> other<00:04:14.280> tricks<00:04:14.489> for<00:04:14.759> finishing<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.180> even

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
some other tricks for finishing and even

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.490 
some other tricks for finishing and even
without<00:04:15.479> destroying<00:04:16.019> all<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.229> enemy

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
without destroying all the enemy

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.589 
without destroying all the enemy
vehicles<00:04:16.889> and<00:04:17.130> they<00:04:17.789> still<00:04:18.239> being<00:04:18.389> able<00:04:18.509> to

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
vehicles and they still being able to

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.819 
vehicles and they still being able to
take<00:04:18.720> that<00:04:18.810> capture<00:04:19.229> point<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:19.620> there<00:04:19.739> are

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
take that capture point so there are

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.129 
take that capture point so there are
some<00:04:19.949> different<00:04:20.220> on<00:04:20.280> occasion

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
some different on occasion

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.770 
some different on occasion
that's<00:04:21.469> awesome<00:04:21.919> that's<00:04:22.039> a<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:22.969> like<00:04:23.659> the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
that's awesome that's a I like the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.469 
that's awesome that's a I like the
concept<00:04:24.199> of<00:04:24.439> this<00:04:24.830> this<00:04:25.159> map<00:04:25.430> it's<00:04:25.729> like<00:04:25.939> you

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
concept of this this map it's like you

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.820 
concept of this this map it's like you
know<00:04:26.599> mixes<00:04:27.050> up<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.199> game<00:04:27.409> a<00:04:27.439> little<00:04:27.560> bit<00:04:27.680> this

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
know mixes up the game a little bit this

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.320 
know mixes up the game a little bit this
is<00:04:27.889> really<00:04:28.159> stealthy<00:04:28.759> it<00:04:28.849> seems<00:04:29.060> like<00:04:29.210> you're

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
is really stealthy it seems like you're

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.869 
is really stealthy it seems like you're
kind<00:04:29.360> of<00:04:29.569> like<00:04:29.719> hiding<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.889> walls<00:04:31.159> and<00:04:31.699> kind

00:04:31.869 --> 00:04:31.879
