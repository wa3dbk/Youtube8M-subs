00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
I've never played that one but I've

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.860 
I've never played that one but I've
always<00:00:42.219> been<00:00:42.460> curious<00:00:42.730> about<00:00:43.059> this<00:00:43.269> game<00:00:43.540> so

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870

always been curious about this game so
let's<00:00:44.079> see<00:00:44.230> how<00:00:44.379> it<00:00:44.530> turned<00:00:44.739> out<00:00:44.860> this<00:00:45.550> is<00:00:45.760> of

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
let's see how it turned out this is of

let's see how it turned out this is of
course<00:00:46.089> a<00:00:46.390> racer<00:00:46.809> where<00:00:47.110> you<00:00:47.199> race<00:00:47.409> on<00:00:47.589> lakes

and<00:00:48.129> other<00:00:48.220> bodies<00:00:48.579> of<00:00:48.610> water<00:00:48.760> using<00:00:49.390> jet<00:00:49.570> skis

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
and other bodies of water using jet skis

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.869 
and other bodies of water using jet skis
in<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.530> beginning<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.129> game<00:00:51.280> forces<00:00:51.729> you<00:00:51.850> to

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
in the beginning the game forces you to

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.520 
in the beginning the game forces you to
play<00:00:52.089> the<00:00:52.269> exhibition<00:00:52.839> mode<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:53.229> you'll<00:00:53.379> get

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
play the exhibition mode so you'll get

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.899 
play the exhibition mode so you'll get
the<00:00:53.649> hang<00:00:53.829> of<00:00:53.920> how<00:00:54.070> to<00:00:54.129> control<00:00:54.370> your<00:00:54.670> jet<00:00:54.879> ski

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
the hang of how to control your jet ski

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.090 
the hang of how to control your jet ski
but<00:00:55.629> before<00:00:55.930> you<00:00:56.019> play<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.350> exhibition<00:00:56.890> mode

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100

I highly recommend you complete the

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.660 
I highly recommend you complete the
tutorial<00:00:59.229> first<00:00:59.500> because<00:01:00.070> you'll<00:01:00.220> struggle<00:01:00.399> a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
tutorial first because you'll struggle a

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.910 
tutorial first because you'll struggle a
lot<00:01:00.850> less<00:01:01.149> with<00:01:01.449> it<00:01:01.629> you<00:01:02.140> get<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.440> choose<00:01:02.679> from

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
lot less with it you get to choose from

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.410 
lot less with it you get to choose from
eight<00:01:03.070> different<00:01:03.219> racers<00:01:03.760> each<00:01:04.000> with<00:01:04.300> their

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
eight different racers each with their

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.359 
eight different racers each with their
own<00:01:04.479> different<00:01:04.989> stats<00:01:05.229> such<00:01:05.649> as<00:01:05.830> top<00:01:06.039> speed

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
own different stats such as top speed

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.760 
own different stats such as top speed
acceleration<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:07.390> handling<00:01:07.420> for<00:01:08.350> beginners

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
acceleration and handling for beginners

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.169 
acceleration and handling for beginners
it's<00:01:09.039> probably<00:01:09.429> best<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.820> start<00:01:10.030> with<00:01:10.149> a

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
it's probably best to start with a

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:11.700 
it's probably best to start with a
character<00:01:10.420> who<00:01:10.810> has<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.960> lot<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.229> handling

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
character who has a lot of handling

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.830 
character who has a lot of handling
skill<00:01:12.039> rather<00:01:12.280> than<00:01:12.580> top<00:01:12.759> speed<00:01:13.149> I've<00:01:13.630> been

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
skill rather than top speed I've been

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.419 
skill rather than top speed I've been
playing<00:01:14.050> this<00:01:14.200> game<00:01:14.380> for<00:01:14.440> a<00:01:14.679> while<00:01:14.740> now<00:01:15.130> up

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:15.429 
playing this game for a while now up

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.160 
playing this game for a while now up
until<00:01:15.759> this<00:01:15.850> review<00:01:16.300> and<00:01:16.539> I<00:01:16.690> still<00:01:16.990> have

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
until this review and I still have

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.419 
until this review and I still have
trouble<00:01:17.320> with<00:01:17.619> any<00:01:17.770> character<00:01:18.100> who's

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
trouble with any character who's

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.700 
trouble with any character who's
handling<00:01:18.880> skill<00:01:19.179> is<00:01:19.360> low<00:01:19.600> this<00:01:20.200> is<00:01:20.350> because

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
handling skill is low this is because

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.410 
handling skill is low this is because
the<00:01:20.890> physics<00:01:21.250> of<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.490> game<00:01:21.520> environment<00:01:22.240> are

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
the physics of the game environment are

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.389 
the physics of the game environment are
very<00:01:22.450> realistic<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.740> point<00:01:23.979> that<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.250> has

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
very realistic to the point that it has

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.370 
very realistic to the point that it has
a<00:01:24.429> very<00:01:24.729> low<00:01:24.909> tolerance<00:01:25.149> to<00:01:25.600> any<00:01:25.780> mistakes<00:01:26.200> you

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
a very low tolerance to any mistakes you

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.230 
a very low tolerance to any mistakes you
might<00:01:26.500> make<00:01:26.560> this<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.399> bittersweet

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
might make this is bittersweet

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.760 
might make this is bittersweet
bitter<00:01:28.509> because<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.140> game<00:01:29.350> has<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.590> pretty

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
bitter because the game has a pretty

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.859 
bitter because the game has a pretty
high<00:01:30.039> learning<00:01:30.399> curve<00:01:30.610> but<00:01:31.060> sweet<00:01:31.390> because<00:01:31.750> of

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
high learning curve but sweet because of

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.929 
high learning curve but sweet because of
the<00:01:31.960> fact<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.259> it's<00:01:32.500> very<00:01:32.679> realistic<00:01:33.130> the

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
the fact that it's very realistic the

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.090 
the fact that it's very realistic the
game<00:01:34.149> is<00:01:34.329> fun<00:01:34.600> don't<00:01:34.899> get<00:01:35.049> me<00:01:35.229> wrong<00:01:35.439> but<00:01:35.770> man

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
game is fun don't get me wrong but man

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.980 
game is fun don't get me wrong but man
it<00:01:36.340> can<00:01:36.490> be<00:01:36.610> pretty<00:01:36.909> difficult<00:01:37.180> you'll

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
it can be pretty difficult you'll

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.569 
it can be pretty difficult you'll
definitely<00:01:38.500> need<00:01:38.619> a<00:01:38.680> lot<00:01:38.890> of<00:01:38.950> patience<00:01:39.490> and

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
definitely need a lot of patience and

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.639 
definitely need a lot of patience and
practice<00:01:40.000> if<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.240> want<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.540> win<00:01:40.720> races<00:01:40.869> there

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
instead change up the weather like

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.920 
instead change up the weather like
putting<00:03:26.190> in<00:03:26.340> fog<00:03:26.610> or<00:03:26.880> severely<00:03:27.330> increasing

can get really fun multiplayer is fun
and<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.169> addition<00:05:07.559> of<00:05:07.650> tricks<00:05:07.919> and<00:05:08.129> stunts<00:05:08.370> is

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
and the addition of tricks and stunts is

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.489 
and the addition of tricks and stunts is
a<00:05:08.639> very<00:05:08.939> cool<00:05:09.150> feature<00:05:09.389> however<00:05:10.199> the

00:05:10.489 --> 00:05:10.499 
a very cool feature however the

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:12.409 
a very cool feature however the
difficulty<00:05:11.039> is<00:05:11.159> really<00:05:11.490> high<00:05:11.699> even<00:05:12.210> on<00:05:12.300> the

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
difficulty is really high even on the

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.659 
difficulty is really high even on the
easiest<00:05:12.749> setting<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.589> controls<00:05:14.069> even<00:05:14.550> though

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
easiest setting the controls even though

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.760 
easiest setting the controls even though
our<00:05:14.699> precise<00:05:15.180> are<00:05:15.509> pretty<00:05:15.749> demanding<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.499> the

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
our precise are pretty demanding and the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.320 
our precise are pretty demanding and the
amount<00:05:17.039> of<00:05:17.189> different<00:05:17.370> levels<00:05:17.849> is<00:05:17.999> kind<00:05:18.240> of

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
amount of different levels is kind of

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.390 
amount of different levels is kind of
low<00:05:18.539> which<00:05:18.779> is<00:05:18.930> disappointing<00:05:19.409> overall

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
low which is disappointing overall

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.100 
low which is disappointing overall
though<00:05:20.610> it's<00:05:20.879> still<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.150> fun<00:05:21.389> game<00:05:21.449> once<00:05:21.990> you've

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
though it's still a fun game once you've

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.989 
though it's still a fun game once you've
gotten<00:05:22.289> used<00:05:22.529> to<00:05:22.620> it<00:05:22.830> it's<00:05:23.279> definitely<00:05:23.550> not<00:05:23.939> a

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:23.999 
gotten used to it it's definitely not a

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:25.850 
gotten used to it it's definitely not a
pushover<00:05:24.479> of<00:05:24.749> a<00:05:24.839> game<00:05:25.050> but<00:05:25.379> if<00:05:25.499> you<00:05:25.589> have<00:05:25.740> the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
pushover of a game but if you have the

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.379 
pushover of a game but if you have the
patience<00:05:26.249> for<00:05:26.339> it<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:26.789> think<00:05:27.120> you'll<00:05:27.270> be
