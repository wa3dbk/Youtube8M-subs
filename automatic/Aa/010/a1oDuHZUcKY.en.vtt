00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello how about here I am again I am 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.240
 david of your support online.es and I'm going to 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.000
 explain how to print from any 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.570
 part of the world 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.960
 either from the mobile or the internet with your 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.919
 home printer 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.919
 and print from any 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.950
 from your house 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.950
 it's a big breakthrough 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.250
 this is done with google chrome 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.210
 With which 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.210
 you just have to go 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.399
 the advanced configuration option 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.580
 and you give him to enable the connector 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.580
 google print 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.839
 this window will come out 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.390
 and then here he says he controls your 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.390
 printers 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.260
 then here you have the option of 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.260
 add your personal printer 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.810
 and now we have to go back to the page 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.810
 Of configuration 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.200
 advanced and we'll see what that is 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.490
 added a new tab that is 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.490
 manage configuration 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.869
 in a new window think that you have 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.020
 to be blocked with your user 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.020
 of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.030
 from gmail or from 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.570
 of Google 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.970
 and when this window is ready 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:52.190
 here you can see in printer 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.190
 and printers you have in the system 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.070
 a 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.640
 delete 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.640
 name 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.590
 as it is already enabled since the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.310
 we have 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.170
 then if you are in a foreign house or in 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.110
 somewhere else 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.760
 you only have to connect to this 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.310
 page 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.500
 print 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.500
 tell black fire to print 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.200
 a file 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.490
 then we will print it 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.010
 what you have printed will come out here 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.200
 a list 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.550
 everything you have printed 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.450
 now there are some new printers that 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.280
 they wear a logo called print 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.200
 sprint reading 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.100
 and then what they do is that they already have 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.080
 an integrated controller 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.180
 to connect to the Google cloud 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.990
 the main brands already have it as 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.990
 hp and epson 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.300
 and now how can we print from your 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.380
 mobile 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.280
 for example from android 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.200
 simply 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.560
 we have to go to google drive or google 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.430
 docs 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.540
 From the phone 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.950
 previously installed clear and then 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.170
 we just go to the option of 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.160
 load 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.209
 load the document to see it when 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.760
 you have opened in the mobile simply 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.010
 press the options button 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.840
 and you will have two options and one is to open 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.880
 web mode 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.310
 open web mode 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.470
 and next to the name of the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.230
 document will leave some little arrows 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.300
 up click there you will get the option 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.200
 print when you want to print it 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:56.610
 download another window where you can 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:01.050
 choose the printer and print put you 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:04.700
 if you want to print from gmail then 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.700
 It would be necessary to download 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.760
 from google play called cloud of 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.189

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.700
 in which you have all the options and 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:17.810
 also automatically when you charge 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.130

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.160
 and you open it 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:27.310
 is to give to see no preview 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:32.280
 and you give him to see then it will come out 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.280
 an option where I tell you to print with 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.780
 the application or print with another
