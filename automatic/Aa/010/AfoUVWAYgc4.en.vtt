00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.720
 in 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.510
 1 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.260

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:39.650
 cento crisis without solution 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.600
 so that's it panic if you 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.070

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.440
 your strength and the trick left you 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.480
 throw on your opponent and that 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.010
 decreases his defense and so that makes your 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:10.540
 ultimate attacks beaten in one go and 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.440
 so we win 8000 rio in a match 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.450
 now i 'm going to show you my 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.230
 technique to me who is a little bit more 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.650
 long but we earn 11000 rio ​​and after 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.060
 I will show you the last hour 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.560

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.560
 he makes 2000 win 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.650
 but that's how it is when you make a 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.650
 champion filling 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.520

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:54.840
 second at level 3 orange 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.870
 so there he died and in addition is dead 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.129
 he left the field 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.599
 so that's why you came 11 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:07.040
 may therefore I showed showering here 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:10.530
 so as I still had but without pv 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.340
 22000 rio ​​times like I did that all 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:18.120
 seconds his fake did 440 trioc 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:24.120
 bonus us as I used as I 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.320
 used a hymn goal three minutes under 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.229
 a secret technique 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.880
 it makes me 105 rio as embarrassed the first 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.470
 coup and account on all the futures 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.550
 plans for that they reign 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.110
 it makes me to Rio 5200 and made May 2 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.900
 times 5 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.169
 seeing that I 'm interested that makes me play the 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.900
 role so that's so it was wrong 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.370
 mixed erm naruto technique and now 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.330
 I showed you the last technique 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.330
 and I found 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.860
 but for that you have to change 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:59.529
 character 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.110

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:03.969
 said a friend of his sight that has a 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.469
 other technique yet and this makes 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:09.550
 earn 60 million a year ago but the eu 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.899
 who told him but I'm not sure that 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.369
 it's true that they will show the video 

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:15.610
 just now and I 'll see it's true 

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:20.289
 This is true of video modes Video 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.459

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.789
 nobody adds take it 

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.789

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.400
 and this team is super fast 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:56.210
 to the right answer but in fact I was 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.330
 not sure on this map that it was ok 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.560
 operate but there is another one 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.440
