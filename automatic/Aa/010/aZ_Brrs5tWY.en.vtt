00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
poop or throw up for my entire life like

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580

I<00:01:38.520> never<00:01:38.850> stopped<00:01:39.299> or<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.900> whenever<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
I never stopped or just whenever it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.450 
I never stopped or just whenever it
happens<00:01:41.070> because<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:42.470> throw<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.829> lot<00:01:44.130> less

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
happens because I throw up a lot less

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.859 
happens because I throw up a lot less
than<00:01:44.490> i<00:01:44.759> Coupe<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:46.610> guess<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.329> throw<00:01:48.570> up

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
than i Coupe so I guess I would throw up

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.249 
than i Coupe so I guess I would throw up
the<00:01:49.170> bowls<00:01:50.000> Pete<00:01:51.000> would<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.420> rather<00:01:51.600> surf<00:01:52.049> or

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the bowls Pete would you rather surf or

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.069 
the bowls Pete would you rather surf or
go<00:01:52.560> scuba<00:01:53.040> diving<00:01:53.070> well<00:01:54.030> I've<00:01:54.390> never<00:01:54.750> done

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
go scuba diving well I've never done

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.999 
go scuba diving well I've never done
either<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.130> i<00:01:56.930> guess<00:01:57.930> i<00:01:58.079> would<00:01:58.140> say<00:01:58.290> scuba

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
either so i guess i would say scuba

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.490 
either so i guess i would say scuba
diving<00:01:59.460> because<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.329> seems<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.750> me<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.259> maybe

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
diving because it seems to me that maybe

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.090 
diving because it seems to me that maybe
servings<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.579> little<00:02:02.939> overrated<00:02:03.509> i<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.469> think

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
servings a little overrated i do think

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.800 
servings a little overrated i do think
it<00:02:05.250> would<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.460> pretty<00:02:05.670> cool<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.030> dive<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
it would be pretty cool to dive in the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
it would be pretty cool to dive in the
water<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> whole<00:02:08.129> entire

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
