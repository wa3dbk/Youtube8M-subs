Copic markers for mostly this drawing it
only<00:00:48.809> really<00:00:49.050> required<00:00:49.500> me<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.890> use<00:00:50.250> gray<00:00:50.550> tone

pens<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.440> was<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:53.039> different<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.149> of

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
pens so that was a different kind of

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.750 
pens so that was a different kind of
challenge<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.690> week<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.920> started<00:00:56.640> off

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
challenge this week so I started off

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.580 
challenge this week so I started off
adding<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> darker<00:00:57.629> gray<00:00:57.899> outlines<00:00:58.440> just

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
adding the darker gray outlines just

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.049 
adding the darker gray outlines just
sort<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.129> an<00:00:59.250> idea<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.579> where<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.879> lights

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
sort of get an idea of where the lights

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.340 
sort of get an idea of where the lights
going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.629> then<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.020> started<00:01:01.260> adding

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
going to be and then I started adding

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
highlights to add some extra texture to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.870 
highlights to add some extra texture to
the<00:01:04.619> drawing<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.489> topped<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> off

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the drawing and then I topped it off

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.149 
the drawing and then I topped it off
with<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.119> black<00:01:06.299> Copic<00:01:06.750> pen<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.380> add<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
with the black Copic pen to just add the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
with the black Copic pen to just add the
darkest<00:01:08.610> shading<00:01:08.880> around<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.600> top<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
darkest shading around the top of the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.039 
darkest shading around the top of the
head<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.369> kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.820> helps<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> at<00:01:12.659> like

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
head and it kind of helps to at like

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.280 
head and it kind of helps to at like
boost<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.130> depth<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> drawing<00:01:15.479> there's

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
boost the depth of the drawing there's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.270 
boost the depth of the drawing there's
one<00:01:16.409> part<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.740> drawing<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.130> really

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
one part of this drawing that really

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.920 
one part of this drawing that really
wasn't<00:01:17.430> sure<00:01:17.549> how<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> was<00:01:18.270> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.750> actually

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
wasn't sure how I was going to actually

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.440 
wasn't sure how I was going to actually
create<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.590> effects<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.310> wanted<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
create the effects that I wanted and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.820 
create the effects that I wanted and
that<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:24.000> gums<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.540> venom<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that was the the gums of venom the the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.649 
that was the the gums of venom the the
the<00:01:26.280> highlights<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> reflections<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the highlights and the reflections of

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.359 
the highlights and the reflections of
his<00:01:27.900> gums<00:01:28.140> I've<00:01:28.590> imagined<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.189> gonna<00:01:29.280> be

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
his gums I've imagined that was gonna be

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
his gums I've imagined that was gonna be
so<00:01:29.490> difficult<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.079> started<00:01:31.740> off

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
so difficult to do so I I started off

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.310 
so difficult to do so I I started off
with<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.220> cardinal<00:01:32.820> Copic<00:01:33.150> marker<00:01:33.509> leaving

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
with a cardinal Copic marker leaving

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.620 
with a cardinal Copic marker leaving
some<00:01:34.500> highlights<00:01:35.030> because<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.090> wanted<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.390> show

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
some highlights because I wanted to show

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.630 
some highlights because I wanted to show
the<00:01:36.750> reflections<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.369> wasn't<00:01:38.549> really

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the reflections and but I wasn't really

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.219 
the reflections and but I wasn't really
sure<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.939> was<00:01:39.030> working<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.390> well<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> started

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
sure it was working so well so I started

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.859 
sure it was working so well so I started
adding<00:01:40.380> some<00:01:40.740> grades<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.970> building<00:01:42.750> up

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
adding some grades and just building up

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.770 
adding some grades and just building up
layers<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.409> grey<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.970> then<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.149> went<00:01:45.329> back<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
layers of grey and then I went back and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
layers of grey and then I went back and
actually<00:01:45.899> added<00:01:46.409> highlights<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> uniball

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
actually added highlights with a uniball

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.600 
actually added highlights with a uniball
signo<00:01:47.610> broad<00:01:47.990> pigment<00:01:48.990> ink<00:01:49.140> white<00:01:49.380> pen<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.799> I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
signo broad pigment ink white pen and I

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.160 
signo broad pigment ink white pen and I
think<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.090> creates<00:01:51.299> an<00:01:51.509> effects<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.079> was

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
think this creates an effects that I was

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.039 
think this creates an effects that I was
actually<00:01:52.409> quite<00:01:52.590> pleased<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:52.920> because<00:01:54.049> it

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
actually quite pleased with because it

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.770 
actually quite pleased with because it
creates<00:01:55.409> an<00:01:55.740> almost<00:01:55.950> 3d<00:01:56.909> effects<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.600> you've

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
creates an almost 3d effects when you've

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.870 
creates an almost 3d effects when you've
got<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.710> highlights<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.310> gums<00:01:59.520> going

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
got the the highlights of the gums going

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.999 
got the the highlights of the gums going
around<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> mouth<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.600> I'm<00:02:01.409> actually<00:02:01.560> quite

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
around the mouth so I'm actually quite

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.920 
around the mouth so I'm actually quite
happy<00:02:02.070> with<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.540> teeth<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.840> is

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
happy with that for the teeth it is

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.440 
happy with that for the teeth it is
really<00:02:04.140> easy<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.920> had<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.159> add<00:02:05.310> some<00:02:05.670> gray

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
really easy I just had to add some gray

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.330 
really easy I just had to add some gray
Copic<00:02:06.930> markers<00:02:07.290> around<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.590> edges<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.190> I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
Copic markers around the edges and I

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.240 
Copic markers around the edges and I
left<00:02:08.489> some<00:02:08.580> highlights<00:02:09.379> and<00:02:10.379> added<00:02:11.129> some

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
left some highlights and added some

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.490 
left some highlights and added some
highlights<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.819> pen

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
highlights with a pen

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.950 
highlights with a pen
that's<00:02:13.280> basically<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.820> it<00:02:14.090> really<00:02:14.270> wasn't<00:02:14.510> too

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
that's basically it it really wasn't too

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.780 
that's basically it it really wasn't too
difficult<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.500> said<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.770> think<00:02:15.950> basically<00:02:16.760> I

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
difficult it said to think basically I

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.160 
difficult it said to think basically I
just<00:02:16.910> said<00:02:17.030> start<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.390> drawing<00:02:17.720> by<00:02:17.840> thinking

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
just said start the drawing by thinking

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.750 
just said start the drawing by thinking
about<00:02:18.350> where<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.800> light<00:02:18.950> source<00:02:19.220> was<00:02:19.490> and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
about where the light source was and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.970 
about where the light source was and
it's<00:02:20.630> basically<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:20.930> exactly<00:02:21.560> from<00:02:21.860> the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
it's basically just exactly from the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.890 
it's basically just exactly from the
front<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.430> once<00:02:22.940> you've<00:02:23.090> got<00:02:23.240> that<00:02:23.360> sorted<00:02:23.750> out

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
front so once you've got that sorted out

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.270 
front so once you've got that sorted out
you<00:02:24.110> can<00:02:24.380> really<00:02:24.650> start<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.040> think<00:02:25.130> about

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
you can really start to think about

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.560 
you can really start to think about
where<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.610> shadows<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.240> lighting

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
where the shadows and the lighting

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.420 
where the shadows and the lighting
should<00:02:26.720> be<00:02:26.810> going<00:02:27.050> throughout<00:02:27.980> this<00:02:28.220> drawing

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
should be going throughout this drawing

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.220 
should be going throughout this drawing
I<00:02:28.610> used<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:29.030> pen<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.480> create<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> highlights

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
I used this pen to create the highlights

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.200 
I used this pen to create the highlights
and<00:02:30.590> I'm<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.400> pleased<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.760> bought<00:02:31.910> this<00:02:32.000> pen

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
and I'm so pleased I bought this pen

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.880 
and I'm so pleased I bought this pen
because<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:32.630> just<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.960> helps<00:02:33.290> me<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:33.710> much

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
because it's just it helps me so much

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.670 
because it's just it helps me so much
add<00:02:34.160> depth<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.730> extra<00:02:35.420> detail<00:02:35.780> drawings

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
add depth and extra detail drawings

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.680 
add depth and extra detail drawings
having<00:02:37.250> highlights<00:02:37.640> can<00:02:37.880> really<00:02:38.180> help<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.540> add

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
having highlights can really help to add

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.100 
having highlights can really help to add
texture<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:40.190> makes<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:41.750> just<00:02:41.900> it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
texture and it makes it it just it

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.870 
texture and it makes it it just it
brings<00:02:42.290> an<00:02:42.560> extra<00:02:42.830> level<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.310> detail<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.850> a

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
brings an extra level of detail to a

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.730 
brings an extra level of detail to a
drawing<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.390> for<00:02:45.200> most<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.440> this<00:02:45.560> drawing

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
drawing and for most of this drawing

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.410 
drawing and for most of this drawing
it's<00:02:45.950> just<00:02:46.100> about<00:02:46.280> building<00:02:46.490> layers<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.209> gray

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
it's just about building layers of gray

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.710 
it's just about building layers of gray
tones<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.980> then<00:02:49.250> just<00:02:49.459> offsetting<00:02:50.420> them<00:02:50.540> with

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
tones and then just offsetting them with

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.110 
tones and then just offsetting them with
the<00:02:50.900> different<00:02:51.080> highlights<00:02:51.560> so<00:02:52.459> it<00:02:52.670> ended<00:02:53.000> up

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
the different highlights so it ended up

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.980 
the different highlights so it ended up
only<00:02:53.870> taking<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.230> two<00:02:54.470> hours<00:02:54.800> which<00:02:55.220> is

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
only taking the two hours which is

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.970 
only taking the two hours which is
definitely<00:02:56.990> an<00:02:57.050> improvement<00:02:57.230> from<00:02:57.620> my<00:02:57.770> work

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
definitely an improvement from my work

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.100 
definitely an improvement from my work
previously<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:58.940> that's<00:02:59.630> what<00:02:59.720> I'm<00:02:59.810> trying<00:03:00.020> to

previously and that's what I'm trying to

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.570 
previously and that's what I'm trying to
do<00:03:00.200> these<00:03:00.350> Copic<00:03:00.740> drawings<00:03:01.070> I'm<00:03:01.220> trying<00:03:01.430> to

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
do these Copic drawings I'm trying to

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.730 
do these Copic drawings I'm trying to
speed<00:03:02.150> up<00:03:02.270> my<00:03:02.390> workflow<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.110> actually<00:03:03.440> create
