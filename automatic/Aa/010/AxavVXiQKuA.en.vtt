00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.309
 I am fat schornagel 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.780
 I am a photojournalist and completely 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.719
 car crap 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.570
 and especially crazy about English cars 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.830
 years ago I was called by one 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 friend garage company 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.330
 Kroymans in Hilversum who were busy 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.910
 exchange silver with a rolls royce 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.859
 seraph and they add if I wanted 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.990
 to buy the Jews 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.340
 then I asked her answer well 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.080
 at your head i want him a little bigger 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.480
 becomes something with way too modern and way too 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.460
 expensive and I would like rolls royce 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.500
 then we have a very old one 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 yes but this is a very beautiful one and he is 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.829
 very cheap well then I am very 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.480
 curious 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.120
 drove to the living and then it turned out 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.680
 terribly beautiful car 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.289
 I think he will be rejected anyway 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.620
 because the belt broke this morning 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.910
 so i hope that do the service 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.910
 to assemble that brand but I think so 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.780
 you would expect at a stop of this 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.100
 caliber at this price don't know if 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.369
 it is completely wrong there is expectation 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.549
 that the quality is excellent it is on 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.600
 apart from the chassis , I do not have to date 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.070
 so much to criticize 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.009
 little things after the minister starts 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.409
 I thought he was a bit messy in 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.340
 felt really just running but that just 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.960
 standing still it was completely gone there 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.679
 yes that really doesn't let me 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.149
 really worry further yes it feels okay 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.259
 we will see it soon 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.929
 I dare not too much or it 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.569
 conclude but that is mainly because 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.069
 I think like most Dutch people 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.069
 few us horse experiences 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.680
 of course i don't have house all 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.689
 episodes from around the clock 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.460
 but I dare to claim too big 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.229
 that this is the first time that a rolls 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.679
 have royce in this section 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.490
 280,000 kilometers on the clock and yes we 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.490
 let's see how he is doing 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.180
 funny it is already well on the 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:21.630
 been tectylating vw ferocious too 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.980
 prevent back falls anyway 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.860
 nothing to criticize on the chassis 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.500
 actually run with full details too 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:37.470
 well is just a solid firm 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:40.640
 there you must allow under 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.640
 others in it 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.110
 it is mainly the connecting rods 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.450
 left for further 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.790
 falls responds but really well just 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.140
 also held at the bottom 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.140
 yes it really is nothing of all 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.650
 the tires this is clear that this 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.800
 worn out is only what stands out is that 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.150
 just the outside that the outside 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.430
 the tire is completely gone 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.030
 while the inside is actually still 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.200
 is fine 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.540
 it's just a defect in the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.560
 wheel suspension is by that will not 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.900
 more orally in the correct position 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.820
 probably something that made it too much 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.930
 toe rail has a cruel you the 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.930
 treated on the outside of you 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.650
 joep and roll they got something you 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.220
 more often see now no in rolls royce 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.299
 actually not this engine by chance 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.450
 because that is a BMW 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:58.200
 yes this is a bmw v12 something dated 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.239
 but 100% bmw hey and the state of the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.590
 car you have been able to discover things 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.629
 well, quite a few straight away 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.129
 I noticed that when I understood it there 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.640
 a mess in the chassis is on the 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:12.299
 front and later it turned out that he something 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.129
 yes straight-line stability lacked minor 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.359
 oil leakage and then you actually have it 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.609
 had that to the treat 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.720
 are bad but that is maintenance 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.169
 thank you go up 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.169
 yes indeed yes so 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.600
 I want to say I had a few things 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.160
 expect like the tires and that 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.040
 you rattles the front suspension that knew 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.140
 me but because i also knew that no harm 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.700
 Could 've had it last year too 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.980
 but just leave it 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.720
 it will be replaced and further this 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.780
 was the strings 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.820
 apk judge so well with his 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.720
 I think that one comment 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.720
 good car have their hands
