happens<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:06.640> know<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:06.760> think<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.360> would<00:03:07.480> be<00:03:07.510> a

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
happens you know I think it would be a

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.720 
happens you know I think it would be a
good<00:03:07.750> learning<00:03:07.930> experience<00:03:08.140> at<00:03:08.590> least<00:03:08.700> try<00:03:09.700> it

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
good learning experience at least try it

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.130 
good learning experience at least try it
once<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.240> if<00:03:10.360> she<00:03:10.480> don't<00:03:10.570> you<00:03:10.780> know<00:03:10.900> if<00:03:10.990> it's

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
once and if she don't you know if it's

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.720 
once and if she don't you know if it's
too<00:03:11.320> much<00:03:11.350> bored<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.040> we'll<00:03:12.280> find<00:03:12.520> something

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
too much bored and we'll find something

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.240 
too much bored and we'll find something
else<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.060> do<00:03:13.210> but<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.630> think<00:03:13.990> it<00:03:14.080> would<00:03:14.170> be<00:03:14.290> if

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
else to do but I think it would be if

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.710 
else to do but I think it would be if
she<00:03:15.400> can<00:03:15.520> qualify<00:03:15.820> for<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.180> Hammers<00:03:16.450> which<00:03:16.600> I
