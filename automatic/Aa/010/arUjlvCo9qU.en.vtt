00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 in this section we are going to benguenna 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.420
 normal and as well as our soon more 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.560
 young so what am I going to do in a 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.719
 first time broke my 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.070
 character created a new image I 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.890
 am going to call rocks like this I 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.510
 click ok and I'll go so 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.119
 selected all of my other 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.640
 so from my character who 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.480
 sculpts and i'm going to come shift and my 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.279
 selection on marot topology i'm going 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.050
 go into the world to check so here 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.969
 that I have 15 cents to have a 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 better details about my soul more 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.809
 young people I hear in the renders tab 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.460
 so here I am going to prepare the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.480
 parameters for it to be select all 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.890
 active with let's say rather 0,252 bias 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.840
 so this is a parameter that helps us to 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.250
 correct some problems 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.710
 i'm going to click clear put a 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.289
 large margin therefore of 12 and spoiler 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.430
 my in soon younger ones once 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.949
 I'm ready I click on bay which is 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.239
 normally we should be able to observe 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.949
 so my english self youngest who 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.740
 comes to stand on the side of my 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.240
 in my had the editor so the man 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.720
 soon younger who will generate so 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.990
 shaded areas of what we can 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.740
 see like this 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.350
 so the unleaded 15 sees them here who 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.649
 is actually reflected in the way 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.720
 next is actually if I press on to 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.430
 game against at least titles in mode 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.680
 edit and I press age observes so 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.830
 my eyes are going so what am I going to do 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.420
 I'm going to press highness h 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.670
 stop forgiveness to observe my 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.830
 character i'm going to click here to 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.610
 remove the wire and that's my years 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.350
 soon younger 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.479
 apply to my character then just 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.860
 before continuing we see here 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.950
 we have black areas so the areas 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.110
 black it's just that on the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.000
 loops here they were going normal 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.289
 are reversed so I'm going around 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.630
 and I'm going to check that normal 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.270
 are not reversed on the on the ebit 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.000
 tonio so I select my species of 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.409
 loop like those like these and 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.539
 I press control n every time 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.979
 so I do not know which ones it is 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.350
 so I'm going to check on everything 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.640
 Here I am, I know that I come back 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.980
 the image of these excellent I press on 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.519
 control n we will even do the loop 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.190
 power plant 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.650
 I can rebecq and all my character 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.380
 so that is the euro coach 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.109
 integer press selected call 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.130
 from larrau topo come selected him to 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.940
 the end 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.760
 return to 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.920
 longest renders make a beak normally 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.040
 should see from our black areas here 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.530
 on the belt that annoys us a little 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.120
 So here we will look more closely 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.060
 black areas are gone that was good 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.670
 so a normal problem on our 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.680
 species of by tonio what are we going to do 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.930
 we're going to press altaide 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.040
 see there so everything is restored 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.670
 I will now select a 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.180
 new map 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.540
 so I go into the edition of my 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:09.720
 object i do himeji new age call it 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.860
 north I'm ok here's like these and 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.600
 there just that I'm going to do if I'm going 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.040
 sting so but normal map so I'm going 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.810
 do exactly the same thing 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.810
 see so all selected my 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.090
 character so when the area clearer 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.120
 these two selections is the active zone 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.090
 then I click on normal and there I 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.400
 do a bake and so I'll beke to the 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.360
 way 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.370
 the same way we paid 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.840
 our occlusion imprints and well I the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.180
 bike is simply but 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.860
 normally so it'll load 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.540
 normally it can be a bit more 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.360
 long because it must calculate a lot 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.920
 information at the relief level and 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.790
 apply a 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.620
 a bluish color so that's it 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.940
 looks like that so what are we going to do 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.040
 now it is that we will quickly make a 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.590
 test to check if everything works 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.230
 so I press so already games 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.720
 saved on perso 11 it's valve 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.970
 sorry I will then press 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.280
 the menu on the key she can not 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.420
 makes the pardon menu appear 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.410
 will make ends meet here as 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.420
 this i will go into glsl and then 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.120
 I will add a material to my 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.489
 basic hardware character i'm going in 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.650
 texture I add an image he puts 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.950
 jean movie the first picture I'm going 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.080
 go to select that at ccl so my 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.990
 friend one of the youngest if I press on 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.700
 alzette I see nothing because I have not 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.919
 of light so I add a light 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.020
 So the wec materials is not 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.100
 unfortunately not good to apply it I 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.570
 will put this light a little bit to 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.270
 the back we will make a light of 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.490
 auckland bach 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.669
 so I select my character I 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.710
 let's go from a mapping generate the 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.330
 coordinates lived so the way that the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.590
 ambient texture to the customer has been 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.120
 applied to our character 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.500
 Now what I'll do is 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.800
 select a second slave from 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.720
 texture add to it median movie with my 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.800
 normal this time so north and 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.410
 then what am I going to do 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.210
 just generate the uv coordinates i 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.710
 will come in imerys involved mean 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.500
 it is a normal map 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.300
 I then went unchecked color for 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.880
 not that we see the colors and click 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.950
 on north to have the normals so there 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.050
 we see that it is abnormal that allow 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.450
 add this relief and find our 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.669
 character such as it had been left 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.020
 when we had carved it so we 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.160
 some small problems at the level of 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.440
 fingers but it's not that bad 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.060
 will go with the texture 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.190
 there I'm going to duplicate the light my 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.000
 second light down is tip type 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:36.780
 so this will be a light point 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.210
 I will then put a color a 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.460
 little orange on the color of back end 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.030
 that I'm going to drop a little bit elsewhere by 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.640
 intensity 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.250
 I will resume my point and this point 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.310
 so I'll have to put a color a 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.200
 little bluish see it will give any 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.750
 following a rather interesting aspect 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.820
 maybe go up a bit the intensity of 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.180
 this point is maybe the closer one 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.330
 little white see with maybe a 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.580
 blue a little less intense and I'm going 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.430
 then selected my material 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.100
 base up and down the hard specula 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.300
 the intensity of the speculate to a little I 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.890
 can not care what I'm going to do 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.890
 I'm going to select my object 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:20.430
 go into blender game in which 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:22.200
 logical I'm going to add a meaning a ground 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.410
 of type always so that means 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:29.580
 always an end type controller is 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:32.310
 a motion-type actor with a 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.470
 rotation of 2 on the z axis what will 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.150
 power that he will allow me to 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.919
 do tests in my game engine 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.440
 to blender I'm going to pray on control 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.290
 active is to put back the origin of 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.960
 my character is his center I prepaid 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.370
 out of 5 to bring perspective 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.000
 that's what I'm going to do next it's 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.979
 so change a little the bottom of my my 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.690
 decor so at the level of the horizon I 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:57.720
 will put something a little bit more 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.000
 its that pulls a little their chestnuts so 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.419
 maybe we'll put something 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.479
 very weak pretty much like that 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:08.760
 here I go down a little more my color 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:11.479
 green towards something darker 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:15.060
 here and so here I'm going to press 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:16.380
 altaide was and we will see our 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.440
 character turn in the game engine 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.570
 blender so this is a first 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.260
 approach of our character in a 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.360
 game engine 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.070
 on this I'll see you soon in the 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.270
 next video in which we 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:30.220
 will begin the texture our 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:33.550
 character immediately 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.550
 do not forget to save
