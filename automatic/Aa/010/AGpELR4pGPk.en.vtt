00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
either get I think you can get in here

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.220 
either get I think you can get in here
v1<00:00:28.460> yeah<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.880> get<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.090> here<00:00:30.119> v1<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.170> you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
v1 yeah you can get in here v1 so you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.840 
v1 yeah you can get in here v1 so you
can<00:00:31.380> start<00:00:31.529> farming<00:00:31.740> v1<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.340> might<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.579> hard

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
can start farming v1 it might be hard

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.130 
can start farming v1 it might be hard
but<00:00:33.630> you<00:00:33.780> could<00:00:33.960> start<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.800> here<00:00:35.070> v1<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:37.079> you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
but you could start in here v1 so you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.290 
but you could start in here v1 so you
basically<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:37.620> clear<00:00:38.219> all<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.879> adds<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.270> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
basically just clear all the adds up to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.100 
basically just clear all the adds up to
this<00:00:39.540> boss<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.260> shadow<00:00:40.620> boss<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:42.020> then<00:00:43.020> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
this boss the shadow boss and then you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.790 
this boss the shadow boss and then you
just<00:00:43.320> farm<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.860> ads<00:00:44.809> over<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.960> over<00:00:46.050> by

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
just farm the ads over and over by

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.720 
just farm the ads over and over by
resetting<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> boss<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:48.620> want<00:00:49.620> best<00:00:50.399> group

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
resetting the boss you want best group

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.720 
resetting the boss you want best group
would<00:00:51.090> probably<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> healer<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.730> three

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
would probably be a healer and three

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.150 
would probably be a healer and three
sorcerers<00:00:54.120> because<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.379> faster<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> farm

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
sorcerers because the faster you farm

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.180 
sorcerers because the faster you farm
this<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.969> marks<00:00:57.270> PL<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.859> fast

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
this the marks PL get the really fast

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.060 
this the marks PL get the really fast
group<00:00:59.489> you<00:01:00.239> could<00:01:00.420> probably<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.469> two<00:01:01.710> million

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
group you could probably get two million

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.660 
group you could probably get two million
XP<00:01:02.460> an<00:01:02.579> hour<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:03.539> got<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.930> their<00:01:04.170> one<00:01:04.379> point

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
XP an hour we got up to their one point

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.859 
XP an hour we got up to their one point
but<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.939> average<00:01:06.090> will<00:01:06.390> probably<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.780> getting

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
but on average will probably be getting

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.450 
but on average will probably be getting
1.2<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.970> 1.5<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:12.350> yeah<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.710> go<00:01:14.159> into

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
1.2 to 1.5 and yeah you just go into

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.880 
1.2 to 1.5 and yeah you just go into
this<00:01:14.580> room<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:14.960> then<00:01:15.960> after<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.320> 30<00:01:16.500> seconds

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
this room and then after like 30 seconds

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.070 
this room and then after like 30 seconds
of<00:01:16.979> also<00:01:17.310> start<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.630> will<00:01:18.750> spawn<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
of also start up and it will spawn the
