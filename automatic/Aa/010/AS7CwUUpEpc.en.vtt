stools<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.140> that's<00:03:18.470> not<00:03:18.709> healthy<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.400> means

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
stools and that's not healthy that means

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.250 
stools and that's not healthy that means
something's<00:03:20.090> going<00:03:20.510> on<00:03:20.630> in<00:03:20.840> there<00:03:20.989> that's<00:03:21.200> not

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
something's going on in there that's not

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.410 
something's going on in there that's not
agreeing<00:03:21.709> with<00:03:21.830> their<00:03:22.010> bellies<00:03:22.160> so<00:03:22.760> we

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
agreeing with their bellies so we

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.449 
agreeing with their bellies so we
switched<00:03:23.720> him<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.680> reason<00:03:25.040> why

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
switched him to this and the reason why

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.690 
switched him to this and the reason why
he<00:03:25.880> was<00:03:26.000> having<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:27.560> gas<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.190> softer

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
he was having the gas and the softer

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.170 
he was having the gas and the softer
stools<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.360> because<00:03:30.200> Blue<00:03:30.560> Buffalo<00:03:30.799> has<00:03:31.760> a

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
stools is because Blue Buffalo has a

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.699 
stools is because Blue Buffalo has a
really<00:03:32.810> high<00:03:33.130> fat<00:03:34.130> and<00:03:34.459> protein<00:03:35.000> content<00:03:35.709> so

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
really high fat and protein content so

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.490 
really high fat and protein content so
we<00:03:37.160> had<00:03:37.430> this<00:03:37.910> one<00:03:37.970> here<00:03:38.570> is<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:38.959> little<00:03:39.200> less

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
we had this one here is a little less

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.880 
we had this one here is a little less
and<00:03:39.970> with<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.269> oatmeal<00:03:41.660> formula<00:03:42.560> it's<00:03:42.829> a

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
and with the oatmeal formula it's a

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.250 
and with the oatmeal formula it's a
little<00:03:43.130> better<00:03:43.310> on<00:03:43.579> their<00:03:43.760> bellies<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:44.660> we

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
little better on their bellies so we

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.539 
little better on their bellies so we
switched<00:03:45.560> him<00:03:45.739> over<00:03:45.829> to<00:03:46.010> this<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:46.400> he's<00:03:46.519> been
