00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
have to make sure that we're putting

have to make sure that we're putting
ourselves<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.619> those<00:00:25.740> game<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.160> situations

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
ourselves in those game like situations

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.250 
ourselves in those game like situations
or<00:00:26.939> tackling<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.689> learn<00:00:27.779> our<00:00:27.990> players

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
or tackling so we can learn our players

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.400 
or tackling so we can learn our players
so<00:00:28.590> they<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.859> always<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.760> as<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.960> would

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
so they can always do and as you would

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.410 
so they can always do and as you would
probably<00:00:31.800> expect<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.850> first<00:00:33.120> scrimmage

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
probably expect in a first scrimmage

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.470 
probably expect in a first scrimmage
like<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:34.230> live<00:00:34.469> stuff<00:00:35.010> going<00:00:35.309> on<00:00:35.480> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
like that with live stuff going on and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.610 
like that with live stuff going on and
tackling<00:00:36.930> there<00:00:37.050> was<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> lot<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> missed

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
tackling there was a lot of missed

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.990 
tackling there was a lot of missed
tackles<00:00:37.680> especially<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> first<00:00:38.850> two

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
tackles especially in the first two

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.130 
tackles especially in the first two
series<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.739> showed<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.989> we<00:00:42.989> got

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
series and so that showed up and we got

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
series and so that showed up and we got
better<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.410> thought<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> second<00:00:44.070> half

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
better I thought the second half

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.830 
better I thought the second half
tackling<00:00:44.579> doesn't<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> office<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> first

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
tackling doesn't the office the first

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.350 
tackling doesn't the office the first
two<00:00:46.200> series<00:00:46.410> were<00:00:46.590> really<00:00:46.860> good<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.360> thought

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
two series were really good I thought

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.229 
two series were really good I thought
that<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.930> know<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.309> two<00:00:50.610> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
that you know for you know you two to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.720 
that you know for you know you two to
fumbled<00:00:51.660> exchanges<00:00:52.460> outside<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
fumbled exchanges outside of that I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.420 
fumbled exchanges outside of that I
think<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.030> got<00:00:54.120> 99<00:00:54.510> plays<00:00:54.980> with<00:00:55.980> only<00:00:56.160> one

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
think you got 99 plays with only one

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.689 
think you got 99 plays with only one
with<00:00:56.879> only<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.329> turnover<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.489> obviously<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
with only one turnover so obviously is a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.310 
with only one turnover so obviously is a
good<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.030> bad<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.899> very<00:01:01.020> good

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
good and bad to that it's very good

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.319 
good and bad to that it's very good
because<00:01:01.680> focus<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.670> ball<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.120> permit

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
because focus on the ball to permit

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.620 
because focus on the ball to permit
offense<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:04.790> offensive<00:01:05.790> or<00:01:06.060> obviously

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
offense but offensive or obviously

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.719 
offense but offensive or obviously
defensively<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.189> more<00:01:08.310> turnovers

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
defensively want to get more turnovers

from<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.820> quarterback<00:02:39.240> suffer<00:02:39.510> looking<00:02:39.750> back

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
from the quarterback suffer looking back

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.480 
from the quarterback suffer looking back
through<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.140> film<00:02:40.380> yesterday<00:02:40.530> well<00:02:41.459> I

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
through the film yesterday well I

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.310 
through the film yesterday well I
thought<00:02:41.790> all<00:02:42.000> three<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.390> guys<00:02:42.540> took<00:02:43.050> care

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
thought all three of the guys took care

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.800 
thought all three of the guys took care
of<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.500> ball<00:02:43.620> well<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:44.160> we<00:02:44.280> talked<00:02:44.520> about

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
of the ball well like we talked about

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.510 
of the ball well like we talked about
you<00:02:45.810> know<00:02:45.900> no<00:02:46.140> interceptions<00:02:46.530> 50<00:02:47.250> pass

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
you know no interceptions 50 pass

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.150 
you know no interceptions 50 pass
attempts<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.030> no<00:02:48.150> interceptions<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:50.100> I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
attempts and no interceptions so I

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.380 
attempts and no interceptions so I
thought<00:02:50.310> they<00:02:50.459> did<00:02:50.580> well<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.300> know

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
thought they did well you know

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.590 
thought they did well you know
completion<00:02:51.870> percentage<00:02:52.020> were<00:02:52.410> pretty<00:02:52.620> good

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
completion percentage were pretty good

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.230 
completion percentage were pretty good
and<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.560> managed<00:02:54.920> offense<00:02:55.700> very<00:02:56.060> little

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
and the managed offense very little

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.660 
and the managed offense very little
penalty<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:56.960> I<00:02:57.200> think<00:02:58.070> if<00:02:58.160> we<00:02:58.280> were<00:02:58.400> able<00:02:58.490> to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
penalty so I think if we were able to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.300 
penalty so I think if we were able to
perform<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.210> way<00:02:59.330> we<00:02:59.480> did<00:02:59.630> yesterday<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.800> a

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
perform the way we did yesterday and a

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.190 
perform the way we did yesterday and a
real<00:03:01.580> game<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:02.360> know<00:03:02.480> we'd<00:03:02.780> win<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.960> lot<00:03:03.110> of

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
real game you know we'd win a lot of

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.260 
real game you know we'd win a lot of
games<00:03:03.380> that<00:03:03.470> way<00:03:03.710> through<00:03:04.490> one<00:03:04.670> week<00:03:04.850> anybody

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
games that way through one week anybody

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.080 
games that way through one week anybody
any<00:03:05.690> of<00:03:05.810> those<00:03:05.870> three<00:03:06.110> really<00:03:06.320> standing<00:03:06.740> out

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
any of those three really standing out

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.940 
any of those three really standing out
no<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.120> think<00:03:08.420> once<00:03:08.840> again<00:03:09.110> they<00:03:09.230> both<00:03:09.560> did<00:03:09.770> that

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
no I think once again they both did that

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.310 
no I think once again they both did that
are<00:03:10.160> all<00:03:10.310> three<00:03:10.580> have<00:03:10.700> had<00:03:10.880> good<00:03:11.780> moments<00:03:12.020> and

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
are all three have had good moments and

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.740 
are all three have had good moments and
all<00:03:13.040> three<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.310> plays<00:03:14.270> didn't<00:03:14.480> want<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.660> take

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
all three of plays didn't want to take

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.090 
all three of plays didn't want to take
back<00:03:14.960> so<00:03:15.200> they<00:03:15.320> gotta<00:03:15.530> learn<00:03:15.770> from<00:03:16.250> move<00:03:16.700> on

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
back so they gotta learn from move on

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.200 
back so they gotta learn from move on
how<00:03:19.100> about<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> offensive<00:03:19.580> line<00:03:19.730> play<00:03:20.090> when

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
how about the offensive line play when

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.560 
how about the offensive line play when
you<00:03:20.300> look<00:03:20.570> at<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:20.750> table<00:03:21.020> yesterday<00:03:22.420> not<00:03:23.420> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
you look at the table yesterday not the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.560 
you look at the table yesterday not the
first<00:03:23.750> two<00:03:23.990> series<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.500> was<00:03:24.590> good<00:03:25.270> not<00:03:26.270> that<00:03:26.450> in

first two series it was good not that in
the<00:03:26.600> second<00:03:27.020> half<00:03:27.110> of<00:03:27.140> went<00:03:27.440> down<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> little

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
the second half of went down a little

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.120 
the second half of went down a little
bit<00:03:28.210> they<00:03:29.210> can<00:03:29.360> play<00:03:29.630> I<00:03:29.960> didn't<00:03:30.680> think<00:03:30.710> Artoo's

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
bit they can play I didn't think Artoo's

we<00:03:31.460> played<00:03:31.700> extremely<00:03:32.090> physical<00:03:32.690> in<00:03:33.440> there

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
we played extremely physical in there

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.940 
we played extremely physical in there
made<00:03:34.900> unusual<00:03:35.900> mistakes<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.590> what<00:03:36.710> they<00:03:36.800> had

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
made unusual mistakes and what they had

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.390 
made unusual mistakes and what they had
done<00:03:37.100> in<00:03:37.280> practice<00:03:37.520> some<00:03:38.390> of<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.540> young<00:03:38.720> guys

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
done in practice some of the young guys

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.380 
done in practice some of the young guys
that's<00:03:40.400> why<00:03:40.520> we<00:03:40.670> go<00:03:40.820> in<00:03:40.940> there<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.180> try<00:03:41.300> to

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
that's why we go in there and try to

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.990 
that's why we go in there and try to
make<00:03:41.990> it<00:03:42.020> like<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.320> game<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.890> we<00:03:43.040> when<00:03:43.850> those

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
make it like a game that we when those

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.160 
make it like a game that we when those
things<00:03:44.180> happen<00:03:44.300> we'll<00:03:44.660> get<00:03:44.780> rid<00:03:44.900> of<00:03:44.960> them<00:03:45.140> now

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
and we didn't den now he would be one of

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.589 
and we didn't den now he would be one of
the<00:03:59.810> more<00:03:59.959> through<00:04:00.319> players<00:04:00.709> on<00:04:01.129> our<00:04:01.370> roster

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.020 
the more through players on our roster
always<00:04:02.599> a<00:04:02.629> lot<00:04:02.810> of<00:04:02.930> lost<00:04:03.349> a<00:04:03.500> lot<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.620> weight

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
always a lot of lost a lot of weight

increased his flexibility playing with
better<00:04:07.069> pad<00:04:07.370> leverage<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.900> same<00:04:09.079> time<00:04:09.260> he's

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
better pad leverage the same time he's

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.199 
better pad leverage the same time he's
got<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.530> long<00:04:09.680> ways<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.010> go<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.159> plants<00:04:11.120> and

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
got a long ways to go to plants and

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.759 
got a long ways to go to plants and
Marky's<00:04:11.510> how<00:04:11.720> much<00:04:12.019> you<00:04:12.140> have<00:04:12.260> to<00:04:12.349> protect<00:04:12.500> him

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
Marky's how much you have to protect him

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:18.520 
Marky's how much you have to protect him
from<00:04:13.099> himself<00:04:16.810> yeah<00:04:17.810> I<00:04:17.840> think<00:04:18.139> when<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.380> have

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
from himself yeah I think when you have

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.349 
from himself yeah I think when you have
guys<00:04:18.769> like<00:04:19.070> monkeys<00:04:19.519> that<00:04:19.729> are<00:04:19.790> competitive

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
guys like monkeys that are competitive

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.120 
guys like monkeys that are competitive
like<00:04:20.479> that<00:04:20.720> when<00:04:20.930> they<00:04:21.049> do<00:04:21.109> have<00:04:21.859> small

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
like that when they do have small

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.730 
like that when they do have small
injuries<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.080> have<00:04:24.169> to<00:04:24.260> be<00:04:24.320> very<00:04:24.380> careful

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
injuries and you have to be very careful

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.370 
injuries and you have to be very careful
with<00:04:24.979> them<00:04:25.160> because<00:04:25.310> they<00:04:25.550> don't<00:04:25.970> really<00:04:26.380> know

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
with them because they don't really know

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.659 
with them because they don't really know
how<00:04:27.410> they<00:04:27.770> don't<00:04:27.919> really<00:04:28.039> understand<00:04:28.490> how<00:04:28.610> to

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
how they don't really understand how to

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.040 
how they don't really understand how to
manage<00:04:29.000> themselves<00:04:29.180> through<00:04:29.600> those<00:04:29.720> injuries

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050
