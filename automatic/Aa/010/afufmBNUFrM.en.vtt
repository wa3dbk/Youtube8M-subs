whole time because you programming this
mad<00:03:56.480> complex<00:03:57.319> mapping<00:03:57.829> but<00:03:58.010> then<00:03:58.160> you're<00:03:58.280> like

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
mad complex mapping but then you're like

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.750 
mad complex mapping but then you're like
hook<00:03:59.480> on<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.720> button<00:04:00.019> that<00:04:00.049> does<00:04:00.739> or<00:04:00.979> is<00:04:01.519> this

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
hook on a button that does or is this

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.240 
hook on a button that does or is this
 mode<00:04:02.209> enabled<00:04:02.810> or<00:04:03.169> it's<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.620> plane<00:04:03.949> or

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
 mode enabled or it's that plane or

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.730 
 mode enabled or it's that plane or
they're<00:04:04.400> not

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
they're not

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.230 
they're not
it's<00:04:05.130> really<00:04:05.310> just<00:04:05.430> nice<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.850> have<00:04:06.000> all<00:04:06.030> that

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
it's really just nice to have all that

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.660 
it's really just nice to have all that
visual<00:04:06.630> feedback<00:04:07.310> also<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.460> means<00:04:08.580> that

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
visual feedback also it means that

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.040 
visual feedback also it means that
you're<00:04:08.850> cycling<00:04:09.090> through<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.570> different

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
you're cycling through the different

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.050 
you're cycling through the different
bouncing<00:04:10.740> you<00:04:10.860> make<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.700> can<00:04:11.850> really

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
bouncing you make you can really

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.490 
bouncing you make you can really
just<00:04:12.180> immediately<00:04:12.600> tell<00:04:12.870> what<00:04:13.020> bank<00:04:13.290> you're

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
just immediately tell what bank you're

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.370 
just immediately tell what bank you're
in<00:04:13.620> so<00:04:13.800> I<00:04:13.830> know<00:04:14.130> that's<00:04:14.400> my<00:04:14.580> main<00:04:14.820> bank<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.450> know

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
in so I know that's my main bank I know

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.170 
in so I know that's my main bank I know
that<00:04:16.590> there's<00:04:16.770> red<00:04:17.040> basically<00:04:17.580> other<00:04:17.850> buttons

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
that there's red basically other buttons

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.350 
that there's red basically other buttons
to<00:04:18.300> turn<00:04:18.510> on<00:04:19.110> the<00:04:19.770> unit<00:04:20.010> one<00:04:20.310> affects<00:04:20.730> if<00:04:21.150> it's

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
to turn on the unit one affects if it's

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.270 
to turn on the unit one affects if it's
flashing<00:04:21.600> red<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.140> means<00:04:22.350> it's<00:04:22.560> enabled<00:04:23.070> for

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
flashing red it means it's enabled for

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.670 
flashing red it means it's enabled for
that<00:04:23.370> track<00:04:23.810> decade<00:04:24.810> being<00:04:25.050> on<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.200> Left<00:04:25.410> get

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
that track decade being on the Left get

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.220 
that track decade being on the Left get
beeping<00:04:26.040> on<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.250> right<00:04:26.840> these<00:04:27.840> purple

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
beeping on the right these purple

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.590 
beeping on the right these purple
buttons<00:04:28.560> basically<00:04:29.040> set<00:04:29.340> up<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:30.090> leyland

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
buttons basically set up the the leyland

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.510 
buttons basically set up the the leyland
green<00:04:33.600> starts<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.260> flashes<00:04:34.920> when<00:04:35.040> it's<00:04:35.220> on<00:04:35.310> and

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
green starts it flashes when it's on and

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.350 
green starts it flashes when it's on and
then<00:04:36.060> they<00:04:36.810> trim<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.170> delay<00:04:37.410> oh<00:04:40.970> right<00:04:41.970> so

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
then they trim the delay oh right so

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.780 
then they trim the delay oh right so
then<00:04:42.570> if<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:42.720> do<00:04:46.160> what's<00:04:47.160> going<00:04:47.370> on<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.670> is

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
then if you do what's going on this is

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.700 
then if you do what's going on this is
madness<00:04:48.060> we're<00:04:48.510> ducking<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.900> why<00:04:49.080> is<00:04:49.440> this

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
madness we're ducking it why is this

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.020 
madness we're ducking it why is this
there<00:04:50.550> they<00:04:50.640> go

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
there they go

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.500 
there they go
now<00:04:51.600> you<00:04:51.690> can<00:04:51.840> see<00:04:52.020> it's<00:04:52.860> basically<00:04:53.510> flashing

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
now you can see it's basically flashing

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.730 
now you can see it's basically flashing
which<00:04:54.660> means<00:04:54.870> it's<00:04:54.990> delayed<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.500> don't<00:04:55.680> get

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
which means it's delayed so don't get

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.200 
which means it's delayed so don't get
confused<00:04:55.860> even<00:04:56.520> though<00:04:56.610> I've<00:04:56.730> got<00:04:56.760> confuse

pretty much that I pretty much said all
the<00:06:16.950> cool<00:06:17.160> it's<00:06:17.550> just<00:06:17.850> a

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
the cool it's just a

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.740 
the cool it's just a
nicely<00:06:18.750> put<00:06:18.900> together<00:06:19.080> thing<00:06:19.530> um<00:06:20.750> certainly

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
nicely put together thing um certainly

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.870 
nicely put together thing um certainly
it's<00:06:21.990> not<00:06:22.230> really<00:06:22.560> that<00:06:22.590> plug<00:06:23.220> and<00:06:23.430> play<00:06:23.610> both

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
it's not really that plug and play both

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.510 
it's not really that plug and play both
granted<00:06:24.330> there<00:06:24.480> are<00:06:24.630> some<00:06:24.960> mappings<00:06:25.560> that<00:06:25.740> you

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
granted there are some mappings that you

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.430 
granted there are some mappings that you
can<00:06:26.670> just<00:06:26.850> load<00:06:27.030> up<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.480> have<00:06:27.810> a<00:06:27.840> bit<00:06:28.050> of<00:06:28.110> a<00:06:28.140> jam

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
can just load up and have a bit of a jam

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.520 
can just load up and have a bit of a jam
out<00:06:29.450> the<00:06:30.450> confusing<00:06:31.080> thing<00:06:31.290> when<00:06:31.410> you

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
out the confusing thing when you

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.200 
out the confusing thing when you
download<00:06:31.950> someone<00:06:32.220> else's<00:06:32.460> mapping<00:06:32.820> it<00:06:33.030> tends

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
download someone else's mapping it tends

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.960 
download someone else's mapping it tends
to<00:06:33.300> be<00:06:33.450> a<00:06:33.480> bit<00:06:33.660> complicated<00:06:33.960> and<00:06:34.790> you<00:06:35.790> don't

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
to be a bit complicated and you don't

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.220 
to be a bit complicated and you don't
really<00:06:36.090> know<00:06:36.240> what's<00:06:36.390> going<00:06:36.420> on<00:06:36.720> with<00:06:36.900> this<00:06:37.050> so

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
really know what's going on with this so

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.420 
really know what's going on with this so
I<00:06:37.290> highly<00:06:37.590> recommend<00:06:37.620> building<00:06:38.130> your<00:06:38.400> own

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
I highly recommend building your own

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.550 
I highly recommend building your own
mapping<00:06:38.760> so<00:06:39.120> just<00:06:39.390> take<00:06:39.510> a<00:06:39.540> bit<00:06:39.780> of<00:06:39.810> time<00:06:40.080> but

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
mapping so just take a bit of time but

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.740 
mapping so just take a bit of time but
then<00:06:40.740> you<00:06:40.860> have<00:06:40.980> your<00:06:41.190> own<00:06:41.280> custom<00:06:41.550> DJ<00:06:42.360> set<00:06:42.600> up

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
then you have your own custom DJ set up

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.510 
then you have your own custom DJ set up
with<00:06:43.410> lights<00:06:43.710> and<00:06:46.040> big<00:06:47.040> fan<00:06:47.220> of<00:06:47.250> the

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
with lights and big fan of the

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.010 
with lights and big fan of the
offense<00:06:47.850> little<00:06:48.180> light<00:06:48.300> see<00:06:48.540> I<00:06:51.020> basically

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
offense little light see I basically

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.450 
offense little light see I basically
just<00:06:52.110> do<00:06:52.380> that<00:06:52.560> for<00:06:52.740> like<00:06:52.830> two<00:06:53.070> hours<00:06:53.100> of<00:06:53.430> my

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
just do that for like two hours of my

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.340 
just do that for like two hours of my
chest

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.470 

pretty<00:06:58.350> rad<00:06:58.650> but<00:06:58.950> I<00:06:58.980> got<00:06:59.700> some<00:06:59.820> cool<00:06:59.940> ideas<00:07:00.090> and

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
pretty rad but I got some cool ideas and

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.630 
pretty rad but I got some cool ideas and
once<00:07:00.600> some<00:07:00.780> apps<00:07:00.930> kind<00:07:01.200> of<00:07:01.320> this<00:07:01.920> mapping<00:07:02.430> is

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.640 
once some apps kind of this mapping is

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.460 
once some apps kind of this mapping is
refined<00:07:04.640> somewhat<00:07:05.640> finalized<00:07:06.270> I<00:07:06.480> will<00:07:06.810> the
