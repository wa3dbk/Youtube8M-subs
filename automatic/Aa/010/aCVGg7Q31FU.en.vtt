00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
know you can go as what as you like it

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.950 
know you can go as what as you like it
doesn't<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.600> matter<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:50.330> put<00:01:51.330> tape<00:01:51.600> here

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
doesn't really matter I put tape here

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.680 
doesn't really matter I put tape here
masking<00:01:52.590> tape<00:01:52.770> on<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.760> pliers<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.390> it

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
masking tape on the pliers because it

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.110 
masking tape on the pliers because it
scratches<00:01:55.410> the<00:01:56.220> ends<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.610> lot<00:01:57.350> when<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:59.640> the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
scratches the ends a lot when you in the

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.830 
scratches the ends a lot when you in the
metal<00:02:00.780> back<00:02:01.040> but<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> usually<00:02:02.400> cover<00:02:02.910> that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
metal back but I usually cover that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.800 
metal back but I usually cover that
little<00:02:04.590> frame<00:02:05.040> area<00:02:05.430> here<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.180> glitter<00:02:06.540> or

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
little frame area here with glitter or

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.980 
little frame area here with glitter or
paint<00:02:07.050> anyway<00:02:07.470> so<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.920> doesn't<00:02:08.250> matter<00:02:08.750> but<00:02:09.750> if

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
paint anyway so it doesn't matter but if

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.740 
paint anyway so it doesn't matter but if
it<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:10.410> bothers<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.400> use<00:02:12.300> more<00:02:12.480> tape

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
it really bothers you just use more tape

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.480 
it really bothers you just use more tape
I<00:02:13.020> didn't<00:02:13.680> use<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.800> much<00:02:14.270> all<00:02:15.270> right<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:17.040> I

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
I didn't use that much all right so I

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.030 
I didn't use that much all right so I
flatten<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> edge<00:02:18.480> see

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.240 

the<00:02:24.550> next<00:02:24.879> step<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:26.700> you're<00:02:27.700> gonna<00:02:27.849> heat<00:02:28.810> up

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
the next step is you're gonna heat up

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.180 
the next step is you're gonna heat up
this<00:02:30.250> plastic<00:02:30.760> area<00:02:31.090> with<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.360> heat<00:02:31.540> tool<00:02:31.810> I

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
this plastic area with the heat tool I

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.460 
this plastic area with the heat tool I
usually<00:02:33.190> do<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.459> for<00:02:33.760> about<00:02:33.849> 10<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.900> 12<00:02:35.080> seconds

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
usually do it for about 10 to 12 seconds

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.810 
usually do it for about 10 to 12 seconds
so

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:49.839 

[Applause]

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.490 

my<00:02:51.650> limit<00:02:52.650> here<00:02:52.980> because<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.489> gets<00:02:53.670> really<00:02:54.120> hot

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
my limit here because it gets really hot

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.949 
my limit here because it gets really hot
now<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:56.670> know<00:02:56.819> grab<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.209> bottle<00:02:57.480> cap<00:02:57.690> and

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
now you know grab the bottle cap and

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.960 
now you know grab the bottle cap and
kind<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.230> go<00:02:58.410> under<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.890> plastic<00:02:59.129> here<00:02:59.670> and

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
kind of go under the plastic here and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.420 
kind of go under the plastic here and
