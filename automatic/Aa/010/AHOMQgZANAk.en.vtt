whenever I do like a watch and go for
now<00:03:34.959> one<00:03:35.230> I<00:03:35.500> think<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.400> will<00:03:36.640> sleep<00:03:37.000> with<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.360> wet

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629

now one I think I will sleep with it wet
that<00:03:38.590> way<00:03:38.769> it<00:03:38.920> doesn't<00:03:39.129> get<00:03:39.400> dry<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:39.760> out

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
that way it doesn't get dry it out

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.660 
that way it doesn't get dry it out
because<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.650> really<00:03:41.860> feels<00:03:42.069> next<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.459> when<00:03:42.549> it

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
because it really feels next to when it

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.800 
because it really feels next to when it
gets<00:03:42.790> dried<00:03:43.030> out<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.569> I<00:03:44.610> hate<00:03:45.610> wetting<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.269> my
