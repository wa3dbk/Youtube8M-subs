00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
little bit more polished to me unless

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.840 
little bit more polished to me unless
I'm<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.390> seeing<00:00:33.600> things<00:00:33.780> but<00:00:34.649> uh<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.640> ranked

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850

1v1<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.390> don't<00:00:39.629> remember<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.960> being<00:00:40.140> there

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
1v1 I don't remember that being there

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
1v1 I don't remember that being there
unless<00:00:41.850> I've<00:00:42.149> been<00:00:42.329> oblivious<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:43.140> don't<00:00:43.620> think

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
unless I've been oblivious I don't think

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.610 
unless I've been oblivious I don't think
so<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.460> they<00:00:45.180> added<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:46.640> all<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.820> fuck<00:00:48.440> ok<00:00:49.440> I
