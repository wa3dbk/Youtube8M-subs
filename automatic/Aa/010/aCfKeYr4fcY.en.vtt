them all the way I'm I feel like I knew
this<00:00:53.489> person<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.750> looks<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.079> little<00:00:55.199> bit

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
this person so this looks a little bit

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
this person so this looks a little bit
light<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.980> was<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> only<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
light but it was the only one that I

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.099 
light but it was the only one that I
could<00:00:56.910> find<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.449> seemed<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> little<00:00:57.930> bit

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
could find that seemed a little bit

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.040 
could find that seemed a little bit
yellow<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.590> tone<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> figured<00:00:59.930> we<00:01:00.930> can

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
yellow in tone so I figured we can

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.750 
yellow in tone so I figured we can
always<00:01:01.289> bronze<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.770> later<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.489> half<00:01:02.730> of

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:20.279 
be a normal to dry skin formula I was
expecting<00:06:17.379> to<00:06:17.469> be<00:06:17.499> oily<00:06:17.949> by<00:06:18.099> now<00:06:18.339> so<00:06:19.149> so<00:06:20.139> that's

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
expecting to be oily by now so so that's

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.879 
expecting to be oily by now so so that's
pretty<00:06:20.589> good<00:06:20.829> and<00:06:21.129> I<00:06:21.459> definitely<00:06:21.759> think<00:06:22.119> that

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
pretty good and I definitely think that

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.059 
pretty good and I definitely think that
maybe<00:06:23.889> in<00:06:24.159> the<00:06:24.279> summer<00:06:24.839> it<00:06:25.839> obviously<00:06:26.769> would

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.069 
maybe in the summer it obviously would

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.739 
maybe in the summer it obviously would
if<00:06:27.189> I<00:06:27.339> was<00:06:27.519> in<00:06:27.729> direct<00:06:27.909> sunlight<00:06:28.179> or<00:06:28.449> something

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:28.749 
if I was in direct sunlight or something

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:32.219 
if I was in direct sunlight or something
like<00:06:28.839> that<00:06:28.899> but<00:06:29.319> I<00:06:30.299> don't<00:06:31.299> know<00:06:31.419> I<00:06:31.779> I<00:06:32.049> said

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
like that but I don't know I I said

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.499 
like that but I don't know I I said
earlier<00:06:32.769> there<00:06:33.189> is<00:06:33.219> breakage<00:06:33.789> around<00:06:34.059> here

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:34.509 
earlier there is breakage around here

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.169 
earlier there is breakage around here
and<00:06:34.719> these<00:06:35.289> little<00:06:36.009> bug<00:06:36.339> bites<00:06:36.639> are<00:06:36.849> showing

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:37.179 
and these little bug bites are showing

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:39.079 
and these little bug bites are showing
through<00:06:37.449> but<00:06:37.779> that<00:06:37.959> was<00:06:38.139> there<00:06:38.319> this<00:06:38.439> morning

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.089 
through but that was there this morning

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:42.359 
through but that was there this morning
I<00:06:40.089> just<00:06:40.569> like<00:06:40.989> how<00:06:41.199> it<00:06:41.229> wears<00:06:41.439> it<00:06:41.649> feels<00:06:42.009> fine

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:42.369 
I just like how it wears it feels fine

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:44.699 
I just like how it wears it feels fine
it<00:06:42.610> doesn't<00:06:42.759> feel<00:06:43.179> sticky<00:06:43.809> doesn't<00:06:44.289> feel<00:06:44.529> like

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:44.709 
it doesn't feel sticky doesn't feel like

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:46.919 
it doesn't feel sticky doesn't feel like
I<00:06:44.860> can<00:06:45.039> wipe<00:06:45.249> it<00:06:45.399> off<00:06:45.519> like<00:06:45.819> this<00:06:45.849> is<00:06:46.239> pretty

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:46.929 
I can wipe it off like this is pretty

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:47.489 
I can wipe it off like this is pretty
dry

00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:47.499 
dry

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:51.209 
dry
as<00:06:47.559> far<00:06:48.039> as<00:06:48.119> me<00:06:49.119> just<00:06:49.360> sweating<00:06:50.019> so<00:06:50.439> for<00:06:51.189> a

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:51.219 
as far as me just sweating so for a

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:52.619 
as far as me just sweating so for a
first<00:06:51.399> impression<00:06:51.610> I<00:06:51.999> definitely<00:06:52.360> give<00:06:52.479> it<00:06:52.509> a

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:52.629 
first impression I definitely give it a

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:55.139 
first impression I definitely give it a
thumbs<00:06:52.899> up<00:06:53.050> it<00:06:53.319> holds<00:06:53.559> up<00:06:53.649> nicely<00:06:53.679> for<00:06:54.489> the

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:55.149 
thumbs up it holds up nicely for the

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:56.790 
thumbs up it holds up nicely for the
crap<00:06:55.389> that<00:06:55.569> I<00:06:55.599> go<00:06:55.839> through<00:06:55.869> in<00:06:56.199> a<00:06:56.259> day<00:06:56.409> cuz<00:06:56.649> I<00:06:56.739> do

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
crap that I go through in a day cuz I do

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.619 
crap that I go through in a day cuz I do
touch<00:06:57.159> my<00:06:57.339> face<00:06:57.550> I<00:06:57.729> know<00:06:57.789> it's<00:06:58.029> horrible<00:06:58.419> but

00:06:58.619 --> 00:06:58.629 
touch my face I know it's horrible but

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.389 
touch my face I know it's horrible but
especially<00:06:59.409> down<00:06:59.559> here<00:06:59.589> I'm<00:06:59.949> always<00:07:00.129> leaning

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:00.399 
especially down here I'm always leaning

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.319 
especially down here I'm always leaning
on<00:07:00.639> something<00:07:01.119> so<00:07:01.389> that's<00:07:02.139> to<00:07:02.439> be<00:07:02.529> expected

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:03.329 
on something so that's to be expected

00:07:03.329 --> 00:07:05.699 
on something so that's to be expected
usually<00:07:04.329> this<00:07:04.449> part<00:07:04.659> of<00:07:04.809> my<00:07:04.899> nose<00:07:05.110> is<00:07:05.349> super

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:05.709

usually this part of my nose is super
dry<00:07:06.189> by<00:07:06.459> the<00:07:06.519> end<00:07:06.729> of<00:07:06.819> the<00:07:06.909> day<00:07:07.059> and<00:07:07.419> like

don't have that at all and which is nice

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:14.969 
don't have that at all and which is nice
because<00:07:13.629> I<00:07:13.809> don't<00:07:13.989> have<00:07:14.139> shine<00:07:14.439> either<00:07:14.769> at
