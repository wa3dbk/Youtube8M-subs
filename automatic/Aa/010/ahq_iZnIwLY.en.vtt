00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
marriage marriage is what brings us

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.660 
marriage marriage is what brings us
together<00:00:04.670> today<00:00:06.319> my<00:00:07.319> opinions<00:00:07.950> on<00:00:08.220> marriage

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
together today my opinions on marriage

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.580 
together today my opinions on marriage
are<00:00:09.000> pretty<00:00:09.540> simple<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:10.050> think<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.410> if<00:00:10.500> you

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
are pretty simple I think that if you

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.020 
are pretty simple I think that if you
want<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.800> get<00:00:10.889> married<00:00:11.010> should<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.849> able<00:00:11.910> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
want to get married should be able to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.280 
want to get married should be able to
get<00:00:12.090> married<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:12.960> don't<00:00:13.080> wanna<00:00:13.230> get

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
get married and if you don't wanna get

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.810 
get married and if you don't wanna get
married<00:00:13.349> then<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.250> get<00:00:14.340> married<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
married then don't get married and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.910 
married then don't get married and
that's<00:00:15.089> kind<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.660> all<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.870> think<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.470> if

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
that's kind of all I think about it if

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.400 
that's kind of all I think about it if
you<00:00:17.010> wanna<00:00:17.130> get<00:00:17.220> married<00:00:17.340> go<00:00:18.210> get<00:00:18.390> married<00:00:18.690> you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
you wanna get married go get married you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.810 
you wanna get married go get married you
should<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.680> able<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.160> if<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.670> want

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
should be able to do that if you want

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.099 
should be able to do that if you want
something<00:00:20.970> more<00:00:21.090> passionate<00:00:21.630> than<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.869> then

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
something more passionate than that then

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.330 
something more passionate than that then

think<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.520> somebody<00:00:32.880> else's<00:00:33.239> affair

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
think that it's somebody else's affair

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.780 
think that it's somebody else's affair
somebody<00:00:34.020> else's<00:00:34.230> business<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.489> doesn't

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
somebody else's business and it doesn't

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.520 
somebody else's business and it doesn't
affect<00:00:36.120> me<00:00:36.329> probably<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:36.960> somebody<00:00:37.260> wants<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.200 
graduating I didn't make a video so what
I<00:01:40.049> would<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.320> said<00:01:40.470> about<00:01:40.770> charity<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.340> this

I think that if you can give to charity

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.490 
I think that if you can give to charity
you<00:01:44.790> should<00:01:45.000> because<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.960> nice<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.170> take
