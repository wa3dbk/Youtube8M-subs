00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.460

 gloomy wanders so bloodthirsty and 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.630
 at least this is full of power 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.710
 trailer from the very bleak comes along 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.390
 and I think it's great too 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.400
 history just to the career too 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.840
 this first great vampire and his 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.220
 luke also tells a story 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.410
 evans a very interesting cast 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.570
 at this point and dracula answer 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.530
 brings universal pictures 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.170
 expected from the second october 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.640
 2014 in German cinemas and how from 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.290
 the first trailer typical of this one 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.630
 a bit of lust for more says 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.130
 action is in darkness to make it 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.660
 especially on bloodthirsty cut 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.850
 the last sequence in the with one 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.950
 Fist chose the bats on the 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.480
 earth down russell are somehow already 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.100
 a little bit on me and me 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.780
 I'm looking forward to the beach or the beginning of October 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.040
 just have to say I was such a 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.090
 bit on the second trailer from where 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.860
 a bit hopefully then that 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.750
 storytelling comes to the fore 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.040
 Here we have the ethical factor 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.690
 Hiding behind it is one more thing 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.340
 bit my question a lot 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.140
 Information is not around yet 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.420

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.650
 which at least filmed here in detail 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.630
 That's why let's do a little bit 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.830
 wait but this trailer makes me 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.150
