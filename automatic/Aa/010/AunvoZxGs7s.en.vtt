controllers whether it's controlling
multiple<00:00:09.960> decks<00:00:10.200> or<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> same<00:00:10.710> decks<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.639> is

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
multiple decks or the same decks this is

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.160 
multiple decks or the same decks this is
all<00:00:11.880> starting<00:00:12.240> from<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.509> conversation<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.110> I

was using my V sevens in concert with my

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.269 
was using my V sevens in concert with my
Novation<00:00:18.630> Dicers<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.350> he<00:00:19.859> didn't<00:00:20.070> know<00:00:20.130> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
Novation Dicers and he didn't know that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.980 
Novation Dicers and he didn't know that
you<00:00:20.369> could<00:00:20.550> use<00:00:20.580> multiple<00:00:21.150> controllers<00:00:21.480> to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
you could use multiple controllers to

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.599 
you could use multiple controllers to
control<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> same<00:00:22.619> index<00:00:22.890> at<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.130> same<00:00:23.310> time

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
control the same index at the same time

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
control the same index at the same time
and<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.269> question<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.600> he<00:00:24.960> had<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.529> he

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and the question that he had is that he

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.630 
and the question that he had is that he
wanted<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.519> control<00:00:26.900> multiple<00:00:28.160> deck<00:00:29.160> sets

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
wanted to control multiple deck sets

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.810 
wanted to control multiple deck sets
like<00:00:30.240> deck<00:00:30.570> one<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.260> two<00:00:31.500> separate<00:00:32.399> from<00:00:32.610> deck

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
like deck one and two separate from deck

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.040 
like deck one and two separate from deck
three<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.270> four<00:00:33.480> with<00:00:33.719> different

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
three and four with different

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.240 
three and four with different
controllers<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.620> didn't<00:00:34.890> think<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.160> was

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
controllers I didn't think that was

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.729 
controllers I didn't think that was
possible<00:00:35.340> but<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.000> very<00:00:36.540> much<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.469> we're

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
possible but it very much is so we're

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.020 
possible but it very much is so we're
gonna<00:00:37.829> go<00:00:38.070> ahead<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.460> give<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.700> quick<00:00:38.850> little

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
gonna go ahead and give a quick little

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.819 
gonna go ahead and give a quick little
demonstration<00:00:39.329> now<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.320> see<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.649> have

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
demonstration now you can see we have

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.040 
demonstration now you can see we have
two<00:00:41.070> controllers<00:00:41.460> hooked<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.809> top

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
two controllers hooked up this this top

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.970 
two controllers hooked up this this top
one<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:44.270> numark<00:00:45.270> DJ<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> go<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.559> bottom<00:00:46.950> one

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
one is a numark DJ to go this bottom one

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.549 
one is a numark DJ to go this bottom one
is<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.340> Numark<00:00:48.059> orbit<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:49.200> these<00:00:49.379> two

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
is a Numark orbit I use these two

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.080 
is a Numark orbit I use these two
because<00:00:49.829> they're<00:00:50.010> both<00:00:50.190> small<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.550> compact

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
because they're both small and compact

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.540 
because they're both small and compact
and<00:00:51.300> easy<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> shoot<00:00:52.530> for<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.770> video<00:00:52.980> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
and easy to shoot for this video so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.910 
and easy to shoot for this video so
let's<00:00:53.760> go<00:00:54.059> ahead<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.390> store<00:00:55.289> demonstration

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
let's go ahead and store demonstration

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.010 
let's go ahead and store demonstration
we're<00:00:56.160> gonna<00:00:56.280> go<00:00:56.370> ahead<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.610> use<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> DG<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
we're gonna go ahead and use the DG to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.700 
we're gonna go ahead and use the DG to
go<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.609> as<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.270> press<00:01:00.510> play

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
go and as you can see as we press play

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.579 
go and as you can see as we press play
the<00:01:01.710> song<00:01:01.980> plays<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.730> Dec<00:01:02.910> 1<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.080> go

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the song plays on Dec 1 if we can go

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.859 
the song plays on Dec 1 if we can go
down<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> Novation<00:01:05.189> Dicer<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.600> stops

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
down to the Novation Dicer and it stops

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.280 
down to the Novation Dicer and it stops
because<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.189> controller<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.290> this

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
because this controller and this

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.359 
because this controller and this
controller<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:12.119> doesn't<00:01:12.570> matter<00:01:13.369> because

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
controller it doesn't matter because

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.060 
controller it doesn't matter because
they're<00:01:14.640> both<00:01:14.729> hooked<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> same<00:01:15.330> deck<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
they're both hooked to the same deck and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.380 
they're both hooked to the same deck and
Virtual<00:01:17.070> DJ<00:01:17.189> doesn't<00:01:17.640> care<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.030> control

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
Virtual DJ doesn't care which control

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.350 
Virtual DJ doesn't care which control
you're<00:01:18.540> using<00:01:18.780> it'll<00:01:19.619> handle<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.340> input<00:01:21.119> from

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
you're using it'll handle the input from

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.090 
you're using it'll handle the input from
both<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.630> those<00:01:21.840> decks<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.500> let's<00:01:22.860> go<00:01:22.979> ahead

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
both of those decks so let's go ahead

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.240 
both of those decks so let's go ahead
and<00:01:23.430> give<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> demonstration<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:25.080> how<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.890> want

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
and give a demonstration of how we want

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.880 
and give a demonstration of how we want
to<00:01:26.340> use<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:26.700> multiple<00:01:27.420> decks<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.590> should

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
to use it with multiple decks I should

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.800 
to use it with multiple decks I should
say<00:01:28.979> multiple<00:01:29.340> decks<00:01:29.579> sets<00:01:29.880> we're<00:01:30.630> going<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
say multiple decks sets we're going to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.340 
say multiple decks sets we're going to
go<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.960> our<00:01:31.110> settings<00:01:32.450> we're<00:01:33.450> gonna<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.840> here

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
go to our settings we're gonna go here

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
go to our settings we're gonna go here
change<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.009> DJ<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:35.790> we're<00:01:36.390> gonna<00:01:36.479> right

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
change the DJ to go we're gonna right

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.240 
change the DJ to go we're gonna right
now<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.439> locked<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.100> two

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
now we have it locked to one and two

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.310 
now we have it locked to one and two
we're<00:01:39.060> gonna<00:01:39.180> take<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> Numark<00:01:39.840> orbit<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
we're gonna take the Numark orbit and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.210 
we're gonna take the Numark orbit and
we're<00:01:40.770> gonna<00:01:40.860> lock<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:42.030> three<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.570> four<00:01:43.220> go

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
we're gonna lock it to three and four go

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.149 
we're gonna lock it to three and four go
ahead<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.490> close<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:45.920> now<00:01:46.920> we're<00:01:47.070> going
