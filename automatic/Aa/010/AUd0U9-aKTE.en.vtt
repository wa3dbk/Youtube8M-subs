00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
gonna just get too repetitive so I'm

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.300 
gonna just get too repetitive so I'm
gonna<00:01:21.630> try<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.020> break<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> floor<00:01:22.830> every<00:01:23.100> once

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
gonna try and break the floor every once

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.920 
gonna try and break the floor every once
in<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.490> while<00:01:23.670> i'll<00:01:23.939> probably<00:01:24.119> upload<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.780> my
