push the series back to Los Angeles for
it<00:00:41.760> game<00:00:41.969> 5<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.300> defense<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.500> was<00:00:43.649> pivotal

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
it game 5 but defense if it was pivotal

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.799 
it game 5 but defense if it was pivotal
in<00:00:44.100> game<00:00:44.309> 3<00:00:44.550> it's<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> huge<00:00:45.510> deal

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
in game 3 it's going to be a huge deal

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.569 
in game 3 it's going to be a huge deal
in<00:00:45.960> game<00:00:46.140> 4<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:46.680> defenses<00:00:47.129> will<00:00:47.250> even

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
in game 4 and I think defenses will even

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
in game 4 and I think defenses will even
be<00:00:47.700> more<00:00:47.940> stepped<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.840> game<00:00:49.079> that's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
be more stepped up in this game that's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
be more stepped up in this game that's
why<00:00:49.710> I'm<00:00:49.800> looking<00:00:50.070> towards<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.430> total<00:00:50.940> I

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
why I'm looking towards the total I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.639 
why I'm looking towards the total I
think<00:00:51.180> they<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> lot<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.629> value<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.260> nine

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
think they have a lot of value to nine

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.010 
think they have a lot of value to nine
and<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> half<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.250> think<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> under<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> lot

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and a half I think the under has a lot

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.810 
and a half I think the under has a lot
of<00:00:55.050> value<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.010> game<00:00:56.190> Golden<00:00:56.579> State<00:00:56.789> has

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
of value for this game Golden State has

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.729 
of value for this game Golden State has
been<00:00:57.059> playing<00:00:57.300> very<00:00:57.600> well<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> defensive

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
been playing very well on the defensive

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.319 
been playing very well on the defensive

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
hasn't been great inconsistent he still

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.270 
hasn't been great inconsistent he still
gives<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.890> end<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.220> floor

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
gives you some on that end of the floor

and<00:01:11.610> he<00:01:11.700> had<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.060> downgrade<00:01:12.689> from<00:01:12.900> Bogut

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and he had in the downgrade from Bogut

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.810 
and he had in the downgrade from Bogut
which<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.920> lot<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.460> thought<00:01:14.640> would<00:01:14.760> be

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
which a lot of which I thought would be

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.249 
which a lot of which I thought would be
a<00:01:14.909> lot<00:01:15.150> bigger<00:01:15.270> than<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.810> has<00:01:16.020> not

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
a lot bigger than what it is has not

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.810 
a lot bigger than what it is has not
been<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.560> significant<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.430> think<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
been as significant so I do think the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.010 
been as significant so I do think the
Golden<00:01:18.090> State<00:01:18.270> Warriors<00:01:18.570> playing<00:01:18.780> extremely

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
Golden State Warriors playing extremely

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.870 
Golden State Warriors playing extremely
well<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.530> defense<00:01:19.740> rebounded<00:01:20.670> well

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
well on defense rebounded well

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.249 
well on defense rebounded well
especially<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.570> Game<00:01:21.720> three<00:01:21.930> from<00:01:22.080> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
especially in Game three from that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.499 
especially in Game three from that
atrocious<00:01:23.009> performance<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.939> Game<00:01:24.119> two<00:01:24.150> or

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
atrocious performance in Game two or

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.050 
atrocious performance in Game two or
they<00:01:24.600> gave<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.869> 138<00:01:25.650> points<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:26.700> three<00:01:27.030> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
they gave up 138 points but now three of

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
these two teams have gone under the

these two teams have gone under the
total<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.850> 209<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> half<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.869> an<00:01:33.960> early

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
total and 209 and a half for an early

total and 209 and a half for an early
afternoon<00:01:34.890> game<00:01:35.130> looks<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.540> bit

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
afternoon game looks to be a little bit

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.899 
afternoon game looks to be a little bit
overvaluing<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.770> i<00:01:37.829> think<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> under

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
overvaluing here and i think the under

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
overvaluing here and i think the under
has<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> play<00:01:39.600> Golden<00:01:39.930> State<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.259> only

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
has to be the play Golden State was only

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550 
has to be the play Golden State was only
two<00:01:41.340> times<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.390> season<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.899> home<00:01:43.079> underdog

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
two times this season a home underdog

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.810 
two times this season a home underdog
but<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:43.829> cashed<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> under<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.610> both

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
but they cashed the under in both

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.999 
but they cashed the under in both
occasions<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.500> said<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
occasions and like I said this is a

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
occasions and like I said this is a
daytime<00:01:47.490> matchups<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.180> start<00:01:48.390> 1230

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
daytime matchups going to start 1230

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
daytime matchups going to start 1230
pacific<00:01:49.770> time<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.189> these<00:01:50.310> guys<00:01:50.549> had<00:01:50.759> going<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
pacific time so these guys had going to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.850 
pacific time so these guys had going to
have<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.509> very<00:01:51.540> early<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.680> game

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
have to be up very early for this game

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.770 
have to be up very early for this game
on<00:01:53.130> Sunday<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.820> think<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.390> lead<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.750> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
on Sunday I think that will lead to a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
on Sunday I think that will lead to a
little<00:01:55.079> bit<00:01:55.170> less<00:01:55.350> offense<00:01:55.770> may<00:01:55.920> be<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.070> little

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
little bit less offense may be a little

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310 
little bit less offense may be a little
bit<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.549> sluggishness<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.810> begin<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> game

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
bit of sluggishness to begin the game

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.440 
bit of sluggishness to begin the game
that<00:01:58.950> could<00:01:59.159> lead<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.579> under<00:01:59.880> at<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> game

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that could lead to the under at the game

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
that could lead to the under at the game
of<00:02:00.689> being<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.020> very<00:02:01.200> good<00:02:01.259> bed<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.680> at<00:02:01.860> under<00:02:02.159> two

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
of being a very good bed so at under two
