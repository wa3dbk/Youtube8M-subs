 Cooking chicken liver pate with 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.320
 vegetables cream and pistachios onions 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.540
 chop arbitrarily because after 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.840
 roasting it will scroll through 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.840
 meat grinder 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.170
 carrots can also be cut but easier for me 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.170
 it just seems to be grated 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.059
 fry vegetables 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.500
 as soon as the vegetables are slightly browned i 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:50.390
 I will add the liver I have already parsed 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.390
 liver ready shopkin add liver 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.720
 so fry the liver to readiness and in the very 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:07.300
 late add salt and pepper and so liver 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.390
 almost ready it's time to add 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:15.700
 cream I add cream in order to 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.940
 the pate was gentle and that said 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.750
 the liver is in the liquid 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.750
 add salt 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.979
 now all this scroll through the meat grinder 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.880
 to enhance the taste of ready pate I 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.880
 be sure to add butter and 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.610
 while my butter is melting I'll grind pistachios 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.710
 for pate 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.160
 pistachios can be replaced by any other 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.160
 a nut 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.510
 chopping not finely so that they 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.510
 felt in the pate 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:26.900
 I spread the finished pate in the jar for 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.810
 further pasteurization and so pate 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.000
 ready if you want to use it 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.490
 today tomorrow or after tomorrow that is 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.650
 for five days then pasteurize it 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.860
 no need but if you want to cook 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.750
 it for longer storage 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.959
 pasteurization is needed today i will 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:49.810
 pasteurize your paste in aerogrill 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.670
 I put the pate in the convection oven 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.620
 I set the time 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:59.840
 20 minutes and temperatures of 150 degrees if 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.880
 you do not have aerogrill can cook 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.670
 in the traditional old way that is 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.340
 put the finished pate in the can 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.989
 boiling water and pasteurize it around 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.989
 15 minutes with the same time 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:20.870
 15 minutes passed the paste is ready carefully 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.600
 I take out a jar of pate and let it cool down 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.380
 then put it in the fridge and in that 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:30.040
 condition the paste can be stored up to 4 5 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.040
 month
