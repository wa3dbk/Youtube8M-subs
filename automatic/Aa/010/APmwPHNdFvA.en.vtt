essentially<00:01:59.660> the<00:02:00.200> smaller<00:02:00.500> kit<00:02:00.860> just<00:02:01.099> means

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
essentially the smaller kit just means

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.010 
essentially the smaller kit just means
less<00:02:01.910> of<00:02:02.149> a<00:02:02.330> range<00:02:02.660> of<00:02:03.009> tom<00:02:04.009> toms<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.729> play

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
less of a range of tom toms to play

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.199 
less of a range of tom toms to play
exactly<00:02:06.020> like<00:02:06.890> i<00:02:07.039> do<00:02:07.099> in<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.429> record<00:02:07.759> but<00:02:07.940> as

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
exactly like i do in the record but as

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.910 
exactly like i do in the record but as
long<00:02:08.420> as<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.599> hear<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:08.810> high<00:02:09.020> drum<00:02:09.319> or<00:02:09.679> middle

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
long as you hear a high drum or middle

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.150 
long as you hear a high drum or middle
drum<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.340> low<00:02:10.489> drum<00:02:10.819> it<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.810> works<00:02:12.349> so<00:02:13.069> I'm

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
drum and a low drum it it works so I'm

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.970 
drum and a low drum it it works so I'm
cool<00:02:13.400> with<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:14.260> back<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.410> dream<00:02:15.620> tears<00:02:15.800> are

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
cool with it back to dream tears are

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.309 
cool with it back to dream tears are
real<00:02:16.099> quick<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.550> this<00:02:17.060> was<00:02:17.209> your<00:02:17.330> second<00:02:18.050> tour

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
real quick and this was your second tour

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.290 
real quick and this was your second tour
I<00:02:18.349> think<00:02:18.650> written

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
I think written

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.940 
I think written
was<00:02:20.930> there<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.110> difference<00:02:21.440> compared<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.890> the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
was there a difference compared to the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.090 
was there a difference compared to the
first<00:02:22.070> time<00:02:22.340> around<00:02:22.840> there<00:02:23.840> was<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.100> huge

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
first time around there was a huge

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.980 
first time around there was a huge
difference<00:02:25.460> from<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.180> second<00:02:26.600> tour<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.810> the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
difference from the second tour of the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.720 
difference from the second tour of the
first<00:02:27.200> tour<00:02:27.440> because<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.010> first<00:02:28.160> tour<00:02:28.490> I

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
first tour because in the first tour I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.080 
first tour because in the first tour I
pretty<00:02:29.420> much<00:02:29.540> was<00:02:30.350> afraid<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.220> veer<00:02:31.670> away<00:02:31.850> from

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
pretty much was afraid to veer away from

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.800 
pretty much was afraid to veer away from
the<00:02:32.870> previous<00:02:33.460> existing<00:02:34.460> drum<00:02:34.730> parts<00:02:35.120> you

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
the previous existing drum parts you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.910 
the previous existing drum parts you
know<00:02:35.930> because<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.170> didn't<00:02:36.380> want<00:02:36.440> people<00:02:36.830> to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
know because I didn't want people to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.010 
know because I didn't want people to
think<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.640> didn't<00:02:38.030> respect<00:02:38.390> it<00:02:38.630> or<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:38.960> I

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
think that I didn't respect it or that I

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.020 
think that I didn't respect it or that I
couldn't<00:02:39.380> play<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.770> or<00:02:39.950> whatever<00:02:40.670> they<00:02:40.970> think

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
couldn't play it or whatever they think

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.660 
couldn't play it or whatever they think
they<00:02:41.360> always<00:02:41.690> think<00:02:41.870> something<00:02:42.350> so<00:02:43.040> i<00:02:43.340> just

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
they always think something so i just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.540 
they always think something so i just
wanted<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.030> honor<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.660> parts<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.920> just

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
wanted to honor the parts and I just

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.910 
wanted to honor the parts and I just
sort<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.850> went<00:02:46.970> with<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.300> flow<00:02:47.450> on<00:02:47.870> this<00:02:48.620> last

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
sort of went with the flow on this last

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.790 
sort of went with the flow on this last
tour<00:02:49.310> I<00:02:49.700> was<00:02:50.060> able<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.450> play<00:02:50.600> songs<00:02:51.020> that<00:02:51.590> were

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800

I<00:02:51.860> constructed<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.700> drum<00:02:52.910> parts<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.330> little

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
I constructed the drum parts a little

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.650 
I constructed the drum parts a little
bit<00:02:53.720> more<00:02:53.990> as<00:02:54.380> far<00:02:55.040> as<00:02:55.070> in<00:02:55.340> even<00:02:56.180> contributing

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
bit more as far as in even contributing

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.050 
bit more as far as in even contributing
to<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.870> composition<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.740> song<00:02:57.950> itself<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:59.030> I

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
to the composition the song itself so I

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.720 
to the composition the song itself so I
had<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.360> little<00:02:59.570> more<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.890> was<00:03:01.040> easier<00:03:01.370> for<00:03:01.430> me

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
had a little more it was easier for me

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.610 
had a little more it was easier for me
you<00:03:02.480> know<00:03:02.540> because<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:02.870> was<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:03.050> part<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.500> from

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
you know because I was a part of it from

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.970 
you know because I was a part of it from
the<00:03:03.710> beginning<00:03:04.630> also<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.930> wasn't<00:03:06.620> afraid<00:03:06.830> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
the beginning also I wasn't afraid to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.940 
the beginning also I wasn't afraid to
change<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:08.480> pre-existing<00:03:09.200> drum<00:03:09.440> parts<00:03:09.800> from

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
all the records that Mike did we did a

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.060 
all the records that Mike did we did a
DVD<00:03:13.370> call<00:03:13.640> breaking<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.150> fourth<00:03:14.390> wall<00:03:14.450> I

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
DVD call breaking the fourth wall I

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.160 
DVD call breaking the fourth wall I
pretty<00:03:16.070> much<00:03:16.250> stuck<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.150> older<00:03:17.570> parts<00:03:17.960> for

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
pretty much stuck to the older parts for

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.170 
pretty much stuck to the older parts for
that<00:03:18.200> for<00:03:18.800> whatever<00:03:18.980> reason<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:19.580> chose<00:03:19.790> to<00:03:20.000> do<00:03:20.150> I

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
that for whatever reason I chose to do I

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.870 
that for whatever reason I chose to do I
just<00:03:20.480> that's<00:03:20.990> what<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.230> did<00:03:21.560> but<00:03:22.430> after<00:03:22.610> that

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
just that's what I did but after that

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.990 
just that's what I did but after that
DVD<00:03:23.270> I<00:03:23.450> realized<00:03:24.110> I<00:03:24.350> should<00:03:24.680> be<00:03:24.920> really<00:03:25.580> going
