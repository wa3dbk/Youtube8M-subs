which was another Kickstarter that I did

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
which was another Kickstarter that I did
and<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.290> was<00:01:43.470> gonna<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.890> an<00:01:43.979> unboxing<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.109 
game but I just never found the time to
and<00:01:48.439> that's<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.619> deck<00:01:49.799> building<00:01:50.159> game<00:01:50.220> for

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
and that's a deck building game for

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.090 
and that's a deck building game for
people<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.479> are<00:01:51.600> familiar<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.990> that

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.920 

let's<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.280> if<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.850> open<00:01:57.180> quickly

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.630 

so<00:02:01.930> boss<00:02:02.140> sponsor<00:02:02.620> so<00:02:02.920> there's<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.250> 8-bit

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
so boss sponsor so there's the 8-bit

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:19.640 
so boss sponsor so there's the 8-bit
graphics<00:02:07.740> here's<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.830> back

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.009 

so<00:02:20.650> since<00:02:21.010> this<00:02:21.129> is<00:02:21.189> a<00:02:21.370> for<00:02:22.299> Kickstarter<00:02:22.870> I

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
so since this is a for Kickstarter I

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.929 
so since this is a for Kickstarter I
think<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.349> comes<00:02:23.500> with<00:02:23.709> some<00:02:23.890> extras<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.760> you

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 
think it comes with some extras that you

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.399 
think it comes with some extras that you
normally<00:02:25.090> wouldn't<00:02:25.510> get<00:02:25.750> if<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.049> have<00:02:26.200> bought

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
normally wouldn't get if you have bought

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:32.280 
normally wouldn't get if you have bought
it<00:02:26.560> in<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.739> store<00:02:27.540> instruction<00:02:28.540> manual<00:02:31.290> so

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
it in the store instruction manual so

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.089 
it in the store instruction manual so
like<00:02:32.650> these<00:02:32.829> these<00:02:33.159> are<00:02:33.340> like<00:02:33.459> metal<00:02:33.909> tokens

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
like these these are like metal tokens

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.880
