and help you this situation is very
simple<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:23.090> syncadapter<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.480> faucet

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
simple we have syncadapter the faucet

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.660 
simple we have syncadapter the faucet
will<00:00:25.560> get<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> bag<00:00:26.160> plus<00:00:26.490> another

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
will get it in the bag plus another

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.810 
will get it in the bag plus another
adapter<00:00:27.240> here<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.570> case<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.869> doesn't<00:00:28.550> fit<00:00:29.550> over

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
adapter here in case it doesn't fit over

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.150 
adapter here in case it doesn't fit over
your<00:00:29.939> extended<00:00:30.109> faucet<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> wall

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
your extended faucet so all the wall

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.560 
your extended faucet so all the wall
mount<00:00:32.369> brackets<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.000> could<00:00:33.149> touch<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
mount brackets we could touch it to the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.490 
mount brackets we could touch it to the
wall<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:35.329> then<00:00:36.329> get<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> hose<00:00:36.960> which<00:00:37.290> means--

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
wall and then get the hose which means--

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.819 
wall and then get the hose which means--
have<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.770> cut<00:00:37.950> into<00:00:38.190> depending<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:39.620> which<00:00:40.620> hose

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
have to cut into depending on which hose

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.700 
have to cut into depending on which hose
you<00:00:41.010> get<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.600> very<00:00:42.809> long<00:00:43.020> scattered<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
you get so it's very long scattered to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.880 
you get so it's very long scattered to
and<00:00:44.010> connected<00:00:44.460> underneath<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> machine<00:00:45.890> the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.880 
tube in boiling water for about 3-4
minutes<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:59.250> try<00:00:59.789> reinserting<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
minutes you can try reinserting the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.760 
minutes you can try reinserting the
ripple<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> back<00:01:04.189> question<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
ripple and in the back question is the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.550 
ripple and in the back question is the
internal<00:01:07.770> filter<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.960> first<00:01:10.260> start<00:01:10.500> off

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
internal filter so you first start off

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.850 
internal filter so you first start off
fishing<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.100> need<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> adjust<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.700> filter<00:01:12.860> so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
fishing you need to adjust the filter so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.370 
fishing you need to adjust the filter so
make<00:01:14.460> sure<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> water<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.000> not<00:01:15.180> raining<00:01:16.250> push

make sure the water is not raining push

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.520 
make sure the water is not raining push
we'll<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.680> push<00:01:19.950> pure<00:01:20.610> water<00:01:21.259> for<00:01:22.259> about

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
we'll have to push pure water for about

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.340 
we'll have to push pure water for about
five<00:01:23.220> seconds<00:01:25.189> you'll<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.520> value<00:01:26.820> 60<00:01:27.350> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
five seconds you'll see the value 60 you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.160 
five seconds you'll see the value 60 you
do<00:01:28.619> pH<00:01:29.100> minus<00:01:30.110> 30<00:01:31.939> and<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.210> push<00:01:33.570> pure<00:01:33.990> water

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
do pH minus 30 and then push pure water

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.819 
do pH minus 30 and then push pure water
again<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.810> see<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> value<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.229> 6,000<00:01:37.740> liters

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829

so<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.630> RFU<00:02:59.020> is<00:02:59.440> getting<00:02:59.800> set<00:03:00.700> up<00:03:00.730> we'll<00:03:01.150> just

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
so the RFU is getting set up we'll just

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.820 
so the RFU is getting set up we'll just
check<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.660> appeal<00:03:01.900> shovel<00:03:03.600> but<00:03:05.010> 10.3<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:08.380> or

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
check the appeal shovel but 10.3 and or

devalue is me time I'll with a bit
more<00:03:17.800> about<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.010> machine

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.940 

so<00:03:22.650> basically<00:03:23.940> comes<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.030> lifetime<00:03:25.570> warranty

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
you got through acidic levels of pure

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.900 
you got through acidic levels of pure
water<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.600> for<00:03:29.250> buckling<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:32.790> have<00:03:33.790> any
