and then take a low dribble because on

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.549 
and then take a low dribble because on
that<00:01:02.390> particular<00:01:03.390> play<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.960> defender<00:01:04.409> was

splitter who's at all players so by

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.310 
splitter who's at all players so by
keeping<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.360> low<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> helped<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:06.930> protect<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.810 
keeping it low it helped and protect the
ball<00:01:07.500> then<00:01:07.950> you're<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> take<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> mini

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
ball then you're going to take a mini

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.980 
ball then you're going to take a mini
Euro<00:01:09.119> step<00:01:09.330> you're<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.810> step

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
Euro step you're going to kind of step

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.960
