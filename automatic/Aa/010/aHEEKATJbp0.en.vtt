00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
it's just going to take me probably

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.210 
it's just going to take me probably
another<00:02:18.970> day<00:02:19.210> before<00:02:20.160> everything<00:02:21.160> is

another day before everything is

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.840 
another day before everything is
properly<00:02:21.400> set<00:02:21.700> up<00:02:23.310> alright<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.460> last<00:02:24.490> thing

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
properly set up alright the last thing

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.090 
properly set up alright the last thing
is<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.300> how<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.600> use<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:25.870> world<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.830> when<00:02:27.010> you

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
is is how to use this world so when you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.180 
is is how to use this world so when you
spawn<00:02:27.370> nubiles<00:02:27.820> pawn<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.390> this<00:02:28.510> area<00:02:28.870> here

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
spawn nubiles pawn in this area here

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.920 
spawn nubiles pawn in this area here
obviously<00:02:30.190> read<00:02:30.670> all<00:02:30.940> signs<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.720> one<00:02:31.900> of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
obviously read all signs is that one of

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.350 
obviously read all signs is that one of
the<00:02:32.050> rule<00:02:32.230> sears<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.550> market<00:02:33.910> is<00:02:33.970> up<00:02:34.030> here

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the rule sears so the market is up here

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.640 
the rule sears so the market is up here
find<00:02:34.780> us<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.690> market<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.170> still<00:02:38.380> under

find us the market is still under

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.840 
find us the market is still under
construction<00:02:38.920> that's<00:02:39.370> probably<00:02:39.670> going<00:02:39.790> to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
construction that's probably going to

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.130 
construction that's probably going to
take<00:02:40.030> another<00:02:40.120> couple<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.600> weeks<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.960> finish
