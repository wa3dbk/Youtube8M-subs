they were trousers Pat likes and so

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.690 
they were trousers Pat likes and so
wearing<00:01:51.600> under<00:01:52.110> briefs<00:01:52.409> would<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.829> natural<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
wearing under briefs would be natural to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.850 
wearing under briefs would be natural to
protect<00:01:54.149> those<00:01:54.420> pants<00:01:55.049> those<00:01:55.259> pantaloons

protect those pants those pantaloons
from<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> dirt<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.939> body

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
from the dirt of the body

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510 
from the dirt of the body
however<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.590> women<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.040> was<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> different

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
however for women it was a different

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280 
however for women it was a different
silhouette<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.149> indeed<00:02:00.479> they<00:02:00.719> wore<00:02:00.960> wide

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
silhouette and indeed they wore wide

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.219 
silhouette and indeed they wore wide
skirts<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:02.670> was<00:02:02.790> nothing<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:03.570> close

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
skirts so there was nothing really close

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.210 
skirts so there was nothing really close
to<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> figure<00:02:05.149> women<00:02:06.560> briefs<00:02:07.560> originally
