so<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.650> probably<00:00:02.340> actually<00:00:02.639> should<00:00:02.790> have

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
so this probably actually should have

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.039 
so this probably actually should have
been<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.210> first<00:00:03.720> video<00:00:04.230> in<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.589> series<00:00:04.620> but<00:00:05.339> I

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
been the first video in the series but I

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.690 
been the first video in the series but I
neglected<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.109> do<00:00:07.290> it<00:00:07.440> one<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.309> items<00:00:08.460> that

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
neglected to do it one of the items that

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.930 
neglected to do it one of the items that
also<00:00:09.300> typically<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.050> change<00:00:10.530> after<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> default

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
also typically I change after a default

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
processes or settings for OS X so I'm

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.080

item we will actually change a few

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.630 
item we will actually change a few
things<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.529> first<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.460> actually

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
things the first one is I actually

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.440 
things the first one is I actually
change<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:31.369> will<00:00:32.369> turn<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
change it so that I will turn on the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.049 
change it so that I will turn on the
requirement<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.350> when<00:00:34.590> I'm<00:00:34.770> logging<00:00:35.730> out<00:00:36.030> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
requirement that when I'm logging out of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.610 
requirement that when I'm logging out of
the<00:00:36.329> screensaver<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.020> need<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> type<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the screensaver I do need to type in a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.190 
the screensaver I do need to type in a
password<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:38.190> do<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.820> only<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:39.570> laptop<00:00:39.809> I

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
password I do this only for my laptop I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
password I do this only for my laptop I
don't<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> desktop<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
don't do it for the desktop but the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.940 
don't do it for the desktop but the
reason<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> laptop<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> travel

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
reason I do it in the laptop is I travel

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310 
reason I do it in the laptop is I travel
fairly<00:00:44.760> frequently<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.510> want<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
fairly frequently so I do want the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.700 
fairly frequently so I do want the
requirement<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.670> screensaver<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
requirement that the screensaver is

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.520 
requirement that the screensaver is
actually<00:00:49.710> sort<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.370> secure<00:00:51.110> break<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.410> me

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
actually sort of a secure break for me

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.290 
actually sort of a secure break for me
one<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> other<00:00:53.610> things<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.149> will

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
one of the other things that this will

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.920 
one of the other things that this will
actually<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.899> by<00:00:55.680> default<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.309> will<00:00:56.600> ask<00:00:57.600> me

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
actually do is by default it will ask me

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.889 
actually do is by default it will ask me
to<00:00:58.079> turn<00:00:58.410> off<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.070> automatic<00:00:59.219> login<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.660> this

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
to turn off the automatic login so this

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.020 
to turn off the automatic login so this
is<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.800> only<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:02.340> user<00:01:02.520> account<00:01:02.910> it's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
is if I only have one user account it's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.429 
is if I only have one user account it's
automatically<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> log<00:01:03.809> me<00:01:04.019> into<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
automatically going to log me into that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.170 
automatically going to log me into that
account<00:01:04.739> without<00:01:04.860> requiring<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.549> password<00:01:05.729> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
account without requiring a password I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
account without requiring a password I
don't<00:01:07.049> want<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> laptop

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
don't want to have that for the laptop

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.039 
don't want to have that for the laptop
either<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.030> actually<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.510> desktop<00:01:09.930> I

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
either and actually for the desktop I

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.620 
either and actually for the desktop I
also<00:01:10.200> require<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> password<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.970> login<00:01:12.299> so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
also require a password on login so

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.440 
also require a password on login so
we'll<00:01:12.750> go<00:01:12.840> ahead<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.080> turn<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:15.360> now

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
we'll go ahead and turn this on for now

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.410 
we'll go ahead and turn this on for now
and<00:01:15.720> as<00:01:15.990> well<00:01:16.200> actually<00:01:17.100> take<00:01:18.030> an<00:01:18.180> apples

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and as well actually take an apples

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.060 
and as well actually take an apples
reppin<00:01:18.720> recommendation<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.409> turn<00:01:19.619> off<00:01:19.890> the

automatic login the automatic login
option<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.710> actually<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.310> by<00:01:23.850> itself<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.990> you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
option is actually here by itself so you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.499 
option is actually here by itself so you
can<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:27.060> are<00:01:27.180> some

can do that the there are some

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.870 
can do that the there are some

control<00:01:52.380> with<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.729> computer<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.270> don't

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
control with the computer I don't

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.550 
control with the computer I don't
actually<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.869> here<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.170> me<00:01:55.350> at<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
actually have it here with me at the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.350 
actually have it here with me at the
moment<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.070> not<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.640> but

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
moment so I'm not going to do that but

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.450 
moment so I'm not going to do that but
the<00:01:57.420> pairing<00:01:57.630> process<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:58.110> fairly<00:01:58.320> simple<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the pairing process is fairly simple you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.340 
the pairing process is fairly simple you
just<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.790> hold<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.750> hit<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> two

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
just have to hold it and hit the two

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.770 
just have to hold it and hit the two
buttons<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.399> will<00:02:02.549> actually<00:02:02.850> pair<00:02:03.509> up

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
buttons and that will actually pair up

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.289 
buttons and that will actually pair up
the<00:02:04.229> remote<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.219> only<00:02:05.369> your<00:02:05.790> remote<00:02:06.149> will

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
the remote so that only your remote will

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.399 
the remote so that only your remote will
work<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.659> computer<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.110> others

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
work with the computer so that others

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.589 
work with the computer so that others
don't<00:02:07.770> actually<00:02:08.280> use<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.759> there<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.390> some

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
don't actually use it there are some

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.969 
don't actually use it there are some
other<00:02:09.780> settings<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.349> are<00:02:10.500> available<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.950> us

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
other settings that are available to us

the firewall settings I do leave by

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
that this is too much of a risk

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.280 
that this is too much of a risk

that<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.480> typically<00:02:30.900> don't<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.890> is<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.730> use<00:02:32.850> File

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150

Vault another reason I don't use
FileVault<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.430> time<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.910> because<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
FileVault this time is because of the

FileVault this time is because of the

primary account very frequently so I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.590 
primary account very frequently so I
don't<00:02:52.530> use<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.340> built-in<00:02:53.670> file<00:02:53.970> vault

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
don't use the built-in file vault

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.570 
don't use the built-in file vault
I<00:02:54.630> use<00:02:55.140> TrueCrypt<00:02:55.740> as<00:02:55.890> an<00:02:56.040> alternate<00:02:56.460> method

I use TrueCrypt as an alternate method

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.540 
I use TrueCrypt as an alternate method
which<00:02:57.420> we'll<00:02:57.630> go<00:02:57.750> over<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.260> later<00:02:58.440> video<00:02:58.650> for

which we'll go over in a later video for
documents<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.060> feel<00:03:00.240> need<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.570> really

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
documents I feel need to be really

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.480 
documents I feel need to be really
secured<00:03:01.320> or<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.250> can<00:03:03.030> also<00:03:03.180> use<00:03:03.530> GPG<00:03:04.530> or<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.980> PGP

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
secured or I can also use GPG or the PGP

secured or I can also use GPG or the PGP
alternative<00:03:06.120> which<00:03:06.270> we'll<00:03:06.450> go<00:03:06.570> over<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:07.200> the

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470

mail section of videos at a later date

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.660 
mail section of videos at a later date
so<00:03:09.590> those<00:03:10.590> are<00:03:10.710> the<00:03:10.800> security<00:03:11.160> items<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.640> I

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
so those are the security items that I

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.700 
so those are the security items that I
do<00:03:11.760> change<00:03:12.180> by<00:03:12.390> default<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.350> may<00:03:13.470> want<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
do change by default you may want to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.040 
do change by default you may want to
tweak<00:03:13.980> your<00:03:14.280> screen<00:03:14.940> saving<00:03:15.360> settings<00:03:15.630> once

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
tweak your screen saving settings once

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.440 
tweak your screen saving settings once
you<00:03:16.200> set<00:03:16.440> these<00:03:16.650> that's<00:03:17.430> obviously<00:03:18.180> available

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
you set these that's obviously available

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.030 
you set these that's obviously available
under<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.930> desktop<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.440> screen<00:03:19.560> savers

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
under the desktop and screen savers

under the desktop and screen savers
sections<00:03:20.630> under<00:03:21.630> screen<00:03:21.959> saver<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:23.100> can

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
sections under screen saver you can

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.479 
sections under screen saver you can
select<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> time<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.110> will<00:03:25.230> start<00:03:25.530> and

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
select the time that it will start and

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.070 
select the time that it will start and
so<00:03:26.670> for<00:03:26.880> me<00:03:27.000> because<00:03:27.270> I<00:03:27.390> do<00:03:27.450> use<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.780> as<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.930> sort

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
so for me because I do use it as a sort

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.510 
so for me because I do use it as a sort
of<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.200> security<00:03:28.380> thing<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.830> will<00:03:29.040> bring<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.370> down

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
of a security thing I will bring it down

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.979 
of a security thing I will bring it down
to<00:03:29.700> five<00:03:29.970> minutes<00:03:30.330> so<00:03:30.420> that<00:03:30.540> my<00:03:30.630> screen<00:03:30.840> saver

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
to five minutes so that my screen saver

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.620 
to five minutes so that my screen saver
will<00:03:31.260> start<00:03:31.730> within<00:03:32.730> five<00:03:33.000> minutes<00:03:33.209> of

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
will start within five minutes of

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.840 
will start within five minutes of
inactivity<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.220> also<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.700> have<00:03:35.790> the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
inactivity and I also like to have the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.190 
inactivity and I also like to have the
clock<00:03:36.030> show<00:03:36.239> on<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.420> screensaver<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:37.020> I<00:03:37.050> can

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
clock show on the screensaver so I can

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.620 
clock show on the screensaver so I can
change<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.530> setting<00:03:37.860> right<00:03:37.950> here<00:03:38.510> we'll<00:03:39.510> go

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
change that setting right here we'll go

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.150 
change that setting right here we'll go
over<00:03:39.720> hot<00:03:39.930> corners<00:03:40.260> during<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.709> expose

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
over hot corners during the expose

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.890 
over hot corners during the expose
settings<00:03:41.550> later<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:42.450> right<00:03:42.570> now<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.720> don't

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
settings later for right now I don't

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.020 
settings later for right now I don't
have<00:03:43.200> them<00:03:43.410> set<00:03:43.680> up<00:03:43.800> but<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:44.520> typically<00:03:44.880> do

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
have them set up but I typically do

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.550 
have them set up but I typically do
assign<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.330> hot<00:03:45.720> corner<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.200> start<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
assign a hot corner to start the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.040 
assign a hot corner to start the
screensaver<00:03:46.890> right<00:03:47.370> away<00:03:47.640> so<00:03:48.630> we'll<00:03:48.780> go<00:03:48.930> over

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
screensaver right away so we'll go over

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.750 
screensaver right away so we'll go over
that<00:03:49.260> at<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.440> later<00:03:49.620> date<00:03:49.830> that's<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.489> for<00:03:50.670> this

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
that at a later date that's it for this

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.910 
that at a later date that's it for this
one
