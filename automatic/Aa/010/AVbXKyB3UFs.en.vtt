in a different way and do it differently

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.580 
in a different way and do it differently
than<00:00:22.880> a<00:00:22.970> girl<00:00:23.180> there<00:00:23.450> are<00:00:23.660> going<00:00:24.020> to<00:00:24.140> be<00:00:24.260> some

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
than a girl there are going to be some

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.380 
than a girl there are going to be some
similarities<00:00:24.860> but<00:00:25.790> there's<00:00:25.940> also<00:00:26.060> going<00:00:26.330> to

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
similarities but there's also going to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.170 
similarities but there's also going to
be<00:00:26.510> some<00:00:26.720> very<00:00:26.960> distinct<00:00:27.530> differences<00:00:28.250> if<00:00:28.550> you

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
be some very distinct differences if you

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.140 
be some very distinct differences if you
feel<00:00:29.630> like<00:00:30.140> SRS<00:00:30.680> is<00:00:30.920> going<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.250> solve<00:00:31.610> all<00:00:32.090> your

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
feel like SRS is going to solve all your

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.870 
feel like SRS is going to solve all your
problems<00:00:32.980> that's<00:00:33.980> gonna<00:00:34.220> be<00:00:34.400> a<00:00:34.430> big<00:00:34.640> problem

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
problems that's gonna be a big problem

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.870 
problems that's gonna be a big problem
because<00:00:35.630> it's<00:00:35.960> not<00:00:36.290> going<00:00:36.650> to<00:00:36.920> solve<00:00:37.640> them

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
because it's not going to solve them

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.500 
because it's not going to solve them
sorry

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
sorry

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.280 
sorry
in<00:00:38.810> fact<00:00:39.050> GID<00:00:39.650> is<00:00:40.250> known<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.180> stay<00:00:41.420> even<00:00:41.780> after

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
in fact GID is known to stay even after

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.979 
in fact GID is known to stay even after
the<00:00:42.590> surgery<00:00:43.070> that<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:43.700> only<00:00:43.880> gets<00:00:44.450> rid<00:00:44.750> of<00:00:44.840> it

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
the surgery that it only gets rid of it

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.510 
the surgery that it only gets rid of it
a<00:00:45.020> certain<00:00:45.410> amount<00:00:45.560> it's<00:00:45.739> not<00:00:45.920> as<00:00:46.040> if<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.340> can

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
a certain amount it's not as if you can

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.740 
a certain amount it's not as if you can
go<00:00:46.670> through<00:00:46.880> the<00:00:46.970> surgery<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:47.510> it's<00:00:47.630> an

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
go through the surgery and it's an

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.639 
go through the surgery and it's an
absolute<00:00:48.410> like<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.340> get<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.060> surgery<00:00:50.450> and

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
absolute like you get the surgery and

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.100 
absolute like you get the surgery and
100%<00:00:51.649> of<00:00:51.770> your<00:00:51.860> GID<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:52.670> gone<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.809> know<00:00:53.930> and

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
100% of your GID is gone you know and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.470 
100% of your GID is gone you know and
I'm<00:00:54.649> sure<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:55.040> there's<00:00:55.460> probably<00:00:55.850> one<00:00:56.210> in<00:00:56.239> a

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
I'm sure that there's probably one in a

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.540 
I'm sure that there's probably one in a
thousand<00:00:56.989> lottery<00:00:57.590> winning<00:00:57.950> girls<00:00:58.250> that

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
thousand lottery winning girls that

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.970 
thousand lottery winning girls that
maybe<00:00:59.090> that's<00:00:59.360> what<00:00:59.630> it<00:00:59.750> does<00:00:59.989> for<00:01:00.290> them<00:01:00.410> but

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
maybe that's what it does for them but

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.680 
maybe that's what it does for them but
it<00:01:01.100> doesn't<00:01:01.430> work<00:01:01.579> like<00:01:01.760> that<00:01:01.820> for<00:01:02.000> everybody

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
it doesn't work like that for everybody

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.660 
it doesn't work like that for everybody
because<00:01:03.020> that's<00:01:03.290> not<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.800> world<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.339> the

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
because that's not the world and the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.760 
because that's not the world and the
reality<00:01:05.089> that<00:01:05.120> we<00:01:05.360> live<00:01:05.600> in<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.409> you<00:01:06.500> have<00:01:06.650> to

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
reality that we live in so you have to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.130 
reality that we live in so you have to
confront<00:01:07.159> that<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.700> consider<00:01:08.600> it<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:08.990> make

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
confront that and consider it and make

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.070 
confront that and consider it and make
sure<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.680> are<00:01:09.860> realistic<00:01:10.460> about<00:01:10.670> it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
sure that you are realistic about it

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.920 
sure that you are realistic about it
so<00:01:12.080> GID<00:01:12.860> will<00:01:13.220> remain<00:01:13.640> because<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.420> can't<00:01:14.690> give

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
so GID will remain because it can't give

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.140 
so GID will remain because it can't give
you<00:01:15.080> whim<00:01:15.380> because<00:01:15.799> it<00:01:16.130> can't<00:01:16.400> carry<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.850> child

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
you whim because it can't carry a child

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.050 
you whim because it can't carry a child
child<00:01:17.330> because<00:01:18.229> it<00:01:18.350> can't<00:01:18.650> go<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:19.490> function

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
child because it can't go in function

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.359 
child because it can't go in function
identical<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.170> woman<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.860> can<00:01:22.070> feel

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
identical to a woman and you can feel

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.880 
identical to a woman and you can feel
you<00:01:22.880> can<00:01:22.909> still<00:01:23.270> after<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.720> surgery<00:01:24.170> feel

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
you can still after the surgery feel

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.310 
you can still after the surgery feel
those<00:01:25.310> limitations<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.390> understand<00:01:27.200> that

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
those limitations and understand that
