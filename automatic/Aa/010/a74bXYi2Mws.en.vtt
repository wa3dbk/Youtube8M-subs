00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.950
 If it makes noise, I'll kill you 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.360
 it can not be 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.360
 that will add 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 my name is janet water I do not speak with another 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.460
 human for two years 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.440
 this is the beginning of a story of 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.440
 love 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.460
 and it has nothing special except a 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.989
 detail we are not in the future and the 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.989
 humanity is almost extinct 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.120
 another species has invaded us 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.410
 that erases our mind to steal the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.020
 body 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.800
 but we still have some and 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.800
 we plant face 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.690
 but no no 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.690
 come with us shit 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.409
 almost all the broken bones and the 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.409
 bursting organs 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.400
 it seems he wants to live 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.280
 you have to get used to the bodies 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.640
 humans are not like the others we have 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.090
 inhabited 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.189
 Your emotions are strong 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.640
 if your will has survived along with 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.590
 your memories 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.590
 could resist this center 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.820
 it's not your hand 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.310
 and we will stop being human 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.960
 I miss everything about her doing what 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.600
 make it come back 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.900
 I have to know I would do it you are there 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.900
 inside
