00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.520
 votes studies but good seeing that 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 arrived on Friday they did not say anything today 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.320
 basically on weekends not to be 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.599
 make it something important for a 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.929
 altercation or something like that is not better 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.420
 do it well then it turns out they talked 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.430
 enough things this week 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.450
 basically interesting things the truth 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.920
 quite interesting that we were not 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.330
 what I said four months ago for 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.920
 back in December, November the theme of 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.080
 texture packs leads to programs 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.200
 conventions the first thing that good said 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.740
 what 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.050
 what about the youtubers of the people of 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.610
 youtube from the united kingdom of usa and more 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.490
 I was preparing a special or 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.930
 something like that and between all of them for 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.880
 On May 9, the first 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.400
 anniversary of minecraft and by live or 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.460
 be it on May 9 a year ago that they go that 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.390
 necessary for xbox 360 and then so 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.560
 they were going to prepare some flames and 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.990
 good and they started then 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.990
 ask if without four eyes studies 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.190
 Well, I was also going to prepare something, 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.050
 special and they said yes but I do not know 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.710
 they animate so it was worth it that on 9 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.510
 May mate a surprise but no no 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.300
 we will know what 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.880
 and then people started to 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.190
 ask why they had previously 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.810
 asked about the texture packs and 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.430
 they said that the pacts and textures already 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.970
 is it so 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.340
 ie almost 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.690
 let's say they are in development so 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.430
 say it because he says they have all the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.990
 team support to make the bread of 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.000
 texture but can not say anything else or 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.930
 I would dare to say that 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.910
 maybe 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.310
 for summer so we will have part of 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.320
 textures that did say that for 9 of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.870
 may not be part of texture the 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.880
 surprise is that there is a surprise on 9 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.770
 May so we'll see what it is but for 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.899
 textures will not do have said that the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.270
 parts and textures have all the support 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.040
 so to say that they are in let's say it 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.580
 doing it but they can not say anything 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.590
 closer to those of the packs of 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.570
 textures is also good after 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.930
 they talked about the 103 session and others 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.520
 surely they are going to correct the books 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.290
 that there is dynamite right now and 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.959
 all that have already corrected us 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.600
 they said if you are going to do an update 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.540
 in the correction plan of books or 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.810
 or a normal update that is with 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.520
 Novelty things and bug fixes today 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.630
 it's going to be just with google networks 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.200
 they did not specify very well what what 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.180
 what I was going to do is worth then 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.270
 recap we have the 9th day there is no 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.650
 a surprise that you do not know what 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.460
 it can be 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.310
 but 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.890
 well I would dare to say that I do not know 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.010
 maybe something new an update 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.930
 again no idea the truth an impact is not 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.730
 You know why they also said some of the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.160
 of the skis for I think it was that 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.630
 they were working for the next 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.540
 already skin version for something that would be 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.860
 the skin park we took room 54 I do not know 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.650
 what or what would be but good here and zone 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.480
 working on them so for a 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.130
 part we have part of textures that do not 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.980
 we know when it will only be said 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.930
 that yes it is confirmed that they are 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.420
 working on textures packs worth 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.860
 the skin so it is also confirmed that 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.670
 they are working on it and we have 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.520
 surprise on May 9 so it can be 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.330
 that surprise well no we do not know 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.710
 the truth see what it is I do not know is not 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.970
 that no one has the slightest idea they have 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.850
 asked but they said they are not going to 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.490
 say nothing that we will know on 9 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.050
 May and the truth is that we are good 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.930
 pretty me at least I'm pretty 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.210
 anxious to know and is that the truth that 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.960
 well the surprises of them tend to be 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.550
 Pretty good 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.140
 you have to remember the surprise 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.160
 Christmas we have an update 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.180
 without anyone expecting the truth and 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.190
 they worked hard to carry it out 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.450
 so well I do not know how to leave in the 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.970
 comments that you start 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.040
 you want me to be personally I do not know 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.410
 is that they do not see I do not know what can be 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.760
 I would have preferred the truth that they were 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.380
 the textures pack but already at 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.680
 confirm that the files will not be 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.020
 of textures because I just do not know 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.030
 think that it will be I do not know also the 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.670
 servers that 24 hours would come 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.080
 pretty good if you do not know that after 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.690
 through the channel and a video that follows 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.310
 explaining it in the end there are many things that 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.680
 I would like it to be but the truth is not 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.360
 I have not the faintest idea that you can 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.040
 be but good nothing was basically for 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.900
 report these things I hope that you 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.460
 I liked it and not leave the 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.090
 comments that you think you make 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.320
 put or something similar is nothing I hope that 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.610
 you liked the video a greeting to 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.610
 all and until next time
