got shoot him in the head to make sure
he<00:00:54.180> doesn't<00:00:54.329> come<00:00:54.570> back<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> zombie<00:00:55.230> because

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
he doesn't come back as a zombie because

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.700 
he doesn't come back as a zombie because
we'd<00:00:56.190> hate<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> see<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.699> happen<00:00:57.530> but<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
we'd hate to see that happen but it's a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.680 
we'd hate to see that happen but it's a
very<00:00:58.739> interesting<00:00:59.460> weapon<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.420> like

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
very interesting weapon I really do like

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.170 
very interesting weapon I really do like
the<00:01:00.960> Rex<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.469> think<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.399> really<00:01:02.940> really

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the Rex I think that it's really really

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.850 
the Rex I think that it's really really
good<00:01:03.210> up<00:01:03.480> close<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.470> kind<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
good up close I think that it kind of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
good up close I think that it kind of
rivals<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> Magnum<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:06.000> close<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.869> only

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
rivals the Magnum up close the only

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
rivals the Magnum up close the only
problem<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> Rex<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.400> very<00:01:08.850> limited

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
problem is as the Rex is very limited

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.420 
problem is as the Rex is very limited
you<00:01:09.930> can't<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.560> those<00:01:10.799> long-range

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you can't really do those long-range

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
you can't really do those long-range
Snipes<00:01:11.760> because<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.570> minimum<00:01:12.930> damage<00:01:13.140> on

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
Snipes because the minimum damage on

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
Snipes because the minimum damage on
this<00:01:13.530> thing<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.860> only<00:01:13.950> 28<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.700> max<00:01:14.939> damage<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
this thing is only 28 the max damage is

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.570 
this thing is only 28 the max damage is
50<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.990> keeps<00:01:16.439> 50<00:01:16.799> damage<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.280> until<00:01:17.549> I

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
50 and it keeps 50 damage up until I

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.940 
50 and it keeps 50 damage up until I
think<00:01:17.820> around<00:01:18.000> 15<00:01:18.509> meters<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.110> that's<00:01:19.680> pretty

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
think around 15 meters so that's pretty

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.100 
think around 15 meters so that's pretty
much<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.189> potential<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.420> one-shot<00:01:21.840> kill

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
much the potential of the one-shot kill

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.660 
much the potential of the one-shot kill
if<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.380> shoot<00:01:22.530> them<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.770> head<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.189> within

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
if you shoot them in the head so within

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.609 
if you shoot them in the head so within
15<00:01:24.119> meters<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
15 meters you have that you have a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.950 
15 meters you have that you have a
chance<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.180> smacking<00:01:27.180> them<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> dome<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
chance of smacking them in the dome and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
chance of smacking them in the dome and
getting<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.259> one-hit<00:01:28.590> kill<00:01:28.829> once<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.520> get

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
getting a one-hit kill once you get

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.280 
getting a one-hit kill once you get
outside<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.420> starts<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> drop<00:01:31.079> off

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
outside of that it starts to drop off

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.319 
outside of that it starts to drop off
pretty<00:01:31.530> quickly<00:01:31.890> once<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.850> get<00:01:33.000> down<00:01:33.119> into

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
pretty quickly once you get down into

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.810 
pretty quickly once you get down into
that<00:01:33.420> 28<00:01:34.200> damage<00:01:34.710> range<00:01:34.979> you're<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that 28 damage range you're not going to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.340 
that 28 damage range you're not going to
be<00:01:35.909> killing<00:01:36.240> people<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:36.750> quickly<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:37.200> all

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
be killing people very quickly at all

we're focusing on the 357 Magnum for
today<00:02:05.060> but<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.149> know<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> Rex<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.810> really

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
today but you know the Rex is really

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.900 
today but you know the Rex is really
good<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.649> finish<00:02:07.829> someone<00:02:08.250> off<00:02:08.369> because<00:02:08.580> 50

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
good to finish someone off because 50

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.699 
good to finish someone off because 50
damage<00:02:09.090> most<00:02:09.629> most<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.080> times<00:02:10.259> when<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.560> hit

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
damage most most of times when you hit

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.680 
damage most most of times when you hit
somebody<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.190> sniper<00:02:11.760> rifle<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.420> doing

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
somebody with a sniper rifle it's doing

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.940 
somebody with a sniper rifle it's doing
more<00:02:12.870> than<00:02:12.900> 50<00:02:13.319> damage<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.739> be

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
more than 50 damage to be

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.589 
more than 50 damage to be
was<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.520> Rex<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.910> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.209> finish<00:02:15.450> them

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
was so the Rex is going to finish them

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.510 
was so the Rex is going to finish them
off<00:02:15.690> no<00:02:15.840> matter<00:02:15.959> where<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.290> hit<00:02:16.560> them<00:02:16.650> but<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
off no matter where you hit them but the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.460 
off no matter where you hit them but the
Rex's<00:02:17.879> biggest<00:02:18.300> advantage<00:02:18.720> over<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.140> Magnum

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
Rex's biggest advantage over the Magnum

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.339 
Rex's biggest advantage over the Magnum
is<00:02:19.560> definitely<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.099> fire<00:02:20.280> rate<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.670> can<00:02:20.819> shoot

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
is definitely the fire rate it can shoot

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.809 
is definitely the fire rate it can shoot
255<00:02:22.349> rounds<00:02:22.800> per<00:02:22.890> minute<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.310> opposed<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
255 rounds per minute as opposed to the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.520 
255 rounds per minute as opposed to the
Magnum<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.540> only<00:02:24.629> shoot<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.900> hundred<00:02:25.410> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
Magnum it can only shoot a hundred and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.050 
Magnum it can only shoot a hundred and
sixty<00:02:25.920> rounds<00:02:26.069> for<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> minute<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.000> a

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
sixty rounds for a minute so it's a

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.699 
sixty rounds for a minute so it's a
pretty<00:02:27.300> big<00:02:27.510> bump<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.989> mean<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.349> can<00:02:28.470> fire<00:02:28.680> off

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
pretty big bump I mean you can fire off

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.710 
pretty big bump I mean you can fire off
a<00:02:28.890> lot<00:02:29.160> more<00:02:29.280> shots<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.879> quicker<00:02:30.120> time<00:02:30.450> here

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
a lot more shots in a quicker time here

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.690 
a lot more shots in a quicker time here
than<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.019> could<00:02:31.230> with<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.500> Magnum<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.069> yes<00:02:32.550> I

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
than you could with the Magnum and yes I

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.100 
than you could with the Magnum and yes I
know<00:02:32.760> they're<00:02:33.000> both<00:02:33.180> technically<00:02:33.660> magnums

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
know they're both technically magnums

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.870 
know they're both technically magnums
but<00:02:34.380> for<00:02:34.680> whatever<00:02:34.860> reason<00:02:35.040> battlefield<00:02:35.700> 3

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
but for whatever reason battlefield 3

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.309 
but for whatever reason battlefield 3
calls<00:02:36.090> at<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.300> 44<00:02:36.660> Magnum<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.170> we're<00:02:37.290> just

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
calls at the 44 Magnum so we're just

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.839 
calls at the 44 Magnum so we're just
going<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.560> refer<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:37.920> what<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.489> Rex<00:02:38.700> and

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
going to refer to what is the Rex and

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.880 
going to refer to what is the Rex and
one<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> Magnum<00:02:39.569> but<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> Rex<00:02:40.709> can

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
one is the Magnum but the Rex can

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.320 
one is the Magnum but the Rex can
outshoot<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.370> pretty<00:02:41.700> quickly<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.120> know<00:02:42.180> I've

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
outshoot it pretty quickly you know I've

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.780 
outshoot it pretty quickly you know I've
won<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> lot<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.930> battles<00:02:43.319> with<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.500> Rex<00:02:43.830> vs

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
won a lot of battles with the Rex vs

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.400 
won a lot of battles with the Rex vs
people<00:02:45.090> who've<00:02:45.239> had<00:02:45.420> their<00:02:45.629> magnums<00:02:46.049> out<00:02:46.200> so

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
people who've had their magnums out so

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.110 
people who've had their magnums out so
it<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.130> definitely<00:02:47.280> compete<00:02:47.640> with<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:47.970> I

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
it can definitely compete with that I

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.490 
it can definitely compete with that I
don't<00:02:48.330> think<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.630> fact<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.049> has<00:02:49.200> lower

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
don't think the fact that it has lower

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.039 
don't think the fact that it has lower
damage<00:02:49.830> really<00:02:50.310> hinders<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.970> much<00:02:51.269> so<00:02:51.930> it

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
damage really hinders it that much so it

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.900 
damage really hinders it that much so it
really<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.410> good<00:02:52.680> alternative<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.400> 44

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
really is a good alternative to the 44

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.640 
really is a good alternative to the 44
if<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.060> don't<00:02:54.239> like<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> 44<00:02:54.989> slow<00:02:55.349> fire<00:02:55.620> rate

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
if you don't like the 44 slow fire rate

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.319 
if you don't like the 44 slow fire rate
you<00:02:55.980> know<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.190> kind<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.579> boom<00:02:56.849> boom<00:02:57.090> boom

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
you know the kind of a boom boom boom

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.420 
you know the kind of a boom boom boom
you<00:02:57.959> can<00:02:58.140> mix<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.440> up<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.680> try<00:02:58.890> out<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.190> Rex

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
you can mix it up and try out the Rex

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.339 
you can mix it up and try out the Rex
now<00:02:59.730> if<00:03:00.000> you're<00:03:00.239> looking<00:03:00.599> for<00:03:00.630> even<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:01.140> higher

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
now if you're looking for even a higher

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.800 
now if you're looking for even a higher
fire<00:03:01.680> rate<00:03:01.890> but<00:03:02.040> still<00:03:02.310> high<00:03:02.489> damage<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:03.150> lot<00:03:03.690> of

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
fire rate but still high damage a lot of

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.180 
fire rate but still high damage a lot of
people<00:03:03.930> tend<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.349> gravitate<00:03:04.530> towards<00:03:05.099> the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
people tend to gravitate towards the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.550 
people tend to gravitate towards the
1911<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.390> Rex<00:03:06.630> in<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.840> 1911<00:03:07.170> are

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
1911 and the Rex in the 1911 are

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.900 
1911 and the Rex in the 1911 are
actually<00:03:07.860> more<00:03:08.040> similar<00:03:08.459> than<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.640> lot<00:03:08.819> of

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
actually more similar than a lot of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:09.979 
actually more similar than a lot of
people<00:03:09.150> would<00:03:09.299> think<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.750> mean<00:03:09.900> you

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
people would think because I mean you

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.770 
people would think because I mean you
look<00:03:10.230> at<00:03:10.500> your<00:03:10.620> like<00:03:10.769> Oh<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> revolver<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:11.819> a

magazine fed weapon we can't really

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.520 
magazine fed weapon we can't really
compare<00:03:14.579> those<00:03:14.760> but<00:03:15.090> in<00:03:15.299> damage<00:03:15.989> model<00:03:16.290> terms

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
compare those but in damage model terms

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.270 
compare those but in damage model terms
you<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.430> see<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:18.090> progression<00:03:18.329> from<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.620> 44

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
you can see the progression from the 44

you can see the progression from the 44
Magnum<00:03:20.310> all<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.970> way<00:03:21.090> up<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.420> standard

Magnum all the way up to the standard
pistols<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.440> kind<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.709> have<00:03:22.859> those<00:03:23.040> weapons

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
pistols you kind of have those weapons

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.220 
pistols you kind of have those weapons
that<00:03:23.579> bridge<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.970> gap<00:03:24.180> you've<00:03:24.660> got<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.959> Rex

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
that bridge the gap you've got the Rex

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.440 
that bridge the gap you've got the Rex
which<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:26.010> doesn't<00:03:26.280> do<00:03:26.549> as<00:03:26.579> much<00:03:26.730> damage<00:03:26.940> this

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
which it doesn't do as much damage this

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.900 
which it doesn't do as much damage this
is<00:03:27.569> 44<00:03:28.079> but<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.620> shoots<00:03:28.799> faster<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.549> then

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
is 44 but it shoots faster and then

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.699 
is 44 but it shoots faster and then
you've<00:03:30.000> got<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.269> 1911<00:03:30.630> which<00:03:31.109> doesn't<00:03:31.500> do<00:03:31.590> as

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
you've got the 1911 which doesn't do as

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.559 
you've got the 1911 which doesn't do as
much<00:03:31.739> damage<00:03:31.950> as<00:03:32.459> their<00:03:32.639> ex<00:03:32.850> but<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.420> shoots

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
much damage as their ex but it shoots

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.599 
much damage as their ex but it shoots
faster<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.170> has<00:03:34.290> two<00:03:34.620> or<00:03:34.799> three<00:03:35.010> extra<00:03:35.310> rounds

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
faster and has two or three extra rounds

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:36.800 
faster and has two or three extra rounds
depending<00:03:35.970> on<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.209> know<00:03:36.269> if<00:03:36.389> you<00:03:36.480> have<00:03:36.569> one<00:03:36.780> in

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
depending on you know if you have one in

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.690 
depending on you know if you have one in
the<00:03:36.900> chamber<00:03:37.139> or<00:03:37.410> not<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:37.769> that's<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.400> pretty

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
the chamber or not so that's a pretty

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.849 
the chamber or not so that's a pretty
good<00:03:38.940> pretty<00:03:39.630> good<00:03:39.750> evolution<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.769> the

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
good pretty good evolution of the

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.830 
good pretty good evolution of the
pistols<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.310> really<00:03:41.700> like<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:41.970> battlefield<00:03:42.480> 3

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
pistols I really like that battlefield 3

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.849 
pistols I really like that battlefield 3
has<00:03:42.930> gotten<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.410> point<00:03:43.560> where<00:03:43.680> they

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
has gotten to the point where they

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.379 
has gotten to the point where they
tweaked<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.280> pistols<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.880> be<00:03:45.000> like<00:03:45.209> that

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
tweaked the pistols to be like that

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.479 
tweaked the pistols to be like that
because<00:03:45.569> before<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.620> lot<00:03:46.829> of<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.010> patches<00:03:47.370> we

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
because before a lot of the patches we

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.009 
because before a lot of the patches we
had<00:03:47.670> there<00:03:47.880> there<00:03:48.120> weren't<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.389> really<00:03:48.750> a<00:03:48.780> lot

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
had there there weren't a really a lot

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.720 
had there there weren't a really a lot
of<00:03:49.170> incentives<00:03:49.680> they<00:03:49.859> use<00:03:50.130> different<00:03:50.310> things

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
of incentives they use different things

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.420 
of incentives they use different things
so<00:03:51.000> i<00:03:51.239> think<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.049> rex<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.440> very<00:03:52.799> useable

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
so i think the rex is a very useable

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.830 
so i think the rex is a very useable
pistol<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.940> game<00:03:54.120> though<00:03:54.269> it's<00:03:54.569> perhaps

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
pistol in the game though it's perhaps

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.780 
pistol in the game though it's perhaps
one<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.440> best<00:03:55.709> ones<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.069> carry<00:03:56.400> if<00:03:56.579> you're

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
one of the best ones to carry if you're

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.970 
one of the best ones to carry if you're
a<00:03:56.819> sniper<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.750> my<00:03:57.900> logic<00:03:58.290> behind<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.709> is<00:03:58.950> a

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
a sniper and my logic behind that is a

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.890 
a sniper and my logic behind that is a
lot<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.250> people<00:03:59.519> would<00:03:59.639> say<00:03:59.790> Oh<00:03:59.819> 44<00:04:00.389> Magnum

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
lot of people would say Oh 44 Magnum

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.809 
lot of people would say Oh 44 Magnum
rules<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.349> day<00:04:01.500> but<00:04:01.769> this<00:04:02.160> can<00:04:02.400> fire<00:04:02.579> much

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
rules the day but this can fire much

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.160 
rules the day but this can fire much
faster<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.389> if<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.569> get<00:04:03.780> into<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.959> situation

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
faster so if you get into a situation

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.360 
faster so if you get into a situation
where<00:04:04.530> you're<00:04:04.709> up<00:04:04.859> close<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.160> know

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
where you're up close you know

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.920 
where you're up close you know
everyone's<00:04:05.880> up<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.269> your<00:04:06.420> face<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.660> all

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
everyone's up in your face and all

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.990 
everyone's up in your face and all
you've<00:04:07.109> got<00:04:07.139> is<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.410> bolt-action<00:04:07.799> sniper<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.549> lot

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
you've got is a bolt-action sniper a lot

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.550 
you've got is a bolt-action sniper a lot
of<00:04:09.120> times<00:04:09.329> if<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:09.569> get<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> hitmarker<00:04:10.019> or<00:04:10.470> you

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
of times if you get a hitmarker or you

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.720 
of times if you get a hitmarker or you
miss<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:10.980> want<00:04:11.160> something<00:04:11.430> that's<00:04:11.489> going<00:04:11.639> to

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
miss you want something that's going to

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.129 
miss you want something that's going to
be<00:04:11.819> able<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.090> shoot<00:04:12.209> off<00:04:12.389> a<00:04:12.419> couple<00:04:12.660> rounds<00:04:12.930> a

be able to shoot off a couple rounds a

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.990 
be able to shoot off a couple rounds a
lot<00:04:13.319> faster<00:04:13.500> before<00:04:13.889> their<00:04:14.250> automatic<00:04:14.579> weapon

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
lot faster before their automatic weapon

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.729 
lot faster before their automatic weapon
can<00:04:15.120> tear<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.450> up<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:16.289> the<00:04:16.410> fire<00:04:16.590> rate

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
can tear you up so the fire rate

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.529 
can tear you up so the fire rate
definitely<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.280> sizable<00:04:17.910> advantage<00:04:18.269> for

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
definitely is a sizable advantage for

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.629 
definitely is a sizable advantage for
the<00:04:18.720> Rex<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.200> think<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.739> really<00:04:19.769> makes<00:04:20.489> it

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
the Rex I think that it really makes it

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.310 
the Rex I think that it really makes it
an<00:04:20.729> awesome<00:04:21.269> finisher<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.900> I've<00:04:21.989> had<00:04:22.169> some

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
an awesome finisher and I've had some

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.920 
an awesome finisher and I've had some
really<00:04:22.349> cool<00:04:22.860> moments<00:04:23.400> here<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.570> game<00:04:24.780> in

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
really cool moments here in this game in

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.450 
really cool moments here in this game in
particular<00:04:25.380> where<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:25.590> get<00:04:25.800> more<00:04:26.010> people<00:04:26.340> than

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
particular where I get more people than

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.180 
particular where I get more people than
I<00:04:26.580> ever<00:04:26.610> would

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
I ever would

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.470 
I ever would
that<00:04:27.280> are<00:04:27.370> getting<00:04:27.670> with<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.880> Magnum<00:04:28.270> so

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
that are getting with the Magnum so

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.200 
that are getting with the Magnum so
these<00:04:29.020> weapons<00:04:29.470> though<00:04:29.680> due<00:04:30.010> reward<00:04:30.310> accuracy

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
these weapons though due reward accuracy

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.130 
these weapons though due reward accuracy
and<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.330> think<00:04:31.480> that's<00:04:31.600> one<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.870> reasons

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
and I think that's one of the reasons

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.470 
and I think that's one of the reasons
why<00:04:32.230> people<00:04:32.740> don't<00:04:33.010> really<00:04:33.430> like<00:04:33.640> you<00:04:33.910> if<00:04:34.330> you

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
why people don't really like you if you

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.730 
why people don't really like you if you
don't<00:04:34.630> consider<00:04:34.780> yourself<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:35.230> super<00:04:35.590> accurate

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
don't consider yourself a super accurate

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.350 
don't consider yourself a super accurate
shot<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.190> lot<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.490> times<00:04:36.670> you<00:04:36.790> use<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.150> standard

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
shot a lot of times you use the standard

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.760 
shot a lot of times you use the standard
pistols<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:37.930> don't<00:04:38.110> even<00:04:38.290> waste<00:04:38.470> time

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
pistols you don't even waste time

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.800 
pistols you don't even waste time
fooling<00:04:39.640> around<00:04:39.820> with<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.120> magnums<00:04:40.510> just

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
fooling around with the magnums just

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.450 
fooling around with the magnums just
because<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.110> do<00:04:41.290> only<00:04:41.500> have<00:04:41.740> you<00:04:42.070> know<00:04:42.160> six

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
because you do only have you know six

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.100 
because you do only have you know six
rounds<00:04:42.850> that's<00:04:42.970> not<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.150> lot<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.480> work<00:04:43.690> with<00:04:43.720> and

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
rounds that's not a lot to work with and

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.780 
rounds that's not a lot to work with and
I<00:04:44.530> know<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.680> lot<00:04:44.800> of<00:04:44.920> people<00:04:45.010> actually<00:04:45.370> like<00:04:45.640> the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
I know a lot of people actually like the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.510 
I know a lot of people actually like the
hipfire<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.360> 44<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.830> Rex<00:04:48.040> has<00:04:48.250> decent

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
hipfire the 44 and the Rex has decent

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.640 
hipfire the 44 and the Rex has decent
hipfire<00:04:49.000> I<00:04:49.240> would<00:04:49.390> argue<00:04:49.600> that<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:50.050> hip<00:04:50.440> fire

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
hipfire I would argue that the hip fire

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.530 
hipfire I would argue that the hip fire
on<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.040> Rex<00:04:51.250> is<00:04:51.430> just<00:04:51.610> a<00:04:51.700> tad<00:04:51.910> bit<00:04:51.940> weaker

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
on the Rex is just a tad bit weaker

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.480 
on the Rex is just a tad bit weaker
though<00:04:52.720> they're<00:04:53.560> pretty<00:04:53.770> similar<00:04:53.980> in<00:04:54.160> stats

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
though they're pretty similar in stats

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.190 
though they're pretty similar in stats
but<00:04:54.700> some<00:04:54.910> of<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.090> movement<00:04:55.540> panels<00:04:55.900> you<00:04:56.020> get

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
but some of the movement panels you get

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.960 
but some of the movement panels you get
with<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.470> Rex<00:04:56.770> it's<00:04:57.010> just<00:04:57.190> it's<00:04:57.730> just<00:04:57.820> a

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
with the Rex it's just it's just a

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.670 
with the Rex it's just it's just a
little<00:04:58.150> bit<00:04:58.270> annoying<00:04:58.540> because<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:59.380> don't

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
little bit annoying because I don't

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.870 
little bit annoying because I don't
understand<00:05:00.040> why<00:05:00.220> it's<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.520> game<00:05:00.700> like

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
understand why it's in the game like

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.250 
understand why it's in the game like
that<00:05:01.030> if<00:05:01.180> you<00:05:01.270> can<00:05:01.390> see<00:05:01.540> I<00:05:01.570> got<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.780> hitmarker<00:05:02.080> on

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
that if you can see I got a hitmarker on

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.050 
that if you can see I got a hitmarker on
that<00:05:02.410> guy<00:05:02.530> but<00:05:02.680> luckily<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:03.070> can<00:05:03.280> knife<00:05:03.490> /<00:05:03.850> him

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
that guy but luckily I can knife / him

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.880 
that guy but luckily I can knife / him
so<00:05:04.780> there's<00:05:04.960> an<00:05:05.050> advantage<00:05:05.260> of<00:05:05.590> how<00:05:05.710> it

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
so there's an advantage of how it

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.380 
so there's an advantage of how it
sometimes<00:05:06.340> takes<00:05:06.520> two<00:05:06.790> shots<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:07.210> kill

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
sometimes takes two shots to kill

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.000 
sometimes takes two shots to kill
someone<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:08.260> guess<00:05:08.410> you<00:05:08.560> could<00:05:08.590> argue<00:05:08.740> that

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
someone and I guess you could argue that

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.530 
someone and I guess you could argue that
possibly<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:09.640> could<00:05:09.730> have<00:05:09.970> finished<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:10.300> guy

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
possibly I could have finished that guy

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.780 
possibly I could have finished that guy
off<00:05:10.720> if<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.020> had<00:05:11.170> the<00:05:11.290> 44<00:05:11.740> Magnum<00:05:11.770> but<00:05:12.280> like<00:05:12.700> i

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
off if I had the 44 Magnum but like i

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.580 
off if I had the 44 Magnum but like i
said<00:05:12.820> i<00:05:13.000> prefer<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.600> higher<00:05:13.900> fire<00:05:14.230> ray<00:05:14.440> just

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
said i prefer the higher fire ray just

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.750 
said i prefer the higher fire ray just
you<00:05:14.770> know<00:05:14.860> it's<00:05:14.980> just<00:05:15.100> a<00:05:15.160> little<00:05:15.340> bit<00:05:15.580> faster

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
you know it's just a little bit faster

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.600 
you know it's just a little bit faster
fire<00:05:16.210> rate<00:05:16.450> over<00:05:17.230> the<00:05:17.470> slow<00:05:17.860> plodding<00:05:18.190> place

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
fire rate over the slow plodding place

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.250 
fire rate over the slow plodding place
of<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:18.910> Magnum<00:05:19.270> now<00:05:19.390> do<00:05:19.450> I<00:05:19.600> really<00:05:19.960> like<00:05:20.110> the

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
of the Magnum now do I really like the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.560 
of the Magnum now do I really like the
Magnum<00:05:20.650> yes<00:05:20.890> yes<00:05:21.490> indeed<00:05:21.670> I<00:05:21.850> like<00:05:22.330> both<00:05:22.540> of

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
Magnum yes yes indeed I like both of

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.110 
Magnum yes yes indeed I like both of
these<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.870> lot<00:05:23.290> you<00:05:24.250> know<00:05:24.340> I<00:05:24.370> know<00:05:24.520> in<00:05:24.790> the<00:05:24.850> game

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
these a lot you know I know in the game

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.850 
these a lot you know I know in the game
for<00:05:25.420> whatever<00:05:25.720> reason<00:05:26.080> they<00:05:26.170> call<00:05:26.350> one<00:05:26.620> the

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
for whatever reason they call one the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.640 
for whatever reason they call one the
mp4<00:05:27.370> 12<00:05:27.730> or<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.210> writing<00:05:28.600> of<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.810> rex<00:05:29.050> and<00:05:29.320> the

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
mp4 12 or the writing of the rex and the

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.860 
mp4 12 or the writing of the rex and the
other<00:05:29.800> they<00:05:29.980> call<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.850> 44<00:05:31.330> Magnum<00:05:31.360> so<00:05:31.810> it

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
other they call the the 44 Magnum so it

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.150 
other they call the the 44 Magnum so it
gets<00:05:31.930> a<00:05:32.050> little<00:05:32.169> bit<00:05:32.350> confusing<00:05:32.710> when<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:32.919> say

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
gets a little bit confusing when I say

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.920 
gets a little bit confusing when I say
Magnum<00:05:33.580> but<00:05:33.730> I<00:05:33.760> assure<00:05:34.090> you<00:05:34.120> guys<00:05:34.390> I'm<00:05:34.570> talking

kind<00:06:10.990> of<00:06:11.020> gravitate<00:06:11.500> towards<00:06:11.830> maybe<00:06:12.040> it's

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
kind of gravitate towards maybe it's

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.090 
kind of gravitate towards maybe it's
1911<00:06:12.910> maybe<00:06:13.150> it's<00:06:13.360> 244<00:06:14.020> heck<00:06:14.500> maybe<00:06:14.740> you<00:06:14.950> guys

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
1911 maybe it's 244 heck maybe you guys

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.890 
1911 maybe it's 244 heck maybe you guys
even<00:06:15.280> like<00:06:15.640> the<00:06:15.820> raffica<00:06:16.300> because<00:06:16.540> that<00:06:16.720> used

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
even like the raffica because that used

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.690 
even like the raffica because that used
to<00:06:17.020> be<00:06:17.140> the<00:06:17.260> big<00:06:17.440> thing<00:06:17.650> after<00:06:17.980> one<00:06:18.100> of<00:06:18.190> the<00:06:18.280> the

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
to be the big thing after one of the the

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.580 
to be the big thing after one of the the
first<00:06:18.880> patches<00:06:19.390> were<00:06:19.540> just<00:06:19.750> made<00:06:19.930> the<00:06:20.080> raffica

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590 
first patches were just made the raffica

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.470 
first patches were just made the raffica
just<00:06:20.770> absolutely<00:06:21.220> nuts<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.850> I<00:06:22.030> haven't

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
just absolutely nuts and I haven't

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.000 
just absolutely nuts and I haven't
really<00:06:22.660> used<00:06:22.690> that<00:06:22.960> weapon<00:06:23.320> a<00:06:23.410> lot<00:06:23.590> since<00:06:23.800> then

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
really used that weapon a lot since then

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.680 
really used that weapon a lot since then
so<00:06:24.190> maybe<00:06:24.430> I<00:06:24.490> should<00:06:24.760> should<00:06:25.210> revisit<00:06:25.510> that

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
so maybe I should should revisit that

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:26.970 
so maybe I should should revisit that
since<00:06:26.050> they<00:06:26.169> brought<00:06:26.350> it<00:06:26.500> back<00:06:26.620> down<00:06:26.830> to<00:06:26.950> earth

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:26.980 
since they brought it back down to earth

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.130 
since they brought it back down to earth
but<00:06:27.430> I'm<00:06:28.060> pretty<00:06:28.180> curious<00:06:28.480> to<00:06:28.630> see<00:06:28.780> what<00:06:28.990> the

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
but I'm pretty curious to see what the

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.440 
but I'm pretty curious to see what the
majority<00:06:29.290> of<00:06:29.590> you<00:06:29.710> guys<00:06:29.860> use<00:06:30.130> maybe<00:06:30.610> your<00:06:30.760> 1911

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
majority of you guys use maybe your 1911

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.990 
majority of you guys use maybe your 1911
guy<00:06:31.570> i<00:06:31.810> know<00:06:32.350> i<00:06:32.470> really<00:06:32.980> like<00:06:33.130> the<00:06:33.280> 1911<00:06:33.610> it's

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
hard for me to get away from that but

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.260 
hard for me to get away from that but
every<00:06:35.710> now<00:06:35.800> and<00:06:35.979> then<00:06:36.070> i'll<00:06:36.160> put<00:06:36.610> on<00:06:36.640> the<00:06:36.729> 44

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
know

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.330 
know
this<00:06:40.630> is<00:06:40.750> really<00:06:40.990> a<00:06:41.139> situational<00:06:41.979> type<00:06:42.039> of

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
this is really a situational type of

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.159 
this is really a situational type of
thing<00:06:42.520> but<00:06:42.669> i<00:06:42.729> found<00:06:43.030> the<00:06:43.210> rex<00:06:43.479> is<00:06:43.690> a<00:06:43.720> really

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
thing but i found the rex is a really

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.659 
thing but i found the rex is a really
awesome<00:06:44.199> finishing<00:06:44.949> weapon<00:06:45.280> when<00:06:45.430> you<00:06:45.550> are

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:45.669
