00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
think it's a great way to level up of

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.220 
think it's a great way to level up of
course<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:18.000> it's<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.540> great<00:02:18.690> way<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> think<00:02:19.020> to

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
course and it's a great way I think to

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.650 
course and it's a great way I think to
also<00:02:19.830> learn<00:02:20.100> new<00:02:20.610> game<00:02:20.850> modes<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.450> think

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
also learn new game modes and I think

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.580 
also learn new game modes and I think
that's<00:02:21.780> an<00:02:21.900> important<00:02:22.290> thing<00:02:22.320> because
