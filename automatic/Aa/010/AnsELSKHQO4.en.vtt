00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Let's take a look at the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.250
 second German trailer in the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.770
 scarlett johansson superhuman 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:23.760
 skills gained through drug influence 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:26.010
 in Lucy is happening we have them 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.019
 Parcel inserted in her abdomen 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.650
 they become something very special for us 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.650
 transport 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.090
 do not understand me you understand 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.920
 only if you see me in the hospital now 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.790
 dry 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.500
 somebody gave me a drug package 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.770
 you have to get it out there 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.600
 is leaking one appreciates most 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.869
 People only use ten percent 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.140
 their total capacity they are 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.920
 We could use 100 percent of it before 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.970
 interesting things happened 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.080
 My name is Lohse I had hers 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.910
 research on the human 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.300
 brain there are a few gaps 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.340
 But you are on the right track 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.440
 I have to cerebral from 28 onwards 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.159
 skills i feel every living thing 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.970
 since when do you write Chinese 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.310
 since one hour 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.860
 what happens when you get the 100 percent 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.860
 I have no idea 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.350
 With this knowledge you can secrets 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.850
 decipher those over our universe 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.960
 I'm not sure if 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.370
 the humanity is ready for it 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.850
 it is as if everything is human to me 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.850
 been removed 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.740
 I'm looking forward to going on that too though you 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.270
 You're so kind of directing that leads 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.920
 some overdoing with the action and 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.120
 then the storytelling neglected 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.350
 I have to say honestly, I'm glad 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.600
 me on the strip because I that 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.710
 basic principle market in lucy the universal 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.720
 pictures from the 14th 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.800
 august in German cinemas you bring 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.270
 The story is told to a woman 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.920
 Actually only a drug 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.780
 to put a drug package in the 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.460
 then hurting her body as she then 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.140
 leads will arrive parts of this drug in 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.000
 Her blood should run into it 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.040
 actually die or gets to the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.390
 to get the limits of their abilities and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.130
 that is, ireland is superhuman 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.270
 skills I have the feeling that must 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.220
 I mix that up a bit 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.780
 transcendence and without limit since they 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.640
 can at once the elements 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.380
 Control can control others 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.540
 it can actually do read everything 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.010
 learn what I want that inside 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.480
 shortest time and actually stand 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.670
 there are no limits here, they are not 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.990
 Overcome may be available 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.460
 hot they stole a funny 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.900
 science fiction action thriller 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.000
 will transform the very action-heavy 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.170
 and will be at luxor if i am 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.550
 times as a bit critical that he 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.290
 hopefully the audience in the 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.640
 material battle loses but also 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.230
 a bit with the main character remains 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.300
 on the other side I think so 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.190
 lohan does not make a great figure 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.720
 just purely from her physical figure 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.880
 she has already proved the avengers 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.320
 just how good she is as a black widow action 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.030
 scenes and because of that 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.590
 I am happy to see them because there 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.209
 such an environment with morgan freeman 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.800
 and other well-known actors 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.970
 only think that this second trailer 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.230
 if I'm honest from the first one 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.520
 not really that different 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.350
 also very provided on action 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.850
 Normally you do some new pictures 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.140
 n roll it is allowing a trailer 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.400
 bit on action and the other then 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.410
 on storytelling made that here 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.820
 relatively identical that is why now 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.410
 There is no big difference and me 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.420
 remain the same level 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.160
 lust regarding lucifer rinse water 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.180
 contrary to the comments joy 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.920
 harbors or interests you 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.209
 you so not so am I 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.430
 through a short little second 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.260
 trailer check to lucy last 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.000
 with these words let it stay if 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.080
 not otherwise that you know there is 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.609
 a few more left and me around and 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.280
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course, at the latest 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.210
 a new video and what do I hope 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.370
 here for weeks again this 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.370
 of course from 3
