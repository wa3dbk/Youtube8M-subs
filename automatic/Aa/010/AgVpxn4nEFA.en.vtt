you're going to use whenever you need to
go<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.370> direct<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.790> anchor<00:00:48.180> whether

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
go in direct to the anchor whether

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
go in direct to the anchor whether
you're<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.019> the<00:00:49.140> base<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.589> climb<00:00:49.890> or

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you're at the base of a climb or

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.119 
you're at the base of a climb or
filleting<00:00:51.089> a<00:00:51.300> leader<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.720> multi<00:00:52.110> bitch<00:00:52.290> so

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
filleting a leader on a multi bitch so

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.770 
filleting a leader on a multi bitch so
I've<00:00:53.280> gone<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> top<00:00:53.970> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.269> first<00:00:54.449> pitch

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
I've gone to the top of the first pitch

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.869 
I've gone to the top of the first pitch
where<00:00:55.110> my<00:00:55.230> leader<00:00:55.470> has<00:00:55.710> built<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.190> solid<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
where my leader has built a solid and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.549 
where my leader has built a solid and
redundant<00:00:57.449> anchor<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:57.989> three<00:00:58.320> bomber

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
redundant anchor with three bomber

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.700 
redundant anchor with three bomber
pieces<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.820> we<00:00:59.850> need<00:01:00.119> to<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.330> tie<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:01.049> direct<00:01:01.470> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
pieces so we need to go tie in direct to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.979 
pieces so we need to go tie in direct to
the<00:01:01.739> anchor<00:01:02.189> to<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.299> take<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.570> locking

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the anchor to do that I take a locking

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.460 
the anchor to do that I take a locking
beaner<00:01:04.580> put<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> master<00:01:06.240> point<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
beaner put it in the master point and

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.810 
beaner put it in the master point and
then<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.130> want<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> tie<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> clove

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
then I'm going to want to tie a clove

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.600 
then I'm going to want to tie a clove
hitch<00:01:09.259> start<00:01:10.259> from<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.560> hardest<00:01:10.979> go<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
hitch start from my hardest go out a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.030 
hitch start from my hardest go out a
couple<00:01:11.850> feet<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.409> actually<00:01:13.470> tie<00:01:13.979> it

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
couple feet and then to actually tie it

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.550 
couple feet and then to actually tie it
you<00:01:14.610> make<00:01:14.759> two<00:01:15.030> loops<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.900> go<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> same

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you make two loops that go in the same

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.679 
you make two loops that go in the same
direction<00:01:17.659> like<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.710> move<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.159> front<00:01:20.490> loop

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
direction like this move the front loop

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.890 
direction like this move the front loop
behind<00:01:21.860> second<00:01:22.860> loop

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
behind second loop

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.820 
behind second loop
put<00:01:25.500> both<00:01:25.680> loops<00:01:26.010> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.550> meter<00:01:27.080> lock<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
put both loops on the meter lock it and

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.870 
put both loops on the meter lock it and
then<00:01:29.430> pull<00:01:29.730> both<00:01:30.030> strands<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.960> dress<00:01:31.230> the<00:01:31.470> not

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
then pull both strands to dress the not

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.760 
then pull both strands to dress the not
so<00:01:32.880> I'll<00:01:33.000> show<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.240> again<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> we're<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.710> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
so I'll show you again so we're going to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.470 
so I'll show you again so we're going to
take<00:01:37.920> two<00:01:38.670> loops<00:01:39.170> going<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> same<00:01:40.500> direction

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
take two loops going the same direction

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:51.250 
take two loops going the same direction
move<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:42.660> front<00:01:42.930> behind<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.830> back

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.670 

and<00:01:51.530> if<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.580> strands<00:01:52.880> keep<00:01:53.270> pulling<00:01:53.780> then<00:01:54.500> you

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
and if the strands keep pulling then you

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.140 
and if the strands keep pulling then you
have<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.010> tied<00:01:55.220> a<00:01:55.250> cloak<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.760> you<00:01:55.910> need<00:01:56.030> to

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
have it tied a cloak that you need to

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.630 
have it tied a cloak that you need to
retie<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.480> so<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.560> best<00:01:57.800> part<00:01:58.100> about<00:01:58.220> this

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
retie it so the best part about this

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.240 
retie it so the best part about this
knot<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.360> that<00:01:59.810> it's<00:02:00.050> adjustable<00:02:00.620> even<00:02:01.100> when

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
knot is that it's adjustable even when

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.760 
knot is that it's adjustable even when
it's<00:02:01.400> tied<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.450> let's<00:02:02.690> say<00:02:02.930> I've<00:02:03.380> got<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.590> little

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
it's tied so let's say I've got a little

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.230 
it's tied so let's say I've got a little
slack<00:02:04.070> in<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.340> system<00:02:04.730> I<00:02:04.880> want<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.120> go<00:02:05.210> a

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
slack in the system I want to go a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.570 
slack in the system I want to go a
little<00:02:05.420> closer<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:06.740> just<00:02:06.980> push<00:02:07.370> through

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
little closer you can just push through

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.600 
little closer you can just push through
like<00:02:10.580> this

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
like this

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.590 
like this
and<00:02:11.760> pull<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.540> slack<00:02:12.780> out<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:14.640> i<00:02:14.670> changed<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and pull the slack out so i changed the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.480 
and pull the slack out so i changed the
length<00:02:16.050> between<00:02:16.200> myself<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.160> anchor

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
length between myself and the anchor

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.270 
length between myself and the anchor
without<00:02:17.760> untying<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.390> knot<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.920> was<00:02:20.070> safe

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
without untying a knot and I was safe

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.150 
without untying a knot and I was safe
the<00:02:20.310> whole<00:02:20.640> time<00:02:20.870> that's<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.990> open<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
the whole time that's the open so the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.350 
the whole time that's the open so the
second<00:02:23.490> not<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.760> we're<00:02:23.850> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> learn<00:02:24.120> is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
second not that we're going to learn is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.880 
second not that we're going to learn is
a<00:02:24.390> figure<00:02:24.660> eight<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.960> bite<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.740> very

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
a figure eight on a bite it's very
