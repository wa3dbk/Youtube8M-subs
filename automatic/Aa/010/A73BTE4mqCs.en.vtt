00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
now he's just a regular one so he is the

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.570 
now he's just a regular one so he is the
one<00:05:46.919> in<00:05:47.220> 12<00:05:47.849> golf<00:05:48.630> zombie<00:05:49.139> the<00:05:49.800> other<00:05:50.039> one<00:05:50.370> is

one in 12 golf zombie the other one is

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.060 
one in 12 golf zombie the other one is
one<00:05:51.180> in<00:05:51.300> 36<00:05:51.599> if<00:05:52.080> it<00:05:52.169> glows<00:05:52.289> in<00:05:52.530> the<00:05:52.560> dark<00:05:52.650> which

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
one in 36 if it glows in the dark which

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.230 
one in 36 if it glows in the dark which
this<00:05:53.880> might<00:05:54.419> be<00:05:54.840> because<00:05:54.990> his<00:05:55.320> skin<00:05:55.530> is<00:05:55.710> green

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240
