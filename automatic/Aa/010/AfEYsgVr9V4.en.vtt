00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.260 

our<00:00:04.980> trees<00:00:05.220> have<00:00:05.370> now<00:00:05.490> been<00:00:05.700> in<00:00:05.850> for<00:00:06.029> six

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
our trees have now been in for six

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.589 
our trees have now been in for six
months<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.870> as<00:00:07.500> part<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.010> aftercare

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
months and as part of the aftercare

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.150 
months and as part of the aftercare
we've<00:00:09.599> ensured<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> bases<00:00:10.740> around<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
we've ensured that the bases around the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.700 
we've ensured that the bases around the
trees<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.610> all<00:00:11.730> been<00:00:11.910> sprayed<00:00:12.620> problem<00:00:13.620> is

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
trees have all been sprayed problem is

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.640 
trees have all been sprayed problem is
of<00:00:13.830> course<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.610> actual<00:00:15.150> weeds<00:00:15.650> that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
of course is that the actual weeds that

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.769 
of course is that the actual weeds that
are<00:00:16.800> inside<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.369> tube<00:00:17.609> are<00:00:17.820> not<00:00:18.240> affected<00:00:18.630> by

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
are inside the tube are not affected by

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.240 
are inside the tube are not affected by
the<00:00:18.840> spray<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:19.470> all<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.859> removed

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the spray so they all have to be removed

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.050 
the spray so they all have to be removed
by<00:00:20.430> hand<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:22.500> first<00:00:22.680> step<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.640> remove<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
by hand the first step is to remove the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.720 
by hand the first step is to remove the
tube<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.570> will<00:00:25.080> ask<00:00:25.230> my<00:00:25.439> assistant<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:26.400> come<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
tube I will ask my assistant to come and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.190 
tube I will ask my assistant to come and
remove<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.119> tube<00:00:32.960> sometimes<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.170> be

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
remove the tube sometimes it can be

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.290 
remove the tube sometimes it can be
quite<00:00:34.440> persistent<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> ground<00:00:35.579> that's<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
quite persistent in the ground that's a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.760 
quite persistent in the ground that's a
bit<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.510> wiggling<00:00:36.660> generally<00:00:37.320> speaking<00:00:37.530> they

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
bit of wiggling generally speaking they

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.119 
bit of wiggling generally speaking they
will<00:00:37.950> come<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.180> Charlie<00:00:43.079> good<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
will come out so that Charlie good and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.630 
will come out so that Charlie good and
as<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.340> can<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:45.140> it's<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.399> open

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
as you can see it's just to just open

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.130 
as you can see it's just to just open
those<00:00:47.879> weeds<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.809> find<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
those weeds up and see we can find the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.939 
those weeds up and see we can find the
tree<00:00:50.780> there<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.870> an<00:00:51.960> ash<00:00:52.110> tree<00:00:52.379> right<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
tree there is an ash tree right in the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.709 
tree there is an ash tree right in the
middle<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.550> there<00:00:55.219> yes<00:00:56.719> those

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
middle of that look there yes those

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.349 
middle of that look there yes those
weeds<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.949> choking<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.760> without

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
weeds really choking it and without

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.689 
weeds really choking it and without
without<00:01:00.989> doing<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:02.309> would<00:01:02.399> obviously

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
without doing this it would obviously

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.770 
without doing this it would obviously
create<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> problem<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.570> tree<00:01:03.780> growth<00:01:05.780> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
create a problem of the tree growth the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
create a problem of the tree growth the
roots<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.290> weeds<00:01:07.500> need<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.830> be<00:01:07.950> removed<00:01:08.220> as

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
roots of the weeds need to be removed as

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.149 
roots of the weeds need to be removed as
well<00:01:08.490> using<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.479> trowel<00:01:09.890> obviously<00:01:10.890> taking

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
well using a trowel obviously taking

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.710 
well using a trowel obviously taking
great<00:01:11.369> care<00:01:11.400> not<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.850> dislodge<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.390> roots<00:01:12.570> on

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
great care not to dislodge the roots on

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:32.800 
great care not to dislodge the roots on
the<00:01:12.840> tree

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.540 

there's<00:01:33.810> an<00:01:33.900> additional<00:01:34.440> precaution<00:01:35.010> if<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
there's an additional precaution if you

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.030 
there's an additional precaution if you
have<00:01:35.670> any<00:01:35.790> old<00:01:35.850> grass<00:01:36.210> cuttings<00:01:36.830> these<00:01:37.830> can

then be used as a mulch around the base
of<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.720> tree<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.770> preserve<00:01:41.070> any<00:01:41.220> moisture
