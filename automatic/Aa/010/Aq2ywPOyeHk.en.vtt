had commented and said that those were

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.109 
had commented and said that those were
the<00:00:27.619> strongest<00:00:28.039> characters<00:00:28.489> in<00:00:28.609> the<00:00:28.699> game<00:00:28.909> but

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
the strongest characters in the game but

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.450 
the strongest characters in the game but

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
make it appear that they're the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.550 
make it appear that they're the
strongest<00:00:37.880> but<00:00:38.240> they're<00:00:38.420> just<00:00:38.600> now<00:00:39.260> I've<00:00:39.350> also

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
reflections that shoot my projectiles

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.699 
reflections that shoot my projectiles
back<00:03:29.489> at<00:03:29.819> me<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.239> do<00:03:30.569> nothing<00:03:31.169> against<00:03:31.590> that

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
back at me is do nothing against that

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.250 
back at me is do nothing against that
star<00:03:32.160> strike<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.700> nasty<00:03:33.510> yeah<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:34.079> was<00:03:34.230> a

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
star strike is nasty yeah that was a

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.979 
star strike is nasty yeah that was a
really<00:03:34.680> kind<00:03:35.250> of<00:03:35.489> bad<00:03:35.760> matchup<00:03:36.180> for<00:03:36.480> hoot<00:03:36.780> loop

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
really kind of bad matchup for hoot loop

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.379 
really kind of bad matchup for hoot loop
because<00:03:37.470> who<00:03:38.010> loop<00:03:38.220> has<00:03:38.430> no<00:03:38.760> other<00:03:39.030> way<00:03:39.329> to

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
because who loop has no other way to

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.690 
because who loop has no other way to
damage<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.139> other<00:03:40.349> than<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.590> teleport<00:03:41.160> which

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
damage you other than the teleport which

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.030 
damage you other than the teleport which
doesn't<00:03:42.150> do<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.359> much<00:03:42.569> damage<00:03:42.599> so<00:03:43.049> all<00:03:43.769> my

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
doesn't do that much damage so all my

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.400 
doesn't do that much damage so all my
projectiles<00:03:44.609> that<00:03:44.940> were<00:03:45.720> getting<00:03:45.930> shot<00:03:46.169> at

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
projectiles that were getting shot at

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.839 
projectiles that were getting shot at
you<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:46.650> could<00:03:46.799> reflect<00:03:47.069> half<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.579> them<00:03:47.700> back

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
you you could reflect half of them back

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.970 
you you could reflect half of them back
at<00:03:48.060> me<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.569> it<00:03:49.049> was<00:03:49.169> definitely<00:03:49.380> a<00:03:49.650> lopsided

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
at me so it was definitely a lopsided

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.979 
at me so it was definitely a lopsided
fight<00:03:50.609> on<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.030> mean<00:03:51.269> out<00:03:51.599> of<00:03:51.660> all<00:03:51.840> the

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
fight on that I mean out of all the

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.900 
fight on that I mean out of all the
tournaments<00:03:52.440> we<00:03:52.530> had<00:03:52.769> I<00:03:53.130> wouldn't<00:03:53.489> have<00:03:53.549> I

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
tournaments we had I wouldn't have I

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.039 
tournaments we had I wouldn't have I
wouldn't<00:03:54.239> have<00:03:54.540> thought<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.870> would<00:03:54.989> have

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
wouldn't have thought that would have

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.500 
wouldn't have thought that would have
happened<00:03:55.440> in<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.590> finals<00:03:56.010> much<00:03:56.250> less<00:03:56.579> you

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
happened in the finals much less you

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.619 
happened in the finals much less you
know<00:03:57.660> who<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.379> was<00:03:58.410> gonna<00:03:58.620> be<00:03:58.859> against<00:03:59.489> well<00:04:00.209> at

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
know who it was gonna be against well at

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.240 
know who it was gonna be against well at
least<00:04:00.750> he<00:04:00.989> made<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.349> that<00:04:01.470> far<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.799> guess<00:04:02.069> that's

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
least he made it that far I guess that's

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.460 
least he made it that far I guess that's
all<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.489> can<00:04:02.549> say<00:04:02.639> about<00:04:02.849> that<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:03.660> that's<00:04:04.290> a

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
all I can say about that but that's a

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.069 
all I can say about that but that's a
wrap<00:04:04.709> once<00:04:05.579> again<00:04:05.879> a<00:04:05.910> swamp<00:04:06.269> for<00:04:06.480> sloths<00:04:06.810> out

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
wrap once again a swamp for sloths out

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.099 
wrap once again a swamp for sloths out
yeah<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.859> force<00:04:08.160> lost<00:04:08.430> yet<00:04:08.760> again<00:04:09.120> but
