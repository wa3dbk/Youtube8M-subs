town hall 9 and town or 10 and that kind
of<00:01:58.920> makes<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.280> lot<00:01:59.430> more<00:01:59.460> difficulty<00:02:00.090> goblins

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
of makes a lot more difficulty goblins

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.859 
of makes a lot more difficulty goblins
of<00:02:00.540> ray<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.259> goblins<00:02:01.590> run<00:02:01.770> ahead<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.219> troops

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
of ray the goblins run ahead of troops

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.050 
of ray the goblins run ahead of troops
so<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.960> can't<00:02:04.170> tank<00:02:04.409> them<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:05.490> they're<00:02:05.729> kind

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
so you can't tank them so they're kind

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.089 
so you can't tank them so they're kind
of<00:02:06.290> yeah<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.350> think<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:07.860> need<00:02:07.979> an

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
of yeah I think I think we need an

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.010 
of yeah I think I think we need an
overhaul<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> contents<00:02:09.060> don't<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.330> let's

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
overhaul of the contents don't you let's

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.150 
overhaul of the contents don't you let's
check<00:02:10.140> out<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> town<00:02:10.560> or<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.920> channel<00:02:11.310> 10

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
check out a town or a channel 10

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.350 
check out a town or a channel 10
and<00:02:12.930> okay<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:13.990> on<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:14.860> my<00:02:15.490> main<00:02:15.700> account<00:02:15.970> right

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
and okay so on my my main account right

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.970 
and okay so on my my main account right
now<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:17.020> course<00:02:17.170> they're<00:02:17.380> all<00:02:17.530> max<00:02:17.740> level

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
now so of course they're all max level

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.010 
now so of course they're all max level
goblins<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.730> everyone<00:02:19.360> who's<00:02:19.510> donated

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
goblins and everyone who's donated

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.710 
goblins and everyone who's donated
goblins<00:02:20.380> because<00:02:21.370> now<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.580> think<00:02:22.330> we're<00:02:22.510> level

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
goblins because now I think we're level

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.290 
goblins because now I think we're level
five<00:02:22.900> clans<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:24.040> levels<00:02:24.400> up<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.640> troops<00:02:24.880> by

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
five clans so it levels up the troops by

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.460 
five clans so it levels up the troops by
one<00:02:25.570> so<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.850> they're<00:02:28.180> all<00:02:28.630> basically<00:02:28.900> level

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
one so so they're all basically level

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.260 
one so so they're all basically level
max<00:02:29.980> level<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.400> their<00:02:30.550> clan<00:02:30.730> castle<00:02:30.910> as<00:02:31.090> well

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
max level in their clan castle as well

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.360 
max level in their clan castle as well
which<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.450> quite<00:02:31.600> nice<00:02:31.750> no<00:02:32.320> Queen<00:02:32.560> got<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> king

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
which is quite nice no Queen got a king

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.700 
which is quite nice no Queen got a king
so<00:02:33.880> let's<00:02:34.060> go<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.240> find<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.540> match<00:02:34.690> oh<00:02:37.470> that's<00:02:38.470> a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
so let's go and find a match oh that's a

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.370 
so let's go and find a match oh that's a
lot<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.860> dark<00:02:39.070> elixir<00:02:39.660> that's<00:02:40.660> really<00:02:41.020> easy<00:02:41.170> to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
lot of dark elixir that's really easy to

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.580 
lot of dark elixir that's really easy to
get<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.680> as<00:02:41.740> well<00:02:41.950> one<00:02:42.160> jumped<00:02:42.400> bug<00:02:42.670> do<00:02:42.940> that

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
get to as well one jumped bug do that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.790 
get to as well one jumped bug do that
okay<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:46.000> think<00:02:46.150> oh<00:02:46.630> look<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.350> we've<00:02:47.530> the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
okay so I think oh look so we've the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.560 
okay so I think oh look so we've the
primary<00:02:48.130> objective<00:02:48.580> is<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.820> get<00:02:48.940> at<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.270> dark

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
primary objective is to get at the dark

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.890 
primary objective is to get at the dark
elixir<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:51.190> secondary<00:02:51.640> objective<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.120> maybe

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
elixir the secondary objective is maybe

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.510 
elixir the secondary objective is maybe
get<00:02:53.080> some<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.380> elixir<00:02:53.800> as<00:02:54.100> well<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.400> pay

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
get some of that elixir as well to pay

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.990 
get some of that elixir as well to pay
for<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.730> spell<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.330> dang<00:02:55.840> guys<00:02:56.020> jump<00:02:57.000> okay

I believe the only ground truth that can

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.650 
I believe the only ground truth that can
actually<00:03:19.000> outrun<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.540> spring<00:03:19.840> trap<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:21.360> know<00:03:22.360> I

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
actually outrun a spring trap I know I

heroes<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.700> just<00:03:28.120> walked<00:03:28.450> right<00:03:28.630> over<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:29.020> but

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
heroes to just walked right over it but

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.710 
heroes to just walked right over it but
hopefully<00:03:29.380> go<00:03:29.800> out<00:03:30.010> right<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:31.150> we<00:03:31.240> go<00:03:31.360> get

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
hopefully go out right so we go get

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.260 
hopefully go out right so we go get
those<00:03:31.840> goblins<00:03:32.230> in<00:03:32.850> what<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> heck<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.120> wrong

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
those goblins in what the heck is wrong

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.360 
those goblins in what the heck is wrong
might<00:03:34.630> as<00:03:34.690> well<00:03:34.780> throw<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.050> king<00:03:35.290> in<00:03:35.500> so<00:03:36.100> yeah

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
might as well throw the king in so yeah

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.590 
might as well throw the king in so yeah
once<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.850> queen<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.420> up<00:03:37.660> going<00:03:37.930> up<00:03:38.020> to<00:03:39.270> 36<00:03:40.270> I

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
once the queen is up going up to 36 I

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.210 
once the queen is up going up to 36 I
think<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:41.050> went<00:03:41.440> 37<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.040> think<00:03:42.220> it's<00:03:42.310> 36<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:45.100> I

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
think I went 37 I think it's 36 and I

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.270 
think I went 37 I think it's 36 and I
think<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.520> cleans<00:03:45.730> going<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.030> 36<00:03:46.570> so<00:03:47.560> i've

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
think it cleans going to 36 so i've

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.060 
think it cleans going to 36 so i've
calculated<00:03:48.610> I've<00:03:48.940> got<00:03:49.090> about<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.620> think<00:03:50.620> three

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
calculated I've got about I think three

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.590 
calculated I've got about I think three
million<00:03:51.370> dark<00:03:51.550> elixir<00:03:51.760> left<00:03:52.180> until<00:03:52.450> I'm

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
ones at the top so well done Stella

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.350 
ones at the top so well done Stella
that's<00:05:56.419> sure<00:05:56.599> you're<00:05:57.080> our<00:05:57.229> man<00:05:57.560> of<00:05:57.590> the<00:05:57.740> match

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
that's sure you're our man of the match

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.690 
that's sure you're our man of the match
so<00:05:59.360> that<00:05:59.570> interestingly<00:05:59.900> enough<00:06:00.349> there<00:06:00.830> man

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
so that interestingly enough there man

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.370 
so that interestingly enough there man
inverted<00:06:02.479> commas<00:06:02.690> I'm<00:06:02.780> sure<00:06:02.960> if<00:06:03.020> it<00:06:03.110> isn't<00:06:03.289> man

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
inverted commas I'm sure if it isn't man

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.460 
inverted commas I'm sure if it isn't man
but<00:06:03.410> shake<00:06:04.270> it<00:06:05.270> men<00:06:05.599> of<00:06:05.660> the<00:06:05.720> matches<00:06:05.870> is<00:06:06.229> on<00:06:06.349> me

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
but shake it men of the matches is on me

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.560 
but shake it men of the matches is on me
actually<00:06:07.010> which<00:06:07.789> is<00:06:07.820> interesting<00:06:08.389> to<00:06:08.450> this

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
actually which is interesting to this

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.990 
actually which is interesting to this
number<00:06:08.870> 70<00:06:09.200> hits<00:06:09.289> number<00:06:09.440> seven<00:06:09.830> but<00:06:09.979> still<00:06:10.160> so

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
number 70 hits number seven but still so

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.629 
number 70 hits number seven but still so
this<00:06:11.479> is<00:06:11.630> a<00:06:11.840> lot<00:06:12.260> of<00:06:12.380> golems<00:06:12.740> that<00:06:13.039> seven

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
this is a lot of golems that seven

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.969 
this is a lot of golems that seven
golems<00:06:14.090> now<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.050> whole<00:06:15.229> the<00:06:15.260> whole<00:06:15.560> idea<00:06:15.950> of

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
golems now the whole the whole idea of

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.250 
golems now the whole the whole idea of
my<00:06:16.280> basis<00:06:16.729> that<00:06:16.909> it<00:06:16.940> spreads<00:06:17.419> out<00:06:17.570> they

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
my basis that it spreads out they

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:23.260 
my basis that it spreads out they
um<00:06:18.940> attacking<00:06:19.940> forces<00:06:20.420> left<00:06:21.140> or<00:06:21.350> right<00:06:21.560> as<00:06:22.270> we

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
um attacking forces left or right as we

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.110 
um attacking forces left or right as we
can<00:06:23.420> see<00:06:23.660> here<00:06:23.690> with<00:06:24.680> not<00:06:25.190> even<00:06:25.400> maxed<00:06:25.850> out

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
can see here with not even maxed out

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.540 
can see here with not even maxed out
heroes<00:06:26.510> with<00:06:26.690> mid<00:06:26.900> middle<00:06:27.200> heroes<00:06:27.590> he's<00:06:28.310> doing

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
heroes with mid middle heroes he's doing

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.730 
heroes with mid middle heroes he's doing
a<00:06:28.640> fantastic<00:06:29.090> job<00:06:29.360> and<00:06:30.230> I<00:06:30.320> think<00:06:30.530> it's<00:06:30.680> because

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
a fantastic job and I think it's because

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.880 
a fantastic job and I think it's because
the<00:06:31.100> weakness<00:06:32.030> it<00:06:32.180> is<00:06:32.300> is<00:06:32.720> that<00:06:32.960> when<00:06:33.620> you<00:06:33.740> have

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890 
the weakness it is is that when you have

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.690 
the weakness it is is that when you have
so<00:06:34.190> many<00:06:34.430> golems<00:06:34.880> in<00:06:35.060> there<00:06:35.270> it's<00:06:36.490> it<00:06:37.490> doesn't

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
so many golems in there it's it doesn't

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.780 
so many golems in there it's it doesn't
really<00:06:37.790> matter<00:06:38.500> because<00:06:39.500> there's<00:06:40.400> just<00:06:40.460> so

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
really matter because there's just so

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.850 
really matter because there's just so
much<00:06:40.940> hit<00:06:41.300> points<00:06:41.660> going<00:06:41.840> towards<00:06:42.290> it<00:06:42.410> then

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
much hit points going towards it then

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.610 
much hit points going towards it then
pretty<00:06:43.190> much<00:06:43.280> anything<00:06:43.760> behind<00:06:44.240> it<00:06:44.780> it<00:06:45.320> is

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
pretty much anything behind it it is

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.500 
pretty much anything behind it it is
preserved<00:06:46.280> now<00:06:46.460> that<00:06:46.640> this<00:06:46.790> what<00:06:47.210> he's<00:06:47.330> done

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
preserved now that this what he's done

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.920 
preserved now that this what he's done
right<00:06:47.750> here<00:06:47.990> is<00:06:48.290> its<00:06:49.070> pulleys<00:06:49.490> troops<00:06:49.940> in<00:06:50.210> and

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
right here is its pulleys troops in and

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.050 
right here is its pulleys troops in and
put<00:06:51.620> the<00:06:51.680> golems<00:06:51.980> in<00:06:52.130> before<00:06:52.730> the<00:06:52.850> other

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
put the golems in before the other

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.220 
put the golems in before the other
troops<00:06:53.360> because<00:06:53.540> if<00:06:53.720> you<00:06:53.840> put<00:06:53.870> the<00:06:54.140> other

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.230 
troops because if you put the other

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.960 
troops because if you put the other
treats<00:06:54.470> in<00:06:54.590> first<00:06:54.860> and<00:06:55.130> of<00:06:55.580> course<00:06:55.820> they've

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:55.970 
treats in first and of course they've

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:57.880 
treats in first and of course they've
made<00:06:56.000> mincemeat<00:06:56.390> of<00:06:56.690> the<00:06:57.020> wizards<00:06:57.560> and<00:06:57.680> stuff

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890 
made mincemeat of the wizards and stuff

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.880 
made mincemeat of the wizards and stuff
in<00:06:58.070> it<00:06:58.160> and<00:06:58.370> look<00:06:59.300> yeah<00:06:59.690> from<00:06:59.930> the<00:07:00.020> golden<00:07:00.380> just

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
in it and look yeah from the golden just

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.550 
in it and look yeah from the golden just
compassionate<00:07:01.160> cells<00:07:01.580> against<00:07:01.820> the<00:07:01.940> wall<00:07:02.560> low

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560 
compassionate cells against the wall low

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.010 
compassionate cells against the wall low
damage<00:07:04.010> per<00:07:04.250> second<00:07:04.550> day<00:07:04.700> off<00:07:04.850> so<00:07:05.480> yeah<00:07:05.780> well

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
damage per second day off so yeah well

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.530 
damage per second day off so yeah well
done<00:07:06.230> so<00:07:06.620> I've<00:07:07.580> a<00:07:07.610> lot<00:07:07.790> of<00:07:07.910> respect<00:07:08.300> for<00:07:08.420> this

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.540 
done so I've a lot of respect for this

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.090 
done so I've a lot of respect for this
and<00:07:08.720> I<00:07:08.780> think<00:07:09.020> I<00:07:09.140> may<00:07:09.290> well<00:07:09.470> change<00:07:09.650> my<00:07:09.890> base

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
and I think I may well change my base

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.190 
and I think I may well change my base
around<00:07:10.370> I<00:07:10.700> might<00:07:11.210> go<00:07:11.360> for<00:07:11.480> closed<00:07:11.780> walls<00:07:12.020> i

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.200 
around I might go for closed walls i

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.560 
around I might go for closed walls i
just<00:07:12.410> kind<00:07:12.620> of<00:07:12.680> like<00:07:12.740> I<00:07:13.190> just<00:07:13.370> sure<00:07:14.270> to<00:07:14.420> change

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
just kind of like I just sure to change

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.880 
just kind of like I just sure to change
these<00:07:14.690> walls<00:07:14.930> around<00:07:15.140> hey<00:07:15.290> look<00:07:15.500> how<00:07:15.590> to<00:07:15.650> be

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:15.890 
these walls around hey look how to be

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.480 
these walls around hey look how to be
funny<00:07:16.040> I<00:07:16.310> kind<00:07:17.150> of<00:07:17.270> like<00:07:17.480> the<00:07:17.690> I<00:07:18.350> just<00:07:19.220> think<00:07:19.400> it

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:19.490 
funny I kind of like the I just think it

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.800 
funny I kind of like the I just think it
looks<00:07:19.640> like<00:07:19.760> the<00:07:19.880> protea<00:07:20.300> you<00:07:20.570> know<00:07:20.720> the

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
looks like the protea you know the

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.200 
looks like the protea you know the
flower<00:07:21.050> in<00:07:21.260> South<00:07:21.440> Africa<00:07:21.880> you<00:07:22.880> know<00:07:22.910> the<00:07:23.060> one

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
flower in South Africa you know the one

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.690 
flower in South Africa you know the one
that<00:07:23.620> the<00:07:24.620> protein<00:07:25.070> is<00:07:25.190> fairly<00:07:25.430> unique

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:25.700 
that the protein is fairly unique

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.020 
that the protein is fairly unique
because<00:07:26.030> if<00:07:26.680> it<00:07:27.680> spreads<00:07:28.040> its<00:07:28.310> seeds<00:07:28.550> by<00:07:28.730> fire

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.030 
because if it spreads its seeds by fire

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.160 
because if it spreads its seeds by fire
in<00:07:29.840> just<00:07:30.110> burn<00:07:30.580> orthopod<00:07:31.580> can<00:07:31.790> open<00:07:32.060> and<00:07:33.050> I

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.170 
in just burn orthopod can open and I

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.670 
in just burn orthopod can open and I
just<00:07:33.350> happen<00:07:33.590> to<00:07:33.650> love<00:07:33.830> the<00:07:34.000> Proteas<00:07:35.000> so<00:07:35.680> there

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:36.680 
just happen to love the Proteas so there

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.130 
just happen to love the Proteas so there
we<00:07:36.770> go<00:07:36.800> a<00:07:37.160> good<00:07:37.550> resounding<00:07:38.120> almost<00:07:38.630> 3<00:07:38.840> stars

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:39.140 
we go a good resounding almost 3 stars

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.660 
we go a good resounding almost 3 stars
there<00:07:39.440> against<00:07:39.890> my<00:07:40.040> other<00:07:40.160> thing<00:07:40.310> anybody's

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:40.670 
there against my other thing anybody's

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.310 
there against my other thing anybody's
ever<00:07:40.730> got<00:07:40.910> three<00:07:41.090> stars<00:07:41.300> early<00:07:41.540> max<00:07:42.020> heroes
