00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.140
 nails because nails are business 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.969

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.180

 teaspoons of salt preferably sea salt 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.260
 if you do not have sea salt you can 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.770
 use ordinary kitchen cookery 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.590
 salt 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.510
 we heat the water to temperature and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 somewhere 80 degrees throw salt there 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.530
 we stir everything and wait for the person 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.730
 dissolve then add there 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.420
 orange juice and 3 drops of iodine here in 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:03.660
 Basically, my composition is ready, but I 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:06.659
 forget something dr go here please i 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:14.570
 forgot to come please completely 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:20.130
 randomly excellent nail polish 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.780
 I need to cut my nails and pull out not 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.950
 so little short 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.579
 running the sa mind for this other faith 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.400
 they do not notice you offer no 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.140
 to file 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.760
 other more problems with nails 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.630
 we can solve this problem differently 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:47.760
 not just needed j &amp; j completely 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:58.560
 by chance i always carry y'all with you 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:02:02.370
 The same advice added to the composition of full 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.120
 now we just drop the nails in this 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:09.830
 line-up and wait 7 10 minutes after that 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.930
 wash my hands with cold water and lubricate them 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.890
 any cream for which you have on 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.130
 better bold 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.190
 I did a bath that I can say well 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.920
 about strengthening and growing something 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.709
 it's hard to say well that this bath I 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.050
 only did this bath once 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.810
 need to do every week at least 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.440
 for two months and then it will be visible 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.150
 result but some result 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.860
 sometimes already 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.860
 I hurt my nails fast and don't apply 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.870
 precoating before varnish 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.660
 apply colorless coating correctly 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.360
 then varnish and then again and colorless 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.910
 I am in a hurry and put in a lot 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.239
 the lamp is then a colorless coating of this 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.630
 nails turn a little yellow if these are some 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:11.120
 dark shades of lacquer red blue 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:14.549
 brown like this after this bath 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.820
 my nails are white white white not even 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.610
 it was evident that I did it all and but they 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.600
 were a yellowish tinge and now it's 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.730
 everything bleached 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.140
