overall<00:02:21.879> I<00:02:21.910> think<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.330> could<00:02:22.510> sum<00:02:22.720> up<00:02:22.840> my

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
overall I think I could sum up my

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.420 
overall I think I could sum up my
experience<00:02:22.989> in<00:02:23.620> playing<00:02:23.829> this<00:02:24.010> game<00:02:24.219> with

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
experience in playing this game with

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.660 
experience in playing this game with
just<00:02:24.519> one<00:02:24.760> word<00:02:24.969> want<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.659> know<00:02:25.750> what<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.019> is

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.130 

so<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.819> conclusion<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.510> don't<00:02:31.690> know<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.959> game

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
so in conclusion I don't know the game
