00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello welcome back to all today video door 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.529
 homemade enamels I was inspired by 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.780
 another video on youtube a girl 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.360
 which makes bricolage videos a lot 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.089
 very useful homemade and the channel yes 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.060
 call in the orange box fo leave you 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.310
 the link if you want to check it out 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.490
 then what will it take to do this 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.099
 contraption 3 leads to empty voids that don't 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.250
 we use more than the slightly higher ones 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.410
 and let's go find us alone 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.830
 the part below then the part 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.830
 lower 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.380
 2 CD racks must be pierced I have 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.570
 had my father help him with a 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.550
 drill is very simple we give from those who have 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.460
 take these tools and some e 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.059
 practical and let's play two of 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.070
 these as support for my mail 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.440
 I go to insert a cable 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.050
 quite double electric and therefore 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.839
 this will help me to get it back 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.080
 non-collapsing glazes 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.390
 then insert the rubber tube 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.610
 inside the base and then I paste it 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.610
 two more floors above 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.670
 alternatively you can also 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.670
 use magic 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.190
 make the pot asthmatic lively e 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.740
 colored date to glue one by one 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.830
 of the bays with the attack all colored 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.880
 so I patiently take it easy 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.880
 le neck 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.940
 I decided to put in my place a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.580
 enamels here on my desk 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.590
 here next to the photo with my brother 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.730
 my sister when we were really a lot 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.320
 very small 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.240
