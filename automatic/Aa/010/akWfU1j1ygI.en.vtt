00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.270 
on cinematics the first thing we did on
all<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.720> them<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.050> sat<00:00:19.200> together<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.160> we

said what was the intention and so I was

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.170 
said what was the intention and so I was
like<00:00:22.770> hey<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.100> reason<00:00:23.250> he<00:00:23.490> salutes<00:00:23.790> there<00:00:24.029> or

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
like hey the reason he salutes there or

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.640 
like hey the reason he salutes there or
the<00:00:24.270> reason<00:00:24.540> he<00:00:24.660> kind<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.869> hesitates<00:00:25.020> there<00:00:25.500> or

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
the reason he kind of hesitates there or

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.080 
the reason he kind of hesitates there or
the<00:00:25.710> reason<00:00:25.950> what<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.460> were<00:00:26.580> trying<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> get

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the reason what we were trying to get

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.330 
the reason what we were trying to get
across<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.869> now<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.650> our<00:00:28.770> time<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.040> so

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
across was this now is our time and so

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.859 
across was this now is our time and so
Kyle<00:00:29.790> and<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.000> went<00:00:30.210> back<00:00:30.330> through<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.690> found

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
Kyle and I went back through and found

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.110 
Kyle and I went back through and found
places<00:00:31.500> where<00:00:31.830> we<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.070> say<00:00:32.250> oh<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:32.760> is<00:00:32.940> more

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
places where we can say oh this is more

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.880 
places where we can say oh this is more
meaningful<00:00:33.330> this<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.900> more<00:00:34.080> interesting<00:00:34.590> this

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
meaningful this is more interesting this

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.229 
meaningful this is more interesting this
is<00:00:35.040> how<00:00:35.160> we<00:00:35.220> would<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.550> done<00:00:35.699> it<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.090> had

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
is how we would have done it if we had

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.870 
is how we would have done it if we had
the<00:00:36.330> time<00:00:36.510> originally

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.000 

you<00:00:43.210> know<00:00:43.330> our<00:00:43.450> first<00:00:43.720> step<00:00:44.380> in<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.560> process

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
you know our first step in the process

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.980 
you know our first step in the process
was<00:00:45.160> to<00:00:45.340> sit<00:00:45.520> down<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:45.880> watch<00:00:45.970> everything<00:00:46.540> get

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
was to sit down and watch everything get

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.470 
was to sit down and watch everything get
rods<00:00:47.170> feedback<00:00:47.590> on<00:00:47.800> it<00:00:48.010> really<00:00:48.910> kind<00:00:49.120> of<00:00:49.150> focus

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
rods feedback on it really kind of focus

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.090 
rods feedback on it really kind of focus
on<00:00:49.570> those<00:00:49.720> key<00:00:49.930> moments<00:00:50.110> that<00:00:50.350> he<00:00:50.620> wanted<00:00:50.950> to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
on those key moments that he wanted to

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.820 
on those key moments that he wanted to
really<00:00:51.460> you<00:00:51.610> know<00:00:51.640> nail<00:00:52.450> so<00:00:52.990> what<00:00:53.470> we<00:00:53.590> wanted

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
really you know nail so what we wanted

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.550 
really you know nail so what we wanted
to<00:00:53.920> do<00:00:54.040> is<00:00:54.280> work<00:00:55.090> on<00:00:55.270> roms<00:00:55.750> execution<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.350> men

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
to do is work on roms execution of men

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.740 
to do is work on roms execution of men
there's<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:57.010> lot<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:57.520> went<00:00:57.730> into<00:00:57.970> that<00:00:58.300> moment

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
there's a lot that went into that moment

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.280 
there's a lot that went into that moment
and<00:00:58.960> trying<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.440> make<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.130> hate<00:01:00.400> ROM<00:01:01.080> show<00:01:02.080> his

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
and trying to make you hate ROM show his

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.850 
and trying to make you hate ROM show his
power<00:01:02.500> but<00:01:03.220> and<00:01:03.820> then<00:01:04.030> transition<00:01:04.870> the<00:01:05.350> power

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
power but and then transition the power

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.770 
power but and then transition the power
within<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.280> squad<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.760> Marcus<00:01:07.150> on<00:01:07.420> all<00:01:07.600> the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
cinematics for this year's game we kind

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.330 
cinematics for this year's game we kind
of<00:01:09.400> had<00:01:09.550> already<00:01:10.150> a<00:01:10.420> template<00:01:10.960> in<00:01:11.170> place<00:01:11.350> from

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
of had already a template in place from

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.980 
of had already a template in place from
the<00:01:12.520> original<00:01:12.910> we<00:01:13.240> tried<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.510> punch<00:01:13.690> up<00:01:13.840> some

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
the original we tried to punch up some

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.930 
the original we tried to punch up some
of<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.110> sequences<00:01:14.640> storyboarding<00:01:15.640> was<00:01:15.760> kind

of the sequences storyboarding was kind

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.550 
of the sequences storyboarding was kind
of<00:01:15.970> integral<00:01:16.300> to<00:01:16.420> that<00:01:16.600> kind<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.020> figuring<00:01:17.440> out

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
of integral to that kind of figuring out

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.380 
of integral to that kind of figuring out
what<00:01:17.860> we<00:01:17.979> wanted<00:01:18.250> to<00:01:18.310> what<00:01:18.760> we<00:01:18.850> want<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.180> play

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
same we wanted to get a lot grittier and

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.290 
same we wanted to get a lot grittier and
that<00:01:23.619> was<00:01:23.740> really<00:01:23.860> fun<00:01:24.190> as<00:01:24.400> far<00:01:24.580> as<00:01:24.610> especially

that was really fun as far as especially
from<00:01:25.540> an<00:01:25.630> animation<00:01:25.900> standpoint<00:01:26.470> because<00:01:26.650> we

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
from an animation standpoint because we

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.680 
from an animation standpoint because we
could<00:01:26.920> really<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.700> know<00:01:27.820> we<00:01:27.970> had<00:01:28.360> these<00:01:28.509> big

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
across the room which was really fun to

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.249 
across the room which was really fun to
shoot<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.479> animators<00:01:34.810> had<00:01:34.930> a<00:01:34.960> great<00:01:35.140> time

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
shoot the animators had a great time

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.780 
shoot the animators had a great time
working<00:01:35.470> on<00:01:35.619> that<00:01:35.680> as<00:01:35.860> well<00:01:36.009> the<00:01:36.280> death<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.610> men

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
working on that as well the death of men

working on that as well the death of men
was<00:01:37.060> really<00:01:38.100> challenging<00:01:39.100> whenever<00:01:39.520> we<00:01:39.700> get

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
was really challenging whenever we get
