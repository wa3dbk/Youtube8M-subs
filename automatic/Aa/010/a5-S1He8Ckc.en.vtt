problems probably put out about 500
miles<00:00:11.250> since<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.820> had<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.030> clean<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.509> last<00:00:12.780> time

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
miles since we had to clean it last time

because<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.559> idle<00:00:13.860> Jack<00:00:14.070> got<00:00:14.309> plugged<00:00:14.670> now<00:00:17.510> it

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
because the idle Jack got plugged now it

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.580 
because the idle Jack got plugged now it
idles<00:00:18.869> perfect<00:00:19.529> but<00:00:20.189> when<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.400> go<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.550> Revit

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
idles perfect but when you go to Revit

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.560 
idles perfect but when you go to Revit
it<00:00:22.590> cuts<00:00:22.859> out<00:00:23.100> because<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.519> main<00:00:23.730> jet<00:00:24.060> into

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
it cuts out because the main jet into

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.859 
it cuts out because the main jet into
this<00:00:24.689> clog<00:00:25.109> now<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:26.060> once<00:00:27.060> again<00:00:27.480> we'll<00:00:27.720> be

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
this clog now so once again we'll be

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.380 
this clog now so once again we'll be
popping<00:00:28.349> off<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.500> side<00:00:28.980> panel<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
popping off a side panel to get to the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.540 
popping off a side panel to get to the
carb<00:00:30.710> now<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.769> got<00:00:31.980> all<00:00:32.189> them<00:00:32.430> clips<00:00:32.759> loose<00:00:34.550> get

your pulse panel right here off comes

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.139 
your pulse panel right here off comes
your<00:00:45.870> panel<00:00:48.590> then<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:50.129> got<00:00:50.370> your<00:00:50.550> carb<00:00:50.820> right

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
your panel then just got your carb right

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.170 
your panel then just got your carb right
back<00:00:51.480> there<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.309> we're<00:00:53.489> gonna<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.940> this

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
back there and what we're gonna do this

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.049 
back there and what we're gonna do this
time<00:00:54.480> probably<00:00:54.829> cuz<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> second

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
time probably cuz this is the second

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.819 
time probably cuz this is the second
time<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.449> plug<00:00:57.809> now<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.590> under<00:00:59.039> 500<00:00:59.730> miles

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
time it's plug now and under 500 miles

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.860 
time it's plug now and under 500 miles
this<00:01:01.829> fuel<00:01:02.190> right<00:01:02.399> here<00:01:02.730> there's<00:01:03.390> absolutely

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
this fuel right here there's absolutely

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.170 
this fuel right here there's absolutely
no<00:01:04.019> filter<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:05.100> screen<00:01:05.640> thing

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
no filter you get a little screen thing

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.520 
no filter you get a little screen thing
coming<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.900> thing<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.140> bottom<00:01:07.470> of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
coming out of the thing on the bottom of

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.770 
coming out of the thing on the bottom of
your<00:01:07.619> gas<00:01:07.860> tank<00:01:08.030> but<00:01:09.030> there's<00:01:09.270> still<00:01:09.510> dirt

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
your gas tank but there's still dirt

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.690 
your gas tank but there's still dirt
getting<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.470> carb<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.369> figure<00:01:11.610> we'll

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
getting in that carb so we figure we'll

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.130 
getting in that carb so we figure we'll
put<00:01:11.880> an<00:01:11.970> inline<00:01:12.390> fuel<00:01:12.780> filter<00:01:13.200> right<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.560> here

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
put an inline fuel filter right in here

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.929 
put an inline fuel filter right in here
well<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.560> case<00:01:16.830> ours<00:01:17.189> doesn't<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.729> an

look at the light with it can't tell on
the<00:02:54.360> camera<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.670> can<00:02:56.670> still<00:02:56.970> see<00:02:57.239> through

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the camera but I can still see through

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.039 
the camera but I can still see through
it<00:02:57.810> some<00:02:59.299> so<00:03:00.299> you'll<00:03:00.390> see<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.570> little<00:03:00.810> bit<00:03:00.930> of

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
it some so you'll see a little bit of

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.199 
it some so you'll see a little bit of
light<00:03:01.230> through<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.470> jet<00:03:01.880> but<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.060> is

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
light through the jet but it is

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.970 
light through the jet but it is
partially<00:03:03.870> flogged<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.410> can<00:03:04.590> see<00:03:04.799> that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
partially flogged you can see that

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.940 
partially flogged you can see that
that's<00:03:05.220> partially<00:03:06.079> restricted<00:03:07.489> so<00:03:08.489> I'll<00:03:08.700> take

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950
