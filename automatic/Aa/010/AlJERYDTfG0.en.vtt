olive oil now since this is a nonstick
pan<00:02:08.050> we<00:02:08.289> won't<00:02:08.470> need<00:02:08.740> much<00:02:08.979> oil

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
pan we won't need much oil

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.809

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
while that pan is heating up I'm going

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.400 
while that pan is heating up I'm going
to<00:02:15.069> get<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.670> toasts<00:02:16.120> ready<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.230> just

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
to get the toasts ready so this is just

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.380 
to get the toasts ready so this is just
regular<00:02:17.950> bread<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.670> I'm<00:02:18.790> using<00:02:19.000> regular

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390

regular bread that I'm using regular
everyday<00:02:20.050> bread<00:02:20.440> but<00:02:20.950> if<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.280> want<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.580> use

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
everyday bread but if you want to use

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.930 
everyday bread but if you want to use
any<00:02:21.910> fancy<00:02:22.270> bread<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.020> can<00:02:23.200> do<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.500> too<00:02:23.940> I'm

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
any fancy bread you can do that too I'm

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.780 
any fancy bread you can do that too I'm
just<00:02:25.210> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.480> dip<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:25.960> in<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.620> custard

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.700 

so<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.850> want<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.180> use<00:02:31.360> slightly<00:02:32.080> stale<00:02:32.440> bread

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
so you want to use slightly stale bread

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.920 
so you want to use slightly stale bread
about<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.100> day<00:02:33.370> old<00:02:33.580> or<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.120> not<00:02:34.330> fresh<00:02:34.660> bread

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
because that will break up completely in

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.980 
because that will break up completely in
the<00:02:36.520> custard<00:02:36.880> will<00:02:37.000> just<00:02:37.210> get<00:02:37.360> mushy<00:02:37.720> and
