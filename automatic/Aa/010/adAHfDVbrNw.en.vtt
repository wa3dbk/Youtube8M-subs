00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
built a rig while blunders compositing

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.280 
built a rig while blunders compositing
nodes<00:00:38.360> are<00:00:39.800> pretty<00:00:40.800> good<00:00:41.100> especially<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
nodes are pretty good especially the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
nodes are pretty good especially the
glare<00:00:43.290> nodes<00:00:43.559> etc<00:00:44.100> they<00:00:44.250> have<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.550> have<00:00:44.730> an

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
glare nodes etc they have to have an

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.810 
glare nodes etc they have to have an
existing<00:00:45.379> pixels<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.500> work<00:00:46.649> with<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.700> your

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
existing pixels to work with and if your

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790 
existing pixels to work with and if your
son<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> frame<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.559> really

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
son is just out of frame you really

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.770 
son is just out of frame you really
don't<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.070> any<00:00:50.250> pixels<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> work<00:00:50.969> with<00:00:52.070> so

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
don't have any pixels to work with so

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.819 
don't have any pixels to work with so

come into scene and we're going to go to

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.399 
come into scene and we're going to go to
lens<00:01:12.930> flare<00:01:13.200> let's<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.100> ahead<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.280> link<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> in

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
lens flare let's go ahead and link it in

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.090 
lens flare let's go ahead and link it in
now<00:01:17.509> we'll<00:01:18.509> go<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.720> our<00:01:19.020> node<00:01:19.710> editor<00:01:21.560> and<00:01:22.560> as

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
now we'll go to our node editor and as

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
now we'll go to our node editor and as
you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.110> nodes

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
you can see here we have all the nodes

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.560 
you can see here we have all the nodes
that<00:01:25.560> made<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.430> scene<00:01:26.729> possible<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.450> it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that made this scene possible and it's

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.980 
that made this scene possible and it's
really<00:01:27.750> not<00:01:27.960> terribly<00:01:28.710> complex<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.990> we're

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
really not terribly complex and we're

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.020 
really not terribly complex and we're
going<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.229> add<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.860> node<00:01:32.220> group<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.850> got

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
going to add in a node group that we got

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.140 
going to add in a node group that we got
from<00:01:33.299> our<00:01:33.540> lens<00:01:34.530> flare<00:01:34.829> scene<00:01:35.159> you'll<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.030> we

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
from our lens flare scene you'll see we

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.080 
from our lens flare scene you'll see we
have<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.479> scene<00:01:36.750> right<00:01:36.900> there<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
have that scene right there and I go to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.109 
have that scene right there and I go to
add<00:01:40.460> group<00:01:41.750> lens<00:01:42.750> flare<00:01:43.079> Angie<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.850> ng<00:01:44.850> just

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
add group lens flare Angie and ng just

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.160 
add group lens flare Angie and ng just
stands<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.630> node<00:01:46.110> group<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.799> drop<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.790> right

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
stands for node group and drop it right

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.010 
stands for node group and drop it right
onto<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.860> viewer<00:01:51.140> now<00:01:52.140> you'll<00:01:52.380> notice<00:01:52.970> here

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
onto the viewer now you'll notice here

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.840 
onto the viewer now you'll notice here
you've<00:01:55.020> got<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.439> underlying<00:01:55.950> image<00:01:56.310> or

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you've got this underlying image or

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.499 
you've got this underlying image or
render<00:01:57.630> layer<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.130> that's<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.850> default

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
render layer and that's this default

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.560 
render layer and that's this default
backdrop<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.229> then<00:02:01.380> we've<00:02:01.530> got<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:02.570> flare

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
backdrop and then we've got this flare

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.740 
backdrop and then we've got this flare
geometry<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:04.860> we're<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.189> get<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
geometry now we're going to get that

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.650 
geometry now we're going to get that
also<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> part<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:08.700> scene<00:02:09.030> we're<00:02:09.539> going

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
also as a part of the scene we're going

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.309 
also as a part of the scene we're going
to<00:02:09.780> add<00:02:11.420> render<00:02:12.420> layers

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
to add render layers

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.589 
to add render layers
I'm<00:02:13.769> going<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> go<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.189> the<00:02:14.670> lens<00:02:15.030> flare<00:02:15.299> scene

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
I'm going to go to the lens flare scene

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.589 
I'm going to go to the lens flare scene
and<00:02:16.340> we're<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:17.489> going<00:02:17.579> to<00:02:17.730> drag<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.389> drop

that<00:02:18.980> over<00:02:19.980> onto<00:02:20.280> there<00:02:21.200> now<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.260> still<00:02:22.799> don't

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
that over onto there now we still don't

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.449 
that over onto there now we still don't
have<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:24.030> lens<00:02:24.239> flare<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.659> you<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:24.959> see<00:02:25.170> and

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
have the lens flare as you can see and

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.349 
have the lens flare as you can see and
there's<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.519> couple<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.879> reasons<00:02:26.999> for<00:02:27.299> that

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
there's a couple of reasons for that

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.690 
there's a couple of reasons for that
first<00:02:27.659> of<00:02:27.780> all<00:02:27.930> I'm<00:02:28.889> going<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.099> go<00:02:29.219> to<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.430> 3d

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
first of all I'm going to go to the 3d

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.899 
first of all I'm going to go to the 3d
view<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.239> see<00:02:30.510> what<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.519> lens<00:02:32.519> flare

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
view so you can see what the lens flare

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.170 
view so you can see what the lens flare
actually<00:02:33.629> looks<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.790> yeah<00:02:35.790> there<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.120> is

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
actually looks like yeah there it is

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.970 
actually looks like yeah there it is
from<00:02:36.389> camera<00:02:36.719> perspective<00:02:37.049> if<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.829> were<00:02:37.889> to

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
from camera perspective if I were to

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.110 
from camera perspective if I were to
look<00:02:38.069> at<00:02:38.219> it<00:02:38.370> from<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.579> side<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.939> can<00:02:39.090> see

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
look at it from the side you can see

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.789 
look at it from the side you can see
that<00:02:40.459> we've<00:02:41.459> got<00:02:41.489> just<00:02:41.969> a<00:02:42.090> few<00:02:42.150> elements<00:02:43.109> here

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.289 

here<00:02:46.799> we<00:02:46.950> have<00:02:47.069> our<00:02:47.129> imaginary<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:47.969> and<00:02:48.209> we

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
here we have our imaginary so and we

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.740 
here we have our imaginary so and we
have<00:02:48.450> some<00:02:48.689> rays<00:02:48.959> for<00:02:49.349> it<00:02:49.439> to<00:02:50.090> cast<00:02:51.090> off<00:02:51.299> we've

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
have some rays for it to cast off we've

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.530 
have some rays for it to cast off we've
got<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:52.019> back<00:02:52.400> glaring<00:02:53.400> disc<00:02:53.849> thing<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.389> have

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
got this back glaring disc thing we have

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.039 
got this back glaring disc thing we have
some<00:02:54.739> hexagonal<00:02:55.969> elements<00:02:56.969> here<00:02:57.120> all<00:02:57.659> of<00:02:57.959> them

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
some hexagonal elements here all of them

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.909 
some hexagonal elements here all of them
are<00:02:58.230> tied<00:02:58.439> to<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:59.510> string<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.810> vertices<00:03:01.680> it's

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
are tied to this string of vertices it's

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.479 
are tied to this string of vertices it's
just<00:03:02.099> an<00:03:02.250> edge<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.819> won't<00:03:03.030> render<00:03:04.370> then<00:03:05.370> when

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
just an edge it won't render then when

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.580 
just an edge it won't render then when
you<00:03:05.579> move<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.939> around<00:03:05.969> by<00:03:06.659> just<00:03:06.930> rotating<00:03:07.109> it

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
you move it around by just rotating it

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.589 
you move it around by just rotating it
along<00:03:07.829> this<00:03:08.519> controls<00:03:10.669> axes<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.989> x<00:03:13.199> and<00:03:13.439> z<00:03:14.599> if

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
along this controls axes the x and z if

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.839 
along this controls axes the x and z if
you<00:03:15.810> look<00:03:16.139> here<00:03:16.709> in<00:03:16.829> this<00:03:16.919> lens<00:03:17.189> flare<00:03:17.459> seen<00:03:17.699> in

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
you look here in this lens flare seen in

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.240 
you look here in this lens flare seen in
your<00:03:17.970> outliner<00:03:18.389> you'll<00:03:19.379> see<00:03:19.709> you've<00:03:19.919> got<00:03:20.069> the

I'm going to go ahead and scale this

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.479 
I'm going to go ahead and scale this
thing<00:03:56.639> along<00:03:57.180> its<00:03:57.389> local<00:03:57.780> y<00:03:58.019> axis<00:03:58.650> hitting

thing along its local y axis hitting
wide<00:03:59.699> twice<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.590> they'll<00:04:02.250> bring<00:04:02.519> those<00:04:02.790> out

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
wide twice and they'll bring those out

these elements are vertex parented to
this<00:04:06.689> edge<00:04:07.229> and<00:04:08.780> will<00:04:09.780> keep<00:04:10.530> their<00:04:11.150> elements

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
this edge and will keep their elements

orthogonal with the camera and that's an

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.599 
orthogonal with the camera and that's an
important<00:04:14.519> thing<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:14.969> note<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:16.430> that<00:04:17.430> you

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
important thing to note and that you

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.849 
important thing to note and that you
don't<00:04:17.849> want<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.509> flare<00:04:18.840> element<00:04:19.289> to<00:04:19.440> appear

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
don't want a flare element to appear

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.310 
don't want a flare element to appear
like<00:04:20.070> it's<00:04:20.310> going<00:04:20.639> that's<00:04:21.269> skewed<00:04:21.930> against

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
like it's going that's skewed against

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.240 
like it's going that's skewed against
the<00:04:22.409> camera

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
the camera

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.280 
the camera
look<00:04:23.370> right<00:04:25.040> so<00:04:26.480> we're<00:04:27.480> going<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.690> go<00:04:27.810> back<00:04:28.050> to

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
look right so we're going to go back to

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.530 
look right so we're going to go back to
our<00:04:28.320> now<00:04:29.070> we've<00:04:29.220> got<00:04:29.370> this<00:04:29.580> positioned<00:04:30.150> we're

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
our now we've got this positioned we're

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.070 
our now we've got this positioned we're
going<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.750> go<00:04:30.840> back<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.110> our<00:04:31.260> earth<00:04:31.710> scene<00:04:33.080> well

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
going to go back to our earth scene well

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:42.140 
going to go back to our earth scene well
go<00:04:34.920> into<00:04:35.340> our<00:04:35.640> nose<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:40.730> we<00:04:41.730> still<00:04:41.940> don't<00:04:42.120> have

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
go into our nose and we still don't have

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.560 
go into our nose and we still don't have
this<00:04:42.900> flare<00:04:43.530> because<00:04:44.070> we<00:04:44.220> haven't<00:04:44.570> rendered

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
this flare because we haven't rendered

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.630 
this flare because we haven't rendered
the<00:04:45.990> node<00:04:46.170> elements<00:04:46.590> now<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.130> actually<00:04:47.580> a

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
the node elements now this is actually a

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.700 
the node elements now this is actually a
full<00:04:47.910> render<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:49.080> earth<00:04:49.200> sea<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:49.530> I'm

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
full render of the earth sea and I'm

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.990 
full render of the earth sea and I'm
just<00:04:49.860> kind<00:04:50.010> of<00:04:50.130> adding<00:04:51.030> in<00:04:51.240> my<00:04:51.750> own

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
just kind of adding in my own

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.340 
just kind of adding in my own
compositing<00:04:54.000> layers<00:04:54.270> here<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:56.550> it's<00:04:56.730> going<00:04:56.940> to

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
compositing layers here so it's going to

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.830 
compositing layers here so it's going to
render<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.790> lens<00:04:59.790> flare<00:05:00.060> elements<00:05:00.570> all<00:05:00.690> by

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
render the lens flare elements all by

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.120 
render the lens flare elements all by

an<00:05:05.669> hour<00:05:05.760> and<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:05.970> half<00:05:06.120> on<00:05:06.300> my<00:05:06.419> computer<00:05:06.840> to

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
an hour and a half on my computer to

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.760 
an hour and a half on my computer to

render its going to go through the
compositing<00:05:17.010> stage<00:05:17.930> now<00:05:18.930> it<00:05:18.990> didn't<00:05:19.230> pop<00:05:19.320> up

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
compositing stage now it didn't pop up

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.560 
compositing stage now it didn't pop up
here<00:05:19.770> because<00:05:19.950> I'm<00:05:20.250> actually<00:05:20.640> tied<00:05:21.030> it<00:05:21.180> in<00:05:21.330> yet

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
here because I'm actually tied it in yet

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.900 
here because I'm actually tied it in yet
to<00:05:22.190> the<00:05:23.190> composite<00:05:23.790> output<00:05:24.090> only<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.910> view

to the composite output only to the view
our<00:05:27.060> output<00:05:27.479> I'll<00:05:28.440> drag<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:28.770> composite<00:05:29.190> over

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
our output I'll drag this composite over

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.080 
our output I'll drag this composite over
connect<00:05:31.800> it<00:05:31.950> up<00:05:32.010> so<00:05:32.370> we'll<00:05:32.520> be<00:05:32.640> able<00:05:32.700> to<00:05:32.880> see<00:05:33.060> it

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
connect it up so we'll be able to see it

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.320 
connect it up so we'll be able to see it
there<00:05:33.360> as<00:05:33.479> well<00:05:33.690> and<00:05:33.960> we'll<00:05:34.410> wait<00:05:34.560> for<00:05:34.800> this

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
there as well and we'll wait for this

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.550 
there as well and we'll wait for this
compositing<00:05:36.330> step<00:05:36.600> to<00:05:36.750> finish<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.380> should

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
compositing step to finish it should

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:46.620 
compositing step to finish it should
just<00:05:37.680> take<00:05:37.890> a<00:05:37.919> few<00:05:38.160> seconds

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.480 

and<00:05:47.320> there<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:47.770> go<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:49.630> see<00:05:49.900> we<00:05:50.280> move<00:05:51.280> this

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
and there you go and see we move this

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.640 
and there you go and see we move this
around<00:05:51.670> and<00:05:52.000> holding<00:05:52.300> down<00:05:52.390> alt<00:05:52.630> in<00:05:52.900> middle

and if I flip over to our you PM is
editor<00:06:01.300> you<00:06:01.450> can<00:06:01.480> see<00:06:01.920> here<00:06:02.920> it<00:06:03.070> is<00:06:03.210> fully<00:06:04.210> done

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
editor you can see here it is fully done

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.450 
editor you can see here it is fully done
and<00:06:06.790> there's<00:06:06.940> a<00:06:07.030> few<00:06:07.560> minor<00:06:08.560> controls<00:06:09.070> that<00:06:09.220> we

and there's a few minor controls that we

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.020 
and there's a few minor controls that we

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
have on the node group itself if I flip

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.200 
have on the node group itself if I flip
back<00:06:13.210> to<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.450> node<00:06:13.660> editor<00:06:14.850> the<00:06:15.850> flare

individual elements the glare brightness

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.730 
individual elements the glare brightness
is<00:06:25.750> the<00:06:26.410> practice<00:06:26.740> of<00:06:26.890> the<00:06:27.850> glare<00:06:28.060> go<00:06:28.480> fig<00:06:28.740> so

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
is the practice of the glare go fig so

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.480 
is the practice of the glare go fig so
if<00:06:30.190> we<00:06:30.670> wanted<00:06:30.970> to<00:06:31.650> brighten<00:06:32.650> these<00:06:32.950> up<00:06:33.190> right

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
if we wanted to brighten these up right

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.860 
if we wanted to brighten these up right
now<00:06:33.730> they<00:06:34.060> are<00:06:34.890> set<00:06:35.890> I<00:06:36.220> think<00:06:36.850> two<00:06:37.180> point<00:06:37.660> six

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
now they are set I think two point six

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.660 
now they are set I think two point six
and<00:06:38.110> one<00:06:38.290> so<00:06:38.590> if<00:06:38.710> we<00:06:38.830> really<00:06:39.070> wanted<00:06:39.340> to<00:06:39.460> play

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
and one so if we really wanted to play

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.000 
and one so if we really wanted to play
with<00:06:39.700> that<00:06:39.970> we<00:06:40.150> could<00:06:40.330> say<00:06:40.540> bring<00:06:41.470> our<00:06:41.620> flare

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
with that we could say bring our flare

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.280 
with that we could say bring our flare
brightness<00:06:42.430> all<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.670> way<00:06:42.790> up<00:06:42.880> to<00:06:42.910> say<00:06:43.210> 1.2<00:06:43.870> and

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
brightness all the way up to say 1.2 and

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.420 
brightness all the way up to say 1.2 and
our<00:06:44.550> globe<00:06:45.550> brightness<00:06:46.120> up<00:06:46.390> to<00:06:46.750> say<00:06:47.230> one<00:06:47.830> point

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
our globe brightness up to say one point

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:57.700 
our globe brightness up to say one point
seven<00:06:48.940> or<00:06:49.330> so<00:06:50.760> and<00:06:51.810> let<00:06:52.810> those<00:06:52.930> composite

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.749 

let's<00:06:58.710> compositing<00:06:59.340> i'm<00:06:59.460> just<00:06:59.610> going<00:06:59.729> to

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
let's compositing i'm just going to

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.330 
let's compositing i'm just going to
reposition<00:07:00.180> in<00:07:00.449> these<00:07:00.629> nodes<00:07:01.039> so<00:07:02.039> if<00:07:02.189> they're

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
reposition in these nodes so if they're

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.149 
reposition in these nodes so if they're
kind<00:07:02.580> of<00:07:02.669> out<00:07:02.819> of<00:07:02.849> the<00:07:02.969> way<00:07:03.590> and<00:07:04.590> there<00:07:04.979> we<00:07:05.099> go

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:05.159 
kind of out of the way and there we go

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.790
