00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.269 

again<00:00:26.179> you're<00:00:26.900> going<00:00:27.050> to<00:00:27.140> have<00:00:27.349> to<00:00:27.859> learn<00:00:28.070> the

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
again you're going to have to learn the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.829 
again you're going to have to learn the
two<00:00:28.429> simpler<00:00:28.730> steps<00:00:28.939> I<00:00:29.060> just<00:00:29.089> mentioned<00:00:29.599> which

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:29.839 
two simpler steps I just mentioned which

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.000 
two simpler steps I just mentioned which
is<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.349> sonic<00:00:31.989> specifically<00:00:32.989> sonic<00:00:33.379> three

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
is the sonic specifically sonic three

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.110 
is the sonic specifically sonic three
four<00:00:34.280> two<00:00:34.579> two<00:00:34.610> three<00:00:35.260> which<00:00:36.260> is<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.710> bottom

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
four two two three which is the bottom

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.520 
four two two three which is the bottom
which<00:00:38.120> involves<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:38.809> bottom<00:00:39.019> three<00:00:39.199> fingers

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
which involves the bottom three fingers

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.119 
which involves the bottom three fingers
of<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:39.860> hand<00:00:40.540> learn<00:00:41.540> how<00:00:41.659> these<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:42.800> sonic

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
of the hand learn how these the sonic

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.360 
of the hand learn how these the sonic
there<00:00:43.339> and<00:00:43.600> then<00:00:44.600> learn<00:00:45.559> how<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:45.800> do<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.040> past

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
there and then learn how to do a past

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.319 
there and then learn how to do a past
verse<00:00:46.729> and<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:49.190> get<00:00:49.309> your<00:00:49.370> one<00:00:49.519> foot<00:00:49.729> you<00:00:50.120> get

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
verse and you get your one foot you get

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.100 
verse and you get your one foot you get
your<00:00:50.449> one<00:00:50.540> point<00:00:50.659> five<00:00:50.870> evolutions<00:00:51.290> from<00:00:53.110> if

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
your one point five evolutions from if

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.899 
your one point five evolutions from if
you<00:00:54.409> I'm<00:00:54.589> not<00:00:54.739> sure<00:00:54.829> if<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:54.979> seeis<00:00:55.250> but<00:00:55.430> you

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
you I'm not sure if you seeis but you

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.270 
you I'm not sure if you seeis but you
look<00:00:56.120> at<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.269> blue<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:57.559> blue<00:00:57.710> grip<00:00:57.890> on<00:00:58.009> my<00:00:58.100> pen

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
look at the blue the blue grip on my pen

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.890 
look at the blue the blue grip on my pen
will<00:00:58.400> help<00:00:58.549> you<00:00:58.610> keep<00:00:58.729> track<00:00:58.790> when<00:00:59.659> you<00:00:59.750> do<00:00:59.809> the

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
will help you keep track when you do the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.149 
will help you keep track when you do the
sign<00:01:00.850> there's<00:01:01.850> half<00:01:02.089> and<00:01:02.650> then<00:01:03.650> we<00:01:03.920> do<00:01:04.070> the

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
sign there's half and then we do the

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.179 
sign there's half and then we do the
pass<00:01:04.840> there's<00:01:05.840> another<00:01:06.020> half<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:06.799> that's<00:01:06.890> one

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
pass there's another half so that's one

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.600 
pass there's another half so that's one
and<00:01:07.460> then<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:09.170> have<00:01:09.409> it<00:01:09.860> went<00:01:10.040> swings<00:01:10.430> into

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
and then you have it went swings into

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.399 
and then you have it went swings into
your<00:01:10.729> hand<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.509> that's<00:01:11.600> another<00:01:11.840> point<00:01:12.110> five

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
your hand and that's another point five

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.630 
your hand and that's another point five
so<00:01:12.860> that's<00:01:12.920> where<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.159> get<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.340> one<00:01:13.460> point

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
so that's where you get the one point

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.010 
so that's where you get the one point
five<00:01:13.790> revolutions<00:01:13.970> of<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.509> diamond<00:01:14.900> sonic

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
five revolutions of the diamond sonic

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.410 
five revolutions of the diamond sonic
this<00:01:18.020> trick<00:01:18.229> is<00:01:18.350> pretty<00:01:19.240> it's<00:01:20.240> easy

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
this trick is pretty it's easy

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.030 
this trick is pretty it's easy
understand<00:01:20.960> but<00:01:21.170> harder<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.650> do

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
understand but harder to do

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.420 
understand but harder to do
I<00:01:22.070> found<00:01:22.970> that<00:01:23.119> doing<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.509> sonic<00:01:23.869> and<00:01:24.020> the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
I found that doing the sonic and the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.270 
I found that doing the sonic and the
lower<00:01:25.430> finger<00:01:26.149> slides<00:01:27.159> plate<00:01:28.159> more

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
lower finger slides plate more

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.380 
lower finger slides plate more
challenging<00:01:28.640> than<00:01:28.790> doing<00:01:28.970> it<00:01:29.060> in<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.180> top

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
challenging than doing it in the top

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.320 
challenging than doing it in the top
finger<00:01:30.140> slot<00:01:30.350> because<00:01:31.280> that's<00:01:31.670> why<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:32.150> learn

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
finger slot because that's why you learn

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.640 
finger slot because that's why you learn
it<00:01:32.540> when<00:01:32.659> you're<00:01:32.810> learning<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.140> fundamental

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
it when you're learning the fundamental

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.750 
it when you're learning the fundamental
but<00:01:34.310> using<00:01:35.180> apply<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.540> same<00:01:36.520> concept<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.610> the

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
but using apply the same concept to the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.060 
but using apply the same concept to the
lower<00:01:37.940> fingers<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:39.110> can<00:01:39.380> do<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.680> sonic

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
lower fingers so you can do the sonic

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.969 
lower fingers so you can do the sonic
and<00:01:40.250> then<00:01:41.210> instead<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.659> catching<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.620> sonic

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
and then instead of catching the sonic

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.039 
and then instead of catching the sonic
right<00:01:43.280> after<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.729> do<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:43.909> you<00:01:44.210> want<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.840> catch

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
right after you do it you want to catch

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.860 
right after you do it you want to catch
it<00:01:45.350> will<00:01:46.070> not<00:01:46.190> catch<00:01:46.370> it<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.729> want<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:47.090> get

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
it will not catch it but you want to get

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.350 
it will not catch it but you want to get
to<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.170> point<00:01:48.470> where<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:48.950> like<00:01:48.979> right<00:01:49.370> here

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
to a point where it's like right here

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.420 
to a point where it's like right here
and<00:01:50.950> that<00:01:51.950> will<00:01:52.100> be<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:54.500> would<00:01:54.650> be<00:01:54.740> after<00:01:55.040> you

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
and that will be that would be after you

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.399 
and that will be that would be after you
do<00:01:55.549> it<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:55.909> inside<00:01:56.510> a<00:01:56.540> path<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:56.960> want<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.200> get

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
do it it's inside a path you want to get

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.609 
do it it's inside a path you want to get
until<00:01:58.340> it's<00:01:58.490> about<00:01:58.580> this<00:01:59.000> point<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.690> that's

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
until it's about this point and that's

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.030 
until it's about this point and that's
exactly<00:02:00.920> explain<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.700> but<00:02:03.190> it's<00:02:04.190> just<00:02:05.119> about

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
exactly explain that but it's just about

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.740 
exactly explain that but it's just about
at<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.400> first<00:02:08.289> joint<00:02:09.289> in<00:02:09.439> your<00:02:09.649> ring<00:02:10.310> finger

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
at the first joint in your ring finger

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.839 
at the first joint in your ring finger
it<00:02:11.750> hasn't<00:02:12.110> gone<00:02:12.200> down<00:02:12.260> yet<00:02:12.799> but<00:02:13.040> it's<00:02:13.640> still

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
it hasn't gone down yet but it's still

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.300 
it hasn't gone down yet but it's still
pointing<00:02:14.180> upwards<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.659> then<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:16.010> gotta<00:02:16.159> have

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
pointing upwards and then you gotta have

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.119 
pointing upwards and then you gotta have
to<00:02:16.400> lift<00:02:16.670> your<00:02:17.349> ring<00:02:18.349> finger<00:02:18.620> up<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.769> little<00:02:18.950> bit

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
to lift your ring finger up a little bit

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.399 
to lift your ring finger up a little bit
let<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.120> pen<00:02:20.330> spin<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.470> then<00:02:23.080> do<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.200> past

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
let the pen spin and then do the past

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.080 
let the pen spin and then do the past
verse<00:02:24.709> make<00:02:25.010> sure<00:02:25.189> you<00:02:25.280> get<00:02:25.400> your<00:02:25.580> ring<00:02:25.730> finger

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
verse make sure you get your ring finger

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.369 
verse make sure you get your ring finger
and<00:02:26.330> pinky<00:02:26.599> finger<00:02:26.810> all<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.900> way<00:02:26.989> so<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.230> I

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
and pinky finger all the way so that I

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.110 
and pinky finger all the way so that I
can<00:02:27.590> spin<00:02:28.099> around<00:02:28.689> again<00:02:29.689> the<00:02:30.049> demon<00:02:30.319> sonic

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
can spin around again the demon sonic

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.539 
can spin around again the demon sonic
looks<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.099> if<00:02:34.099> you<00:02:34.279> won't<00:02:34.430> get

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
looks like that and if you won't get

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.690 
looks like that and if you won't get
more<00:02:34.700> circular<00:02:35.209> just<00:02:35.389> keep<00:02:35.629> practicing

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
more circular just keep practicing

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.170 
more circular just keep practicing
like<00:02:37.830> sometimes<00:02:38.830> when<00:02:39.340> I'm<00:02:39.430> doing<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.849> I<00:02:39.970> don't

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
like sometimes when I'm doing it I don't

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.479 
like sometimes when I'm doing it I don't
put<00:02:40.360> enough<00:02:40.540> for<00:02:40.780> find<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:42.340> will<00:02:42.430> just

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
put enough for find it and it will just

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.729 
put enough for find it and it will just
look<00:02:42.640> really<00:02:43.060> straight<00:02:43.420> but<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.470> idea<00:02:44.709> of

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
look really straight but the idea of

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.699 
look really straight but the idea of
Sonic<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.520> Sonic<00:02:45.940> trick<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.599> hence<00:02:47.260> makes<00:02:47.560> me

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
Sonic and Sonic trick and hence makes me

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.830 
Sonic and Sonic trick and hence makes me
look<00:02:47.860> around<00:02:48.010> not<00:02:48.489> words<00:02:48.910> not<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.330> horizontal

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
look around not words not a horizontal

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.449 
look around not words not a horizontal
anyway<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.590> linear<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.920> don't<00:02:54.100> try<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.250> get

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
anyway a linear so you don't try to get

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.750 
anyway a linear so you don't try to get
around<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.340> comes<00:02:57.640> with<00:02:59.459> sometimes<00:03:00.459> it

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
around and it comes with sometimes it

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.880 
around and it comes with sometimes it
takes<00:03:01.000> speed<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.900> make<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.170> go<00:03:02.319> around<00:03:02.500> and

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
takes speed to make it go around and

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.430 
takes speed to make it go around and
momentum<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.580> also<00:03:04.480> uh<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:04.930> takes<00:03:05.260> practice

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
momentum and also uh just takes practice

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.650 
momentum and also uh just takes practice
like<00:03:05.890> always<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:10.000> I'm<00:03:10.090> really<00:03:10.209> much<00:03:10.390> more<00:03:10.569> I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
like always so I'm really much more I

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.860 
like always so I'm really much more I
can<00:03:10.750> tell<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.050> about<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.350> trick<00:03:12.000> again<00:03:13.000> can

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
can tell you about this trick again can

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.380 
can tell you about this trick again can
we<00:03:13.900> reform<00:03:14.260> palm<00:03:14.470> up<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.880> palm<00:03:15.880> down<00:03:16.060> if<00:03:16.269> you

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
we reform palm up and palm down if you

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.590 
we reform palm up and palm down if you
want<00:03:16.569> if<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.019> really<00:03:17.080> want<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:18.330> it's<00:03:19.330> hard<00:03:19.450> to

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
want if you really want to it's hard to

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.490 
want if you really want to it's hard to
do<00:03:19.690> palm<00:03:20.019> down<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.260> think<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:22.630> it's<00:03:23.319> still

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
do palm down I think but it's still

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.440 
do palm down I think but it's still
possible<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:25.920> that's<00:03:26.920> really<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.400> yeah<00:03:28.269> if
