00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.830
 Warehouse saw party members triples Is not 2 no camera which colors hair while A fragment 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.830
 In ne other countries city 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.660
 I have never seen a landscape that I've been filling the building all the way to my house . 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.430
 Is it 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.990
 I still feel like it's Tokyo 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.730
 I was surprised but still 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.370
 Of course the d 810 sensor has a high resolution 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.020
 Of course there is 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:39.330
 This really there I wonder if I say three-dimensional view of things 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.650
 It feels like I made it, but it 's a distant landscape in the infinity of kings, but it is far 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.920
 Overlapping of buildings in 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.690
 Or 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.750
 That's why 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.829
 Let's got to Bettari If this do me the case of Vader 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:55.460
 Would appear to this same is the Tteyuu this perspective of distant ones 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.250
 Whether that was closer to that seen eye with a higher 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.840
 That kind of place is really 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.840
 I will in the Fu it 's such a big welcome 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.899
 this time 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.460
 Where I wish Well better is that the Tteyuu standard of Picture Control 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:17.000
 Early and at the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:20.170
 Fine if people become a feeling that we extend to I wish you would've been worked really on the three-dimensional sense of representation 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.170
 I feel like 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:29.240
 Bytes of architectural photography Nau 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:34.430
 For the first time swing of the camera saying say the horizontal of the camera vertical it is caught caught properly 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:39.290
 It is only possible to do it after adjustment and it has been 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.940
 Shake only 2 cameos and say with 2100 at the edge of the screen using the function 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.750
 What 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.970
 The line is horizontal 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.220
 It's a place where it's neatly overlapped It's the first time the spirit is straight 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.010
 Tak that 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:58.660
 It is possible to be in the state that it is facing to the front to the face of the face architecture 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.660
 I think that will come in handy 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.820
 What you see there 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.770
 Seeing closer and closer 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.180
 I would like to express that there 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.890
 To the fact that will still become the high-definition is say so 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.120
 Because it is my own expression 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.480
 doubt that that dear bug jet is going to be your main worry from this 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.480
 It is not 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.540
 Ah ah ah ah
