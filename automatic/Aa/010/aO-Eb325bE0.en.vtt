00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
more height and the base itself now the

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.009 
more height and the base itself now the
particles<00:04:05.950> are<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.730> sparkles<00:04:07.600> are<00:04:07.720> there

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
particles are so the sparkles are there

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.990 
particles are so the sparkles are there
to<00:04:08.230> represent<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.799> GM<00:04:09.040> particles<00:04:09.519> I<00:04:09.609> believe

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
to represent the GM particles I believe

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.360 
to represent the GM particles I believe
and<00:04:10.290> it's<00:04:11.290> not<00:04:11.620> going<00:04:11.739> to<00:04:11.829> bother<00:04:12.010> me<00:04:12.340> that

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370
