00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.380
 hello amanda it's a real 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.270
 pleasure to have you here with us on 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.220
 the tgs so here everyone you 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.140
 knows as samantha carter's 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.680
 the stargate series sg 1 and stargate 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.570
 atlantis 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.590
 but you also played in sanctuary 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.840
 and supernatural so since little 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.220
 you have two passions the science and the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.449
 actor's job what do you have 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.379
 what did it do to you 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.350
 first time you put your hand 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:02.010
 on the stargate script sg1 so so 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.810
 it was absolutely great because so 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.479
 really did not expect to have the role 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.000
 that she thought it was going to leave on 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.280
 the American so she did it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.360
 the hearing by saying yes but that's it 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:24.600
 it's done it says it's a 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.060
 awesome show she did not think that that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.390
 would last accusing but she really has the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.250
 found it great so one of the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.810
 people you know and who has 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.070
 also played in stargate wanted to do 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.689
 pass a little message 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.280
 do you have anything to do 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.869
 answer and then more globally 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.159
 how was the atmosphere actually 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.390
 between the actors on the set 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.549
 savory was it rather 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:02:17.900
 happy relaxed or rather pressure ' 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:02:17.900
 clothes of the savior to sir yves bur 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.040
 so the nature message comes from cliffs 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.670
 imon is she adore she says thank you 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.890
 we find that manila cliffs did 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.080
 a so good naughty because 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.730
 precisely he was so he was a 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.730
 actor who really had a big club 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.350
 it reflects well the spirit of equipped who 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.320
 had on a 7 dvg 1 because really 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.880
 they loved playing together he was doing 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.880
 also the joke 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.340
 and it's true that it sold out 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.500
 the team that has become like a big 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.959
 family especially after ten years they 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.360
 were fighting they squabbled 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.060
 but he protected himself it was 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.640
 really a family and she finds that 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.250
 it is particularly reflected yes 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.930
 as much at the level of the image is that 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.769
 precisely here we see this cohesion 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.180
 who exists in this team then in 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.290
 all the series in which you 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.310
 played there were a lot of moments 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.540
 epics 1 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.820
 if you were given the chance to replay 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.690
 a scene the scene that has you most 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:51.209
 Mark 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:53.519
 which to flee is a choice a little 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.500
 a little difficult as you say we have 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.680
 hesitated for a moment but she thinks 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.700
 that if she were to relive 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.329
 especially special it would be the 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.329
 Norwegian pilot 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.090
 he is all together in the same hotel 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.090
 he ate together every night 

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:24.510
 replay that moment where samantha carter 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.990
 in the conference scene that would be 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.580
 this is on his time his nose actually 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.230
 it is extremely difficult to choose 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.230
 with in the exciting moments that goes 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.800
 so to finish in the series you 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.970
 play heroin trying to make the 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.740
 better world but that's also the case 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.290
 in fact in real life since you 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.310
 have founded a foundation called 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.780
 sanctuary for kids 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.910
 Can you tell us about it? 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.350
 little bit so she tells you everything 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.300
 first thank you for having his life is not 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.260
 if it's really so nice 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.210
 it started from a desire to 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.480
 work with charities 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.980
 to any small budget because seen 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.530
 they have small budgets l oms 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.630
 their administrative costs 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.270
 in fact they decided to 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.700
 choose small charities 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:19.170
 a little bit of money he is very 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.700
 Well, it's actually going to make them 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.950
 little tremolos will make big 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.160
 waves 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:28.949
 several associations including jean 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.880
 orphans in nepal 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.919
 work is also with two 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.389
 associations that are against the traffic 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:39.220
 of women of men and children 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:41.020
 there is also in your cutlery a house 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.650
 in fact to help young people who are 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.780
 find on the street 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.310
 you see fans is particularly little 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.860
 especially science fans 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.870
 fiction are extremely generous who 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.199
 are extremely generous so with their 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.949
 time with them unless she has not 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:59.169
 with the money so they left here 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.479
 in Nepal they said to themselves what is 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.160
 we could do to help them 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.110
 maybe from histamine and by going there 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.940
 down they realized seeing news 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.590
 it was particularly necessary to 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.840
 lower their diet 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.400
 better town of Bin Jawad of 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.160
 proteins have a free gimmick and done 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.599
 that they have improved their diet 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.050
 their invoice actually in the pharmacy 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:24.940
 went down 70% 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.849
 so you can imagine what it's like 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.229
 Yes, exactly 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.750
