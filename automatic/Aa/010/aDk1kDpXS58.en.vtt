background then we have a levels layer

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.670 
background then we have a levels layer
which<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.060> clipped<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.899> butterflies<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.649> I

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
which is clipped on the butterflies so I

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.979 
which is clipped on the butterflies so I
just<00:02:07.920> darkened<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> butterflies<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.330> well<00:02:09.810> as

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
just darkened the butterflies as well as

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.990 
just darkened the butterflies as well as
color<00:02:10.530> graded<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> butterflies<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.849> that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
color graded the butterflies so that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.729 
color graded the butterflies so that
they<00:02:12.150> match

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
they match

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.459 
they match
the<00:02:13.010> overall<00:02:13.579> image<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:14.000> bit<00:02:14.150> better<00:02:14.439> then<00:02:15.439> I

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:15.469 
the overall image a bit better then I

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.929 
the overall image a bit better then I
have<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.709> curves<00:02:16.010> adjustment<00:02:16.159> layer<00:02:16.609> that

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
have a curves adjustment layer that

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.699 
have a curves adjustment layer that
color<00:02:17.180> grades<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.659> whole<00:02:17.810> image<00:02:18.109> as<00:02:18.349> well<00:02:18.530> as

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
color grades the whole image as well as

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.009 
color grades the whole image as well as
a<00:02:18.739> colorful<00:02:19.310> layer<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.209> used<00:02:20.480> at<00:02:20.689> a<00:02:20.719> very

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
a colorful layer that I used at a very

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.849 
a colorful layer that I used at a very
low<00:02:21.230> opacity<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.859> 10%<00:02:22.250> just<00:02:22.760> kind<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.799> add<00:02:24.799> a

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 
low opacity of 10% just kind of to add a

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.520 
low opacity of 10% just kind of to add a
bit<00:02:25.189> of<00:02:25.219> blue<00:02:25.519> in<00:02:25.879> to<00:02:26.150> all<00:02:26.359> of<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.870> elements<00:02:27.079> in

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
bit of blue in to all of the elements in

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.020 
bit of blue in to all of the elements in
this<00:02:27.650> photograph<00:02:27.859> then<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:28.849> have<00:02:29.000> a

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
this photograph then I have a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.410 
this photograph then I have a
hue/saturation<00:02:29.359> layer<00:02:30.670> which<00:02:31.670> again<00:02:32.090> color

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
hue/saturation layer which again color

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.379 
hue/saturation layer which again color
grades<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.959> image<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.200> bit<00:02:33.319> further<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:34.389> then

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
grades the image a bit further and then

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.750 
grades the image a bit further and then
I<00:02:35.420> did<00:02:35.689> some<00:02:35.900> fixes<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.409> got<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.620> got<00:02:37.129> rid<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.400> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
I did some fixes I got I got rid of the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.330 
I did some fixes I got I got rid of the
small<00:02:38.450> bits<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.870> sky<00:02:39.139> that<00:02:39.349> we<00:02:39.500> have<00:02:39.650> here<00:02:40.159> and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
small bits of sky that we have here and

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.640 
small bits of sky that we have here and
all<00:02:40.519> that<00:02:40.879> stuff<00:02:41.180> kind<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.900> cleaned<00:02:42.230> up<00:02:42.439> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
all that stuff kind of cleaned up the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.819 
all that stuff kind of cleaned up the
image<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.159> if<00:02:43.519> you<00:02:43.639> will<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.439> then<00:02:45.439> I<00:02:45.590> have<00:02:45.799> a

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
image in if you will and then I have a

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.039 
image in if you will and then I have a
stamp<00:02:46.189> visible<00:02:46.669> layer<00:02:46.849> so<00:02:47.419> this<00:02:47.659> is<00:02:47.810> kind<00:02:47.989> of

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
stamp visible layer so this is kind of

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.589 
stamp visible layer so this is kind of
my<00:02:48.530> first<00:02:48.769> stage<00:02:49.129> of<00:02:49.340> editing<00:02:49.489> then<00:02:50.299> I<00:02:50.389> did<00:02:50.569> a

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
my first stage of editing then I did a

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.770 
my first stage of editing then I did a
dodging<00:02:51.049> burn<00:02:51.290> on<00:02:51.889> the<00:02:52.489> image<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.970> against

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
dodging burn on the image and against

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.670 
dodging burn on the image and against
time<00:02:54.049> visible<00:02:54.620> on<00:02:54.859> top<00:02:55.159> of<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:56.450> now<00:02:56.720> then<00:02:57.650> I

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
time visible on top of it and now then I

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.490 
time visible on top of it and now then I
started<00:02:58.099> testing<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.849> coloring<00:02:59.359> so<00:02:59.689> I<00:02:59.959> didn't

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
started testing the coloring so I didn't

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500 
started testing the coloring so I didn't
really<00:03:00.620> know<00:03:00.919> where<00:03:01.219> to<00:03:01.760> what<00:03:01.909> direction<00:03:02.150> I

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
really know where to what direction I

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.420 
really know where to what direction I
wanted<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.840> take<00:03:02.959> this<00:03:03.290> photograph<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.400> I

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
wanted to take this photograph so I

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.610 
wanted to take this photograph so I
tested<00:03:04.879> all<00:03:05.299> sorts<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.870> things<00:03:06.139> I'll<00:03:06.349> show<00:03:06.560> you

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620

and show you guys first I have a slight
smoke<00:03:14.989> layer<00:03:15.260> underneath<00:03:15.829> an<00:03:16.250> overt

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
smoke layer underneath an overt

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.899 
smoke layer underneath an overt
butterflies<00:03:18.079> then<00:03:19.069> I<00:03:19.099> have<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.370> white<00:03:19.669> prints

butterflies then I have a white prints
layer<00:03:20.120> as<00:03:20.359> tested<00:03:20.750> out<00:03:20.870> maybe<00:03:21.109> adding<00:03:21.409> a<00:03:21.500> bit

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
layer as tested out maybe adding a bit

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.740 
layer as tested out maybe adding a bit
of<00:03:21.680> vibrance<00:03:22.159> would<00:03:22.340> help<00:03:22.579> I<00:03:22.849> did<00:03:23.419> a<00:03:23.449> hue<00:03:23.720> and

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
of vibrance would help I did a hue and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.140 
of vibrance would help I did a hue and
saturation<00:03:23.870> on<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:24.769> to<00:03:24.949> get<00:03:25.099> a<00:03:25.129> bit<00:03:25.340> too<00:03:25.669> green

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
saturation on it to get a bit too green

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.960 
saturation on it to get a bit too green
more<00:03:26.449> greenish<00:03:26.750> tone<00:03:27.109> to<00:03:27.889> color<00:03:28.159> balance<00:03:28.370> kind

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
more greenish tone to color balance kind

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.819 
more greenish tone to color balance kind
of<00:03:29.060> brought<00:03:29.449> you<00:03:29.599> back<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.169> normal<00:03:30.590> stage

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
of brought you back to the normal stage

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.000 
of brought you back to the normal stage
took<00:03:31.760> some<00:03:32.090> brown<00:03:32.359> color<00:03:32.720> field<00:03:33.079> and<00:03:33.379> I<00:03:33.620> tried

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
took some brown color field and I tried

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.610 
took some brown color field and I tried
to<00:03:34.189> turn<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.489> a<00:03:34.669> bit<00:03:35.030> more<00:03:35.180> brownish<00:03:35.840> use<00:03:36.439> the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
to turn it a bit more brownish use the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.589 
to turn it a bit more brownish use the
curves<00:03:37.129> adjustment<00:03:37.310> layer<00:03:37.819> a<00:03:38.269> hue/saturation

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
curves adjustment layer a hue/saturation

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.339 
curves adjustment layer a hue/saturation
layer<00:03:39.290> another<00:03:39.979> one<00:03:40.280> third<00:03:41.090> one<00:03:41.359> so<00:03:42.019> kind<00:03:42.259> of

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
layer another one third one so kind of

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.259 
layer another one third one so kind of
as<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:42.590> can<00:03:42.739> see<00:03:43.009> here<00:03:43.430> I<00:03:43.459> was<00:03:43.729> just<00:03:43.759> testing

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
as you can see here I was just testing

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.659 
as you can see here I was just testing
around<00:03:44.840> with<00:03:45.079> colors<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.709> finally<00:03:46.459> what<00:03:46.639> I

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:46.669 
around with colors and finally what I

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.789 
around with colors and finally what I
understood<00:03:47.479> was<00:03:47.720> what<00:03:47.959> I<00:03:47.989> really<00:03:48.079> liked<00:03:48.560> was

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
understood was what I really liked was

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.909 
understood was what I really liked was
this<00:03:49.009> very<00:03:49.370> natural-looking<00:03:50.650> direction<00:03:51.650> for

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
this very natural-looking direction for

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.189 
this very natural-looking direction for
this<00:03:52.040> photograph<00:03:52.549> but<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.389> wanted<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:54.019> add

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
this photograph but I wanted to add

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.530 
this photograph but I wanted to add
something<00:03:54.650> magical<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.489> kind<00:03:55.729> of<00:03:55.790> got<00:03:56.000> didn't

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
something magical I kind of got didn't

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.530 
something magical I kind of got didn't
want<00:03:57.169> to<00:03:57.349> keep<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.769> greens<00:03:58.069> so<00:03:58.970> then<00:03:59.269> what<00:03:59.509> I

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
want to keep the greens so then what I

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.580 
want to keep the greens so then what I
understood<00:04:00.049> was<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.549> need<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.729> go<00:04:02.139> kind<00:04:03.139> of<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.560> a

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
understood was I need to go kind of to a

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.789 
understood was I need to go kind of to a
totally<00:04:04.159> different<00:04:04.689> style<00:04:05.689> of<00:04:05.989> color<00:04:06.319> grading

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
totally different style of color grading

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.520 
totally different style of color grading
and<00:04:06.949> changed<00:04:07.489> everything<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.419> is<00:04:08.599> green<00:04:08.930> to

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
and changed everything that is green to

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.580 
and changed everything that is green to
a<00:04:09.560> reddish<00:04:09.979> tone<00:04:10.959> this<00:04:11.959> was<00:04:12.169> kind<00:04:12.409> of<00:04:12.500> a

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
a reddish tone this was kind of a

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.309 
a reddish tone this was kind of a
decision<00:04:12.919> that<00:04:13.099> I<00:04:13.280> made<00:04:14.000> after<00:04:14.319> testing

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
decision that I made after testing

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.830 
decision that I made after testing
around<00:04:15.560> for<00:04:15.979> about<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.759> half<00:04:17.030> an<00:04:17.180> hour<00:04:17.329> or<00:04:17.599> so

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
around for about a half an hour or so

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.469 
around for about a half an hour or so
and<00:04:18.650> then<00:04:18.799> I<00:04:18.889> thought<00:04:19.130> yeah<00:04:19.489> let's<00:04:20.120> change

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
and then I thought yeah let's change

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.600 
and then I thought yeah let's change
everything<00:04:21.139> that's<00:04:21.349> green<00:04:21.620> into<00:04:22.070> this<00:04:22.310> nice

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
everything that's green into this nice

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.040 
everything that's green into this nice
reddish<00:04:23.510> purplish<00:04:24.080> tone<00:04:24.580> then<00:04:25.580> we

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
reddish purplish tone then we

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.990 
reddish purplish tone then we
adjustment<00:04:26.560> layer<00:04:26.680> kind<00:04:27.039> of<00:04:27.129> color<00:04:27.490> graded<00:04:27.909> a

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
adjustment layer kind of color graded a

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.649 
adjustment layer kind of color graded a
bit<00:04:28.930> further<00:04:29.409> and<00:04:29.909> then<00:04:30.909> I<00:04:30.970> did<00:04:31.180> some<00:04:31.360> minor

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
bit further and then I did some minor

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:36.210 
bit further and then I did some minor
fixes<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:34.229> created<00:04:35.229> us<00:04:35.349> time<00:04:35.530> visible<00:04:36.039> there

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
fixes and created us time visible there

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.149 
fixes and created us time visible there
and<00:04:36.490> then<00:04:36.909> here<00:04:37.300> are<00:04:37.509> just<00:04:37.750> final<00:04:38.259> things<00:04:38.979> that

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
and then here are just final things that

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.100 
and then here are just final things that
I<00:04:39.190> did<00:04:39.460> some<00:04:39.759> sharpening<00:04:40.300> on<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.599> image<00:04:41.310> also

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
I did some sharpening on the image also

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.619 
I did some sharpening on the image also
just<00:04:44.110> some<00:04:45.009> slight<00:04:45.389> brightening<00:04:46.389> of<00:04:46.509> the

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
just some slight brightening of the

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.240 
just some slight brightening of the
image<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.169> then<00:04:47.650> with<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.919> hue<00:04:48.129> and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
image and then with the hue and

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.570 
image and then with the hue and
saturation<00:04:48.280> layer<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.300> just<00:04:50.069> pulled<00:04:51.069> down<00:04:51.159> some

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
saturation layer I just pulled down some

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.939 
saturation layer I just pulled down some
of<00:04:51.699> the<00:04:51.819> saturation<00:04:52.300> on<00:04:52.599> these<00:04:52.949> greenish

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
of the saturation on these greenish

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.820 
of the saturation on these greenish
butterflies<00:04:54.750> so<00:04:55.750> yeah<00:04:56.110> that's<00:04:56.349> pretty<00:04:56.530> much

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
butterflies so yeah that's pretty much

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.589 
butterflies so yeah that's pretty much

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
it quite a lot of time went into the
