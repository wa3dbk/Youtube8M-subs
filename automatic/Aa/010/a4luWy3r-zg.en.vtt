they're right after a heart rate up to
170<00:01:47.689> hundred<00:01:47.960> 80<00:01:48.140> beats<00:01:48.560> per<00:01:48.680> minute<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.549> they

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
170 hundred 80 beats per minute and they

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.730 
170 hundred 80 beats per minute and they
get<00:01:49.880> them<00:01:50.000> get<00:01:50.360> in<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.570> sim<00:01:50.840> it's<00:01:51.200> really<00:01:51.590> easy

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
get them get in the sim it's really easy

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:10.059 
get them get in the sim it's really easy
to<00:01:51.799> make<00:01:52.009> a<00:01:52.040> mistake

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
lot of that's not physical a lot of that

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.120 
lot of that's not physical a lot of that
is<00:02:53.710> mental<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:58.660> if<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.320> don't<00:02:59.500> plan<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.980> then

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
is mental and if you don't plan and then

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.270 
is mental and if you don't plan and then

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
where that mental breaking point is if

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.170 
where that mental breaking point is if
Mike's<00:03:13.810> not<00:03:14.050> succeeding<00:03:14.920> or<00:03:15.100> doing<00:03:15.460> well<00:03:15.670> in

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
Mike's not succeeding or doing well in

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.540 
Mike's not succeeding or doing well in
the<00:03:16.330> races<00:03:16.780> it<00:03:17.470> won't<00:03:17.710> be<00:03:17.860> because<00:03:18.040> he's<00:03:18.340> not

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
the races it won't be because he's not

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.630 
the races it won't be because he's not
trying<00:03:18.820> hard<00:03:19.150> I've<00:03:19.510> never<00:03:19.870> seen

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
trying hard I've never seen

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:27.670 
trying hard I've never seen
but<00:03:20.820> he<00:03:20.880> drive<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:22.410> much<00:03:22.710> to<00:03:23.580> one<00:03:23.970> goal<00:03:26.060> then

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
but he drive so much to one goal then

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.720 
but he drive so much to one goal then
what<00:03:28.680> he<00:03:28.830> does<00:03:30.020> yeah

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
what he does yeah

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.160 
what he does yeah
the<00:03:32.730> more<00:03:32.910> working<00:03:33.240> out<00:03:33.360> more<00:03:33.690> training<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
the more working out more training the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.860 
the more working out more training the
more<00:03:34.290> physical<00:03:34.860> preparedness<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.300> I<00:03:36.540> am

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
more physical preparedness I have I am

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.330 
more physical preparedness I have I am
going<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:37.770> get<00:03:38.040> better<00:03:43.130> win<00:03:44.130> lose<00:03:44.310> or

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
going to just get better win lose or

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.130 
going to just get better win lose or
draw<00:03:44.520> there's<00:03:45.090> no<00:03:45.240> one<00:03:45.390> truck<00:03:45.570> there's<00:03:45.870> no<00:03:45.990> one

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
draw there's no one truck there's no one

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.650 
draw there's no one truck there's no one
trying<00:03:46.350> harder
