00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.150
 hello today we will make aubergines with garlic 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.299
 these are the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.299
 need 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.010
 well we take the aubergines already washed and 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.380
 we are going to remove the top part and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.680
 we are going to proceed to peel them to remove 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.680
 the shell 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.090
 this we are going to do with a 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.090
 of the potato 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.950
 well in this way so as not to lose so much 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.950
 pulp 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.610
 perfect 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.210
 now we cut it in half and the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.390
 let's cut 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.149
 julienne 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.149
 so that we have some sticks 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.149
 thin 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.730
 so this way 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.530
 well since we have them all 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:17.049
 we are going to look for a container 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.049
 and we're going to put it in the container 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.729
 This strainer is stored so that you can 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.729
 drain the bitter liquid that has 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.530
 we pass it to the container 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.020
 we look for a dish we put our 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.569
 colander and let's start to salt the 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.649
 let's add salt so that they 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.649
 can you vote that juice 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.850
 and after all are well 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.100
 we put them in the colander 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.060
 we put the plastic container underneath and 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.060
 a plate on top 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.790
 after 6 hours in my case we are going to 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.920
 throw out the bitter juice and let's rinse 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.290
 the good ones to eliminate all the excess of 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.290
 salt and juice that may be left 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.000
 rinsed three times 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.560
 until the water comes out a bit clear 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.290
 perfect 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.780
 now already washed we will proceed to 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.549
 Drain even more to be able to draw 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.310
 that remainder of bitter juice that remains 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.290
 then we take a handful we put it 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.250
 in the hand 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.510
 and very carefully we will squeeze 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.409
 until it is well removed 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.409
 without squeezing 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.780
 from this handful the amount of juice 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.580
 what has gone out 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.980
 well, let's do with all the 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.349
 eggplant 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.349
 until we have it all right it is removed 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.300
 previously we boiled 2 liters of 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.300
 Water 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.269
 now let's put him after 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.269
 boil and we put a little salt 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.599
 to taste 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.100
 and we put the half cup of vinegar 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.100
 this to give a touch of acidity 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.530
 now we are going to place our 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.530
 eggplants waiting for the water to boil 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.100
 now that the water is boiling we are going to 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.100
 place our aubergines 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.550
 after we have added it we hope 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.350
 let it boil again and we will leave it 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.350
 for five minutes cooking 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.539
 we cover so you do not lose fast and do not 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.810
 let's stop spending the time of the 5 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.770
 minutes 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.479
 this time has passed 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.479
 our aubergines are ready 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:51.119
 now let's strain the 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.199
 and we're going to go through cold water to 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:59.199
 to be able to cut the cooking 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.510
 already cast we are going to squeeze them 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.280
 that the cold very carefully I do not know 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.640
 will break us because they are new 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.640
 made 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.680
 and we will stay in these ways and 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.680
 delgaditas 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.500
 perfect now let's add the garlic 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.759
 and the parsley that we have previously 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.759
 chopped well tiny 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.230
 we mix and now we put the cup 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.610
 of olive oil 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.610
 you can also use sunflower oil 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.820
 we mix and serve 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.260
 if you keep it in the fridge for a couple of 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:54.480
 days will take better flavors and you can 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.480
 accompany it with meat chicken and fish 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.439
 that you enjoy it and that you have good 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.439
 advantage
