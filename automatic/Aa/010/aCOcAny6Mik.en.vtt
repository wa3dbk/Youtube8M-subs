00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
if it's tilted like this your body's a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.470 
if it's tilted like this your body's a
bit<00:00:37.880> sort<00:00:38.570> of<00:00:38.630> like<00:00:38.690> twisted<00:00:39.560> slightly<00:00:40.100> so

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
bit sort of like twisted slightly so

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.080 
bit sort of like twisted slightly so
then<00:00:41.480> you<00:00:41.660> will<00:00:41.870> he<00:00:42.470> will<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:43.160> will<00:00:43.430> turn<00:00:43.940> your

then you will he will it will turn your

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.360 
then you will he will it will turn your
body<00:00:44.360> around<00:00:44.720> in<00:00:45.110> some<00:00:45.440> ways<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:45.800> how<00:00:45.980> so<00:00:46.220> how

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
body around in some ways and how so how

00:00:46.370 --> 00:01:01.080

do<00:00:46.430> you<00:00:46.579> dance<00:00:46.850> with<00:00:47.210> that<00:00:47.420> is<00:00:47.660> a<00:00:48.050> question<00:00:56.649> I

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.329 

think<00:01:02.090> it's<00:01:02.390> nice<00:01:02.690> sometimes<00:01:02.989> to<00:01:03.339> twist

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
think it's nice sometimes to twist

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.280 
think it's nice sometimes to twist
gender<00:01:05.059> representation<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.110> give

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
gender representation and to give

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.670 
gender representation and to give
another<00:01:06.890> kind<00:01:07.190> of<00:01:07.310> vibe<00:01:07.549> to<00:01:08.290> twist<00:01:09.290> also<00:01:09.560> the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
another kind of vibe to twist also the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.080 
another kind of vibe to twist also the
aesthetic<00:01:10.220> of<00:01:10.400> presenting<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:11.420> body

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
aesthetic of presenting the body

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.630 
aesthetic of presenting the body
something<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:14.390> has<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.570> certain<00:01:14.990> type<00:01:15.409> of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
something that has a certain type of

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.660 
something that has a certain type of
fashionable<00:01:16.640> look<00:01:17.299> but<00:01:18.110> a<00:01:18.250> twisted<00:01:19.250> type<00:01:19.460> of

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
beautiful exchange maybe it needs

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:49.270 
beautiful exchange maybe it needs
transform<00:01:41.390> what<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:41.780> do<00:01:41.869> with<00:01:42.020> your<00:01:42.049> feet

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.310

it's very nice to see the back also you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.520 
it's very nice to see the back also you
enjoyed<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.980> game<00:01:53.160> of<00:01:53.310> unity<00:01:53.790> will<00:01:53.940> enjoy<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
enjoyed the game of unity will enjoy to

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.400 
enjoyed the game of unity will enjoy to
to<00:01:55.530> share<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.870> thurman<00:01:57.870> start<00:01:58.260> as<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
to share it and to thurman start as a

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.390 
to share it and to thurman start as a
very<00:01:58.770> basic<00:01:59.250> energy<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.650> very<00:02:01.650> like<00:02:02.010> primal

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
very basic energy like very like primal

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.420 
very basic energy like very like primal
energy<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.300> then<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.110> became<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.890> much<00:02:05.220> more

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
energy and then it became a much more

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.510 
energy and then it became a much more
sophisticated<00:02:05.750> notion<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.900> energy<00:02:07.520> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
sophisticated notion of energy the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.020 
sophisticated notion of energy the
dynamic<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.300> communication<00:02:10.280> is<00:02:11.280> inherent<00:02:11.910> to

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
dynamic of communication is inherent to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.790 
dynamic of communication is inherent to
death<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:14.840> sometimes<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:16.020> go<00:02:16.260> with<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.709> a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
death so sometimes we go with it in a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.979 
death so sometimes we go with it in a
very<00:02:16.980> minimalist<00:02:17.610> way<00:02:17.850> sometimes<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.660> more

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
very minimalist way sometimes in a more

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.190 
very minimalist way sometimes in a more
extravagant<00:02:19.770> way<00:02:20.360> or<00:02:21.360> sometime<00:02:21.690> in<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> very

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
extravagant way or sometime in a very

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.100 
extravagant way or sometime in a very
visual<00:02:22.500> way<00:02:23.030> we're<00:02:24.030> using<00:02:24.239> different<00:02:24.480> ways<00:02:24.870> of

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
visual way we're using different ways of

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.229 
visual way we're using different ways of
treating<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.340> subject<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:27.900> course<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:29.239> human

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
treating this subject of course as human

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.920 
treating this subject of course as human
bodies<00:02:30.660> as<00:02:30.840> bodies<00:02:31.290> are<00:02:32.600> dealing<00:02:33.600> with<00:02:33.780> energy

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
bodies as bodies are dealing with energy

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.190 
bodies as bodies are dealing with energy
all<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.470> time<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.310> moving<00:02:35.640> energy<00:02:36.200> so

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
all the time and with moving energy so

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.540 
all the time and with moving energy so
then<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.530> start<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.890> move<00:02:38.040> with<00:02:38.190> something

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
then to start to move with something

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.160 
then to start to move with something
that's<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:39.000> universal<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:42.360> then<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.690> dreaming

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
that's a universal so then the dreaming

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.940 
that's a universal so then the dreaming
of<00:02:43.320> space<00:02:43.650> becomes<00:02:44.070> very<00:02:44.459> heightened<00:02:45.800> this<00:02:46.800> is

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
of space becomes very heightened this is

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.860 
of space becomes very heightened this is
not<00:02:47.130> only<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:47.550> about<00:02:48.000> about<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.420> body<00:02:48.630> as

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
not only I think about about the body as

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.780 
not only I think about about the body as
a<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.320> whole<00:02:49.650> but<00:02:49.920> it's<00:02:50.010> also<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.340> body<00:02:50.580> and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
a as a whole but it's also the body and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.570 
a as a whole but it's also the body and
the<00:02:50.940> space<00:02:51.239> around<00:02:51.269> it<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.930> how<00:02:52.200> its<00:02:53.070> I

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
the space around it and how its I

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.789 
the space around it and how its I
integrate<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.600> movement<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.320> body<00:02:55.590> and

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
integrate this movement of body and

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.090 
integrate this movement of body and
space<00:02:56.540> I'm<00:02:57.540> working<00:02:58.049> with<00:02:58.230> trance<00:02:58.620> but<00:02:58.830> trance
