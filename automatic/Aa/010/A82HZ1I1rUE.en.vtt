for the car industry in America and we

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.270 
for the car industry in America and we
we<00:04:17.949> got<00:04:18.159> to<00:04:18.190> be<00:04:18.430> part<00:04:18.669> of<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:18.880> because<00:04:19.359> in

we got to be part of that because in

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.520

2008 we were looking when the world was

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.800 
2008 we were looking when the world was
different<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.610> see<00:04:24.789> how<00:04:24.940> we<00:04:25.000> could<00:04:25.330> market

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
different to see how we could market

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.480

some<00:04:26.080> of

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
products in America and that's how we

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.520 
products in America and that's how we
initiated<00:04:28.830> our<00:04:29.099> discussions<00:04:29.639> with<00:04:29.819> Chrysler

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
initiated our discussions with Chrysler

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.870 
initiated our discussions with Chrysler
and<00:04:31.530> we<00:04:31.650> were<00:04:31.800> thinking<00:04:32.220> about<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.610> Fiat

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
and we were thinking about the Fiat

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.120 
and we were thinking about the Fiat
Cinquecento<00:04:33.110> of<00:04:34.110> which<00:04:34.289> most<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.740> you<00:04:34.949> have

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130

participate with our cars to to this

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.320 
participate with our cars to to this
symposium<00:04:41.699> and<00:04:43.370> so<00:04:44.370> we<00:04:44.490> got<00:04:44.669> involved<00:04:44.970> in<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330

discussions where basically to find a
solution<00:04:50.639> every<00:04:51.389> stakeholder<00:04:51.800> had<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:53.009> come

solution every stakeholder had to come

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.390 
solution every stakeholder had to come

isn't<00:05:20.099> really<00:05:20.250> solving<00:05:20.789> the<00:05:21.139> problem<00:05:22.139> of

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
isn't really solving the problem of

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.029 
isn't really solving the problem of
volume<00:05:24.060> for<00:05:24.300> us<00:05:24.449> and<00:05:24.780> that's<00:05:25.319> why<00:05:25.530> we<00:05:25.740> started

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
volume for us and that's why we started

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.249 
volume for us and that's why we started
discussing<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:29.449> opportunity<00:05:30.449> of<00:05:30.630> combining

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
long term then try and find solutions

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.469 
long term then try and find solutions
which<00:06:11.370> are<00:06:11.550> really<00:06:11.729> about<00:06:11.909> self<00:06:12.419> preservation

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
which are really about self preservation

which are really about self preservation
and<00:06:13.380> trying<00:06:14.039> to<00:06:15.229> not<00:06:16.229> look<00:06:16.440> at<00:06:16.620> the<00:06:16.800> problems

and trying to not look at the problems

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.760 
and trying to not look at the problems
and<00:06:17.520> ultimately<00:06:18.360> not<00:06:18.630> solve<00:06:18.990> them<00:06:19.199> so<00:06:19.560> what

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
and ultimately not solve them so what

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.899 
and ultimately not solve them so what
we've<00:06:19.949> learned<00:06:20.310> so<00:06:20.759> far<00:06:20.789> is<00:06:21.360> that<00:06:22.550> to<00:06:23.550> create

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
we've learned so far is that to create

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.830 
we've learned so far is that to create
an<00:06:24.229> industrial<00:06:25.229> future<00:06:26.120> one<00:06:27.120> needs<00:06:27.389> to<00:06:27.659> be

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
an industrial future one needs to be

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.200 
an industrial future one needs to be
very<00:06:28.169> clear<00:06:28.409> about<00:06:28.770> the<00:06:29.039> issues<00:06:29.370> one<00:06:29.639> faces

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
very clear about the issues one faces

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.540 
very clear about the issues one faces
and<00:06:30.419> address<00:06:31.050> them<00:06:31.289> and<00:06:32.000> what<00:06:33.000> I<00:06:33.030> want<00:06:33.840> to<00:06:34.550> to

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
and address them and what I want to to

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.920 
and address them and what I want to to
add<00:06:35.669> to<00:06:35.969> that<00:06:36.000> before<00:06:36.839> closing

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
add to that before closing

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.990 
add to that before closing
is<00:06:37.990> that<00:06:38.289> an<00:06:38.560> industrial<00:06:39.130> future<00:06:39.639> when

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
is that an industrial future when

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.730 
is that an industrial future when
creating<00:06:40.419> an<00:06:40.539> industrial<00:06:40.990> future<00:06:41.350> is<00:06:41.560> about

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
creating an industrial future is about

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.529 
creating an industrial future is about
people<00:06:42.400> and<00:06:43.320> we've<00:06:44.320> put<00:06:44.620> a<00:06:44.770> lot<00:06:44.949> of<00:06:45.539> attention

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:46.539 
people and we've put a lot of attention

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.860 
people and we've put a lot of attention
for<00:06:47.199> a<00:06:47.259> Family<00:06:47.710> Foundation<00:06:48.460> in<00:06:49.000> education

for a Family Foundation in education

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.560 
for a Family Foundation in education
because<00:06:50.530> we<00:06:50.770> strongly<00:06:51.310> believe<00:06:51.460> that<00:06:51.789> more

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
because we strongly believe that more

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.090 
because we strongly believe that more
people<00:06:52.840> are<00:06:53.530> educated<00:06:53.800> and<00:06:54.580> better<00:06:55.360> educated

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 
people are educated and better educated

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.249 
people are educated and better educated
the<00:06:57.100> easier<00:06:57.520> it<00:06:57.639> will<00:06:57.820> be<00:06:58.030> to<00:06:58.300> come<00:06:58.840> up<00:06:59.050> with

00:06:59.249 --> 00:06:59.259 
the easier it will be to come up with

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:01.770 
the easier it will be to come up with
solutions<00:07:00.009> to<00:07:00.250> the<00:07:00.820> many<00:07:01.030> challenges<00:07:01.300> and
