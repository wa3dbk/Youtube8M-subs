00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.439
 It is introduction of 2013 model 4700 disk 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:22.670
 If you go to the mountain in specs, you want to purchase from the price range of here 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.670
 I will introduce in 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.240
 First is the drive system 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.240
 Based on Shimano 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.390
 The front that is assembled is 3 bullets 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.000
 The area is 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.100
 It is 10 pairs 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.100
 I will do everything except points 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.030
 The risk brakes are also hydraulic and use Shimano's on the island. 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:15.939
 It is a suspension but travel of 100 mm 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.939
 I think that the travel amount of suspension is enough to enjoy from black 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.659
 And I have a lever that can be locked out at hand 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.270
 Next is the overall design 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.500
 Based on red 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:43.990
 I also put a curl on the wheel so high 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.990
 It is coordinated by fashion in total 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:57.130
 Tire diameter is 26 factors 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.130
 Tire width 2.20 is attached 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 In fact, this bike is the only 26-inch mountain bike to be exhibited in the market cycle this year 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.330
 Become 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.660
 And 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.660
 You will be asked to be used as a test-drive cars in this state 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.820
 29-inch bike I remember now 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:31.100
 Since then, the 26-inch bike has always been popular 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:31.100
 It is possible to ride and compare both, so I hope you can give it a try . 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.470
 Last is the weight 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:45.510
 2013 model 4700 disks 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:48.530
 There was a 13.1 k in weight in this state 15.5 inches 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.530
 Yes it is more than
