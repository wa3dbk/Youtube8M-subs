00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.860
 propels one dresses it white 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.100
 r a band for 5 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.790
 we shoe 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.790
 and with average energy before the 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.070
 shock with the tape measure the angle that 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.800
 makes the direction of the trajectory of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.160
 the white ball with the normal to the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.430
 strip passing through the center of the city 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.290
 it is worth about 14 degrees by analogy 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.720
 with geometric optics 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.629
 we can call this angle the angle 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:45.540
 of incidence do the same measurement 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.730
 after the shock on the band the angle 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.339
 measure and can be called the angle of 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.070
 reflection verdict about 14 degrees 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:59.790
 conclude with a simple principle 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.489
 equal impact thinking we 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.710
 here we discover a new simple rule 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.299
 is fundamental to help the player 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.840
 billiard to predict the trajectories 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.020
 repugnant let's do the same thing 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.070
 with d angle of incidence more and more 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.390
 great the principle is still checked 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.000
 but we will note that the angles 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.710
 of incidence are less than 40 degrees 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.689
 apply this principle by doing 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.329
 now walk a way more 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.609
 important to the white ball and with a 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.770
 angle of incidence much greater 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.899
 than 40 degrees 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.630
 the white abbey touches three bands 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:43.170
 but the angles of incidence are no longer 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.909
 equal to the angles of reflection the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.909
 trajectory that should describe the ball 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.429
 is a parallelogram we observe 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.070
 that this is not the case though 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.999
 directions 2 and 4 practically rest 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.340
 parallel this observation brings a 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.320
 new possibility quite complicated 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.509
 so that the billiard player can 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.689
 calculate and predict the trajectories of 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.689
 ball
