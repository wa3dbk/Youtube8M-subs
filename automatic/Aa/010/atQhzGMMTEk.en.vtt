00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.969
 which is a noble theme of the class of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.080
 today the notation 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.460
 in this first moment I go 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.340
 demystify some issues 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.320
 related to the notation that is as if 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.710
 describes a game of chess 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.260
 this image is shocking even is is a 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.090
 image in another language and from a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.029
 set of code letters that 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.850
 has no meaning at all and is 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.660
 This is what I'm going to take today to demystify. 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.910
 today because all the ratings of 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.680
 chess both descriptive with such gesture 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.620
 which I will explain here during this 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.780
 videoula follows a logic 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.680
 independent of the country of the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.750
 from this country 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.820
 the logic to describe a game of 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.250
 chess is always the same 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.399
 then both in Russia and in Norway 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.350
 in Africa in Japan the logic for 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.140
 to enter a match is the same as 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.820
 changes are often the codes and you 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.149
 can not get stuck in that first 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.330
 to codes but rather to logic. 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.970
 how to construct this notation or 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.180
 annotation so I do not have it today 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.820
 intention to make you write 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.490
 the game of chess perfectly in sim 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.920
 understand logic and be able to 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.479
 pick up any chess book and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.310
 to understand what is written there 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.770
 able to reproduce that game 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.860
 so my intention today is to teach 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.810
 logical reader and not the writer I do not 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.659
 I'll stick to all the details but I 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.970
 I'll explain what the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.490
 logic of a play of such as the note 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.950
 this play and who you became 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.750
 able to write in the study from the 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.790
 moment you started to study 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.040
 to read the books you took these 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.200
 details of how to write this is not the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.450
 intention today and understand the logic 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.329
 from this we will begin our 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.000
 video lesson now let's go to the 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.970
 algebraic system here I will describe 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.310
 a game of course and you will 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.700
 understand this logic which is the first 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.160
 logic is of the board with respect to 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.709
 system to g1 we have letters and numbers 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.890
 so the numbers are in the rows and the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.170
 letters are in the columns and each piece 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.810
 she has a name 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.030
 relative her tower horse bishop and us 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.349
 we will always use the first law 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.989
 The first thing we'll do is 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.760
 identify the part that is the person 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.430
 first we will use your 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.989
 first list except the pawn 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.400
 Let's play here naturally, then 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.410
 I'm going to write the game. 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:45.530
 if I move to champion is 4 I should 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:50.810
 jot so pawn is 4 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:55.100
 so I mess up the pawn until it 's 4 correct 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:59.120
 but it is not used when we close the 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.930
 pawn we only use is 4 is implied that 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.340
 was the pawn that is moving all 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.489
 Once we move the pawn we 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.350
 takes the first letter and places only the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.440
 I'll move another time to 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.900
 to be clearer I've put another 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.920
 The pawn and I will note the match was the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.709
 vehicle is still in the first bid is 5 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.799
 Why is it in the house and in the 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.350
 column is in row five then the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.209
 first move of both white and 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.340
 of blacks happened 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.630
 Let's go to the second bid if the 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.299
 horse movement 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.790
 this horse here and that horse went to 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.370
 to f3 then the first thing i have 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.900
 what to do is write down the letter that the horse 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.790
 an f3 horse 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.609
 so it's very clear here so always 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.489
 I put the part first after the 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.459
 column after the row then this is the 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.010
 logic of notation that people 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.049
 will use here in the game of chess that 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.989
 is called a notation which is also the 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.660
 notation is what we will notice is 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.579
 the game of chess and how it is and will be 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.100
 written in books then we already have 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.709
 gifts two situations here the pawn to people 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.160
 withdraws is the first letter they think 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.850
 and it is only the column and the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.680
 row 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.739
 already the other parts we have to use the 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.930
 part name or part-to-column letter 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.020
 and the row let's move another piece now 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.480
 for example now I'm going to move the bishop who 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.290
 moved bishop so far 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.750
 so come hebe the bishop is in the house 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:40.180
 b in row four then as I 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:45.280
 I'm going to write down bishop b row again 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:48.580
 and minuscule and four then the bishop is 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.680
 column b in row 4 and that 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.660
 same logic goes on during the game 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.790
 if you move the tower for example 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.820
 Take this tower and put it here. 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:04.930
 comment the notary t is from the tower c5 then 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.930
 always this same store in this column and 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.350
 row to write down there to capture as 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.600
 is made this notation in there I shifted the 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.250
 bishop now I'm going to capture with the horse 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.130
 I'm going to make the third bid here with 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.980
 horse let's go horse can capture 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.110
 here one turns then what 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.020
 happened here the horse captured the pawn 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:32.560
 then as we will note that third 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:34.390
 horse lance captured that is the pawn xis 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.060
 always too may hear the piece in 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.010
 uppercase and lowercase columns 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.890
 then horse captured that is the xis 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.860
 capture is ox is the capture symbol 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.930
 when the very simple pawn 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.350
 logic is always this and if you 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.630
 understood this logic so far is great 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:55.720
 You will be able to read any book by 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:58.660
 chess with the algeco system understanding 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.220
 only to be human and have to understand that x 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.660
 capture and has another one that appears 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.850
 Quite also what I'm going to do here 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.360
 I'm going to play here now randomly. 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:10.900
 It's rock or rock. 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.170
 it is done so suppose that people 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.670
 I'm going to take the 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.130
 king throw two houses 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.740
 I'll take the reiki play two houses and made 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.390
 the rock the rock that happened here is 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.490
 called small rock so how 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:32.740
 we will note the trace o 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:37.389
 the big rock would be the dash trace 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.520
 three partners then with these practically 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:42.009
 these four symbols here we 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.690
 we have managed to solve most of the 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.699
 chess game and starting note 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:50.500
 It's very simple what we have to 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:53.830
 understand is part column row capture x 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.020
 and commonly used u2 rock with the 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.880
 dash in the middle big rock out with 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.280
 That's enough to understand with what 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.849
 any chess book if you take the 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:06.909
 algebraic annotation you 'll already be able to 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:08.800
 read in chess positions 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:11.380
 basically this is always respecting 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.080
 this logic if it happens for example of 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.449
 two horses picked up the same piece for 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.159
 example there is a horse here taking this 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:20.650
 ask and there's another horse here picking up 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:25.659
 this piece he will identify that it is this 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:26.680
 horse here, no horses and c3 capturing 

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:29.110
 pawn 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.570
 So it's very simple to understand the 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:34.479
 logic something else that we should 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.300
 also the question of the king and queen 

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:40.270
 if I come to notice the queen here in the 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.509
 notation in notation what did you find 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:46.389
 best at this point is if I put r 

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:48.430
 and be equal for both the king and the 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:51.039
 queen the queen is actually also 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.870
 called a lady then we like when 

00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:57.099
 let's note the match here in Brazil 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:59.349
 we will put of in the queen and in the king is 

00:07:57.099 --> 00:08:02.500
 one thing also that soon in the beginning 

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:05.349
 You'll set it now and it will be fine. 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.360
 easy then queen is lady in reality 

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:09.870
 at the time of writing and the king continues with 

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.870
 are r
