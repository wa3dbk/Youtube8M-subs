the third perk and that's why I've

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.980 
the third perk and that's why I've
chosen<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.640> got<00:01:39.030> scavenger<00:01:39.509> here's<00:01:39.659> my<00:01:39.840> first

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
chosen it got scavenger here's my first

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.510 
chosen it got scavenger here's my first
perk<00:01:40.350> mainly<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.400> be

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
perk mainly just because it can be

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.819 
perk mainly just because it can be
running<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> ammo<00:01:42.090> loads<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.290> really

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
running out of ammo loads and I really

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.170 
running out of ammo loads and I really
like<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.009> make<00:01:44.189> sure<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.549> especially<00:01:44.850> with

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
like to make sure that especially with

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.359 
like to make sure that especially with
the<00:01:45.270> scar<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:46.049> your<00:01:46.560> clip<00:01:47.100> size

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
the scar because you're your clip size

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.670 
the scar because you're your clip size
and<00:01:47.759> clip<00:01:48.240> empties<00:01:48.780> pretty<00:01:49.170> quickly<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.530> want

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
and clip empties pretty quickly I want

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.020 
and clip empties pretty quickly I want
to<00:01:49.770> make<00:01:49.890> sure<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.189> not<00:01:50.280> running<00:01:50.640> out<00:01:50.700> now<00:01:50.759> or

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
to make sure I'm not running out now or

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.580 
to make sure I'm not running out now or
too<00:01:51.210> early<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:52.170> I'm<00:01:52.259> getting<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
too early and here I'm getting a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.410 
too early and here I'm getting a
eight-six<00:01:53.009> overwatch<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> key

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
eight-six overwatch and this is the key

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.330 
eight-six overwatch and this is the key
point<00:01:54.810> because<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.470> Osprey<00:01:55.920> gunner<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
point because the Osprey gunner is a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.179 
point because the Osprey gunner is a
17-point<00:01:57.329> streak<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.200> hardest<00:01:58.710> part<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.070> my

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
17-point streak the hardest part in my

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.740 
17-point streak the hardest part in my
opinion<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.640> get<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.939> Osprey<00:02:00.270> gun<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
opinion to get the Osprey gun and you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.300 
opinion to get the Osprey gun and you
may<00:02:00.899> find<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.409> well<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.829> sort<00:02:02.280> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
may find this as well is a sort of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.630 
may find this as well is a sort of
transitional<00:02:03.320> period<00:02:04.320> kill<00:02:04.500> streak<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
transitional period kill streak and the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.910 
transitional period kill streak and the
final<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.259> risk<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
final one you can risk it with the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.529 
final one you can risk it with the
second<00:02:08.220> kill<00:02:08.399> streak<00:02:08.640> by<00:02:09.179> going<00:02:09.420> with

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
second kill streak by going with

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.809 
second kill streak by going with
something<00:02:09.869> really<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:10.470> high<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.129> like

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
something really really high and like

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.200 
something really really high and like
the<00:02:12.060> juggernaut<00:02:12.629> arm

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
the juggernaut arm

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.670 
the juggernaut arm
something<00:02:13.510> like<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:14.170> try<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.530> build

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
something like that to try and build

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.350 
something like that to try and build
your<00:02:14.890> way<00:02:14.950> towards<00:02:15.490> your<00:02:15.670> spray<00:02:15.910> gunner<00:02:16.150> or

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
your way towards your spray gunner or

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.540 
your way towards your spray gunner or
something<00:02:17.140> even<00:02:17.290> higher<00:02:17.500> like<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:18.010> pave<00:02:18.280> low

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
something even higher like the pave low

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.270 
something even higher like the pave low
or<00:02:18.820> ac-130<00:02:19.660> but<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.320> like<00:02:20.530> sticking<00:02:20.800> towards

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
or ac-130 but I like sticking towards

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.920 
or ac-130 but I like sticking towards
the<00:02:21.430> middle<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:21.970> nine<00:02:22.360> kill<00:02:22.660> streak

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
the middle with the nine kill streak

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.710 
the middle with the nine kill streak
leave<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.290> Reaper<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.980> try<00:02:24.490> shoot<00:02:24.820> an<00:02:24.970> UAV<00:02:25.480> here

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720

with<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.080> type<00:02:26.290> 95<00:02:26.620> because<00:02:27.010> if<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.280> do<00:02:27.430> shoot

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
with the type 95 because if you do shoot

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.280 
with the type 95 because if you do shoot
it<00:02:27.790> down<00:02:27.910> it's<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.180> nice<00:02:28.330> free<00:02:28.630> point<00:02:28.900> towards

here unfortunately didn't help me too
much<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.570> but<00:02:50.080> in<00:02:50.200> future<00:02:50.410> gameplays<00:02:50.980> you'll

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
much and but in future gameplays you'll

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.920 
much and but in future gameplays you'll
see<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.520> it<00:02:51.640> can<00:02:51.820> really<00:02:52.330> tear<00:02:52.600> into<00:02:52.840> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
see that it can really tear into the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.810 
see that it can really tear into the
enemies<00:02:53.260> if<00:02:53.500> you're<00:02:53.860> placing<00:02:54.100> yourself<00:02:54.460> in

enemies if you're placing yourself in

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.030 
enemies if you're placing yourself in

the middle of the map and trying to get
as<00:02:57.130> close<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.520> enemies<00:02:57.760> as<00:02:57.880> possible<00:02:58.270> cuz

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
as close to the enemies as possible cuz

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.360 
as close to the enemies as possible cuz
it<00:02:58.450> acts<00:02:58.660> as<00:02:58.840> like<00:02:58.960> a<00:02:58.990> personal<00:02:59.710> bodyguard<00:02:59.860> and

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
it acts as like a personal bodyguard and

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.460 
it acts as like a personal bodyguard and

thing<00:03:02.620> about<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.070> you're<00:03:03.340> actually

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
thing about it is that you're actually

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.710 
thing about it is that you're actually
still<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.330> game

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
still in the game

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.030 
still in the game
that's<00:03:04.990> only<00:03:05.140> downside<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.770> Reaper

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
that's only downside of the Reaper

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.830 
that's only downside of the Reaper
missile<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.490> that<00:03:06.610> when<00:03:06.790> you're<00:03:07.240> using<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.690> and

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
to fight back and it can work really

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.380

now<00:05:26.170> there<00:05:26.380> are<00:05:26.470> two<00:05:26.650> tactics<00:05:27.190> to<00:05:27.400> use<00:05:27.430> here

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
now there are two tactics to use here

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.010 
now there are two tactics to use here
when<00:05:27.880> it<00:05:28.000> comes<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.390> dropping<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:28.810> care

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
when it comes to dropping the care

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.690 
when it comes to dropping the care
packages<00:05:29.410> either<00:05:29.920> you<00:05:30.130> can<00:05:30.250> drop<00:05:30.520> it<00:05:30.670> right

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
packages either you can drop it right

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.310 
packages either you can drop it right

you've laid down to hide from the enemy

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.630 
you've laid down to hide from the enemy
or<00:05:37.530> you<00:05:38.530> can<00:05:38.710> place<00:05:38.920> it<00:05:39.100> right<00:05:39.310> in<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.520> middle

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640

or you can place it right in the middle
of<00:05:39.730> the<00:05:39.790> map<00:05:39.910> like<00:05:40.060> I've<00:05:40.180> done<00:05:40.300> here<00:05:40.480> and<00:05:40.540> use

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
of the map like I've done here and use

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.690 
of the map like I've done here and use
it<00:05:40.930> as<00:05:41.140> bait<00:05:41.350> the<00:05:42.070> likelihood<00:05:42.460> is<00:05:42.550> your

it as bait the likelihood is your

it as bait the likelihood is your

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
teammates are probably gonna pick it up

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.960 
teammates are probably gonna pick it up
and<00:05:44.050> steal<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.470> anyway<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:44.940> lessen<00:05:45.940> that

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
and steal it anyway so lessen that

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.700 
and steal it anyway so lessen that
happen<00:05:46.240> isn't<00:05:46.360> too<00:05:46.600> much<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:46.870> a<00:05:46.930> problem<00:05:47.140> but

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
happen isn't too much of a problem but

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.230
