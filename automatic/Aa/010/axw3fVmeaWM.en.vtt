00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.240 
because I figured if I don't know I have
two<00:03:00.900> daughters<00:03:01.080> too<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.650> they<00:03:01.740> might<00:03:01.890> want<00:03:02.130> it

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
two daughters too and they might want it

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.820 
two daughters too and they might want it
and<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.910> was<00:03:03.000> very<00:03:03.150> special<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.510> her<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:03.930> um<00:03:04.200> I

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
and it was very special to her so um I

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.160 
and it was very special to her so um I
did<00:03:05.820> have<00:03:05.940> parts<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.420> feet<00:03:06.630> or<00:03:06.750> anything<00:03:06.840> to

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
did have parts the feet or anything to

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.290 
did have parts the feet or anything to
it<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:08.010> think<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.280> was<00:03:08.400> Ginny<00:03:08.640> Maxim<00:03:09.060> sent

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300
