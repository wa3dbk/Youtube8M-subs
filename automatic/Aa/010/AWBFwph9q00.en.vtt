00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.890 
pretty big issue going on right now what
with<00:00:13.070> proposition<00:00:13.760> 8<00:00:13.940> in<00:00:14.090> California<00:00:14.750> and

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
with proposition 8 in California and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.320 
with proposition 8 in California and
then<00:00:15.049> I<00:00:15.289> think<00:00:15.709> it's<00:00:15.949> proposition<00:00:16.820> 2<00:00:17.090> in
