far

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.040 
far
well<00:00:15.740> we<00:00:16.340> had<00:00:16.460> a<00:00:16.490> difficult<00:00:16.910> start<00:00:18.910> but<00:00:19.910> as<00:00:20.570> we

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
well we had a difficult start but as we

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.970 
well we had a difficult start but as we
are<00:00:21.170> heading<00:00:21.470> towards<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:23.529> half<00:00:24.529> way<00:00:24.740> of<00:00:24.890> the

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
are heading towards the half way of the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.769 
are heading towards the half way of the
season<00:00:25.340> what<00:00:25.490> we<00:00:25.610> reach<00:00:25.910> now<00:00:26.180> I<00:00:26.210> think<00:00:26.480> we

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
season what we reach now I think we

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.290 
season what we reach now I think we
started<00:00:27.470> playing<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:27.830> better<00:00:28.340> better<00:00:28.880> football

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
started playing a better better football

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.560 
started playing a better better football
you<00:00:29.750> understand<00:00:30.200> each<00:00:30.320> other<00:00:30.560> better<00:00:30.740> I<00:00:31.570> think

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
you understand each other better I think

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.190 
you understand each other better I think
the<00:00:32.720> total<00:00:33.110> group<00:00:33.640> has<00:00:34.640> become<00:00:35.000> bigger<00:00:35.690> we've

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
the total group has become bigger we've

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.610 
the total group has become bigger we've
got<00:00:36.380> players<00:00:36.710> in<00:00:37.510> who<00:00:38.510> came<00:00:38.690> into<00:00:38.900> the<00:00:38.990> team<00:00:39.320> so

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
got players in who came into the team so

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.010 
got players in who came into the team so
the<00:00:39.740> squad<00:00:40.040> has<00:00:40.310> had<00:00:40.579> more<00:00:40.790> depth<00:00:41.060> and<00:00:41.240> I<00:00:41.780> think

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
the squad has had more depth and I think

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.770 
the squad has had more depth and I think
that's<00:00:42.140> very<00:00:42.230> important<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:44.420> also<00:00:44.660> the

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
that's very important and and also the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.510 
that's very important and and also the
fitness<00:00:45.140> of<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.320> team<00:00:45.620> has<00:00:45.860> improved<00:00:46.190> a<00:00:46.400> lot

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
fitness of the team has improved a lot

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.640 
fitness of the team has improved a lot

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.099 
progresses is is going we played on some
very<00:01:16.460> decent<00:01:16.880> football<00:01:17.030> some<00:01:17.689> very<00:01:17.900> good

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 
very decent football some very good

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:20.859 
very decent football some very good
football<00:01:18.259> some<00:01:18.710> parts<00:01:19.009> of<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.189> game<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.869> we

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
football some parts of the game and we

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.679 
football some parts of the game and we
have<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.109> try<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.700> maintain<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:23.179> a<00:01:23.390> longer

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
have to try to maintain that a longer

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.569 
have to try to maintain that a longer
period<00:01:23.929> in<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.499> game<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:24.740> think<00:01:24.920> that's<00:01:25.369> one<00:01:25.549> of

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
period in a game I think that's one of

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.569 
period in a game I think that's one of
the<00:01:25.789> goals<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:26.899> we<00:01:27.170> should<00:01:27.320> work<00:01:27.499> on<00:01:27.740> and

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
the goals that we should work on and

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.520 
the goals that we should work on and
that<00:01:29.060> means<00:01:29.329> that<00:01:29.539> we<00:01:29.630> have<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.780> get<00:01:29.960> even<00:01:30.259> more

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
that means that we have to get even more

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.149 
that means that we have to get even more
fitter<00:01:30.969> play<00:01:31.969> more<00:01:32.299> possession<00:01:33.289> game<00:01:33.319> keep

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
fitter play more possession game keep

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.120 
fitter play more possession game keep
the<00:01:34.280> ball<00:01:34.460> longer<00:01:34.700> in<00:01:34.999> our<00:01:35.119> in<00:01:35.960> our<00:01:36.109> team<00:01:36.380> so

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
the ball longer in our in our team so

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.789 
the ball longer in our in our team so
that<00:01:37.159> we<00:01:37.429> can<00:01:37.609> dictate<00:01:37.880> more<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.590> there's

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
that we can dictate more and so there's

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.700 
that we can dictate more and so there's
still<00:01:39.950> enough<00:01:40.399> that<00:01:40.729> we<00:01:40.880> can<00:01:41.119> work<00:01:41.630> on<00:01:41.869> what

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
still enough that we can work on what

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.200 
still enough that we can work on what
has<00:01:42.799> been<00:01:42.979> your<00:01:43.009> highlight<00:01:43.159> of<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.759> season<00:01:43.909> so

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:06.550 
the game what was very important for for
us<00:02:04.009> as<00:02:04.219> a<00:02:04.249> new<00:02:04.490> club<00:02:04.789> as<00:02:05.179> a<00:02:05.299> new<00:02:05.450> team<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.530> that

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
us as a new club as a new team so that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.180 
us as a new club as a new team so that
gave<00:02:06.920> us<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.399> lot<00:02:07.579> of<00:02:07.609> confidence<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:09.069> put<00:02:10.069> in

gave us a lot of confidence and put in

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.080 
gave us a lot of confidence and put in
general<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.670> think<00:02:11.110> all<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.410> moments<00:02:12.740> together

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
general I think all the moments together

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.420 
general I think all the moments together
are<00:02:14.090> good<00:02:14.750> even<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.290> moments<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:16.280> are

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
are good even the moments that that are

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.880 
are good even the moments that that are
not<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.810> fine<00:02:17.810> for<00:02:18.140> sports<00:02:18.470> meant<00:02:18.709> when<00:02:18.860> you

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
not that fine for sports meant when you

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.000 
not that fine for sports meant when you
lose<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.850> can<00:02:20.030> learn<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.240> lot<00:02:20.360> from<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.770> as<00:02:21.770> a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
lose you can learn a lot from that as a

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.130 
lose you can learn a lot from that as a
big<00:02:22.280> example<00:02:22.849> i<00:02:22.909> think<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.599> game<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:23.840> we

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
big example i think is the game that we

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.090 
big example i think is the game that we
played<00:02:24.379> away<00:02:24.620> against<00:02:24.950> Brisbane

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
played away against Brisbane

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.100 
played away against Brisbane
that<00:02:26.280> we<00:02:26.430> had<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> heavy<00:02:26.880> loss<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.600> after<00:02:27.990> that

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
that we had a heavy loss but after that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.680 
that we had a heavy loss but after that
we<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:29.340> started<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.880> understand<00:02:30.390> more<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690

a spot in the finals of the top six or

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.200 
a spot in the finals of the top six or
potentially<00:04:02.370> even<00:04:02.400> look<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.850> top-floor

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
potentially even look to a top-floor

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.670 
potentially even look to a top-floor
place<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:04.340> think<00:04:05.450> what<00:04:06.450> we<00:04:06.660> said<00:04:07.500> in<00:04:07.650> the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
place I think what we said in the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.290 
place I think what we said in the
beginning<00:04:07.830> of<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.220> season<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:09.000> way<00:04:09.150> of

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
beginning of the season is the way of

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.520 
beginning of the season is the way of
playing<00:04:09.680> that's<00:04:10.680> my<00:04:10.920> focus<00:04:11.700> that's<00:04:12.180> my<00:04:12.500> way<00:04:13.500> I

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
playing that's my focus that's my way I

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.710 
playing that's my focus that's my way I
train<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.580> I<00:04:14.700> talked<00:04:14.940> with<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.210> players<00:04:15.420> and

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
train and I talked with the players and

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.000 
train and I talked with the players and
as<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.290> result<00:04:16.560> of<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.390> hopefully<00:04:18.390> we<00:04:18.810> can<00:04:19.080> end

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
as a result of that hopefully we can end

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.039 
as a result of that hopefully we can end
in<00:04:20.670> the<00:04:20.820> top<00:04:21.030> six<00:04:21.330> because<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.690> think<00:04:21.960> that

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
in the top six because I think that

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.930 
in the top six because I think that
would<00:04:22.140> be<00:04:22.200> a<00:04:22.320> fantastic<00:04:22.530> achievement<00:04:23.310> in<00:04:23.850> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
would be a fantastic achievement in the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.780 
would be a fantastic achievement in the
first<00:04:24.150> year<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:25.010> getting<00:04:26.010> into<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.370> playoffs

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
first year and getting into the playoffs

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.990 
first year and getting into the playoffs
but<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:28.710> do<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:28.860> you<00:04:29.250> have<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.430> work<00:04:29.970> very

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
but to do that you have to work very

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.060 
but to do that you have to work very
hard<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.870> have<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.380> efforts<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:31.800> have<00:04:31.950> your

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
hard and have the efforts and have your

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.980 
hard and have the efforts and have your
goals<00:04:32.340> and<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.610> think<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.970> goal<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.390> we

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
goals and I think the goal that we

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.080 
goals and I think the goal that we
should<00:04:34.169> have<00:04:34.350> is<00:04:34.680> maintained<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.729> way<00:04:35.850> we're

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
should have is maintained the way we're

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.010 
should have is maintained the way we're
working<00:04:36.270> on<00:04:36.600> now

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
working on now

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.050 
working on now
and<00:04:37.289> progressing<00:04:37.949> on<00:04:38.099> the<00:04:38.220> way<00:04:38.340> where<00:04:38.580> we're

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
and progressing on the way where we're

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.230 
and progressing on the way where we're
playing<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.660> that's<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:41.639> vision<00:04:41.789> that<00:04:42.000> we

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
playing and that's the vision that we

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.559 
playing and that's the vision that we
have<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.690> with<00:04:43.259> that<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:44.300> becoming<00:04:45.300> better

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
have and with that and becoming better

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.159 
have and with that and becoming better
with<00:04:46.169> that<00:04:46.379> we<00:04:47.340> should<00:04:47.580> get<00:04:48.150> more<00:04:48.300> points<00:04:48.569> and

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
with that we should get more points and

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.100 
with that we should get more points and
finally<00:04:50.159> end<00:04:50.370> up<00:04:50.520> in<00:04:50.819> the<00:04:50.940> in<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.569> first<00:04:51.840> six

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
finally end up in the in the first six

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.430 
finally end up in the in the first six
