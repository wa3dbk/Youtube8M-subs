 best match maker remake the world 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.480
 do these fund books 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.590
 carbon fiber carbon mass you know where you 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.630
 Risk m aussi Nashiri as well as of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.539

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.669
 use just next door and above 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.670

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.320
 company 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.559
 will be looking at gaza news release 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.160
 gaza to make win gbagbo drop 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.329
 this possible this is why we choose lorima 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.890
 I am very proud to return to be 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.809
 on this kind of project for a simple 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.879
 and good reason is that have managed to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.260
 associate the competition part precisely 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.300
 where we have been developing since 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.440
 very very long time on the part 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.839
 multihulls or if there is a funny sort 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.699
 when catamaran is today the tan 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.960
 66 represents perfectly what we have 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.940
 managed to develop the part 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.229
 competition at the cruise part the 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.909
 seven cruise parties today we have 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.500
 tried to simplify things so 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.000
 to have a product that is more 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.140
 easily adaptable to just this 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.270
 part cruises and maybe people 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.550
 less experienced but in any case who 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.410
 benefits perfectly from the notion 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.509
 carbon so the weight the performance 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.240
 this being the case we tried to work 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.920
 precisely on a project that remains 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.390
 something very safe 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.300
 we need to have products that they 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.740
 are easily usable secure and 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.060
 with information leaflets that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.060
 make it easy to use 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.920
 carbon fiber material list all of 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:53.930
 very very light very resistant beings 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:56.960
 isync is also a lady of time in gamine 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.880
 high schools carbon mass screw m 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.270
 otherwise it's idiotic under style finder 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.750
 you need the superfast catamar and you 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.470
 must have 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.250
 very light mass tens of carbon fiber is 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.680
 not only the most the choice of carbon 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.480
 it is indeed we will say that the hand in 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.890
 much lighter effect that's not there 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.160
 photo now on the principle it's 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.630
 especially to be able to benefit from 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.030
 this weight the weight that we will have in the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.240
 mast height just imagine 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.800
 for example on the height of the rhombus of 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.300
 this evil has for example to have 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.590
 the equivalent to its center of 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.360
 gravity that we will consider roughly 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.770
 in the middle of the farmhouse to have a little cow 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.410
 near a Breton cow in this area 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.140
 there who today goes in his 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.340
 operation of the boat allow the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.870
 boats in any case do not have this 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.580
 mass in this area there to have a 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.170
 boat that is at a behavior on 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.970
 water that is much healthier that wants 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.440
 say that the more we drop the masses on 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.830
 the height plus the boat has a 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.170
 interesting behavior 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.520
 I filed a patent there are few 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.230
 time for a good color always 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.670
 same to benefit from what is being done 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.350
 in the competition to have a real 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.420
 mainsail reported to the party 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.890
 cruise on the tan 66 is to have 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.630
 a retractable boom on which we have 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.390
 true slats so today the system 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.769
 wants us to be able to wind up 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.630
 mainsail battens and 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.310
 carts turn a tube that makes that the 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.810
 mainsail is exactly the same on 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.580
 a boat at the moment when they open a 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.580
 traditional good tradition 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.470
