00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.460 
would that be
OCP<00:01:46.439> new<00:01:46.619> or<00:01:47.100> full<00:01:47.640> alien<00:01:48.380> something<00:01:49.380> like

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
OCP new or full alien something like

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.210 
OCP new or full alien something like
that<00:01:49.649> anyway<00:01:50.030> once<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
that anyway once you get here in you

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.499 
that anyway once you get here in you
maneuver<00:01:53.220> around<00:01:53.369> all<00:01:53.790> those<00:01:53.970> bear<00:01:54.210> traps

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
maneuver around all those bear traps

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.789 
maneuver around all those bear traps
like<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.840> saw<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.290> did<00:01:55.470> well<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.540> makes<00:01:57.540> sense

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
like I saw you did well that makes sense

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.770 
like I saw you did well that makes sense
you'll<00:01:58.799> come<00:01:58.979> across<00:01:59.100> energy<00:01:59.579> here<00:02:00.409> and

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
you'll come across energy here and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
you'll come across energy here and
option<00:02:03.780> two<00:02:03.840> killing<00:02:04.110> her<00:02:04.230> we<00:02:04.350> don't<00:02:04.410> kill<00:02:04.650> all

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
option two killing her we don't kill all

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.990 
option two killing her we don't kill all
cuz<00:02:04.980> that'll<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.430> bit<00:02:05.550> hard<00:02:05.730> to<00:02:05.760> get<00:02:05.880> it

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
cuz that'll make it a bit hard to get it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.430 
cuz that'll make it a bit hard to get it
I<00:02:06.180> don't<00:02:06.510> actually<00:02:06.600> make<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.930> easy<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.350> get

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
I don't actually make it easy to get

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.680 
I don't actually make it easy to get
over<00:02:07.850> but<00:02:08.850> you're<00:02:08.970> gonna<00:02:09.090> ask<00:02:09.240> her<00:02:09.360> about<00:02:09.510> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
over but you're gonna ask her about the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.960 
over but you're gonna ask her about the
targets<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.320> then<00:02:11.310> she's<00:02:11.490> gonna<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:11.940> you

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
targets and then she's gonna go are you

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.430 
targets and then she's gonna go are you
any<00:02:12.240> good<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.540> bird<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.020> you<00:02:13.080> can<00:02:13.290> say

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
any good with the bird and you can say

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.390 
any good with the bird and you can say
whatever<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.770> want<00:02:15.650> how<00:02:16.650> about<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.860> shoe<00:02:17.190> with

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
whatever you want how about a shoe with

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.170 
whatever you want how about a shoe with
a<00:02:17.430> shot<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.030> head<00:02:18.210> no<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.390> don't<00:02:18.660> know<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
a shot to the head no I don't know and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.310 
a shot to the head no I don't know and
eventually<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.510> say<00:02:21.750> you're<00:02:21.900> ready<00:02:22.050> for<00:02:22.170> some

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
eventually you say you're ready for some

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.870 
eventually you say you're ready for some
practice<00:02:22.410> take<00:02:22.920> these<00:02:23.070> practice<00:02:23.520> or<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.790> it

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
practice take these practice or is it

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.250 
practice take these practice or is it
leaning<00:02:24.180> against<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> wall<00:02:24.540> here<00:02:24.930> because

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
leaning against the wall here because

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.260 
leaning against the wall here because
you<00:02:25.350> can<00:02:25.500> only<00:02:25.620> use<00:02:25.920> practice<00:02:26.490> sorry<00:02:26.850> practice

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
you can only use practice sorry practice

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.330 
you can only use practice sorry practice
arrows<00:02:27.660> because<00:02:28.560> that's<00:02:28.800> all<00:02:28.920> she'll<00:02:29.100> let<00:02:29.250> you

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
arrows because that's all she'll let you

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.440 
arrows because that's all she'll let you
use<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.950> once<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.730> get<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.000> just<00:02:33.240> head

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
use and once you get that just head

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.700 
use and once you get that just head
south<00:02:33.660> down<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.020> hill<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.320> down<00:02:34.440> til<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
south down the hill and down til the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.130 
south down the hill and down til the
targets<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.280> she's<00:02:36.270> going<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.480> give<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
targets and she's going to give you the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.370 
targets and she's going to give you the
four<00:02:37.620> tests<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.660> first<00:02:39.870> one<00:02:40.020> here<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.350> just

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
four tests so the first one here is just

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.620 
four tests so the first one here is just
to<00:02:40.620> hit<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.920> three<00:02:41.250> targets<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.090> first<00:02:42.450> three

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
to hit the three targets the first three

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.340 
to hit the three targets the first three
targets<00:02:42.990> sir<00:02:47.300> I'm<00:02:48.300> gonna<00:02:48.480> cut<00:02:49.050> through<00:02:49.200> this

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
targets sir I'm gonna cut through this

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.750 
targets sir I'm gonna cut through this
video<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.650> few<00:02:49.830> times<00:02:50.100> because<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.460> didn't

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
video a few times because if I didn't

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.280 
video a few times because if I didn't
this<00:02:50.910> video<00:02:51.480> would<00:02:51.600> be<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:51.780> seven<00:02:52.200> hours

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
this video would be like seven hours

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.720 
this video would be like seven hours
long<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:54.810> was<00:02:54.980> surprisingly<00:02:55.980> difficult

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
long it was surprisingly difficult

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.640 
long it was surprisingly difficult
maybe<00:02:57.180> not<00:02:57.390> for<00:02:57.540> most<00:02:57.750> people<00:02:57.990> but<00:02:58.050> for<00:02:58.170> me<00:02:58.230> it

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
maybe not for most people but for me it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.330 
maybe not for most people but for me it
was<00:02:59.780> and<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.959> second<00:03:01.290> test<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:02.040> hit<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
was and the second test is to hit the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.520 
was and the second test is to hit the
three<00:03:02.550> targets<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.270> eight<00:03:03.390> seconds<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.900> think

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.190 

the<00:03:07.530> only<00:03:07.739> tip<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:08.010> can<00:03:08.070> give<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:09.080> for<00:03:10.080> these

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
the only tip I can give you is for these

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.500 
the only tip I can give you is for these
bunkers<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.459> just<00:03:11.640> aim<00:03:11.820> a<00:03:11.850> little<00:03:12.060> bit<00:03:12.300> lower

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
bunkers here just aim a little bit lower

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.920 
bunkers here just aim a little bit lower
and<00:03:12.720> then<00:03:12.900> what<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.140> going<00:03:13.290> to<00:03:13.410> hit<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.900> then

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
and then what you going to hit and then

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.900 
and then what you going to hit and then
that<00:03:16.140> seems<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.500> get<00:03:16.590> him<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.640> third

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
that seems to get him and for the third

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.030 
that seems to get him and for the third
test<00:03:21.239> she<00:03:21.780> wants<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.080> hit<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.320> very<00:03:22.620> far

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
test she wants you to hit the very far

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.220 
test she wants you to hit the very far
target<00:03:23.790> on<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.940> back<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.750> I'm<00:03:24.870> lucky<00:03:25.050> because

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
target on the back and I'm lucky because

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.500 
target on the back and I'm lucky because
I<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.620> zoom<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:25.980> school<00:03:26.269> but<00:03:27.269> for<00:03:27.390> this

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
I have the zoom in school but for this

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.050 
I have the zoom in school but for this
one<00:03:27.720> just<00:03:27.989> put<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.830> crosshair<00:03:29.550> directly

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
one just put the the crosshair directly

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.360 
one just put the the crosshair directly
on<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.630> should<00:03:30.780> hit<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:34.250> sorry<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.310> took

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
on it and it should hit it sorry I took

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.590 
on it and it should hit it sorry I took
so<00:03:35.489> long<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.850> fire<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:36.209> one<00:03:36.330> off<00:03:36.450> falls

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
so long to fire this one off falls

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.290 
so long to fire this one off falls
waiting<00:03:36.870> here<00:03:36.989> for<00:03:37.350> her<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.560> see<00:03:37.709> her<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.640> when

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
waiting here for her to see her and when

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.840 
waiting here for her to see her and when
I<00:03:39.330> realized<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.780> she<00:03:39.959> wasn't<00:03:40.110> going<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.500> I

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
I realized that she wasn't going to I

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:49.680 
I realized that she wasn't going to I
was<00:03:41.850> like<00:03:41.970> oh<00:03:42.180> crap
