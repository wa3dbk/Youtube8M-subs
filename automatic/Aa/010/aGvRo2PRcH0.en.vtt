00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.760
Good god, that's beautiful.
The Angel Darkstorm.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.160
Nebula and black hole meeting in perfect harmony.
Absolutely magnificent.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.620
Ah, rats.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.180
Can't enjoy such a sight without a good cuppa.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.980
Huh?
*spluttering*

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.620
Work, dammit!

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.580
No!

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.680
Oh, good lord.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.800
Uhh... Hello, I'm the Doct-- Oof!

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.620
What the--
What did the Darkstorm do?

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.650
Giving tea sentience, who knows what might
happen?!

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.460
Wait. No, not the coffee machine!
I need that whenever I am up late trying to

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.311
speed-read all of Shakespeare's great works.
Do you know how long it takes to read forty

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.749
plays?!
My record is two hours and twelve minutes,

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:10.869
and I need that coffee!

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.180
*laughing*

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.680
Oh, you laugh now.
But what about when I disassemble your molecular

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.300
structure!

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.860
Hmm, needs more sugar.
