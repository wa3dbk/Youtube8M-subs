00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 I've happened to do I do not know 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.609
 speak right on the name of the 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.300
 celebrity that we are going to make this 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.920
 time the girl bei everything and correct me there 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.320
 below the comments because they were 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.299
 you have chosen her style and it is 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.299
 the one we're going to show where in the video 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.070
 When I think of the girl's style I 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.080
 I think mainly of two 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.450
 characteristics the first is that it 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.449
 prefers pieces well marks in dark tones 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.550
 and neutral, and the scene is that she really likes 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.129
 to highlight the legs then the 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.410
 visual it end up as much of it 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.500
 one of the things that can not be missed is 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.180
 the boots look great with the skirts and 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.489
 dresses she really likes to wear 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.530
 again in more neutral tones but 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.120
 mixed belly several times 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.920
 also with goias 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.659
 I already made a video on beret if you 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.360
 Do you want to see her like you? 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.699
 mainly of these type of knitting 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.699
 crochet because even if the clothes are 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.920
 tidy and a blazer abandoned a 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.930
 little more stripped down when she uses 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.729
 jeans what is well with the first she 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.220
 prefer them to be black or like 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.640
 washing over dark and also combining 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.369
 We are neutral so T-shirts 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.530
 basics of one color saws only in gray 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.869
 always falling for her combined with 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.030
 Longer looser cardigan 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.340
 The tip is to choose pieces that really 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.850
 would also have to value their 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.039
 figure because for more the column that 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.929
 be the girl's pieces so to speak 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.789
 it gives a special touch to choose 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.670
 those that serve as a glove 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.560
 This is clear everyone can do is 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.600
 only sequence in your body and we 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.030

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.109
 how to find the right piece for your 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.939
 figure 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.319
