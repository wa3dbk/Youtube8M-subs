considering replacing a technician

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.720 
considering replacing a technician
because<00:00:35.920> he<00:00:36.010> didn't<00:00:36.250> have<00:00:36.310> the<00:00:36.370> proper

certification versus experience and also

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.810 
certification versus experience and also
a<00:00:44.470> little<00:00:44.740> bit<00:00:44.890> about<00:00:45.040> that<00:00:45.250> employer<00:00:45.700> it's

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
a little bit about that employer it's

a little bit about that employer it's
himself<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:46.870> I<00:00:47.440> like<00:00:47.830> the<00:00:47.950> fact<00:00:48.130> that<00:00:48.310> some<00:00:48.580> of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.340 
himself and I like the fact that some of
you<00:00:48.880> actually<00:00:49.090> pointed<00:00:49.720> out<00:00:49.840> that<00:00:50.050> from<00:00:50.260> a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
you actually pointed out that from a

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.530 
you actually pointed out that from a
business<00:00:50.650> owner<00:00:50.860> standpoint<00:00:51.490> he<00:00:52.120> has<00:00:52.240> to<00:00:52.420> look

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
business owner standpoint he has to look

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.540 
business owner standpoint he has to look
out<00:00:52.690> for<00:00:52.900> his<00:00:53.050> interests<00:00:53.470> as<00:00:53.560> well<00:00:53.740> because<00:00:54.190> he

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
out for his interests as well because he

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.770 
out for his interests as well because he
invests<00:00:55.120> money<00:00:55.750> into<00:00:56.350> his<00:00:56.680> crew<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:58.360> have<00:00:58.570> them

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
invests money into his crew to have them

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.870 
invests money into his crew to have them
perform<00:00:58.990> work<00:00:59.500> and<00:00:59.830> if<00:01:00.040> that<00:01:00.190> work<00:01:00.430> isn't<00:01:00.670> up

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
perform work and if that work isn't up

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.340 
perform work and if that work isn't up
to<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.120> standards<00:01:01.570> of<00:01:01.690> like<00:01:01.870> say<00:01:02.110> in<00:01:02.230> this

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
to the standards of like say in this

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.009 
to the standards of like say in this
instance<00:01:02.890> Toyota<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.610> they<00:01:04.210> don't<00:01:04.420> sign<00:01:04.780> off

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
instance Toyota and they don't sign off

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.710 
instance Toyota and they don't sign off
on<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.320> repair<00:01:05.710> well<00:01:06.369> he's<00:01:07.119> kind<00:01:07.390> of<00:01:07.450> screwed

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
on the repair well he's kind of screwed

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.109 
on the repair well he's kind of screwed
so<00:01:08.590> he<00:01:08.770> was<00:01:08.920> looking<00:01:09.040> for<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.369> solution<00:01:09.610> to<00:01:09.939> that

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
so he was looking for a solution to that

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.090 
so he was looking for a solution to that
now<00:01:10.509> I<00:01:10.540> thought<00:01:10.900> he<00:01:10.960> was<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.110> bit<00:01:11.350> callous<00:01:11.680> in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
now I thought he was a bit callous in

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.499 
now I thought he was a bit callous in
his<00:01:12.909> approach<00:01:13.469> however<00:01:14.469> I<00:01:15.429> think<00:01:16.299> it<00:01:16.359> brought

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
his approach however I think it brought

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.169 
his approach however I think it brought
up<00:01:16.659> an<00:01:16.780> interesting<00:01:16.899> point<00:01:17.530> about<00:01:18.149> us

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
up an interesting point about us

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.569 
up an interesting point about us
technicians<00:01:19.899> not<00:01:20.140> being<00:01:20.439> shop<00:01:20.829> equipment<00:01:21.369> now

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
technicians not being shop equipment now

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.889 
technicians not being shop equipment now
I<00:01:21.609> did<00:01:21.850> some<00:01:22.030> thinking<00:01:22.270> about<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.749> whole

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
I did some thinking about the whole

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.349 
I did some thinking about the whole
argument<00:01:23.469> of<00:01:23.850> experience<00:01:24.850> versus

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
argument of experience versus

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.959 
argument of experience versus
certification<00:01:26.229> education<00:01:27.039> and<00:01:27.369> I<00:01:27.670> think<00:01:27.880> I've

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
certification education and I think I've

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.779 
certification education and I think I've
come<00:01:28.149> up<00:01:28.270> with<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.619> good<00:01:29.619> analogy<00:01:30.069> an<00:01:30.340> analogy

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
come up with a good analogy an analogy

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.760 
come up with a good analogy an analogy
that<00:01:30.909> I<00:01:31.119> at<00:01:31.270> least<00:01:31.420> would<00:01:31.689> like<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:31.960> use<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.439> lot

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
that I at least would like to use a lot

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.069 
that I at least would like to use a lot
of<00:01:32.799> times<00:01:33.069> auto<00:01:33.460> repair<00:01:33.909> is<00:01:34.149> like<00:01:34.450> chasing<00:01:34.810> a

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
of times auto repair is like chasing a

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.800 
of times auto repair is like chasing a
puppy<00:01:35.469> in<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.710> completely<00:01:36.340> dark<00:01:36.609> room<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:37.600> can

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
puppy in a completely dark room you can

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.109 
puppy in a completely dark room you can
hear<00:01:38.109> it<00:01:38.200> it's<00:01:38.380> running<00:01:38.829> around<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.429> you<00:01:39.969> can

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
hear it it's running around and you can

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.789 
hear it it's running around and you can
chase<00:01:40.359> after<00:01:40.569> it<00:01:40.869> but<00:01:41.109> you<00:01:41.200> can't<00:01:41.439> see<00:01:41.710> it

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
chase after it but you can't see it

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.910 
chase after it but you can't see it
because<00:01:41.920> it's<00:01:42.009> completely<00:01:42.670> dark

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
because it's completely dark

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.219 
because it's completely dark
education<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.159> light<00:01:45.579> switch<00:01:45.939> you<00:01:46.270> flip

the<00:01:47.350> light<00:01:47.530> switch<00:01:47.560> you're<00:01:48.009> actually<00:01:48.399> able<00:01:48.549> to

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
the light switch you're actually able to

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.270 
the light switch you're actually able to
see<00:01:48.969> the<00:01:49.179> puppy<00:01:49.509> running<00:01:49.929> around<00:01:50.139> inside<00:01:51.009> and

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
all those things coming together make

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.200 
all those things coming together make
for<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.770> successful<00:02:11.980> repair<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:12.940> know<00:02:13.000> we're

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
for a successful repair I know we're

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.730 
for a successful repair I know we're
talking<00:02:13.360> about<00:02:13.630> puppies<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.350> dark<00:02:14.560> but<00:02:14.680> I

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
talking about puppies in the dark but I

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.310 
talking about puppies in the dark but I
think<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.070> a<00:02:15.130> good<00:02:15.280> analogy<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:17.170> would

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
think it's a good analogy and I would

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.770 
think it's a good analogy and I would
also<00:02:17.470> argue<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.010> education<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.180> part<00:02:19.660> of

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
also argue that education is part of

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.210 
also argue that education is part of
your<00:02:19.900> experience<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.860> certification

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
your experience and that certification

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.290 
your experience and that certification
is<00:02:21.930> validation<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.140> experience<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.730> lot

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
is validation of that experience a lot

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.820 
is validation of that experience a lot
of<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.480> brought<00:02:25.720> up<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.990> point<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.560> agree

of you brought up a point that I agree

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.010 
of you brought up a point that I agree
with<00:02:26.860> which<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.580> if<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.540> went<00:02:28.750> through<00:02:28.900> the

with which is if you went through the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
training is a liability and and I would

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.780 
training is a liability and and I would
not<00:03:56.470> want<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.709> hire<00:03:56.890> that<00:03:56.920> person<00:03:57.130> because

not want to hire that person because

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.520 
not want to hire that person because
they<00:03:58.269> they<00:03:58.570> hadn't<00:03:58.930> made<00:03:59.050> that<00:03:59.110> commitment

like that I don't think that exists

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.310 
like that I don't think that exists
anymore<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:19.150> don't<00:04:19.210> think<00:04:19.359> that<00:04:19.720> there's<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:20.020> job

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
anymore I don't think that there's a job

anymore I don't think that there's a job
out<00:04:20.530> there<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.739> could<00:04:21.010> be

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
out there I could be

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.680 
out there I could be
and<00:04:21.549> go<00:04:21.640> ahead<00:04:21.820> and<00:04:21.940> tell<00:04:22.090> me<00:04:22.180> in<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.300> comments

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.900 
and go ahead and tell me in the comments
but<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:23.050> just<00:04:23.740> don't<00:04:23.890> think<00:04:24.040> there's<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.430> way<00:04:24.610> for

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
but I just don't think there's a way for

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.800 
but I just don't think there's a way for
you<00:04:25.030> even<00:04:25.780> as<00:04:25.900> an<00:04:26.050> experienced<00:04:26.710> DIY<00:04:27.610> er

you even as an experienced DIY er
someone<00:04:28.810> who's<00:04:28.960> worked<00:04:29.290> on<00:04:29.410> cars<00:04:29.680> for<00:04:29.920> several

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
someone who's worked on cars for several

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.580 
someone who's worked on cars for several
years<00:04:30.430> at<00:04:30.580> home<00:04:30.760> has<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.420> natural<00:04:31.930> ability<00:04:32.020> for

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
years at home has a natural ability for

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.800 
years at home has a natural ability for
it<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.890> don't<00:04:33.880> think<00:04:34.060> it's<00:04:34.150> possible<00:04:34.600> for<00:04:34.720> you

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
it I don't think it's possible for you

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.780 
it I don't think it's possible for you
to<00:04:34.840> necessarily<00:04:35.380> walk<00:04:35.800> into<00:04:36.190> someplace<00:04:36.400> and

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
to necessarily walk into someplace and

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.490 
to necessarily walk into someplace and
get<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:36.940> job<00:04:37.210> like<00:04:37.480> that<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:38.080> might<00:04:38.230> know

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
get a job like that you might know

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.740 
get a job like that you might know
somebody<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.550> might<00:04:39.760> work<00:04:39.970> out<00:04:40.150> but<00:04:40.540> I

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
somebody and that might work out but I

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.630 
somebody and that might work out but I
just<00:04:41.140> think<00:04:41.530> that<00:04:41.680> that's<00:04:41.830> that's<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.400> rare

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
just think that that's that's a rare

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.640 
just think that that's that's a rare
occurrence<00:04:43.210> I<00:04:43.660> don't<00:04:44.350> think<00:04:44.500> that's

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
occurrence I don't think that's

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.170 
occurrence I don't think that's
something<00:04:44.830> as<00:04:45.160> common<00:04:45.460> as<00:04:45.640> it<00:04:45.790> used<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.030> be

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
something as common as it used to be

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.660 
something as common as it used to be
like<00:04:46.360> say<00:04:46.600> in<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.020> 50s<00:04:47.410> and<00:04:47.530> 60s<00:04:47.590> where<00:04:48.490> that

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
like say in the 50s and 60s where that

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.580 
like say in the 50s and 60s where that
was<00:04:48.820> actually<00:04:49.210> what<00:04:49.420> you<00:04:49.570> did<00:04:49.840> I<00:04:50.080> mean<00:04:50.230> that's

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
was actually what you did I mean that's

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.970 
was actually what you did I mean that's
at<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.800> time<00:04:50.980> before<00:04:51.160> ASE<00:04:51.850> but<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:53.500> was<00:04:53.560> kind

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
at a time before ASE but so it was kind

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.890 
at a time before ASE but so it was kind
of<00:04:54.010> an<00:04:54.130> unregulated<00:04:54.640> Wild<00:04:55.300> West<00:04:55.510> kind<00:04:55.810> of

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
of an unregulated Wild West kind of

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.159 
of an unregulated Wild West kind of
industry<00:04:56.260> back<00:04:56.440> then<00:04:56.680> but<00:04:57.660> dare<00:04:58.660> I<00:04:58.690> say<00:04:59.020> this

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
industry back then but dare I say this

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.700 
industry back then but dare I say this
was<00:04:59.740> there<00:04:59.950> more<00:05:00.160> integrity<00:05:00.730> back<00:05:01.180> then<00:05:01.710> it's

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
was there more integrity back then it's

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.470 
was there more integrity back then it's
hard<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:02.980> say<00:05:03.220> because<00:05:03.580> I<00:05:03.790> wasn't<00:05:04.120> even<00:05:04.210> alive

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
hard to say because I wasn't even alive

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.020 
hard to say because I wasn't even alive
but<00:05:05.320> from<00:05:05.770> everything<00:05:05.950> my<00:05:06.250> grandparents<00:05:06.940> have

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
but from everything my grandparents have

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.390 
but from everything my grandparents have
told<00:05:07.210> me<00:05:07.360> there<00:05:07.660> was<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:08.200> I<00:05:08.860> have<00:05:08.950> a<00:05:09.010> tendency

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
told me there was and I have a tendency

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.230 
told me there was and I have a tendency
to<00:05:09.490> believe<00:05:09.640> them<00:05:09.970> all<00:05:10.360> that<00:05:10.720> set<00:05:10.960> aside<00:05:11.260> I

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
to believe them all that set aside I

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.730 
to believe them all that set aside I
think<00:05:13.240> like<00:05:13.750> many<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:14.080> you<00:05:14.140> pointed<00:05:14.320> out<00:05:14.560> you

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
think like many of you pointed out you

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.220 
think like many of you pointed out you
need<00:05:14.890> a<00:05:14.919> combination<00:05:15.160> of<00:05:15.580> both<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.840> I<00:05:17.020> also

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
need a combination of both and I also

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.380 
need a combination of both and I also
think<00:05:17.680> that<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:17.890> education<00:05:18.250> counts<00:05:18.970> toward

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
think that that education counts toward

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.880 
think that that education counts toward
your<00:05:19.450> experience<00:05:20.050> that's<00:05:20.230> a<00:05:20.350> part<00:05:20.620> of<00:05:20.740> your

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
your experience that's a part of your

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.159 
your experience that's a part of your
experience<00:05:21.280> even<00:05:21.700> though<00:05:22.480> you<00:05:22.540> haven't<00:05:22.870> had

experience even though you haven't had

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.930 
experience even though you haven't had
like<00:05:23.440> hands-on<00:05:24.160> experience<00:05:24.700> with<00:05:24.820> that

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
like hands-on experience with that

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.150 
like hands-on experience with that
education<00:05:25.150> you<00:05:25.990> still<00:05:26.260> have<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.500> grasp<00:05:26.890> we

lights<00:05:29.590> are<00:05:29.800> on<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.400> you're<00:05:30.760> able<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:31.030> see

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
lights are on and you're able to see

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.480 
lights are on and you're able to see
that<00:05:31.450> puppy<00:05:31.840> running<00:05:32.110> around<00:05:32.229> as<00:05:32.620> opposed<00:05:33.370> to

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
that puppy running around as opposed to

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.100 
that puppy running around as opposed to
just<00:05:33.640> being<00:05:33.760> in<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.120> dark<00:05:34.360> just<00:05:34.450> chasing<00:05:35.020> it

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
just being in the dark just chasing it

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.140 
just being in the dark just chasing it
around<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.500> blind<00:05:35.830> hope<00:05:36.130> hoping<00:05:36.610> you<00:05:36.700> find<00:05:36.729> it

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
around a blind hope hoping you find it

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.600 
around a blind hope hoping you find it
you<00:05:37.540> might<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.770> there's<00:05:39.190> a<00:05:39.250> good<00:05:39.400> chance

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
you might and and there's a good chance

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.030 
you might and and there's a good chance
you<00:05:39.820> will<00:05:40.000> but<00:05:40.840> it'd<00:05:41.110> be<00:05:41.200> a<00:05:41.350> lot<00:05:41.410> easier<00:05:41.590> with

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
you will but it'd be a lot easier with

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.370 
you will but it'd be a lot easier with
the<00:05:42.130> lights<00:05:42.340> on<00:05:42.520> and<00:05:42.790> it'd<00:05:43.180> be<00:05:43.210> even<00:05:43.510> easier<00:05:43.990> if

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
the lights on and it'd be even easier if

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.080 
the lights on and it'd be even easier if
you<00:05:44.560> had<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:44.890> dog<00:05:45.130> biscuit<00:05:45.550> in<00:05:45.610> your<00:05:45.700> pocket

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
you had that dog biscuit in your pocket

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.380 
you had that dog biscuit in your pocket
I<00:05:47.070> think<00:05:48.070> that<00:05:48.430> pretty<00:05:48.580> much<00:05:48.700> sums<00:05:48.850> up<00:05:49.210> how<00:05:49.360> I

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
I think that pretty much sums up how I

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.120 
I think that pretty much sums up how I
feel<00:05:49.660> about<00:05:49.900> it<00:05:49.960> it's<00:05:50.410> a<00:05:50.470> combination<00:05:50.800> of

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
feel about it it's a combination of

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
feel about it it's a combination of
everything<00:05:51.280> that's<00:05:51.669> going<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:51.850> give<00:05:52.030> you

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
everything that's going to give you

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.840 
everything that's going to give you
success<00:05:52.840> in<00:05:52.900> this<00:05:53.140> industry<00:05:53.430> it's<00:05:54.430> not<00:05:54.520> any

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
success in this industry it's not any

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.420 
success in this industry it's not any
one<00:05:55.120> thing<00:05:55.180> and<00:05:55.750> getting<00:05:56.560> back<00:05:56.740> to<00:05:56.919> the<00:05:57.070> to<00:05:57.310> the

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
one thing and getting back to the to the

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.280 
one thing and getting back to the to the
argument<00:05:57.820> about<00:05:57.880> technicians<00:05:58.750> just<00:05:59.110> being

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
argument about technicians just being

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.800 
argument about technicians just being
like<00:05:59.530> shop<00:05:59.830> equipment<00:06:00.330> that's<00:06:01.330> something<00:06:01.720> I

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
like shop equipment that's something I

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.200 
like shop equipment that's something I
still<00:06:02.080> am<00:06:02.320> very<00:06:02.650> much<00:06:02.830> opposed<00:06:03.190> to<00:06:03.430> I<00:06:03.669> don't

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
still am very much opposed to I don't

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.700 
still am very much opposed to I don't
like<00:06:04.360> his<00:06:04.600> approach<00:06:04.870> many<00:06:05.290> of<00:06:05.410> you<00:06:05.530> pointed

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
like his approach many of you pointed

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.080 
like his approach many of you pointed
out<00:06:05.950> that<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.310> best<00:06:06.460> approach<00:06:06.669> would<00:06:07.060> be

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
out that the best approach would be

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.510 
out that the best approach would be
something<00:06:07.450> like<00:06:07.800> take<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:08.919> technician<00:06:09.430> you

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
something like take the technician you

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.250 
something like take the technician you
already<00:06:09.880> have<00:06:10.120> and<00:06:10.419> send<00:06:10.690> them<00:06:10.810> out<00:06:10.930> for<00:06:10.960> that

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
already have and send them out for that

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.830 
already have and send them out for that
training<00:06:11.580> rather<00:06:12.580> than<00:06:12.910> trying<00:06:13.180> to<00:06:13.240> recycle

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
training rather than trying to recycle

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.000 
training rather than trying to recycle
them<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.080> get<00:06:14.229> somebody<00:06:14.470> who<00:06:14.680> already<00:06:14.860> has

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
them and get somebody who already has

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.770 
them and get somebody who already has
that<00:06:15.370> training<00:06:15.729> because<00:06:16.240> that's<00:06:16.450> kind<00:06:16.660> of<00:06:16.690> a

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
that training because that's kind of a

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.280 
that training because that's kind of a
shortcut

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
shortcut

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.080 
shortcut
that's<00:06:17.800> like<00:06:18.010> saying<00:06:18.310> I'm<00:06:18.490> not<00:06:18.729> willing<00:06:18.910> to

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
that's like saying I'm not willing to

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.909 
that's like saying I'm not willing to
invest<00:06:19.479> in<00:06:19.630> that<00:06:19.750> technicians<00:06:20.140> training<00:06:20.800> to

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
invest in that technicians training to

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.140 
invest in that technicians training to
make<00:06:21.100> him<00:06:21.280> into

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
make him into

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.840 
make him into
what<00:06:22.330> he<00:06:22.510> needs<00:06:22.780> to<00:06:22.990> be<00:06:23.170> in<00:06:23.710> order<00:06:24.010> to<00:06:24.220> get<00:06:24.700> that

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
what he needs to be in order to get that

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.090 
what he needs to be in order to get that
certified<00:06:25.390> repair<00:06:25.600> I'd<00:06:26.230> rather<00:06:26.500> just<00:06:26.740> go<00:06:26.920> out

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
certified repair I'd rather just go out

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.010 
certified repair I'd rather just go out
and<00:06:27.130> get<00:06:27.430> a<00:06:27.610> ready-made<00:06:27.970> piece<00:06:28.390> of<00:06:28.540> equipment

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
and get a ready-made piece of equipment

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.950 
and get a ready-made piece of equipment
or<00:06:29.380> personnel<00:06:30.330> and<00:06:31.330> bring<00:06:31.570> them<00:06:31.690> into<00:06:31.810> the

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
or personnel and bring them into the

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.270 
or personnel and bring them into the
shop<00:06:31.990> and<00:06:32.200> get<00:06:32.530> rid<00:06:32.680> of<00:06:32.710> what's<00:06:32.920> not<00:06:33.070> working

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
shop and get rid of what's not working

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.220 
shop and get rid of what's not working
that's<00:06:33.910> the<00:06:34.180> attitude<00:06:34.330> I<00:06:34.720> had<00:06:34.900> issue<00:06:35.080> with

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230 
that's the attitude I had issue with

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.380 
that's the attitude I had issue with
it's<00:06:35.860> not<00:06:36.100> so<00:06:36.280> much<00:06:36.430> a<00:06:36.460> question<00:06:36.670> of<00:06:37.030> somebody

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
it's not so much a question of somebody

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.000 
it's not so much a question of somebody
with<00:06:37.540> experience<00:06:37.690> and<00:06:38.320> somebody<00:06:38.860> with

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
with experience and somebody with

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.130 
with experience and somebody with
certification<00:06:39.790> and<00:06:39.970> the<00:06:40.510> comparison<00:06:41.050> between

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
certification and the comparison between

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.530 
certification and the comparison between
those<00:06:41.530> two<00:06:41.770> things<00:06:41.980> it's<00:06:42.520> just<00:06:42.670> the<00:06:42.970> attitude

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
those two things it's just the attitude

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.230 
those two things it's just the attitude
of<00:06:43.570> oh<00:06:43.990> well<00:06:44.560> this<00:06:45.040> one's<00:06:45.310> no<00:06:45.490> good<00:06:45.520> I'm<00:06:46.000> gonna

of oh well this one's no good I'm gonna

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.940 
of oh well this one's no good I'm gonna
