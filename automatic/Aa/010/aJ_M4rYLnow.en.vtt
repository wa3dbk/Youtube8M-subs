they actually fill tab it's been removed
now<00:00:41.450> but<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:43.410> worked<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.920> cheaper<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
now but it worked out cheaper in the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.160

grab<00:02:09.149> some<00:02:09.360> water<00:02:09.390> from<00:02:09.690> your<00:02:09.840> pond<00:02:10.459> put<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.550> in

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
grab some water from your pond put it in

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.089 
grab some water from your pond put it in
there<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:11.879> still<00:02:12.239> got<00:02:12.420> drinking<00:02:12.780> water

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
there you still got drinking water

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.839 
there you still got drinking water
in<00:02:13.249> my<00:02:13.370> case<00:02:13.430> um<00:02:13.819> collecting<00:02:14.359> rainwater<00:02:14.599> and

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
in my case um collecting rainwater and

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.979 
in my case um collecting rainwater and
it<00:02:16.849> means<00:02:17.060> you're<00:02:17.209> never<00:02:17.359> ever<00:02:17.599> going<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.870> be

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
it means you're never ever going to be

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.360 
it means you're never ever going to be
sort<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.439> without<00:02:18.620> water

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
sort of without water

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.500 
sort of without water
now<00:02:20.120> what<00:02:20.269> I've<00:02:20.420> also<00:02:20.629> done<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:22.010> bought<00:02:22.510> a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
now what I've also done is I bought a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.569 
now what I've also done is I bought a
pair<00:02:24.049> of<00:02:24.079> these<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.349> just<00:02:24.469> just<00:02:24.829> wash<00:02:25.099> these<00:02:25.370> as

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
pair of these I just just wash these as

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.949 
pair of these I just just wash these as
well<00:02:25.790> these<00:02:26.510> are<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:27.260> f<00:02:27.920> PF<00:02:28.909> two<00:02:29.209> filters<00:02:29.870> I

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
well these are the f PF two filters I

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.119 
well these are the f PF two filters I
think<00:02:30.170> basically<00:02:30.500> what<00:02:30.650> these<00:02:30.769> do<00:02:30.950> is<00:02:30.980> they

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
think basically what these do is they

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.429 
think basically what these do is they
take<00:02:31.310> care<00:02:31.609> of<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.849> fluoride<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
take care of the fluoride and the

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.690 
take care of the fluoride and the
arsenic<00:02:33.889> and<00:02:34.099> what<00:02:34.189> they<00:02:34.280> do<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.549> they<00:02:34.670> just

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
arsenic and what they do is they just

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.750 
arsenic and what they do is they just
screw<00:02:35.150> onto<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.540> bottom<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.799> these<00:02:37.370> filters

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
screw onto the bottom of these filters

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.390 
screw onto the bottom of these filters
so<00:02:38.450> they<00:02:38.569> basically<00:02:38.989> hang<00:02:39.409> down<00:02:39.650> inside<00:02:40.099> and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
so they basically hang down inside and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.009 
so they basically hang down inside and
then<00:02:40.819> get<00:02:40.969> rid<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.150> any<00:02:41.269> fluoride<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:41.930> the

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
then get rid of any fluoride in the

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.379 
then get rid of any fluoride in the
water<00:02:42.049> as<00:02:42.439> well<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.090> happened<00:02:44.359> to

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
water as well and I just so happened to

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.809 
water as well and I just so happened to
have<00:02:44.480> switched<00:02:44.900> over<00:02:45.079> to<00:02:45.310> non<00:02:46.310> fluoride

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
have switched over to non fluoride

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.929 
have switched over to non fluoride
toothpastes<00:02:47.510> as<00:02:47.599> well<00:02:47.780> which<00:02:47.989> is<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.760> bit<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.849> an

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
toothpastes as well which is a bit of an

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.640 
toothpastes as well which is a bit of an
experiment<00:02:50.299> really<00:02:50.510> just<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.900> sort<00:02:51.079> of<00:02:51.169> mean

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
experiment really just to sort of mean

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.949 
experiment really just to sort of mean
so<00:02:52.549> I'm<00:02:52.669> not<00:02:52.819> consuming<00:02:53.419> the<00:02:53.540> fluoride

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
so I'm not consuming the fluoride

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:54.640 
so I'm not consuming the fluoride
anymore

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
anymore

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.970 
anymore
now<00:02:55.189> it<00:02:55.250> works<00:02:55.549> out<00:02:55.760> that's<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:57.620> could<00:02:57.829> leave

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
now it works out that's you could leave

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.250 
now it works out that's you could leave
these<00:02:58.219> part<00:02:58.519> these<00:02:58.819> Berkey<00:02:59.329> okay<00:02:59.719> Monica

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
these part these Berkey okay Monica

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.140 
these part these Berkey okay Monica
little<00:03:00.530> bark<00:03:00.709> use<00:03:00.949> and<00:03:01.099> reason<00:03:01.310> these<00:03:01.639> Berkey

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
little bark use and reason these Berkey

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.319 
little bark use and reason these Berkey
filters<00:03:02.750> they<00:03:03.500> can<00:03:03.739> last<00:03:03.949> up<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.370> ten<00:03:05.090> years

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
filters they can last up to ten years

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.539 
filters they can last up to ten years
and<00:03:06.019> all<00:03:06.409> you<00:03:06.620> do<00:03:06.739> is<00:03:06.859> just<00:03:06.980> once<00:03:07.159> a<00:03:07.280> month<00:03:07.310> you

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
and all you do is just once a month you

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:08.619 
and all you do is just once a month you
just<00:03:07.609> take<00:03:07.909> them<00:03:08.060> out<00:03:08.150> give<00:03:08.389> them<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.510> little

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
just take them out give them a little

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.869 
just take them out give them a little
scrub<00:03:08.989> with<00:03:09.139> a<00:03:09.169> bit<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.379> scotch<00:03:09.560> brite<00:03:09.889> put

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
scrub with a bit of scotch brite put

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.280 
scrub with a bit of scotch brite put
them<00:03:10.969> back<00:03:11.090> again<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.569> then<00:03:11.659> do<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.019> test

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
them back again and then do the test

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.599 
them back again and then do the test
which<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.650> exactly<00:03:12.919> what<00:03:13.099> I'm<00:03:13.159> doing<00:03:13.280> here

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
which is exactly what I'm doing here

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.330 
which is exactly what I'm doing here
with<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.939> the<00:03:14.329> green<00:03:14.540> color<00:03:15.069> in<00:03:16.069> there<00:03:16.310> and

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
with the the green color in there and

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.030 
with the the green color in there and
clearly<00:03:16.969> that's<00:03:17.209> that's<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:18.470> taken<00:03:18.889> the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
clearly that's that's it's taken the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.179 
clearly that's that's it's taken the
actual<00:03:19.340> dye<00:03:19.930> out<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.409> looks<00:03:21.709> nice<00:03:21.919> and<00:03:22.129> clean

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
actual dye out and looks nice and clean

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.330 
actual dye out and looks nice and clean
and<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.720> actually<00:03:24.079> works<00:03:24.319> out<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.650> lot<00:03:25.009> cheaper

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
and it actually works out a lot cheaper

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.469 
and it actually works out a lot cheaper
than<00:03:26.139> using<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:27.229> Brita<00:03:27.470> water<00:03:27.889> jug<00:03:28.489> filters

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:29.479 
than using the Brita water jug filters

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.030 
than using the Brita water jug filters
because<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:29.840> have<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.049> replace<00:03:30.500> those<00:03:30.709> every

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
because you have to replace those every

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.869 
because you have to replace those every
month<00:03:31.069> so<00:03:32.060> and<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:34.040> works<00:03:34.549> actually

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
month so and it works actually

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.659 
month so and it works actually
considerably<00:03:35.509> cheaper<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:37.220> also<00:03:37.340> obviously

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
considerably cheaper and also obviously

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.969 
considerably cheaper and also obviously
got<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.030> big<00:03:38.239> capacity<00:03:38.930> or<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:39.769> know<00:03:39.889> the

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:39.979 
got the big capacity or you know the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.179 
got the big capacity or you know the
much<00:03:40.129> bigger<00:03:40.340> capacity<00:03:40.549> and<00:03:41.349> it's<00:03:42.349> a<00:03:42.470> lot<00:03:42.680> less

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
much bigger capacity and it's a lot less

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.420 
much bigger capacity and it's a lot less
faffing<00:03:43.849> around<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.569> also<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.319> believe<00:03:45.829> the

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
faffing around and also I believe the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.649 
faffing around and also I believe the
Brita<00:03:46.669> ones

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
Brita ones

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:53.860 
Brita ones
it<00:03:48.139> only<00:03:48.349> takes<00:03:49.310> out<00:03:50.079> 99.99%<00:03:51.079> of<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:52.870> rubbish

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
it only takes out 99.99% of the rubbish

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.429 
it only takes out 99.99% of the rubbish
in<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.079> water

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:54.439 
in the water

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.849 
in the water
this<00:03:55.419> actually<00:03:56.419> purifies<00:03:57.229> the<00:03:57.409> water<00:03:57.439> it

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
this actually purifies the water it

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.379 
this actually purifies the water it
takes<00:03:58.069> out<00:03:58.280> ninety-nine<00:03:58.819> point<00:03:59.030> nine<00:03:59.180> nine

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
takes out ninety-nine point nine nine

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.569 
takes out ninety-nine point nine nine
nine<00:04:00.079> nine<00:04:00.109> nine<00:04:00.560> nine<00:04:00.799> nine<00:04:01.069> nine<00:04:01.340> nine

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
nine nine nine nine nine nine nine

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.479 
nine nine nine nine nine nine nine
percent<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:03.590> basically<00:04:03.919> takes<00:04:04.310> out

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
percent so it basically takes out

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.939 
percent so it basically takes out
everything<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.299> almost<00:04:05.810> on<00:04:05.989> undetectable

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949 
everything to almost on undetectable

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.420 
everything to almost on undetectable
levels<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:08.139> so<00:04:09.139> that<00:04:09.469> then<00:04:09.769> becomes<00:04:10.129> classed

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
levels and so that then becomes classed

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.119 
levels and so that then becomes classed
