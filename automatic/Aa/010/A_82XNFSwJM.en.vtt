moves all parts like WWE dolls and stuff

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.550 
moves all parts like WWE dolls and stuff
like<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:16.610> I<00:05:16.849> I<00:05:17.240> think<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.080> would<00:05:18.199> one<00:05:18.349> I

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
like that so I I think it would one I

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.999 
like that so I I think it would one I
think<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.789> will<00:05:19.940> set<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.150> new<00:05:20.330> trend<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:21.680> my

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:22.009 
think it will set a new trend and my

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:23.260 
think it will set a new trend and my
logic<00:05:22.340> is<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.639> know<00:05:22.699> we<00:05:22.789> spend<00:05:23.000> out<00:05:23.060> of<00:05:23.090> money

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
logic is you know we spend out of money

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.820 
logic is you know we spend out of money
that's<00:05:23.449> part<00:05:23.630> of<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.780> marketing<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.680> want

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
that's part of the marketing and I want

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.040 
that's part of the marketing and I want
kids<00:05:24.979> to<00:05:25.130> buy<00:05:25.370> it<00:05:25.430> if<00:05:26.210> they<00:05:26.419> don't<00:05:26.449> then<00:05:26.900> I'll

kids to buy it if they don't then I'll

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.589 
kids to buy it if they don't then I'll
play<00:05:27.530> with<00:05:27.620> them<00:05:27.820> but<00:05:28.820> I<00:05:28.880> think<00:05:29.210> it<00:05:29.419> should

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
play with them but I think it should

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:30.969 
play with them but I think it should
work<00:05:29.750> it's<00:05:29.960> important<00:05:30.410> you<00:05:30.590> know<00:05:30.680> and<00:05:30.830> when<00:05:30.949> I
