00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.130
 it was easier to get feathers hard to 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.460
 I'm leaving the ball when the ball is 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.859
 launched striker meets 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.789
 that the team that I need to 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.380
 reach the ball 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.180
 you wind up losing a little because you are 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.609
 jumping you're not just chain to 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.289
 marijuana that part of down the fight 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.820
 in the new center is a bit more 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.150
 little more complicated as it is difficult to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.020
 me 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.969
 sensational was then a leg and does 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.670
 a lot of things here, goalkeeper with no interest 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.430
 Do not play, you do not believe. 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.260
 will leave the house just get the ball in the middle 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.570
 goes to the ground so it is going 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.780
 Ball is awesome aa performance 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.780
 his 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.930
 I have a great friend of mine and 96 final in 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.250
 third, he invited me to 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.320
 rented a house at the end of the year in 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.059
 beach great beach and invited and 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.690
 let's play ball as the general proof of 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.540
 UN 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.010
 Good, we got up and went to other 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.479
 questions like that 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.090
 then he took my own put on the 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.700
 back and went to save google own 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.780
 only that as in sand was good your kayak 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.000
 no male 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.250
 From then on I realized that it 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.090
 play ball one leg only 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.090
 No problem 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.160
 Unfortunately not everyone has the head 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.350
 open only that those people who do 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.700
 jokes about all the people who did 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.350
 jokes at the end of the game were 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.030
 that you understand better than to 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.530
 the person she mocks you 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.530
 only after she was already recognizes 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.270
 wrong understood, that's it, I think we 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.740
 will listen preferring is not a thing 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.649
 Different is not normal to be a guy. 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.750
 jumping on goal with one leg only understood 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.979
 It's not normal, I accept that in a good way. 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.770
 I think it has to have a good head. 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.310
 to filter what goes in is good and 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.310
 bad going out 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.450
 I came to spend the 1986 carnival in SÃ£o 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.340
 Paul went to take a trip to send 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.739
 water for saints on the south coast of moto 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.599
 and a car in the opposite direction and ran over 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.969
 bike that was after one year 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.859
 trying to recover the leg the end after 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:31.040
 of one year coming to the conclusion that 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:32.870
 had cool operations and better solution 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.090
 would amputate put a prosthesis one 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.519
 almost normal life that I do today 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.139
 person 's disability is in the head if 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.849
 put your head down and cry 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.519
 When I lost my leg today I would not have 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.900
 woman I have a son I have one 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.900
