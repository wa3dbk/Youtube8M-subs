Edwards blitz defense and they're

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.189 
Edwards blitz defense and they're
totally<00:00:27.029> different<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.599> honest<00:00:27.840> we're

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
totally different to be honest we're

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.269 
totally different to be honest we're
gonna<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> little<00:00:28.800> look<00:00:29.070> at<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
gonna have a little look at the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.410 
gonna have a little look at the
difference<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> drift<00:00:30.029> offense<00:00:30.269> you're

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
difference the drift offense you're

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.479 
difference the drift offense you're
trying<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> drift<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.199> push<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.920> opposition

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
trying to drift and push the opposition

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280 
trying to drift and push the opposition
out<00:00:32.730> towards<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> touchline<00:00:33.480> bath<00:00:33.870> doing<00:00:34.200> it

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
out towards the touchline bath doing it

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
out towards the touchline bath doing it
here<00:00:34.440> against<00:00:34.920> Leicester<00:00:35.340> actually<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
here against Leicester actually and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.490 
here against Leicester actually and
you'd<00:00:36.300> think<00:00:36.480> actually<00:00:36.660> it'd<00:00:36.870> be<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> little

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
you'd think actually it'd be a little

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.750 
you'd think actually it'd be a little
bit<00:00:37.590> closer<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.950> try<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:38.640> they

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
bit closer to try and do it but they

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.280 
bit closer to try and do it but they
just<00:00:38.969> drift<00:00:39.210> they're<00:00:39.390> all<00:00:39.510> working<00:00:39.930> hard<00:00:39.960> on

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
just drift they're all working hard on

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.229 
just drift they're all working hard on
the<00:00:40.410> inside<00:00:40.520> talking<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.640> each<00:00:41.760> other<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the inside talking to each other and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.810 
the inside talking to each other and
it's<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> lot<00:00:42.780> more<00:00:43.290> passive<00:00:43.980> defense<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
it's a lot more passive defense but you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.209 
it's a lot more passive defense but you
tend<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.210> make<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.539> lot<00:00:45.750> less<00:00:45.960> errors<00:00:46.800> doing<00:00:47.100> it

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
tend to make a lot less errors doing it

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.190 
tend to make a lot less errors doing it
this<00:00:47.340> way<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.239> lose<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.480> bit<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.780> space<00:00:48.960> on

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
this way you can lose a bit of space on

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.139 
this way you can lose a bit of space on
the<00:00:49.320> outside<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.309> tend<00:00:50.579> not<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.760> miss<00:00:51.030> as

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the outside but you tend not to miss as

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.790 
the outside but you tend not to miss as
many<00:00:51.329> tackles<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:51.840> opposed<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:52.530> blade

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
many tackles as opposed to your blade

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.590 
many tackles as opposed to your blade
but<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.460> drift<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.820> all<00:00:53.969> about<00:00:54.210> from<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
but if the drift is all about from the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.450 
but if the drift is all about from the
from<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> inside<00:00:55.289> moving<00:00:55.739> out<00:00:56.010> towards<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
from the inside moving out towards the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.979 
from the inside moving out towards the
touch<00:00:56.640> line<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.180> blitz<00:00:57.420> defense<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
touch line the blitz defense is the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.479 
touch line the blitz defense is the
total<00:00:58.289> opposite<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.739> about<00:00:58.859> getting<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.309> on

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
total opposite it's about getting up on

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.279 
total opposite it's about getting up on
the<00:00:59.670> outside<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.359> try<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.750> force<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the outside and try to force the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.650 
the outside and try to force the
attackers<00:01:01.710> back<00:01:02.100> inside<00:01:02.520> quite<00:01:03.149> high-risk

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
attackers back inside quite high-risk

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.740 
attackers back inside quite high-risk
but<00:01:04.199> hopefully<00:01:04.650> quite<00:01:04.860> high<00:01:05.040> reward<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:06.630> was

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
but hopefully quite high reward it was

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.660 
but hopefully quite high reward it was
just<00:01:06.900> seeing<00:01:07.080> Saracens<00:01:07.650> you've<00:01:07.799> got<00:01:07.890> Hopkins

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
just seeing Saracens you've got Hopkins

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.130 
just seeing Saracens you've got Hopkins
they're<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.390> he's<00:01:09.540> rushing<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:10.020> on

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
they're just up so he's rushing up on

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.440 
they're just up so he's rushing up on
the<00:01:10.229> outside<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.799> forcing<00:01:11.460> Cooke<00:01:11.760> Rob<00:01:12.240> cook

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450

there<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> Gloucester<00:01:13.110> defense<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
there the Gloucester defense on the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.800 
there the Gloucester defense on the
inside<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> about<00:01:15.240> total

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
inside and it really is about total

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
inside and it really is about total
commitment<00:01:16.080> from<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> whole<00:01:16.710> defensive<00:01:17.310> line

commitment from the whole defensive line

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.490 
commitment from the whole defensive line
we<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.119> another<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.540> clip<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.170> where

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
we see another little clip here where

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.899 
we see another little clip here where
they've<00:01:19.619> they're<00:01:20.040> just<00:01:20.220> trying<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> force<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
they've they're just trying to force the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.490 
they've they're just trying to force the
guys<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> inside<00:01:21.390> which<00:01:21.930> means<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.409> you

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
guys on the inside which means that you

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.830 
guys on the inside which means that you
will<00:01:22.650> ultimately<00:01:23.360> it<00:01:24.360> would<00:01:24.479> just<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
will ultimately it would just see the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
will ultimately it would just see the
back<00:01:24.960> end<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.920> forcing<00:01:26.310> them<00:01:26.400> up<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
back end of you just forcing them up and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.000 
okay and if we just quickly wrote the
blitz<00:02:54.329> guys<00:02:54.569> this<00:02:55.079> is<00:02:55.230> more<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:55.560> sprint<00:02:55.859> as

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
blitz guys this is more of a sprint as

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.500 
blitz guys this is more of a sprint as
that<00:02:56.189> tends<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.549> about<00:02:56.730> being<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.180> line

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
that tends it's about being on the line

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.789 
that tends it's about being on the line
so<00:02:57.629> this<00:02:57.780> one<00:02:57.989> of<00:02:58.109> the<00:02:58.169> same<00:02:58.379> rule<00:02:58.590> we're<00:02:58.769> going

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
so this one of the same rule we're going

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.770 
so this one of the same rule we're going
to<00:02:58.950> start<00:02:59.220> with<00:02:59.400> our<00:02:59.430> outside<00:03:00.209> foot<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.659> we're

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
to start with our outside foot so we're

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.599 
to start with our outside foot so we're
slightly<00:03:01.109> turned<00:03:01.379> in<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.799> it<00:03:02.010> literally<00:03:02.370> is

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
slightly turned in and it literally is

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.520 
slightly turned in and it literally is
that<00:03:02.760> energy<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:03.299> emotion<00:03:03.689> of<00:03:03.810> sprinting<00:03:04.349> up

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that energy and emotion of sprinting up

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.289 
that energy and emotion of sprinting up
and<00:03:04.769> cutting<00:03:05.220> off<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.489> outside<00:03:05.639> pasture

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
and cutting off that outside pasture

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.629 
and cutting off that outside pasture
yeah<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:06.750> as<00:03:07.139> you<00:03:07.590> say<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.129> a<00:03:08.159> sprint<00:03:08.519> off

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
yeah so as you say it is a sprint off

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.970 
yeah so as you say it is a sprint off
the<00:03:08.790> line<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.419> JC<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.019> Reggie<00:03:10.200> probably<00:03:10.799> leave

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
the line so JC and Reggie probably leave

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.520 
the line so JC and Reggie probably leave
that<00:03:11.010> leave<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:11.970> as<00:03:12.659> soon<00:03:12.900> as<00:03:13.019> they<00:03:13.169> see<00:03:13.230> that

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530
