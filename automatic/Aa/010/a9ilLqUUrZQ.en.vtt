00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hi guys back with a good 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.890
 brand new video 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 today we are on the times plan again 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.429
 because compared to the last time I am 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.559
 get out of updates and have 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.170
 added a lot of new stuff so 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.820
 let's see what changed then 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.830
 meanwhile in the arcade mode and now 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.920
 we will be able to choose between normal faster 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.560
 reverse before we had only one mode 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.490
 so I would say let's play a game on 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.320
 pasteur 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:35.510
 let's see what we can do 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:35.510
 then let's get started then ok 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.480
 perfect we do absolutely ok 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.309
 fucking damn it 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.620
 okay then see the mode instead 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.460
 different that I haven't tried yet 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.690
 be sincere and as we see is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 on the contrary, a nice mess at the beginning 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:09.119
 until you get used to it ok then a 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.890
 little more and I exceed the record of the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:17.159
 master mode this indeed 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.750
 it's probably easier because no 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.140
 also exceeded of the court of first 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.310
 ok 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.259
 damn it is good then to be 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.549
 the first game on the lapels if it is not there 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.150
 went very badly 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.560
 then let's do the classique we put 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:40.079
 50 let's see what we can do 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.509
 here we must try to put less 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:48.180
 possible time to reach the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:51.070
 finish line 10 seconds 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.600
 let's try again here let's do at least 8 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.600
 or that shot too big 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.810
 ok 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.440
 kat let's try this then again 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.379
 time without clicking on the keys in i 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.739
 white game is called not click on 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:31.959
 white keys where the fuck I click on 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:34.660
 white keys 9,662,691 where there are gods 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.660
 squares that if we click we will lose 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:43.650
 just like this red here it is 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:46.060
 this is just starting even now 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.440
 remains unchanged 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.329
 maybe it just starts to increase 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.610
 speed becomes a mess that cazzola 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:59.319
 come the case okay then let's try 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.560
 the lighting mode where while 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.079
 for example we will play these 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.269
 moments where there are kind of an effect 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.769
 however the whole view is darkened 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.670
 so we must have a memory 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:22.900
 photo to remind us where i am 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:25.989
 perfect cubes to click we are at 150 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:31.209
 precisely now it is not very difficult 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.760
 this mode actually fucking perfect 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.720
 I spoke too soon 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.079
 ok let's try the last mode 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.180
 of the arcade plus that double where some 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.280
 Sometimes it can happen that there are two 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.410
 rates to click simultaneously 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.620
 well try again because we did 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.620
 hell 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.300
 ok 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.790
 perfect ok but I have a pending account 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.990
 however, with the classic mode we put it 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.470
 let's see if we can do a good job 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.470
 score 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:17.040
 940 me I have to beat my record of 8 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.040
 then let's warm our fingers and leave 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.989
 better to do it again 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.960
 by that under that of first ok for 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.460
 very little I succeeded let's see if 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:46.040
 we still manage to improve another 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:47.540
 little no ok guys I would say that for today it is 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.020
 I hope you enjoyed the videos 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.670
 let's see if we reach 700 inches in 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.110
 on leaving also a comment 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.490
 subscribe to the channel if not yet 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.420
 you are registered you will find a lot of 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.130
 other stuff 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.650
 follow me on my facebook page 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.670
 link at the top of the description and us how 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.770
 see you in the next video as usual 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.950
 then we simply have to press 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.620
 this button to try to jump and 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.020
 bring the table not on this side 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.170
 otherwise he would win and we are blue 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.290
 even if this paper is orange and does not go 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.290
 well
