00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
just here with a bit of gameplay from

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.390 
just here with a bit of gameplay from
limbo<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:17.869> this<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.109> got<00:00:19.380> for<00:00:19.859> free<00:00:19.890> and

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
limbo and this I got for free and

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
limbo and this I got for free and
apparently<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:22.039> it's<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.340> cross<00:00:23.910> purchase<00:00:26.420> so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
apparently is a it's a cross purchase so

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.689 
apparently is a it's a cross purchase so
I<00:00:27.990> thought<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.650> had<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> bide<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
I thought you had to bide you like the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.910 
I thought you had to bide you like the
other<00:00:29.820> version<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.599> ps3<00:00:31.410> version<00:00:31.830> or

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
other version so ps3 version or

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.760 
other version so ps3 version or
something<00:00:32.279> by<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> min<00:00:32.669> got<00:00:32.850> ps3<00:00:33.380> and<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:34.739> I

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
something by a min got ps3 and so then I

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.040 
something by a min got ps3 and so then I
thought<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.390> through<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> PlayStation

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
thought it was through the PlayStation

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.709 
thought it was through the PlayStation
Plus<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> when<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.210> Ross<00:00:39.360> purchase<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
Plus so I when I think Ross purchase I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.830 
Plus so I when I think Ross purchase I
mean<00:00:39.899> crossed<00:00:40.469> by<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.510> I'm<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> bit

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
mean crossed by and so I'm a bit

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.420 
mean crossed by and so I'm a bit
confused<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.680> why<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> got<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> free

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.940 
confused as to why I got it free
basically<00:00:44.940> that's<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.300> I'm<00:00:45.420> saying<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.829> am

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.950 
game I've never played it before I've
seen<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.829> bit<00:00:58.980> online<00:00:59.750> courses<00:01:00.750> got

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
seen a little bit online courses got

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.640 
seen a little bit online courses got
highly<00:01:01.350> stylized<00:01:01.890> graphics<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.409> sound<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
highly stylized graphics and sound and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.980 
highly stylized graphics and sound and
it<00:01:04.769> looks<00:01:05.100> obviously<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:06.299> rather<00:01:06.659> cool

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
it looks obviously really rather cool

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.770 
it looks obviously really rather cool
but<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> don't<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.220> anything<00:01:08.369> about<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
but I don't know anything about it

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.980 
but I don't know anything about it
really<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:13.490> here<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.760> go<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.630> quite<00:01:15.960> a

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
really so here we go is it is quite a

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.380 
really so here we go is it is quite a
dark<00:01:16.320> game<00:01:16.590> anyway<00:01:17.460> um<00:01:18.409> as<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.759> its<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.119> think

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
dark game anyway um as in its I think

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.410 
dark game anyway um as in its I think
it's<00:01:21.540> quite<00:01:21.659> darking<00:01:22.590> sort<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> design<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it's quite darking sort of design and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.200 
it's quite darking sort of design and
gameplay<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.890> also<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.750> me

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
gameplay but I think it's also so me

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.480 
gameplay but I think it's also so me
quite<00:01:30.210> um<00:01:30.560> difficult<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.369> is

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
quite um difficult to see this that is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.350 
quite um difficult to see this that is
me<00:01:32.930> hopefully<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.170> see<00:01:34.409> me

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.080 

it<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.500> really<00:01:39.800> really<00:01:40.070> dark<00:01:40.370> isn't<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.790> I
