00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.590
 for the professional laying of a floor, the surface must be dry and dry 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.629
 clean or the floor covering is ready 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.939
 first, sound-insulating subfloor must be laid, which is the best 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.939
 surface for floors with the master located plus system 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.019
 with weigher you can easily set the minimum distance of 10 for a floating floor 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.019
 millimeter from the floors 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.080
 start in the left corner 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.680
 make sure that the first row of shelves is placed parallel to the wall 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.690
 Remove from all boards that are in the first line only the fourth 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.200
 on the long side 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.880
 qlixz the second board on the front side of the first board 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.690
 as with the last sounds of the first row at least 10 millimeters away from 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.570
 the wall 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.480
 with the 200-hour collection, the first sounds of the second row in post 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.750
 80 centimeters 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.010
 then click this as flat as possible the group of the previous fights went on 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.010
 langedijk and drugs the plank slowly down 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.570
 the next whole board is again in its entirety with the long side in the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.040
 previous stringing shoved before someone sinks, we must first touch the board 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 push the front end closest to the previous one 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.710
 in this way you lay the entire floor 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.390
 the minimum offset of the head after the import of 40 centimeters in this area 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.530
 amounts 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.740
 to lay the last row, use the remainder of the piece to make the required plank 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.360
 know to be able to indicate that the minimum distance is taken into account 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660
 of 10 millimeters from the wall 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.490
 on the dance floor can work reproach just the 4 of the rest piece 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.730
 for the joint floor parts, the plastic springs must be on the front side 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.099
 fix wall side so the head piece is locked 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.870
 it is best to use a track iron or screwdriver for this 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:23.119
 you can of course also place the masters light points them upside down 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.399
 got the group of friends for this 4 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.919
 so it is possible to move from left to right 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.459
 or I work in the opposite direction 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.699
 by reversing you can click your thomas plus system in each 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.699
 lay the desired space 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.129
 you can also easily connect a board to the previous board using 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 The surface of the special assembly is thus prevented from meister 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.439
 screwing in the shelves is a lot easier 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.629
 now only missing on the points 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.639
 with the help of the patented plant clips, the plant sinks easily 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.589
 confirm 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.589
 handy borssele rewards are included 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.719
 you can draw the plant and then simply draw on the designated plinth clubs
