00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
was like 14 16 I think and I mean the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.450 
was like 14 16 I think and I mean the
maps<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.470> were<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:34.800> close<00:00:35.039> could<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
maps that were really close could it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.779 
maps that were really close could it
have<00:00:35.670> gone<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.570> other<00:00:36.690> way<00:00:36.899> around

00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:37.789 
have gone like the other way around

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:42.560 
have gone like the other way around
easily<00:00:38.789> and<00:00:39.410> I<00:00:40.410> mean<00:00:40.969> we<00:00:41.969> did<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> few<00:00:42.359> bad

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
easily and I mean we did a few bad

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.810 
easily and I mean we did a few bad
rounds<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.710> bed<00:00:43.890> some<00:00:44.250> bad<00:00:44.399> situate

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
rounds in a bed some bad situate

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.169 
rounds in a bed some bad situate
situations<00:00:45.480> but<00:00:46.309> 311<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.550> still<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> good

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
situations but 311 is still a good

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:51.410 
situations but 311 is still a good
result<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:49.190> so<00:00:50.190> had<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.579> situation<00:00:51.269> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
result I think so had the situation to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660 
result I think so had the situation to
go<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.600> your<00:00:51.870> way<00:00:52.019> you<00:00:52.079> could<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.010> winning

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
go on your way you could see you winning

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.650 
go on your way you could see you winning
tuscan<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.359> you<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:57.120> didn't<00:00:57.510> think

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
tuscan and you and I didn't think

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.169 
tuscan and you and I didn't think
honestly<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.410> we're<00:00:58.949> gonna<00:00:59.129> win<00:00:59.339> tuscan

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
honestly that we're gonna win tuscan

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.140 
honestly that we're gonna win tuscan
because<00:01:01.280> we<00:01:02.280> haven't<00:01:02.519> cracked<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.999> at<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:04.070> but

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
because we haven't cracked it at all but

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
because we haven't cracked it at all but
he<00:01:06.150> went<00:01:06.360> our<00:01:06.510> way<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.960> played<00:01:07.200> some<00:01:07.229> randomly

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
he went our way we played some randomly

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.920 
he went our way we played some randomly
and<00:01:08.270> people<00:01:09.270> played<00:01:09.450> good<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:11.689> then<00:01:12.689> we

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and people played good so and then we

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.450 
and people played good so and then we
just<00:01:13.110> took<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.770> by<00:01:14.009> map<00:01:14.340> by<00:01:14.579> map<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:16.460> finally

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
just took it by map by map and finally

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.710 
just took it by map by map and finally
it<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:18.030> away<00:01:19.040> last<00:01:20.040> time<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.399> face<00:01:20.610> values<00:01:21.180> at

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
it got away last time you face values at

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.310 
it got away last time you face values at
Extreme<00:01:22.710> Masters<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.340> finals<00:01:23.729> where<00:01:24.210> 91<00:01:25.140> to

match<00:01:25.500> winning<00:01:25.890> 16<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.430> six<00:01:26.820> twice<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:28.259> has

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
match winning 16 to six twice what has

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.710 
match winning 16 to six twice what has
changed<00:01:28.470> since<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.369> mean<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.509> only

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
changed since then I mean it's it's only

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.219 
changed since then I mean it's it's only
been<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.500> month<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.509> think<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
been like a month or so I think the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
been like a month or so I think the
biggest<00:01:34.439> change<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.310> time<00:01:35.579> was<00:01:35.969> that<00:01:36.299> we

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
biggest change this time was that we

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.300 
biggest change this time was that we
went<00:01:36.780> into<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.259> match<00:01:37.469> with<00:01:37.740> much<00:01:38.070> bigger

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
went into the match with much bigger

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.990 
went into the match with much bigger
confidence<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.299> much<00:01:40.229> bigger<00:01:41.000> communication

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
confidence and much bigger communication

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.620 
confidence and much bigger communication
in<00:01:42.149> game<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.729> we<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:45.030> talked<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.479> lot

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
in game and we really talked a lot

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.929 
in game and we really talked a lot
during<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.680> whole<00:01:46.860> match<00:01:47.070> will<00:01:47.610> each<00:01:47.729> other

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
during the whole match will each other

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.649 
during the whole match will each other
with<00:01:48.329> each<00:01:48.539> other<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:50.000> like<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.180> didn't<00:01:51.450> lose

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
with each other with like we didn't lose

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.219 
with each other with like we didn't lose
any<00:01:51.930> silly<00:01:52.350> rounds<00:01:52.829> any<00:01:53.369> three<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.240> two<00:01:54.450> five

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
any silly rounds any three and two five

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.260 
any silly rounds any three and two five
and<00:01:55.259> four<00:01:55.649> situations<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.490> stuff

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
and four situations and stuff

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.160 
and four situations and stuff
so<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.380> think<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.770> did<00:01:58.859> it<00:01:58.950> good<00:02:00.049> after<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
so I think we did it good after the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.950 
so I think we did it good after the
match<00:02:01.200> series<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.310> community<00:02:02.789> would<00:02:02.939> GOx<00:02:03.659> as

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960

match series the community would GOx as
man<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> match<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.719> we'll<00:02:06.719> see<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> key

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
man of the match and we'll see the key

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
team today beating finale I think like

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.470 
team today beating finale I think like
actually<00:02:14.459> every<00:02:15.390> player<00:02:15.629> had<00:02:15.930> his<00:02:16.379> own<00:02:16.620> map

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
actually every player had his own map

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.380 
actually every player had his own map

and Sasuke Nashville I'm a plate really
early<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:50.970> measures<00:02:51.420> could<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.260> explain<00:02:52.410> a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
early in measures could you explain a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.339 
early in measures could you explain a
bit<00:02:52.709> why<00:02:53.299> why<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.510> happened<00:02:54.840> why<00:02:55.140> do<00:02:55.200> you

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
bit why why that happened why do you

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:02.330 
bit why why that happened why do you
want<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.530> play<00:02:55.709> trainer<00:02:56.010> saladna<00:03:00.350> yeah<00:03:01.350> yeah

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
want to play trainer saladna yeah yeah

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.240 
want to play trainer saladna yeah yeah
yeah<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.680> think<00:03:04.680> yeah<00:03:06.350> I'm<00:03:07.350> not<00:03:07.560> sure<00:03:07.739> but<00:03:07.980> I

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
yeah I think yeah I'm not sure but I

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.580 
yeah I think yeah I'm not sure but I
think<00:03:08.340> Rowan<00:03:08.790> picked<00:03:08.970> its<00:03:09.180> system<00:03:10.019> first<00:03:10.200> just

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
think Rowan picked its system first just

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.599 
think Rowan picked its system first just
because<00:03:10.639> he<00:03:11.639> wanted<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.060> show<00:03:12.630> Marik<00:03:13.609> because

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
because he wanted to show Marik because

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.050 
because he wanted to show Marik because
I<00:03:14.760> think<00:03:15.000> natick<00:03:15.389> didn't<00:03:16.819> they<00:03:17.819> weren't

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
I think natick didn't they weren't

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.789 
I think natick didn't they weren't
thinking<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.600> we're<00:03:18.750> going<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.900> choose<00:03:19.139> that

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
thinking that we're going to choose that

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.670 
thinking that we're going to choose that
map<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> first<00:03:20.519> map<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:21.600> just<00:03:22.049> to<00:03:22.530> do

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
map as the first map so just to do

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.309 
map as the first map so just to do
something<00:03:22.920> randomly<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.790> guess<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.319> much

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
something randomly I guess and much

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.830 
something randomly I guess and much
seems<00:03:25.889> like<00:03:26.099> now<00:03:26.400> will<00:03:26.730> be<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.329> team<00:03:27.569> to<00:03:27.599> win

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
seems like now will be the team to win

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.020 
seems like now will be the team to win
that<00:03:27.989> at<00:03:28.200> least<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.709> lot<00:03:28.889> has<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.280> changed<00:03:29.819> more

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
that at least a lot has to changed more

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.090 
that at least a lot has to changed more
yeah<00:03:30.359> to<00:03:30.959> be<00:03:31.079> another<00:03:31.290> team

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
yeah to be another team

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.430 
yeah to be another team
and<00:03:32.510> what<00:03:33.510> do<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.630> think<00:03:33.810> about<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.020> Navi

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
team I mean it's still a pretty new team

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.610 
team I mean it's still a pretty new team
what<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.340> your<00:03:38.460> comment<00:03:38.670> about<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:38.970> team<00:03:39.300> I

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
what is your comment about this team I

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.290 
what is your comment about this team I
mean<00:03:40.620> we<00:03:41.010> have<00:03:41.130> seen<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.490> players<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.120> long

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
mean we have seen the players for a long

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.220 
mean we have seen the players for a long
time<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.750> different<00:03:43.020> teams<00:03:43.230> but<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.840> time<00:03:46.050> I

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
time in different teams but this time I

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.980 
time in different teams but this time I
think<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.770> they<00:03:47.160> have<00:03:47.420> made<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.450> team<00:03:48.780> which

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
think that they have made a team which

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
think that they have made a team which
gonna<00:03:49.590> lash<00:03:49.860> for<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> while<00:03:50.960> they<00:03:51.960> played<00:03:52.230> the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
gonna lash for a while they played the

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.310 
gonna lash for a while they played the
last<00:03:53.300> like<00:03:54.300> this<00:03:54.510> tournament<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.140> last

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
last like this tournament and the last

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.380 
last like this tournament and the last
one<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.680> in<00:03:55.980> Germany<00:03:56.520> they<00:03:56.880> are<00:03:56.970> played<00:03:57.180> really

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
one in in Germany they are played really

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.860 
one in in Germany they are played really
good<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.810> they<00:03:58.650> have<00:03:58.800> beaten<00:03:59.790> like<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.540> best

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
good and they have beaten like the best

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.630 
good and they have beaten like the best
team<00:04:01.110> in<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.350> world<00:04:01.380> also<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.960> I<00:04:04.160> think<00:04:05.160> if

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
team in the world also and I think if

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.720 
team in the world also and I think if
they<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:06.750> like<00:04:07.140> staying<00:04:07.980> as<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.220> team<00:04:08.520> I<00:04:08.550> think

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
they just like staying as a team I think

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.450 
they just like staying as a team I think
they<00:04:09.030> can<00:04:09.350> become<00:04:10.350> one<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:10.830> one<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.250> the

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
they can become one of the one of the

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.390 
they can become one of the one of the
best<00:04:11.640> teams<00:04:11.850> in<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.090> world<00:04:12.410> actually<00:04:13.410> yeah<00:04:13.620> so

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
best teams in the world actually yeah so

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.770 
best teams in the world actually yeah so
what<00:04:14.520> do<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:14.670> think<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.090> venue<00:04:15.390> here<00:04:15.570> it's

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
it's always fun to try something new but

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.410 
it's always fun to try something new but
I<00:04:24.570> mean<00:04:25.560> it's<00:04:25.920> really<00:04:26.250> hard<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.730> keep<00:04:26.880> focusing

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
I mean it's really hard to keep focusing

I mean it's really hard to keep focusing
for<00:04:27.600> farm<00:04:27.810> apt<00:04:27.990> in<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.170> row<00:04:29.720> it<00:04:30.720> would<00:04:30.930> be<00:04:31.080> be

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
for farm apt in a row it would be be

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.300 
for farm apt in a row it would be be
good<00:04:31.770> too<00:04:32.840> sometimes<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.140> it<00:04:34.470> feels<00:04:34.740> like<00:04:34.950> you

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
need some kind of a break but I mean

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.420

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
think at least from from our point of

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.650 
think at least from from our point of
view<00:05:36.870> I<00:05:37.260> think<00:05:37.320> we're<00:05:37.800> going<00:05:37.920> to<00:05:38.040> go<00:05:38.360> in<00:05:39.360> with<00:05:39.420> a

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
view I think we're going to go in with a

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.070 
view I think we're going to go in with a
lot<00:05:39.930> of<00:05:39.960> confidence<00:05:40.669> and<00:05:41.669> try<00:05:42.120> to<00:05:42.180> pick<00:05:42.660> up

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
lot of confidence and try to pick up

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.940 
lot of confidence and try to pick up
every<00:05:44.010> map<00:05:44.660> to<00:05:45.660> secure<00:05:46.020> at<00:05:46.229> least<00:05:46.470> a<00:05:46.620> second

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
every map to secure at least a second

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.820 
every map to secure at least a second
place<00:05:47.130> and<00:05:47.400> if<00:05:48.390> we<00:05:48.540> play<00:05:48.780> as<00:05:49.110> good<00:05:49.380> as<00:05:49.530> we<00:05:49.680> did

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
place and if we play as good as we did

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.290 
place and if we play as good as we did
today<00:05:49.979> I<00:05:50.100> think<00:05:50.400> we<00:05:50.520> have<00:05:50.550> at<00:05:50.880> least<00:05:51.000> a<00:05:51.150> good

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
today I think we have at least a good

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.190 
today I think we have at least a good
chance<00:05:52.370> and<00:05:53.370> then<00:05:53.970> for<00:05:54.630> that<00:05:54.750> for<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:54.990> first

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200
