00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
interface built for a phone so on top we

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.370 
interface built for a phone so on top we
have<00:02:22.070> two<00:02:22.460> buttons<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:23.030> home<00:02:23.270> button<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.840> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
menu button and those kind of serve as

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.300 
menu button and those kind of serve as
the<00:02:26.030> back<00:02:26.270> or<00:02:26.570> taking<00:02:26.960> you<00:02:27.020> to<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.320> menu<00:02:27.680> there

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
the back or taking you to the menu there

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.610 
the back or taking you to the menu there
are<00:02:28.340> no<00:02:28.760> external<00:02:29.180> volume<00:02:29.780> controls<00:02:30.260> which<00:02:30.470> I

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
are no external volume controls which I

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.250 
are no external volume controls which I
was<00:02:30.710> a<00:02:30.740> little<00:02:31.220> bit<00:02:31.370> disappointed<00:02:32.060> in<00:02:32.260> but

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
was a little bit disappointed in but

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.200 
was a little bit disappointed in but
that's<00:02:33.470> okay<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.460> those<00:02:34.640> are<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.910> only

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
that's okay so those are the only

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.880 
that's okay so those are the only
external<00:02:35.720> buttons<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.200> think<00:02:36.410> Kobe<00:02:36.620> did

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
external buttons and I think Kobe did

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.370 
external buttons and I think Kobe did
that<00:02:37.130> for<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.460> sake<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:38.140> streamlining<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
that for the sake of streamlining the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.160 
that for the sake of streamlining the
device<00:02:39.850> tons<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:41.150> ports<00:02:41.450> on<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.660> bottom<00:02:41.780> here

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
device tons of ports on the bottom here

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.380 
device tons of ports on the bottom here
which<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.440> love<00:02:42.710> to<00:02:42.740> see<00:02:43.130> we<00:02:43.280> have<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.520> USB<00:02:43.820> port

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
which I love to see we have the USB port

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.160 
which I love to see we have the USB port

sturdy it's not cheap and other than the

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.870 
sturdy it's not cheap and other than the
resolution<00:07:14.230> being<00:07:14.830> a<00:07:14.920> little<00:07:15.310> bit<00:07:15.430> stretched
