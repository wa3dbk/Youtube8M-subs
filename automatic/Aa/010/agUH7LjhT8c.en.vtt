 4 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.730
 maybe her tears were running 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.730
 January 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.110
 Meanwhile, beating the waves would hit the Wadden Sea is who's here 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:35.109
 all one thing the city stopped 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.860
 there is mine but under pressure under pressure something but no one needs 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 need 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.490
 Kretschmer finally 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.490
 there she is 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.760
 Piel, too, what are you doing there, but not all 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.540
 Euro moves 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.700
 that is our proposal has been standing for years in a field the day low 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.890
 Herten 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.250
 the referee strong 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.280
 I do that only because I'm always on the first day after the third new moon 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.090
 in the fourth century v I think that has tradition, so to speak 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.340
 and this one 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.400
 Farfus it was strangely saved on emergency you have a goal Gaal the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.620
 Can opener is the fishhook, so to speak 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.360
 Kate now also a completely invented story from the stables there very much 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.560
 because it does not depend that these days Alzheimer Wollitz needed 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 Roth wants to travel for years No 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.759
 we will pause in the port of small red cards card for the big one 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.970
 crossing over the best years of work 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.950
 suddenly Manner tied the side wall to Esser 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.470
 the land the plague on the harbor wall 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.550
 and asked if she could come along 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.840
 I was just born and then Heine just said 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.970
 with empty there with 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.610
 a short time later we clicked wait 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.530
 Opi 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.810
 There is a disease that does not work on the ship's side 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.299
 that's true 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.409
 sometimes she comes on the boat without knocking 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.279
 but that does not exist anymore 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:18.769
 We had been at sea for two days when the wind suddenly stopped 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:22.999
 were different 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.069
 and because you can not do anything for the first time 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.569
 I was clear because the doldrums last longer 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.870
 the UN had not made easy and the yield before the start 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.859
 to notice the provisions 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.029
 wh 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:43.469
 the car rental company Handelsblatt the weeks without months too 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:46.309
 only the slightest with a lot of rain 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.089
 we already have player's life hanging on the masts 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.479
 and what about the ps2 and Wii 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.599
 if she has the start, then it is not 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.689
 the door is to be expected 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.689
 and for those without 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.039
 Percent and there are strict I difficult 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.779
 So we were not far away from Madagascar and had the best answer 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:08.779
 a true location factor he is 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.439
 No, some discounters do not harm us because she was sick 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.309
 and him all the time over the railing 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:17.320
 that's how it was 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.529
 and who have come away since their return 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:20.629
 and anyway 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.849
 that is currently the persistent one 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.849
 Oh right! 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.029
 "After six months races can finally start again 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:32.389
 we were overjoyed the expectations they set it was 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.309
 enjoyment 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:37.500
 I return to intensive thinking and of course 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.500
 I had a rose after a short time 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:45.050
 I just sharpened a preemie on a fishing rod 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.129
 and acted as a third party 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.110
 Otti included are endless we talk 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.080
 the branch is a swarm of cans floating past our ship 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.649
 big bit crazy but all so 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:01.629
 I would have a couple with the devil and put it in Serbia and in 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.609
 Flasks fly and roll 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.090
 Chirac repeat this year and that was exactly the first day at the 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:14.709
 Brits nine moon in the fourth year that's probably just not all sorts 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.409
 Problem therefore become stick 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:21.909
 there's a picture of me just like a pair of pants over three meters long 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:22.980
 acted 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.980
 for the depth and Corey Perry told ver di 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.449
 a small defeat in the Easter 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.449
 the time of revealing 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.199
 he was a guest 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.270
 kassel 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.270
 had on the 11th
