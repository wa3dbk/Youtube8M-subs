happening<00:01:37.000> in<00:01:37.119> front<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.479> you

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.380 

throughout<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.310> game<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.640> actually<00:01:43.910> upgrades

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
throughout the game it actually upgrades

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.330

as<00:01:44.570> Tanner<00:01:44.810> becomes<00:01:45.350> stronger<00:01:45.680> first<00:01:46.190> thing

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
as Tanner becomes stronger first thing

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.430 
as Tanner becomes stronger first thing
is<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:47.330> shift<00:01:47.570> itself<00:01:47.960> becomes<00:01:48.290> more

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
is that the shift itself becomes more

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.220 
is that the shift itself becomes more
powerful<00:01:48.650> so<00:01:49.100> we<00:01:49.580> can<00:01:49.730> pull<00:01:50.000> further<00:01:50.630> up<00:01:51.020> and

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
powerful so we can pull further up and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.410 
powerful so we can pull further up and
see<00:01:51.770> more<00:01:52.010> of<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.250> city<00:01:52.280> more<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.060> car

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
see more of the city more of a car

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.679 
see more of the city more of a car
that<00:01:55.259> changes<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.189> kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.430> mission<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:57.420> can

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that changes the kind of mission we can

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.210 
that changes the kind of mission we can
do<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.080> shift<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.009> create

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
do with shift so we can create

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.010 
do with shift so we can create

in progress near City Hall you need to

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.330 
in progress near City Hall you need to
catch<00:02:15.360> him<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.319> would<00:02:16.470> use<00:02:16.650> shift<00:02:17.069> either

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
catch him so you would use shift either

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.160 
catch him so you would use shift either
to<00:02:17.700> take<00:02:17.850> another<00:02:18.060> car<00:02:18.330> which<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.510> faster<00:02:18.930> to

target car then is completely designed
around<00:02:27.000> shift<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:27.780> not<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:28.019> a<00:02:28.050> cheat

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
around shift so it's not like a cheat

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.020 
around shift so it's not like a cheat
it's<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.160> unlimited<00:02:29.850> ability

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
it's not like it's a unlimited ability

it's not like it's a unlimited ability
it's<00:02:30.360> actually<00:02:31.190> integral<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> gameplay

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
it's actually integral to the gameplay

it's actually integral to the gameplay
one<00:02:34.769> of<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.950> first<00:02:35.100> upgrades<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.330> we

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
one of the first upgrades that that we

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.360 
one of the first upgrades that that we
have<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.630> orbital<00:02:36.959> rapid<00:02:37.290> shift<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.160> if<00:02:38.250> you're

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
have is orbital rapid shift so if you're

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.580 
have is orbital rapid shift so if you're
two<00:02:38.940> cops<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.780> cop<00:02:39.959> shows<00:02:40.140> trying<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.470> take

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
two cops and a cop shows trying to take

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.320 
two cops and a cop shows trying to take
down<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.799> getaway<00:02:41.220> car<00:02:41.250> one<00:02:41.880> push<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.299> button

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
down a getaway car one push of a button

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.509 
down a getaway car one push of a button
and<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:42.750> rapidly<00:02:43.440> shift<00:02:43.920> between<00:02:44.130> those

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
and you can rapidly shift between those

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.150 
and you can rapidly shift between those
two<00:02:44.670> cop<00:02:44.940> cars<00:02:45.150> we<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:46.049> boost<00:02:46.319> which<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.040> like

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
two cop cars we have boost which is like

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.580 
two cop cars we have boost which is like

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
ability is like a puppy you can just

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.740 
ability is like a puppy you can just
swap<00:02:52.620> cars<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.459> just<00:02:53.670> always<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.390> at<00:02:54.600> the
