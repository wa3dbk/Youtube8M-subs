00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.700
 and hello here today is a 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.599
 new inspection 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.340
 this time it's a camaro 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:15.480
 chevrolet camaro years seventy six 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.550
 rs models equipped with a manual gearbox 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.330
 4 speeds and a v8 engine of 350 that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.670
 bic lynch the engine is not original 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:30.269
 it's actually the engine coming from a 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.219
 72 year corvette so that produces 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.960
 more power play than horses 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.870
 than the original engine beyond 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.879
 the camaro in 76 so that's 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.860
 really a very first take of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.010
 contact I come from I discover the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.010
 car 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.339
 so first first first 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.100
 impressions one can rather positive 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.309
 the interior being is in good condition is in 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.000
 very good condition even hard and complete game the 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:03.229
 console has been replaced by with a 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.930
 Original original type console 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:10.460
 face and the car but they have 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:15.710
 correct correct electric windows 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.960
 work and so that's so we have a 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.560
 manual 4 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.550
 and well it's gone we'll we'll see what 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.679
 what does it give 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.220
 so here I am the class ja I did not 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:27.220
 not started yet 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.500
 on the studs 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.690
 finally here is his name in neutral 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.470
 we're going to start in Beijing already bonneu 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.470
 good thing to start 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.750
 we make it the first of the speeds 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.370
 seems to pass correctly 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.470
 here we are a 2nd 3rd 4th and we have 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.600
 reverse 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:08.350
 here you are, then, dead in peace on 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.970
 the cold level small glance on 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.370
 the counters fast and so we see the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.520
 gasoline charge is not that seems 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.459
 operate the volt meter is at the cleat 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.680
 at 18 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:24.379
 we have an outline 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.409
 works a trip to the temperatures 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:30.469
 who is who has not yet taken off and 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.359
 a watch here we'll see so it's 10 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.220
 2 hours we will see if the third 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:38.090
 operate the car radio 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.090
 this Tuesday six pioneers 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:08.950
 so here you have it with facade 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.140
 detachable honduras later on 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.590
 Let's go 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.680
 go on we start the first one and we go 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.680
 go 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.140
 pleasant power steering the clutch 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.440
 worked very well 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.020
 the car does not flinch 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.420
 bassil started easy to drive that's it 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.920
 well that in a second we are really going how much 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.959
 very positive impression 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.920
 when it takes a sure voice I'm going 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.920
 discover five minutes 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.970
 in the box is very nice to have 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.050
 fight is going well we see a little 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.690
 little housekeeping a little now 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.690
 so here's pk 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.110
 finally a disc in the front 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.300
 e 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.360
 I have not seen the peel take off yet 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.860
 said sort of so it's possible that the 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.050
 watch does not work 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.680
 see then that the temperature the 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.209
 water temperature here 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.269
 it's still a bit early for the 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.269
 know 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.080
 the blue light so that show that we 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.280
 is on go now summer is ok 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.280
 the whole island on board 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.280
 e 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.920
 anxious 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.140
 Through birds worldwide sales and 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.720
 so here's the lights work 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.400
 keeps leaving the south one to that 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.740
 works in 1/8 is fast and a 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.520
 slow speed here it works 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.940
 the caps 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.940
 here we are 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.780
 here we go 1st web to this camaro the mist 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.190
 worth any unpleasant direction 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.880
 more than 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.880
 and go into the bush 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.360
 she is easy to drive she looks 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.360
 very healthy 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.680
 now it's good to accelerate well 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.120
 london I have trouble driving the bright 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.800
 food or in the left hand 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:29.770
 the direction it is accurate to pkp and 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.010
 sweet or so so we have a direction 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.560
 assisted and lack of total play ensures 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.460
 the management not remarkable 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.720
 I would have on the box again 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:43.000
 mutations easy to spend pleasant 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:48.180
 and these two windows see the window 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.790
 Passenger side drops good cap driver 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.270
 here it goes on my appetite without 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.270
 hesitation 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.970
 So here I see here the referral 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.230
 the forgiveness gauge water temperature 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.540
 who just took off the tooth she 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.650
 works by cons confirmation is 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.650
 there there 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.380
 it's nice eh it's nice how 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.860
 friendly 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:41.710
 we already feel that it is the car 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.060
 relatively modern compared to everything 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.280
 this all I'm used to 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.640
 drive what we see is not the 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:52.170
 same technology 

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:54.610
 here we go, we'll stop there so we do not 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.700
 take a little tour to see a little 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.040
 little in detail all that under it and 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.110
 then here we are, we have a test 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.630
 conduct which is which is very positive 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.510
 the pleasant ones 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:09.700
 here I discovered 75 euros 76 and wood 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:13.240
 of cat ba it's nice nice picture of 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:16.660
 he has seven board are colored one 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.900
 do not know how much fishing goes the meters 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.640
 black stand out well it's the grass 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.770
 here again it was so a 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.610
 try a presentation a take 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:30.340
