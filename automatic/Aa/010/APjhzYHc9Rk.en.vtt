00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.169
 I am in asturias in the town 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.389
 a locality near posada de llanes 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:11.990
 where are we going to proceed to install a 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.240
 robot during this month of July of the year 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.410
 2012 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.390
 Well the first thing we did was to locate 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.430
 the robot in the most ideal place of the 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.189
 farm for it today we decided 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.169
 place it in this place that we see here 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.320
 which is quite open aired and 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.730
 exposed to nature and that we place 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.970
 on the boat at one end of 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.950
 the farm 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.560
 in this video what I want to show you is 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.900
 how is the previous work to place the 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.450
 robot 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.110
 Here we see that what has been done is a 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.370
 shit has the roof of the robot covered 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.930
 and what we've always talked about has been left 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.330
 of a space in front of the robot 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.160
 approximately four meters and 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.640
 half five meters for the cows 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.640
 can circulate 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.570
 if we see the cows 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.470
 let's see how the work of the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.500
 robot corresponding to an astronaut to 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.770
 four let's take the pit 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.649
 with the fall a fall 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.380
 in this case to channel the water the 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.400
 cow's stool 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.960
 and there we see some pipes 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.119
 for 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.719
 different reasons is to say the data 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.719
 etc 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.640
 this is where it is located let's see the 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.030
 back of the robot 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.410
 let's say where I have my hand here is 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.250
 where the cow's feeder will be 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.700
 the cow will be looking towards this 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.900
 place to go where that is 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.090
 cow the cornada 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.280
 of the wolf will always be directed 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.000
 towards the cow tim should be looking at 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.450
 comedy and as we see 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.050
 the work is very well very correct here 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.840
 we see 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.690
 a sink to collect water from the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.000
 brushes and proceed when washing 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.620
 all this clean area that corresponds to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.260
 the technical zone may have fall and for 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.490
 otherwise we see that the robot 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.620
 cows are going to have a good 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:26.370
 shadow ventilation a suitable area that is 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.370
 what is intended 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.860
 later or still showing how it is 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.300
 the evolution of robot placement 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.470
 and the adaptation of the cows 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.470
 the milking robot
