00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.920
 official website of the project advanced 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.920
 experience that in june usual 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.700
 Hello everyone, on the air 4 roar of the project 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.150
 additions from the ceiling will be 1 6 of 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.200
 the past helpers already know that today we 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.030
 let's talk about banners and screeds 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.520
 on the inferno card in the defense game 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.250
 in each group it is important about or only 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250
 beginner say certain 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.620
 you point on the cards 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.600
 whose position can perfectly take 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.870
 call in which he can fold 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.090
 to get your Timati out of business 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.310
 a couple of minuses 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.620
 water deposits need to be reached and how will you 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.640
 drag christianization 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.210
 most importantly what time will you do it 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.580
 this is the most important whether you can both 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.050
 you can move less in the frame 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.960
 and at the same time 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.830
 play productively today we will analyze 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.610
 several examples of power system and 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.180
 see how you can move around and 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.170
 to be pinched 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.250
 in the cave of the map we will see how cute 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.720
 should look like a team round 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.210
 which will be as clear as possible 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.670
 share your actions and take 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.040
 right decisions well let's 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040
 move on to the main analysis 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.670
 initially we divide the planets on 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.300
 equal parts to see which 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.470
 rudiments who should block it there 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.520
 three parts are highlighted and plans for the first two 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.840
 example we are considering if in 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.300
 the middle of the round of your order is 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.610
 kills at points b often after such 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.750
 cons game which considers the point a 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.760
 immediately to the point would be with words 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.320
 boys, I gave 5 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.670
 if the players at point a remain in such 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.710
 position as you see now alone in 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.030
 carpets second on egypt trying 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.400
 follow 5 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.430
 it will already make a mistake so 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.540
 as a case of an attack on a point and you 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.779
 will have to play for yourself 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.349
 exit 5 plus seven players attack 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.069
 put a fat point in this round 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.129
 hopes to shoot in this case as 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.479
 option but can not be taken into account 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.249
 only shooting in the game 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.769
 you have in this case with option 2 first you 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.839
 give the first part of the land and focus 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:27.939
 on the second third we look how it goes 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.009
 tie back on the main positions on 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.909
 planet auth this constriction will help you 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.899
 drink 5 and then with your theme 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.039
 this one don't beat out the plan believe me even 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.339
 if the attack installs the flank you will be easier 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.379
 will come the point all along took your 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.529
 the subject will do it his and in 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.989
 the best case is not easy to force 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.749
 ivasik and the second option is if you 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.559
 give full second third part 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.309
 planets and focus on the first that is 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:50.209
 on carpets 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.790
 if we already do that then you 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.120
 must be on carpets 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.839
 and as you already admit I am so one of the outputs 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.989
 secondly police officer general dahi 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.049
 very difficult and the risk of giving away the round is very 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.819
 is great 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.520
 now go to the battlefield 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.600
 players on the background of the central bank should also be very 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.380
 gently acting on the planet would play 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.180
 in relation to the bar and can not 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.960
 let's see how to act 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.749
 protection at this point 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:14.949
 initially the location of the players 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.119
 may be different thanks may 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.869
 collect inter purchases as you saw 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.969
 last trigger but if the first did not go 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.869
 under the kidnapped club just changed to 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.119
 arc your mate in the mail 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:27.359
 must restructuring storm graduate first 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.809
 what he should do is take such 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:31.209
 position if after the first minus goes 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.169
 Immediately exit on the background of the items will not be able 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.279
 cause significant damage to the opponent after 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:36.839
 what can take a sleeve like in principle 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.639
 most players 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.609
 I repeat once again stand kraysport not 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.859
 wait with it litas why act 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:43.989
 what exactly 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.180
 these actions as you have noticed 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.609
 designed for such kirklenda why 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.400
 recoil rally driver can 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.790
 select or play correctly 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.980
 phrase correctly play 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.609
 implies the fact that if you 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.560
 make everything shown as you lose 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.440
 round it will be easier for you to look for mistakes 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.390
 with five planets than adjusting from 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.970
 five sailors who have not coped with 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.369
 running on point 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:04.659
 and power the bike with such a tactical 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.269
 you have an advantage over 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.819
 rival photo books of this team 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.589
 makes a lot of mistakes when holding 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:10.549
 points 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.339
 from these positions hide atlanta you 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.400
 can do for which will fly your 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.549
 team take a round and do numerical 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.690
 advantage over your opponent 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.359
 just undeniable one more plus which 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.709
 this quality cannot be compared with anything 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.270
 training runs a lot 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.979
 it is better 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.169
 so again repeat the fate 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.449
 foreman price small mistakes and you will know 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:28.960
 that both need to understand 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.039
 adjust 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.949
 it was an example so to say pictures 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.729
 defender now see about 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.729
 points while you play marked a 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.889
 choosing your position the other day may be 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.550
 there were no different occupational options 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.680
 a huge amount for example you can just 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.159
 option 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.889
 let's say that you have plans and landing on 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.039
 stranded and water lantern 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.719
 the third player is on the carpets and 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.580
 in the middle of the round all over it is given on 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.279
 carpets 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:53.319
 croup arrived in time so 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.949
 deserted son carpets pashkov point b should 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.789
 be exactly here a position near 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.099
 libraries a lot of sand do not argue and 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.189
 small sands since this will be a game on 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:04.519
 yourself what could be the game for yourself in this 

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:05.469
 case 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:07.409
 two days after minus on carpets 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.439
 continue to stand like a tower why 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.399
 if after the first person on the carpets they 

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.949
 take off and bake nosenko 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.159
 beat off carpets and it will tons like 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.269
 such that it is expressed wrong, I think 

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:20.089
 no one does and will not do 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.259
 second even if you hide the media not 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.349
 pulling from over five in and would put 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.659
 you will not have time to catch a visa exit skadovsk 5 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.349
 plan at the very call 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:29.899
 unless of course nobody passed the tournament 

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:32.110
 do not have time here should stay on 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.379
 a place to wait for an ailment for free so 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:35.740
 how the attack will try to swing 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.119
 Kombrig Ukraine that plus pasha arable land can 

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:39.770
 pick up the form of coats 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.529
 point b drink experience children $ plus 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.439
 pashkov give information is too early 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.169
 families as he is like me already 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.889
 spoke near the library 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.879
 but then whether to spend the situation and 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.370
 Dynamo uah or vice versa b plan this 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.430
 moment to play and also should not be so 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.699
 help with abortions is unlikely 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:59.039
 unless of course the situation is with 2 in Baku and 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.879
 the flow plan will be set from the total 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.529
 Dismantled I conclude that the game is on 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.219
 the planet and the plan stupid 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.120
 completely interconnected by 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.680
 such actions you can win and 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.439
 seconds that will help you ahead 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.960
 bomb physicist for example or ancestors of kipling 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.879
 games on canvas turrets but there 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:15.759
 we offer only options for drawing 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.909
 round and the choice of the position of a cry as well 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:19.809
 play it your right next 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.719
 the last but one dolphin map we 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.110
 let's talk and beat and shawl for protection but in 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.830
 subsequent lessons find a reason for urkhart 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.719
 this time two windows this today donkeys 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:28.349
 say goodbye
