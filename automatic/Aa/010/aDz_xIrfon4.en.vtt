00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 and so 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210
 efe 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:28.529
 and 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:28.529
 the sun rises and even though it's full 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:37.190
 glow of the collectors and we're going to 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.470
 start with 5 curious facts as I said 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.650
 will be uploaded on Mondays and Fridays 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.210
 because because I'm crazy if for that 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.860
 reason not the reasons because almost 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.160
 we are about to reach the special 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.589
 100 curious facts part 2 that is others and 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.070
 in data we are missing counting without counting 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.080
 this is missing 8 more episodes so 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.839
 I want it to be the possible brand and we're going 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.460
 to start with the first data I remember you 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.559
 as always if you have a data 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.619
 comment and I always choose the ones that have 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.960
 more more likes because then obviously they are 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.310
 true and good and if you see a 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.170
 Comment worth 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.780
 please like it so I can 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.510
 see and this faster and let's start 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.180
 with the first data which is 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.080
 all absolutely all the pistons 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.060
 who are watching are all activated 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.950
 but all activated is worth 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.040
 Well, precisely this is what the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.470
 only maybe there are one or two that I 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.480
 missing but but these are the blocks 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.250
 that can not be moved by pistons and are 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.360
 the spams fuck you are the portal that this 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.330
 is achieved in creative and I say 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.100
 the obsidian the table enchantments the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.400
 base stone or pet rock 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.850
 the chest of ander and the portal of the under 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.700
 that is also achieved in 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.189
 in creative and good technically are the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.840
 only the sponge but maybe 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.330
 the sponge is a material that 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.150
 you only get creative which 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.130
 I do not understand very well because if it would be very 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.410
 easy good first the sponge yes 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.250
 it works but hey these are the fives 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.890
 blocks 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.530
 maybe there are one or two that are going away 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.239
 right now but in general these are 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.300
 the blocks that can not be pushed 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.280
 by pistons and let's start with the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.350
 community data are four data 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.950
 here so let's put first the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.650
 which is from gabriel tafur and he tells us 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.370
 how can you see it here opposite no no 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.260
 there is no difference they are not really 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.330
 same but this is something we do 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.250
 every time we play minecraft always 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.580
 every time we play minecraft what 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.310
 we do and it's something that he never does 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.120
 we pay attention and it is the following thing 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.370
 they see the same but just one is a 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.709
 White 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.659
 of wood and others a search table what 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.170
 which makes sense because the table 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.120
 cracking is made of wood but the 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.650
 truth is that it is always like 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.299
 we always put a postman table always 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.090
 we see the sides that have a saw 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.190
 He has a hammer but we never see each other 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.659
 we never look down on what we give ourselves 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.900
 realize that below is just like a 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:20.650
 a wood a wood plant and 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.650
 just that 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.360
 the sun comes up 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.690
 and we go with the following data of the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.080
 community when brought by Kirby Luigi 22 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.260
 and this is a fact something is extremely 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:40.100
 stupid which and you know what toy what 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.110
 which I do not find any sense and good 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.530
 we go with the data which tells us that 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.530
 let's remove this clogging it's worth 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.020
 well let's chop lapis lazuli with 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.030
 a stone peak 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.000
 there is our beautiful pencil there 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.980
 blue and now we're going to chop the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.980
 lapis lazuli with a gold peak 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.330
 Well, just that stupidity more 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.750
 great in the world because because with the 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.150
 golden peak 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.250
 if it can be chopped but it does not give you objects 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.960
 since it is a tool that is not suitable 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.630
 for lapis lazuli and because the stone 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.180
 and that is how it is that is that is that 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.519
 There's Mommy, let's go with the following information 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.650
 and with another and momo insert last name 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.960
 Japanese here and good he tells us that 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.560
 set something very weird and very stupid 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.780
 well let's break this ice ok no 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.820
 water came out and we broke this ice and 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.670
 logical water of minecraft I do not know no no 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.240
 always words without words without 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.700
 words and let's go with the latest data and the 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.470
 data number 5 that Alberto brought 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.900
 which sent a lot of data but this was the 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.850
 unique that I saw interesting which we 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.340
 says that if we leave an oven on 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.530
 there it is refining what is the 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.419
 diamond and we leave an ice on the side and 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.430
 here we leave an ice here or what 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.010
 we leave at the same time good so let's go 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.440
 to make a fast camera and according to this 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.440
 this ice is going to melt and this one does not 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.120
 and 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.560
 the sun comes up 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.520
 and 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.520
 the sun comes up 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:37.600
 in your eyes but alves planted 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.430
 and there you have it, guys there they have it 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.920
 just melted the ice that we put 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.350
 technically that will be a one second one 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.460
 second after one in fact this one what 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.430
 we put first and this we put 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.390
 afterwards and this time I tried it too 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.470
 and this one stayed that way it stayed and is 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.200
 just the ice they had seen 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.940
 here just never melted and 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.100
 this ice then there is there comes the 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.700
 verified data and as you can see is 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.930
 Water 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.820
 static that is not moving but but 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.490
 in a time in a minute two minutes 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.050
 more or less water is seen to scatter 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.600
 as it will no longer be static and 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.060
 just those are the five data the 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:21.040
 pistons 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.270
 the karate table or on the bottom 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.560
 lapis lazuli 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.560
 what are they 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:34.200
 This is one that if you put an ice on it 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.710
 from one as it is destroyed it melts and by 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.410
 last the biggest stupidity 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.880
 is this that is broken is this appears 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.160
 water and it will be a fish this does not look like water 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.240
 because by minecraft logic the same as 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.390
 the collectors because they liked it 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.190
 the video 5 curious facts episode 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.530
 number 32 remember that we see each other 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.800
 Mondays and Fridays at 3 o'clock 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.300
 late hour from mexico and that's it 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.990
 remember that if you have a data 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:02.090
 curious commenting please and if you yes 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.560
 you do not have a curious fact but it's a 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.930
 curious fact that it's worth it and that 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.390
 you know you really can like 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.660
 so that in that way I can know 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:13.040
 that that data is worth it and so I do 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.200
 these videos faster so good 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.180
 see you until the next week and 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.630
 follow us on twitter and follow us on 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.930
 facebook below I leave the links and that 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.930
 that's it 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.190
 this hair 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.930
 the sun comes up 

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:40.349
 i 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.349
 do not 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.210
 Y 

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:56.100
 m 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:59.100
 and because 

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.100
 waters 

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.560
 Amen 

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.560
 now
