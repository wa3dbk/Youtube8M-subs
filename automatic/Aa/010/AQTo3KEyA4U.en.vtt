of threat ten root on the E string then

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.560 
of threat ten root on the E string then
we've<00:01:16.780> got<00:01:16.899> C<00:01:17.170> sharp<00:01:17.470> five<00:01:17.800> fret<00:01:18.520> 9<00:01:18.820> root<00:01:19.390> on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
we've got C sharp five fret 9 root on

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.700 
we've got C sharp five fret 9 root on
the<00:01:19.600> E<00:01:19.750> string

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.719 

and<00:01:23.520> finally<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> b5<00:01:24.990> fret<00:01:25.530> 7<00:01:26.040> roots<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.580> the

string

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.860 

so<00:01:30.530> there<00:01:30.740> are<00:01:30.770> all<00:01:30.950> routes<00:01:31.310> on<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.610> e-string

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
so there are all routes on the e-string

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.920 
so there are all routes on the e-string
ten<00:01:32.890> nine<00:01:33.890> seven<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:35.210> those<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:35.540> you<00:01:35.630> ones

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
ten nine seven and those of you ones

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.100 
ten nine seven and those of you ones
were<00:01:36.080> going<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.290> be<00:01:36.380> using<00:01:37.540> that<00:01:38.540> what<00:01:39.020> you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
were going to be using that what you

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.390 
were going to be using that what you
want<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.380> do<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:39.620> just<00:01:39.800> make<00:01:39.979> sure<00:01:40.160> you<00:01:40.250> can

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
want to do is just make sure you can

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.790 
want to do is just make sure you can
move<00:01:40.550> around<00:01:40.670> these<00:01:41.030> free<00:01:41.330> cords<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:41.960> retain

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
move around these free cords and retain

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.680 
move around these free cords and retain
the<00:01:42.920> integrity<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.760> shape<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.479> if<00:01:44.570> you

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
the integrity of the shape so if you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.390 
the integrity of the shape so if you
squeeze<00:01:44.990> too<00:01:45.200> hard<00:01:45.530> you're<00:01:45.800> gonna<00:01:45.950> sort<00:01:46.340> of

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
squeeze too hard you're gonna sort of

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.430 
squeeze too hard you're gonna sort of
start<00:01:46.640> losing<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.479> spread<00:01:47.750> of<00:01:47.780> your<00:01:47.960> fingers

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
start losing the spread of your fingers

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.719 
start losing the spread of your fingers
and<00:01:48.650> they're<00:01:48.860> not<00:01:49.010> going<00:01:49.160> to<00:01:49.220> run<00:01:49.340> nicely

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
and they're not going to run nicely

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.030 
and they're not going to run nicely
together<00:01:49.880> so<00:01:50.240> make<00:01:50.390> sure<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.860> retain<00:01:51.860> some

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
together so make sure you retain some

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.040 
together so make sure you retain some
flexibility<00:01:52.760> in<00:01:52.910> that<00:01:52.940> and<00:01:53.330> also<00:01:53.660> make<00:01:54.020> sure

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
flexibility in that and also make sure

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.900 
flexibility in that and also make sure
your<00:01:54.380> mutants<00:01:54.770> in<00:01:54.950> place<00:01:55.190> on<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.580> treble

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
your mutants in place on the treble

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.760 
your mutants in place on the treble
strings<00:01:56.119> like<00:01:56.570> we<00:01:56.720> looked<00:01:56.900> at<00:01:57.050> in<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.320> earlier

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
strings like we looked at in the earlier

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.770 
strings like we looked at in the earlier
lesson<00:01:58.220> okay<00:01:59.000> so<00:01:59.060> I'm<00:01:59.240> just<00:01:59.300> going<00:01:59.510> to<00:01:59.570> play

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
lesson okay so I'm just going to play

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.719 
lesson okay so I'm just going to play
through<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.080> riff<00:02:00.380> really<00:02:00.830> slowly<00:02:01.100> now<00:02:01.490> and

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
through the riff really slowly now and

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.340 
through the riff really slowly now and
then<00:02:02.149> I'll<00:02:02.300> talk<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.570> little<00:02:02.690> bit<00:02:03.020> more<00:02:03.200> about

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
then I'll talk a little bit more about

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:18.460 
then I'll talk a little bit more about
how<00:02:03.560> we<00:02:03.590> rhythms<00:02:04.070> working

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:26.170 

you

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.759 

[Music]

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.380 

okay<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:34.830> that's<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.519> main<00:02:35.730> weights<00:02:36.000> moving

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
okay so that's the main weights moving

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.390 
okay so that's the main weights moving
around<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:37.019> from<00:02:37.170> ten<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.950> nine<00:02:38.160> to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
around just going from ten to nine to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.089 
around just going from ten to nine to
seven<00:02:38.879> back<00:02:39.450> through<00:02:39.720> nine<00:02:39.989> to<00:02:40.440> right<00:02:40.709> back<00:02:40.950> at

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
seven back through nine to right back at

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.729 
seven back through nine to right back at
ten<00:02:41.310> for<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:42.120> progression<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.780> restart<00:02:43.319> so

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
ten for the progression to restart so

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.320 
ten for the progression to restart so

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
through literary Wistrom directions so

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.610 
through literary Wistrom directions so
we've<00:03:15.000> got<00:03:15.349> down<00:03:16.349> down<00:03:17.250> down<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.540> down<00:03:18.930> and

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
we've got down down down and down and

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.940 
we've got down down down and down and
down<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.670> down<00:03:21.390> down<00:03:22.069> down

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.009 

down<00:03:26.950> down<00:03:27.700> down

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
down down down

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.199 
down down down
so<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.709> basically<00:03:29.950> think<00:03:30.310> of<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.609> as<00:03:30.790> we

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
so you basically think of it as we

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.730 
so you basically think of it as we
remembers<00:03:31.629> down<00:03:32.170> down<00:03:32.950> down<00:03:33.640> down

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
remembers down down down down

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.300 
remembers down down down down
down<00:03:36.310> down<00:03:37.630> so<00:03:37.900> it's<00:03:38.020> accord<00:03:38.380> with<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.100> river

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
down down so it's accord with the river

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.400 
down down so it's accord with the river
and<00:03:39.580> that<00:03:40.000> final<00:03:40.480> stream<00:03:40.750> at<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.960> end<00:03:41.140> and

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
and that final stream at the end and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.720 
and that final stream at the end and
then<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.620> same<00:03:41.830> thing<00:03:42.070> happening<00:03:42.400> from<00:03:42.580> the

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
then the same thing happening from the

then the same thing happening from the
b5<00:03:43.240> as<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.930> said<00:03:44.110> if<00:03:44.200> that's<00:03:44.410> not<00:03:44.770> super<00:03:45.460> clear
