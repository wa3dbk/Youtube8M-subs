00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
it's just reactionary time and you hope

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.960 
it's just reactionary time and you hope
that<00:03:34.110> there<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> clear<00:03:34.860> path<00:03:35.130> for<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.850> go
