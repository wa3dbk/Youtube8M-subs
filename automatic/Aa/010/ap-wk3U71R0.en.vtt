00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.310
 talves absolute of the saints the game opened and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.440
 I bring a trickster game today in the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.850
 Truth is a trickster gameplay and ps3 ibaf 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.520
 of 31 33 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.080
 This is the farewell video of my 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.270
 capture card the tree hd team 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.969
 served me well during the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.559
 rush skateboard championship that was 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.109
 accomplished by the people and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.120
 started in was a good championship 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.179
 Centralized even has videos from 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.760
 our plays on the sony channel we do not 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.839
 lost a match and we managed to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.719
 play very well told us 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.629
 trained enough and leave the time that 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.170
 accompanied us a little leg 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.510
 we got the style inspired in 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.780
 season looking gameplay round 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.320
 competitive prosecutor clÃ¡udio us 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.020
 we did what we got is we got on the maps 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.960
 empty and that we can go places and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.119
 was very strong with lots of fun and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.729
 this must be competitive was very 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.920
 interesting and I at least change the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.810
 capture card helped me a lot 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.110
 I say yes for my spirit. 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.140
 competitive and the band on the course 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.240
 has in the competitive mif board paid for 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.520
 in the time of which we now know it was already worth 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.920
 very worthy because the level of requirement 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.320
 I have with me and the people who 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.570
 play with me is so great 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.399
 headaches that have already relieved me know 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.990
 and so I had to do what I 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.090
 I did what I liked to do was 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.560
 give the maps names to rags 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.630
 ball strategy 'is way to roll 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.850
 Working for the galley was worth a lot. 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.340
 pen and I am very happy about it but 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.439
 arrived said to say goodbye to the 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.719
 video there has some photos 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.970
 and y and the board face is who plays the console 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.619
 so I think it's worth it 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.940
 I do not know how to make an investment 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.770
 capture board 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.260
 if you play competitive 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.210
 if you're not competitive there 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.420
 Yes it's worth even more because you 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.250
 learn a lot about whether a game like 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.240
 improve your game you see that you 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.970
 did 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.350
 it you did wrong event you did 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.050
 of certain but mainly that you did 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.800
 wrong what you could have done and 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.540
 did not 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.100
 so she gets my recommendation and if 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.350
 Can you buy a license plate? 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.390
 capture require several I do not 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.210
 I'll advertise for none like that. 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.700
 tell which one you should buy either 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.370
 any better of all and I will not do 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.260
 alone that this strand broke the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.230
 quietly twig time that I used 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.470
 but the idea is that it's worth a lot 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.510
 You're sorry you did review you as 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.250
 You've been playing games. I see a lot of videos. 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.840
 that the audience and told us that Fernando 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.090
 I also see a lot of how he plays. 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.770
 and it helps me improve my 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.440
 performance are also sure that you 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.360
 that exists in the videos you too 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.700
 Can you see how we 're playing the game? 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.820
 What are you doing? Is it working or not? 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.390
 and it sure helps you so in your 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.860
 commitment is daily play of boots 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.080
 galera no more is this video the video 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.140
 very quick just wanted to bring this 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.340
 last experience is not useful me kind 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:33.030
 In the botafogo of 3.63 in ps3 because I am 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.190
 there if you want and and add on psn 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.680
 I think maybe there still has room 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.750
 No one is the same that I use that dilates 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.640
 opened then he mentioned that perhaps the 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.050
 We play together and from now on I 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.810
 I will play will not only be able to record and 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.150
 publish on the channel then they had 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.610
 capture board play record people 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.100
 talking and playing alongside a 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.890
 sponsorship facebook message 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.250
 document here and let's play there fell 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.010
 all available was being much of a 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.320
 that the last rounds there were in the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.350
 uncertainties because of the difficulty 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.390
 is devoted keyboard to the control in a 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.720
 Much text business is more experienced 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.230
 which for me is very painful but I did 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.669
 because I wanted to leave my 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.359
 ox experience with the REIA board 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.130
 catch 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.919
 more battlefield 3 to install from ps3 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.390
 and started to play better now that's it 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.510
 thank you you were not to 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.670
 and does not know the physical act 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.290
 she talks about the fit point with the br 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.650
 too much content is worth you 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.210
 yes knowing if you see what you have already produced 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.210
 that I 've discussed from now on. 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.210
 then this soldier a hug and even more
