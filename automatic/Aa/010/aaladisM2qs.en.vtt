00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.780 

so<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.110> don't<00:00:52.350> paint<00:00:52.650> for<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> special<00:00:53.340> audience

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
so I don't paint for a special audience

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.630 
so I don't paint for a special audience
I<00:00:54.030> paint<00:00:54.450> the<00:00:54.960> big<00:00:55.170> scales<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:56.040> there's<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I paint the big scales because there's a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.860 
I paint the big scales because there's a
need<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:56.970> me<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.330> do<00:00:57.600> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
need for me to do it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.560 
need for me to do it
you<00:00:58.020> know<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.740> it's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.090> it's<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.270> it's<00:01:00.300> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
you know so it's a it's a it's a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.930 
you know so it's a it's a it's a
question<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.930> proportion<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.400> I

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
question of proportion I think so I I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.910 
question of proportion I think so I I
don't<00:01:02.970> know<00:01:03.150> I<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.110> beginning<00:01:04.590> on<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
don't know I from the beginning on I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.910 
don't know I from the beginning on I
made<00:01:05.100> sometimes<00:01:05.550> very<00:01:05.880> big<00:01:06.090> scale<00:01:06.390> paintings

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
made sometimes very big scale paintings

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.650 
made sometimes very big scale paintings
because<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.160> didn't<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.850> shrink<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
because I didn't want it to shrink the

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.480 
because I didn't want it to shrink the
theme<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.260> interested<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.160> know<00:01:11.280> I

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
theme I'm interested in you know I

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.930 
theme I'm interested in you know I
couldn't<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.480> so<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.720> think<00:01:13.050> that<00:01:13.410> that<00:01:13.940> each

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
couldn't do it so I think that that each

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.990 
couldn't do it so I think that that each
person<00:01:15.540> has<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.720> proportion<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.920> know<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.280> so

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
person has a proportion you know and so

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.450 
person has a proportion you know and so
so<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.870> my<00:01:19.050> proportion<00:01:19.770> these<00:01:19.950> kind<00:01:20.370> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
so it's my proportion these kind of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.969 
so it's my proportion these kind of
situations<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.480> want<00:01:21.690> to<00:01:21.840> paint<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
situations and if I want to paint a

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.490 
situations and if I want to paint a
bigger<00:01:23.550> theme<00:01:23.910> I<00:01:24.150> need<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> bigger<00:01:24.690> canvas<00:01:25.020> even

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
bigger theme I need a bigger canvas even

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.500 
bigger theme I need a bigger canvas even
a<00:01:25.740> painting<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.190> this<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.060> detail<00:01:27.450> of

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
a painting like this is just a detail of

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.350 
a painting like this is just a detail of
the<00:01:27.720> world<00:01:28.050> I<00:01:28.260> want<00:01:28.440> to<00:01:28.500> paint<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.119> in

the world I want to paint you know so in

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
sometimes it's not possible to make

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.540 
sometimes it's not possible to make

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
to have these hundred meters and you

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.740 
to have these hundred meters and you
have<00:01:44.160> more<00:01:44.460> from<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.910> world<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.510> know<00:01:45.630> what

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
have more from this world you know what

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.859 
have more from this world you know what
I<00:01:45.780> mean<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:47.310> there's<00:01:47.729> no<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.720> would

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
I mean so it's but there's no that would

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.960 
I mean so it's but there's no that would
be<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:49.020> dream<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.440> do<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.190> because<00:01:50.400> I<00:01:50.700> think

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
be a dream to do it so because I think

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.719 
be a dream to do it so because I think
that<00:01:51.119> even<00:01:51.330> this<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.260> detail<00:01:52.410> of<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that even this is just a detail of the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.820 
that even this is just a detail of the
world<00:01:53.940> I'm<00:01:54.210> thinking<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.289> easier<00:01:55.679> to

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
world I'm thinking of it's easier to

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.219 
world I'm thinking of it's easier to
make<00:01:55.979> small<00:01:56.280> paintings<00:01:56.759> anyway<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> love

make small paintings anyway but I love

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
make small paintings anyway but I love
it<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.470> there's<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.800> need<00:01:59.070> for<00:01:59.100> me<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.580> do<00:01:59.880> it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
it and there's a need for me to do it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.480

cannot say it's not there it's there so

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.820 
cannot say it's not there it's there so
it's<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.360> it's<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.780> thing<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:57.050> use<00:03:57.260> from<00:03:57.530> time<00:03:57.709> to

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
it's a it's the thing I use from time to

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.610 
it's a it's the thing I use from time to
time<00:03:57.860> -<00:03:58.310> yeah<00:03:58.610> why<00:03:59.300> do<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.600> use<00:03:59.750> mannequin<00:04:00.320> so

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
time - yeah why do you use mannequin so

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.860 
time - yeah why do you use mannequin so
much<00:04:00.830> I<00:04:01.220> like<00:04:01.670> it<00:04:01.700> sometimes<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.450> have<00:04:02.630> this

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
much I like it sometimes to have this

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.400 
much I like it sometimes to have this
thin<00:04:03.410> line<00:04:03.620> in<00:04:03.920> between<00:04:04.070> a<00:04:04.640> human<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.720> can<00:04:05.750> see

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
thin line in between a human you can see

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.240 
thin line in between a human you can see
and<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.730> idea<00:04:08.120> of<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.510> human<00:04:08.870> you<00:04:09.050> have<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.680> so

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
and the idea of a human you have and so

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.370 
and the idea of a human you have and so
that's<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.610> reason<00:04:10.790> why<00:04:11.000> sometimes<00:04:11.030> I<00:04:11.690> mix<00:04:12.140> it

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
that's the reason why sometimes I mix it

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.949 
that's the reason why sometimes I mix it
or<00:04:12.620> sometimes<00:04:13.040> I<00:04:13.250> cut<00:04:13.519> something<00:04:14.060> or<00:04:14.300> make

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
or sometimes I cut something or make

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.080 
or sometimes I cut something or make
something<00:04:14.989> I<00:04:15.709> don't<00:04:16.310> know<00:04:16.370> an<00:04:16.489> arm<00:04:16.730> which<00:04:16.940> is

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
something I don't know an arm which is

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.750 
something I don't know an arm which is
not<00:04:17.239> fitting<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:17.900> you<00:04:18.560> know<00:04:18.680> -<00:04:19.190> it's<00:04:19.489> an

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
not fitting to the you know - it's an

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.530 
not fitting to the you know - it's an
absurd<00:04:20.299> idea<00:04:20.690> but<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.140> sometimes<00:04:22.040> it<00:04:22.190> shows

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
absurd idea but it sometimes it shows

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.570 
absurd idea but it sometimes it shows
that<00:04:23.540> there's<00:04:23.960> more<00:04:24.229> flexibility<00:04:24.919> in<00:04:25.160> it<00:04:25.280> then

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
that there's more flexibility in it then

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.400 
that there's more flexibility in it then
we<00:04:26.030> think<00:04:26.300> sometimes<00:04:26.690> some<00:04:27.140> of<00:04:27.290> your

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
we think sometimes some of your

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.690 
we think sometimes some of your
paintings<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.919> seems<00:04:28.130> that<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.370> could<00:04:28.550> almost

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
paintings it seems that you could almost

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.969 
paintings it seems that you could almost
turn<00:04:29.060> them<00:04:29.180> sideways<00:04:29.390> -<00:04:30.020> degrees<00:04:30.440> on<00:04:30.650> and

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
turn them sideways - degrees on and

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.520 
turn them sideways - degrees on and
still<00:04:31.490> see<00:04:31.669> an<00:04:31.790> image<00:04:31.940> within<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.450> image<00:04:32.600> can

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
still see an image within that image can

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.620 
still see an image within that image can
you<00:04:33.620> tell<00:04:33.800> me<00:04:33.890> something<00:04:34.070> about<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.630> yeah

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
you tell me something about that yeah

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.420 
you tell me something about that yeah
you're<00:04:35.960> right<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:36.380> in<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.620> end<00:04:36.740> of<00:04:36.979> painting

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
you're right so in the end of painting

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.580 
you're right so in the end of painting
has<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.790> work<00:04:38.000> in<00:04:38.330> every<00:04:38.630> direction<00:04:38.930> in<00:04:39.410> a<00:04:39.470> way

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
has to work in every direction in a way

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.000 
has to work in every direction in a way
as<00:04:39.830> an<00:04:40.010> abstract<00:04:40.490> thing<00:04:40.810> but<00:04:41.810> in<00:04:42.380> a<00:04:42.530> case<00:04:42.740> of

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
as an abstract thing but in a case of

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.850 
as an abstract thing but in a case of
one<00:04:43.610> painting<00:04:43.970> here<00:04:44.120> for<00:04:44.300> example<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:44.900> changed

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
one painting here for example I changed

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.950 
one painting here for example I changed
the<00:04:46.100> point<00:04:46.340> of<00:04:46.490> view<00:04:46.760> so<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.120> painted<00:04:47.479> it<00:04:47.750> like<00:04:47.930> a

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
the point of view so I painted it like a

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.520 
the point of view so I painted it like a
room<00:04:48.260> and<00:04:48.590> then<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:49.130> turned<00:04:49.669> it<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.350> so<00:04:51.350> it's

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
room and then I turned it and so it's

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.530 
room and then I turned it and so it's
now<00:04:51.710> on<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:51.919> side<00:04:52.280> so<00:04:52.640> it<00:04:52.760> makes<00:04:53.000> it<00:04:53.240> the

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
now on the side so it makes it the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.990 
now on the side so it makes it the
situation<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.169> bit<00:04:54.200> more<00:04:54.470> absurd<00:04:54.950> that<00:04:55.790> this

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
situation a bit more absurd that this

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.210 
situation a bit more absurd that this
happens<00:04:56.450> you<00:04:56.960> know<00:04:57.080> but<00:04:57.290> I<00:04:57.320> think<00:04:57.650> it's<00:04:57.770> it's

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
happens you know but I think it's it's

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.820 
happens you know but I think it's it's
okay<00:04:58.520> if<00:04:58.700> it's<00:04:58.880> still<00:04:59.300> to<00:04:59.750> understand<00:05:00.470> as<00:05:00.770> a

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
okay if it's still to understand as a

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.880 
okay if it's still to understand as a
viewer<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:01.760> know<00:05:01.790> if<00:05:02.180> not<00:05:02.570> I<00:05:02.780> lose<00:05:03.320> the<00:05:03.590> viewer

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
viewer you know if not I lose the viewer

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.280 
viewer you know if not I lose the viewer
you<00:05:04.310> know<00:05:04.430> what<00:05:04.550> I<00:05:04.610> mean<00:05:04.790> and<00:05:05.660> you<00:05:05.810> also<00:05:05.990> really

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
you know what I mean and you also really

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.600 
you know what I mean and you also really
want<00:05:06.530> known<00:05:06.680> for<00:05:06.919> your<00:05:07.010> use<00:05:07.190> of<00:05:07.340> fluorescent

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
want known for your use of fluorescent

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.969 
want known for your use of fluorescent
colors<00:05:08.240> where<00:05:08.960> does<00:05:09.110> your<00:05:09.140> palette<00:05:09.470> come<00:05:09.680> from

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
colors where does your palette come from

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.770 
colors where does your palette come from
I<00:05:10.280> like<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.970> intends<00:05:11.360> of

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
I like the intends of

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.800 
I like the intends of
because<00:05:12.350> it's<00:05:12.620> not<00:05:12.800> so<00:05:13.100> intellectual<00:05:13.910> it's

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
because it's not so intellectual it's

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.990 
because it's not so intellectual it's
the<00:05:15.020> thing<00:05:15.230> you<00:05:15.260> feel<00:05:15.650> you<00:05:15.950> know<00:05:16.070> it<00:05:16.250> you<00:05:16.970> know

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
the thing you feel you know it you know

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.090 
the thing you feel you know it you know
it<00:05:17.120> goes<00:05:17.389> in<00:05:17.630> your<00:05:17.780> feeling<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:18.590> love<00:05:18.830> this

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
it goes in your feeling and I love this

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.960 
it goes in your feeling and I love this
that<00:05:19.639> in<00:05:19.880> the<00:05:20.090> end<00:05:20.270> if<00:05:20.690> you<00:05:21.500> leave<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.580> room

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
that in the end if you leave the room

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.540 
that in the end if you leave the room
here<00:05:23.330> you<00:05:23.990> cannot<00:05:24.320> remember<00:05:24.620> all<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:25.070> content

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
here you cannot remember all the content

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.629 
here you cannot remember all the content
but<00:05:26.270> if<00:05:26.510> you<00:05:26.720> have<00:05:26.930> still<00:05:27.290> the<00:05:27.440> feeling<00:05:27.980> of<00:05:28.010> the

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
but if you have still the feeling of the

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.940 
but if you have still the feeling of the
paintings<00:05:29.150> then<00:05:29.690> I'm<00:05:29.870> totally<00:05:30.200> okay<00:05:30.590> you<00:05:30.830> know

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
paintings then I'm totally okay you know

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.370 
paintings then I'm totally okay you know
that's<00:05:31.220> what<00:05:31.400> I<00:05:31.430> like<00:05:31.700> too<00:05:32.060> you<00:05:32.510> know<00:05:32.630> and<00:05:32.780> so

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
that's what I like too you know and so

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.470 
that's what I like too you know and so
and<00:05:33.590> of<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:34.010> colors<00:05:34.340> are<00:05:34.520> transporting

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
and of the colors are transporting

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.870 
and of the colors are transporting
exactly<00:05:36.200> this<00:05:36.380> idea<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:37.160> you<00:05:37.370> build<00:05:37.700> up<00:05:37.820> your

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
exactly this idea and you build up your

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.510 
exactly this idea and you build up your
layers<00:05:38.180> a<00:05:38.540> lot<00:05:38.720> as<00:05:39.230> well<00:05:39.290> how<00:05:39.889> many<00:05:40.070> layers<00:05:40.310> of

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
layers a lot as well how many layers of

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.850 
layers a lot as well how many layers of
payment<00:05:41.300> would<00:05:41.419> you<00:05:41.600> typically<00:05:42.020> have<00:05:42.320> yeah<00:05:42.830> I

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
payment would you typically have yeah I

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.680 
payment would you typically have yeah I
like<00:05:43.220> it<00:05:43.250> to<00:05:43.490> have<00:05:43.520> a<00:05:43.639> fight<00:05:43.970> on<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.270> painting

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
like it to have a fight on the painting

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.810 
like it to have a fight on the painting
because<00:05:45.080> I<00:05:45.110> think<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.770> audience<00:05:46.190> can<00:05:46.430> see<00:05:46.669> it

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
because I think the audience can see it

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.020 
because I think the audience can see it
I<00:05:46.970> want<00:05:47.180> to<00:05:47.360> I<00:05:47.720> want<00:05:47.810> to<00:05:48.169> see<00:05:48.470> the<00:05:49.070> procedure<00:05:49.580> of

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
I want to I want to see the procedure of

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.020 
I want to I want to see the procedure of
painting<00:05:50.840> because<00:05:51.530> it's<00:05:51.710> becoming<00:05:52.160> more<00:05:52.430> deep

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
painting because it's becoming more deep

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.240 
painting because it's becoming more deep
and<00:05:53.270> heavy<00:05:53.690> you<00:05:54.169> know<00:05:54.290> then<00:05:54.530> I<00:05:54.680> like<00:05:54.890> it

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
and heavy you know then I like it

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.830 
and heavy you know then I like it
and<00:05:55.340> so<00:05:55.880> that's<00:05:56.090> the<00:05:56.180> reason<00:05:56.419> why<00:05:56.510> I<00:05:56.540> make<00:05:56.810> a

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
and so that's the reason why I make a

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.830 
and so that's the reason why I make a
lot<00:05:57.050> of<00:05:57.110> layers<00:05:57.530> and<00:05:57.890> I<00:05:58.430> destroy<00:05:59.150> again<00:05:59.510> and<00:05:59.720> go

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
lot of layers and I destroy again and go

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.630 
lot of layers and I destroy again and go
over<00:06:00.140> it<00:06:00.260> and<00:06:00.440> destroy<00:06:00.770> again<00:06:01.040> and<00:06:01.220> go<00:06:01.340> over<00:06:01.520> it

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
over it and destroy again and go over it

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.430 
over it and destroy again and go over it
and<00:06:01.760> then<00:06:01.820> so<00:06:02.180> it<00:06:02.300> becomes<00:06:02.690> more<00:06:02.930> like<00:06:03.410> a

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
and then so it becomes more like a

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.950 
and then so it becomes more like a
result<00:06:03.950> of<00:06:04.070> a<00:06:04.160> struggle<00:06:04.490> I<00:06:04.850> like<00:06:05.570> that

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
result of a struggle I like that

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.570 
result of a struggle I like that
so<00:06:06.320> what<00:06:06.500> do<00:06:06.590> you<00:06:06.650> think<00:06:06.830> Freud<00:06:07.010> would<00:06:07.250> make<00:06:07.430> of

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
so what do you think Freud would make of

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.909 
so what do you think Freud would make of
your<00:06:07.669> works<00:06:07.940> I<00:06:08.360> don't<00:06:09.110> know<00:06:09.410> yeah<00:06:09.620> that<00:06:09.800> would

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
your works I don't know yeah that would

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.969 
your works I don't know yeah that would
be<00:06:09.950> interesting<00:06:10.520> right<00:06:11.290> but<00:06:12.290> what<00:06:12.680> Freud

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
be interesting right but what Freud

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.790 
be interesting right but what Freud
would<00:06:13.040> say<00:06:13.340> I<00:06:14.090> have<00:06:14.479> no<00:06:14.510> idea<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:15.290> maybe

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
would say I have no idea and maybe

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.700 
would say I have no idea and maybe
sometimes<00:06:16.340> it's<00:06:16.490> better<00:06:16.729> not<00:06:17.000> to<00:06:17.080> to<00:06:18.080> look<00:06:18.470> too

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
sometimes it's better not to to look too

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.640 
sometimes it's better not to to look too
deep<00:06:18.979> in<00:06:19.250> yourself<00:06:19.700> right<00:06:20.030> I<00:06:20.390> make<00:06:21.229> it<00:06:21.350> enough

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
deep in yourself right I make it enough

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.969 
deep in yourself right I make it enough
you<00:06:21.890> see<00:06:22.070> it<00:06:22.190> here<00:06:22.430> so<00:06:22.460> so<00:06:23.390> I<00:06:23.419> don't<00:06:23.720> know<00:06:23.979> but

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979
