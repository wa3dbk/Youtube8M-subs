shorter<00:03:29.730> hairs<00:03:30.000> as<00:03:30.239> well<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.620> doesn't

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
shorter hairs as well and it doesn't

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
apply a little bit more to just give it

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.529 
apply a little bit more to just give it
that<00:06:23.200> sleek<00:06:23.620> finish<00:06:24.070> and<00:06:24.700> it<00:06:24.910> does<00:06:25.090> not<00:06:25.330> weigh

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
that sleek finish and it does not weigh

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.629 
that sleek finish and it does not weigh
my<00:06:25.720> hair<00:06:25.750> down<00:06:25.960> at<00:06:26.229> all<00:06:26.380> a<00:06:26.410> very<00:06:26.830> fine<00:06:27.160> textured

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.210 
my hair down at all a very fine textured
hair<00:06:27.820> so<00:06:28.090> my<00:06:28.300> hair<00:06:28.570> would<00:06:28.780> be<00:06:28.810> the<00:06:29.320> hair<00:06:29.710> type

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.310 
hair so my hair would be the hair type
that<00:06:30.550> would<00:06:30.700> get<00:06:30.940> weighed<00:06:31.360> down<00:06:31.389> by<00:06:31.840> products

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
that would get weighed down by products

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.649 
that would get weighed down by products
and<00:06:32.590> this<00:06:33.220> definitely<00:06:33.580> does<00:06:33.880> not<00:06:34.060> do<00:06:34.300> that<00:06:34.479> to

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:34.659
