00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
back got a good target or a good signal

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:28.810 
back got a good target or a good signal
here<00:00:21.880> at<00:00:23.199> hitting<00:00:24.199> an<00:00:24.289> Iron<00:00:24.680> Range<00:00:27.369> man<00:00:28.369> in<00:00:28.609> the

back<00:00:32.960> got<00:00:33.350> a<00:00:33.380> good<00:00:33.590> strong<00:00:33.830> signal<00:00:36.460> very

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
back got a good strong signal very

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.610 
back got a good strong signal very
consistent<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:38.600> in<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:38.809> iron<00:00:38.960> range<00:00:39.200> which

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
consistent and in the iron range which

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.880 
consistent and in the iron range which
is<00:00:39.739> why<00:00:39.860> we<00:00:40.010> expect<00:00:40.370> on<00:00:40.460> an<00:00:40.550> old<00:00:40.730> farm<00:00:41.770> when<00:00:42.770> the

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
is why we expect on an old farm when the

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.830 
is why we expect on an old farm when the
tricks<00:00:43.129> I<00:00:43.250> learned<00:00:43.280> on<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.579> forum<00:00:43.940> is<00:00:44.059> that<00:00:44.270> to

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
tricks I learned on the forum is that to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.410 
tricks I learned on the forum is that to
judge<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.230> depth<00:00:45.760> just<00:00:46.760> lift<00:00:46.910> up<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:47.149> coil

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
judge the depth just lift up the coil

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.020 
judge the depth just lift up the coil
and<00:00:47.629> see<00:00:48.160> see<00:00:49.160> how<00:00:49.280> far<00:00:49.550> up<00:00:49.699> you<00:00:49.789> can<00:00:49.910> get<00:00:49.969> a

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
and see see how far up you can get a

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.260 
and see see how far up you can get a
signal<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:51.350> I've<00:00:51.649> been<00:00:51.739> trying<00:00:52.039> that<00:00:52.160> if<00:00:52.760> it

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
signal and I've been trying that if it

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.549 
signal and I've been trying that if it
still<00:00:53.510> hits<00:00:53.600> at<00:00:53.780> nine<00:00:53.899> inches<00:00:54.199> it's<00:00:54.379> going<00:00:54.500> to

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
still hits at nine inches it's going to

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.930 
still hits at nine inches it's going to
be<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.680> beer<00:00:54.980> can<00:00:55.190> or<00:00:55.870> something<00:00:56.870> like<00:00:56.930> that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
be a beer can or something like that

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.750 
be a beer can or something like that
which<00:00:58.940> is<00:00:59.090> what<00:00:59.649> hey<00:01:00.649> young<00:01:00.829> back<00:01:01.129> kind<00:01:01.699> of

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
which is what hey young back kind of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.680 
which is what hey young back kind of
good<00:01:01.879> signal<00:01:03.430> very<00:01:04.430> consistent<00:01:04.970> running<00:01:05.570> an

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
good signal very consistent running an

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.270 
good signal very consistent running an
all-metal<00:01:05.960> mode<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.680> sitting<00:01:07.010> in<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.130> iron

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
all-metal mode is sitting in the iron

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.470 
all-metal mode is sitting in the iron
range<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:07.940> not<00:01:08.090> going<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.330> anything

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
range so it's not going to anything

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.130 
range so it's not going to anything
great<00:01:09.850> but<00:01:10.850> I'm<00:01:10.940> out<00:01:11.090> here<00:01:11.210> practicing<00:01:11.420> until

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
great but I'm out here practicing until

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.690 
great but I'm out here practicing until
I<00:01:12.200> could<00:01:12.620> be<00:01:12.710> comfortable<00:01:13.100> taking<00:01:13.220> Jane<00:01:13.550> two

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
I could be comfortable taking Jane two

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.050 
I could be comfortable taking Jane two
apart<00:01:17.320> hey<00:01:18.320> yo<00:01:18.500> I'm<00:01:18.620> back<00:01:18.830> got<00:01:19.280> a<00:01:19.310> good<00:01:19.490> good

target<00:01:20.330> here<00:01:21.250> very<00:01:22.250> consistent<00:01:22.910> running<00:01:23.570> an

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
target here very consistent running an

target here very consistent running an
all-metal<00:01:23.960> mode<00:01:25.180> it's<00:01:26.180> in<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.330> iron<00:01:26.480> range

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.780 

Jane<00:01:30.050> does<00:01:30.230> not<00:01:30.380> have<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.560> depth<00:01:30.860> indicator<00:01:31.040> so

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
Jane does not have a depth indicator so

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.220 
Jane does not have a depth indicator so
one<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.120> things<00:01:32.180> I've<00:01:32.600> been<00:01:32.720> trying<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.020> do

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
one of the things I've been trying to do

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.620 
one of the things I've been trying to do
is<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.250> judge<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:34.880> dip<00:01:35.060> by<00:01:35.240> lifting<00:01:35.480> at<00:01:35.600> the

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
is to judge the dip by lifting at the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.380 
is to judge the dip by lifting at the
coil<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.700> seeing<00:01:37.700> how<00:01:37.820> high<00:01:37.970> off<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.210> ground

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
coil and seeing how high off the ground

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.920 
coil and seeing how high off the ground
the<00:01:38.570> signal<00:01:38.900> stops<00:01:41.260> that's<00:01:42.260> been<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:43.810> well<00:01:44.810> if

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
the signal stops that's been a well if

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.900 
the signal stops that's been a well if
had<00:01:45.020> mixed<00:01:45.200> results<00:01:45.380> with<00:01:45.620> that<00:01:45.830> nine<00:01:46.640> inches

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
had mixed results with that nine inches

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.930 
had mixed results with that nine inches
off<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.090> ground<00:01:47.210> is<00:01:47.480> probably<00:01:47.870> a<00:01:47.960> can<00:01:48.850> do<00:01:49.850> you

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
off the ground is probably a can do you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.570 
off the ground is probably a can do you
inches<00:01:50.180> off<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.330> ground<00:01:50.450> could<00:01:50.780> be<00:01:50.900> anything

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
inches off the ground could be anything

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.270 
inches off the ground could be anything
or<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.640> could<00:01:52.790> be<00:01:52.820> something<00:01:52.940> deep<00:01:54.280> alright

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
or it could be something deep alright

things I'm trying to do is learn how to
