00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 Welcome to my drive 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.120
 deck profile of our decks we ours 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.700
 17 round with volume 7 had played 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.170
 and first we go over the android 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.150
 cover that he zusammengerottet 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.740
 cards finally came again 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.960
 little choice what you can play 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.539
 or because really nice times have something 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.480
 you changed 2 dd warriors are 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.430
 entered because witch and engaged 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.960
 represent very beautiful lips very beautiful 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.720
 professions because then they do not even hesitate 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.460
 not yes and otherwise a bit something that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.769
 triggers villages on gaia so after the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 motto is a white magic hat 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.930
 gone out because just now the de 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.480
 warrior came to it and nothing more 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.350
 so many weak monsters are there and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.219
 that means he really has to go straight 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.680
 attack 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.440
 then I took out a jacobo 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.960
 I've done a new one because 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.489
 you can search for me 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.250
 maybe I would have done the second 1 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.899
 that's great because you just keep nautica 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.010
 can fall if you want one of them 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.120
 can mainly be because you look at the on 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.949
 take the hand and as you can times 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.510
 to stop writing is not that way 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.100
 I would say a bad dealer 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.870
 then I do not know if I am in front of the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.350
 he has been nursing 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.220
 have been in every case now 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.110
 maybe I would have second 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.260
 desired because of the number of years to fall 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.180
 yes, because with the here with now 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.080
 Forster has come out now you have 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.439
 one that you actually meet 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.759
 can not know that is yes and 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.920
 I have a black hole once 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.430
 taken out because just now mirror 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.860
 is powerful there and actually better 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.630
 is mirrored force ruled for it 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.070
 opponents for toys already and then 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.470
 you have free field for next too 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.299
 afford and if the opponent receives that 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.670
 not expected yes then the two are 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.159
 event groups walked out because mirror 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.570
 power is better and you have also last 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.520
 thrown out because it's easy on the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.079
 friday a very hard card that that 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.640
 falsifies that a bit of fear that 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.509
 everything 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.000
 otherwise you would probably this 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.430
 map definitely on what he is 23 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.470
 play because they like that all carriers 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.840
 would rather like we have here the 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.570
 Unfortunately, ignore them because they are not 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.430
 completely works like life like that 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.950
 then let's take a quick look at my new ones 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.759
 version that's the one here and I think so 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.780
 I hardly of it 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.220
 I'm still in geneva 3 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.840
 hard on tuesday i only have one canon 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.950
 soldier is just as searchable and with 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.530
 belt can be brought out again 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.730
 but also built two ddr because I 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.760
 can be more and the witch 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.230
 Neat on the biscuit is still going on 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.180
 three white magic about that is for me 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.580
 the strongest one bank card actually 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.200
 with the set so far in our pool 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.660
 inside is because she actually stops plus 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.610
 makes in this opponent - pure skin and 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.200
 Hold all male cards out lured 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.430
 with the thing gone is that actually 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.569
 my but the first card you 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.160
 so wants to have the opponent in 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.340
 to bring distress 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.750
 I chained a song and 2 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.400
 face or one I do not know now how 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.480
 had for you because I wanted 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.830
 have a bit more space for the new ones 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.560
 cards that came in are there I have 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.660
 including corridor packed because 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.730
 he bravely stops as one can 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.739
 you do not see him coming when 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.900
 you did not add that with lucio 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.600
 can be with it and can stop it 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.760
 like to stop and I have triple h 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.080
 played better because I knew only on 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.459
 The end of the track team is really strong 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.100
 and I did not know if you were too 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.230
 trap hoss plays therefore i said 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.819
 I pack three times has the cela 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.019
 there purely because I go fuel biscuit 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.660
 or October at once again with the 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.380
 heavy agreement weighted job 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.760
 decided for it 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.350
 I had one at the last moment 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.440
 I had played around before 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.220
 topping there probably had it in but then 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.510
 me again from the boku 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.280
 decided to put more trades 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.860
 Can the country know the thing out and 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.120
 if you play less or hold that 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.890
 it is possible to intercept decisive 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.750
 all right because they have a generalist because 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.380
 he wanted to chained one day again 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.269
 not playing 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.310
 and yes in the jobs I have now only 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.480
 still the drummer beech and thrice fund 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.109
 because they are much more flexible 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.780
 are stronger 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.390
 I think as a trap we want it now 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.829
 Lots of fleet running around and that brings 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.140
 then nothing a higher four seasons 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.489
 turned back because you are too 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.220
 Several monster churches can 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.470
 otherwise I do not think so 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.930
 big chained in rome archives at the 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.180
 cards are too slow now it is seen 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.680
 things are always purely important 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.640
 this will not steal the map 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.189
 because one of them knew then leads 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.599
 This is usually the end of it 

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.560
 known among them can still be quite 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.989
 she can still come out well 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.010
 Add with one of the floater must 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.440
 but then be sure that the opponent 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.959
 Already all power cards used what 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.060
 mostly not the case and yes one 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.850
 trekkie card yes that was ours 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.650
 penultimate duel and do a lot 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.169
 we still booster 7 I hope there are 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.270
 there are still cards in the card 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.310
 can add 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.190
 and yes let's see how the last one 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.620
 will be times when we are once again the 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.660
 whole duel do it again again yet 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.669
 make a back profile art thing 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.720
 and next video will do it 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.320
 but accordingly again 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.020
 next videos announced and now 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.009
 meanwhile also with the change is 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.000
 however, that would be true anyway 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.490
 a bit critical in 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.570
 future or because then the whole 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.370
 rowlings that are completely different than 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.470
 at that time probably with cards 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.490
 how cars imperator rachel loses 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.259
 his greatest strength 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.310
 that's exactly what you have after that comes something like 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.690
 with the last sake we are at present 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.070
 already here you have that stop 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.510
 compromise must be something not so 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.800
 nice there would have to be cards with vip 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.169
 then you could play there you can 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.330
 Do whatever you want so that was ours 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.620
 small cover case now our next 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.550
 I hope you liked it and we did 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.240
 See you next time 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.240
 bye bye
