video<00:00:07.290> we're<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.710> be<00:00:07.770> looking<00:00:07.890> at<00:00:08.100> how

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
video we're going to be looking at how

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.840 
video we're going to be looking at how
to<00:00:08.430> make<00:00:08.670> your<00:00:08.940> blender<00:00:09.450> render<00:00:09.810> stream<00:00:10.710> or<00:00:11.220> at

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.850 
to make your blender render stream or at

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.160 
to make your blender render stream or at
least<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.120> my<00:00:12.240> case<00:00:12.510> if<00:00:12.720> you<00:00:12.810> have<00:00:12.930> a<00:00:12.960> crappy

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
least in my case if you have a crappy

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.860 
least in my case if you have a crappy
computer<00:00:13.910> at<00:00:14.910> least<00:00:15.090> go<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.240> little<00:00:15.360> bit<00:00:15.540> faster

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
computer at least go a little bit faster

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.100 
computer at least go a little bit faster
than<00:00:16.020> what<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.260> did<00:00:16.379> before<00:00:16.880> ok<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.450> right<00:00:18.960> now

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
than what it did before ok so right now

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.020 
than what it did before ok so right now
I'm<00:00:19.200> using<00:00:19.230> blender<00:00:19.710> 2.66<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.580> which<00:00:20.790> is<00:00:20.940> the

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.030 
I'm using blender 2.66 a which is the

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.620 
I'm using blender 2.66 a which is the
latest<00:00:21.330> at<00:00:21.660> least<00:00:21.870> right<00:00:22.200> now<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:23.630> first

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
latest at least right now and first

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.359 
latest at least right now and first
thing<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:24.870> gonna<00:00:24.960> talk<00:00:25.140> about<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:26.190> you're

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
thing we gonna talk about is what you're

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.230 
thing we gonna talk about is what you're
using<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.760> render<00:00:27.600> your<00:00:27.780> images<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:29.240> blender

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
using to render your images in blender

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.200 
using to render your images in blender
are<00:00:30.600> using<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> cycles<00:00:31.530> render<00:00:31.740> or<00:00:32.129> are<00:00:32.759> you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
are using the cycles render or are you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.160 
are using the cycles render or are you
using<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.660> blender<00:00:34.020> render<00:00:34.410> internal<00:00:35.070> engine

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
using the blender render internal engine

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.810 
using the blender render internal engine
if<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.410> are<00:00:37.590> using<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.250> blender<00:00:38.670> render

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
if you are using the blender render

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.750 
if you are using the blender render
internal<00:00:39.420> engine<00:00:39.720> it's<00:00:40.620> already<00:00:41.130> optimized

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
internal engine it's already optimized

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.330 
internal engine it's already optimized
pretty<00:00:42.570> much<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> fastest<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.040> get

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
pretty much for the fastest you can get

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.889 
pretty much for the fastest you can get
I<00:00:44.520> mean<00:00:44.730> there<00:00:44.850> are<00:00:44.910> some<00:00:45.210> things<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.720> do

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I mean there are some things you can do

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.930 
I mean there are some things you can do
but<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.220> great<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:47.610> about<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
but that's the great thing about the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.819 
but that's the great thing about the
blender<00:00:48.239> render<00:00:48.420> internal<00:00:48.960> engine<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.649> is

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
blender render internal engine is it is

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.900 
blender render internal engine is it is
extremely<00:00:49.950> fast

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
extremely fast

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.639 
extremely fast
the<00:00:51.329> downside<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.950> as<00:00:53.370> good<00:00:54.239> as

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
the downside is it's not as good as

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.510 
the downside is it's not as good as
render<00:00:55.649> as<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.890> would<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.190> out<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
render as you would get out of the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.369 
render as you would get out of the
cycles<00:00:56.940> render<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> whole

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
cycles render and that's the whole

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.290 
cycles render and that's the whole
reason<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.010> cycles<00:00:59.370> render<00:00:59.489> engine<00:01:00.149> is

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
reason for the cycles render engine is

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.489 
reason for the cycles render engine is
is<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.930> get<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.200> quality<00:01:03.199> so<00:01:04.199> basically

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:04.499 
is to get that quality so basically

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:05.959 
is to get that quality so basically
we're<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.249> to<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.369> talking<00:01:05.609> about<00:01:05.759> the

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969 
we're going to be talking about the

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:11.300 
we're going to be talking about the
cycles<00:01:06.389> render<00:01:08.389> cycles<00:01:09.709> when<00:01:10.709> when<00:01:11.009> cycles

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
cycles render cycles when when cycles

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.539 
cycles render cycles when when cycles
came<00:01:11.459> out<00:01:11.639> because<00:01:12.359> cycles<00:01:13.109> is<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.469> more<00:01:14.009> set

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
came out because cycles is is more set

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.660 
came out because cycles is is more set
to<00:01:14.579> the<00:01:15.450> quality<00:01:15.899> of<00:01:16.200> rendering<00:01:16.889> you<00:01:17.549> know

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to the quality of rendering you know

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.429 
to the quality of rendering you know
there's<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.969> lot<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.149> a<00:01:18.600> lot<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.139> complaining

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
there's a lot of a lot of complaining

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.379 
there's a lot of a lot of complaining
that<00:01:19.649> was<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.039> about<00:01:20.340> oh<00:01:20.579> it<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.060> takes

00:01:21.379 --> 00:01:21.389 
that was going on about oh it so takes

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:23.809 
that was going on about oh it so takes
so<00:01:21.600> long<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.380> render<00:01:22.799> anything<00:01:23.069> and<00:01:23.429> that's

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
so long to render anything and that's

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:25.940 
so long to render anything and that's
why<00:01:24.029> I<00:01:24.060> held<00:01:24.450> off<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.840> long<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.770> to

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
why I held off so long on going to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.249 
why I held off so long on going to
cycles<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.609> because<00:01:26.999> when<00:01:27.179> I<00:01:27.209> try<00:01:27.929> it<00:01:27.990> it's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
cycles is because when I try it it's

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.039 
cycles is because when I try it it's
like<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.279> took<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.819> long<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.869> there

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
like you know it took so long but there

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.109 
like you know it took so long but there
are<00:01:31.200> things<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.490> order<00:01:32.969> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
are things that you can do in order to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.499 
are things that you can do in order to
speed<00:01:33.539> up<00:01:33.569> your<00:01:33.719> renders<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.119> first<00:01:36.329> thing

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
speed up your renders so the first thing

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.389 
speed up your renders so the first thing
that<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.719> want<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:36.990> talk<00:01:37.109> about<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
that we want to talk about is the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.910 
that we want to talk about is the
hardware<00:01:38.959> like<00:01:39.959> I<00:01:40.109> said<00:01:40.289> my<00:01:40.409> computer<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
hardware like I said my computer is

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.879 
hardware like I said my computer is
crappy<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.209> once<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.659> get<00:01:42.719> upgraded<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:43.889 
crappy and once I get upgraded one of

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:46.099 
crappy and once I get upgraded one of
these<00:01:44.009> days<00:01:44.249> then<00:01:45.029> I'll<00:01:45.299> get<00:01:45.479> better<00:01:45.659> renders

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
these days then I'll get better renders

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.879 
these days then I'll get better renders
so<00:01:46.939> number<00:01:47.939> one<00:01:48.289> make<00:01:49.289> sure<00:01:49.319> you<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.740> an

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
so number one make sure you have an

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.339 
so number one make sure you have an
upgraded<00:01:50.249> computer<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.880> course<00:01:50.939> if<00:01:51.719> you<00:01:52.109> can

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
upgraded computer of course if you can

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:55.129 
upgraded computer of course if you can
and<00:01:52.679> then<00:01:53.369> number<00:01:53.669> two<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.179> your<00:01:54.599> video<00:01:54.749> card

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
and then number two is your video card

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:58.339 
and then number two is your video card
so<00:01:55.349> if<00:01:55.619> we<00:01:55.740> look<00:01:55.919> at<00:01:56.130> file<00:01:56.659> user<00:01:57.659> preferences

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
so if we look at file user preferences

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.249 
so if we look at file user preferences
and<00:01:58.590> then<00:01:59.039> in<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.249> system<00:01:59.639> settings<00:02:00.109> look<00:02:01.109> at

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and then in the system settings look at

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.069 
and then in the system settings look at
this<00:02:01.469> area<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.549> where<00:02:02.669> the<00:02:03.179> compute<00:02:03.840> device

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
this area here where the compute device

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.919 
this area here where the compute device
is<00:02:04.289> this<00:02:04.529> is<00:02:04.709> your<00:02:04.979> video<00:02:05.159> card<00:02:05.520> setup<00:02:05.909> if<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
is this is your video card setup if it

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.139 
is this is your video card setup if it
says<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.590> CPU<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.430> you<00:02:08.550> can't<00:02:08.820> select

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
says just CPU and you can't select

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.230 
says just CPU and you can't select
anything<00:02:09.420> else<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.530> means<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.580> you

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
anything else then that means that you

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.730 
anything else then that means that you
probably<00:02:12.270> don't<00:02:12.990> have<00:02:13.110> a

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
as you can see mine is the GeForce GTX

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.430 
as you can see mine is the GeForce GTX
650<00:02:26.240> not<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.390> greatest<00:02:27.660> card<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.230> world

650 not the greatest card in the world

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.850 
650 not the greatest card in the world
but<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:28.860> something<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.670> recently<00:02:30.860> went

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
but it's something that I recently went

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.010 
but it's something that I recently went
out<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.220> got<00:02:32.310> an<00:02:32.460> Nvidia<00:02:32.880> card<00:02:33.210> because<00:02:33.660> I

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
out and got an Nvidia card because I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.780 
out and got an Nvidia card because I
needed<00:02:34.680> something<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.220> supported<00:02:35.700> the

needed something that supported the
cycles<00:02:36.150> render<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.770> at<00:02:37.770> least<00:02:37.950> so<00:02:38.190> far<00:02:38.220> you

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
cycles render and at least so far you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.760 
cycles render and at least so far you
know<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.270> don't<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.960> quickest<00:02:40.500> render

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
know I don't have the quickest render

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.040 
know I don't have the quickest render
times<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.220> world<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.850> it's<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.930> know

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.820 
times in the world because it's you know
kind<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.890> low-end<00:02:44.340> card<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:45.690> I<00:02:46.020> am<00:02:46.500> enjoying

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
kind of a low-end card but I am enjoying

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.530 
kind of a low-end card but I am enjoying
much<00:02:47.190> quicker<00:02:47.430> renders<00:02:47.850> than<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.090> was<00:02:48.270> getting

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
much quicker renders than I was getting

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.920 
much quicker renders than I was getting
which<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.870> my<00:02:49.050> CPU<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.420> that's<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.750> first

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
which is my CPU so that's the first

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.220 
which is my CPU so that's the first
thing<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.290> have<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.680> get<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.460> GPU<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.480> graphics

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
thing you have to get a GPU a graphics

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.100 
thing you have to get a GPU a graphics
card<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:56.190> supports<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:57.390> cycles<00:02:57.810> blender

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
card that supports the cycles blender

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.990 
card that supports the cycles blender
render<00:02:59.120> and<00:03:00.120> once<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.020> have<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.260> set<00:03:01.320> there

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
render and once you have that set there

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.850 
render and once you have that set there
if<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.180> go<00:03:03.330> to<00:03:03.390> your<00:03:03.600> render<00:03:03.840> settings<00:03:04.230> you

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
if you go to your render settings you

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.140 
if you go to your render settings you
want<00:03:05.040> them<00:03:05.160> also<00:03:05.400> make<00:03:05.580> sure<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.000> turn

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
want them also make sure that you turn

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.360 
want them also make sure that you turn
your<00:03:06.210> device<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.990> this<00:03:07.110> GPU<00:03:07.650> compute<00:03:08.130> device

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
your device to this GPU compute device

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.360 
your device to this GPU compute device
versus<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.150> CPU<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.770> think<00:03:10.950> they<00:03:11.040> did<00:03:11.100> that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
versus the CPU and I think they did that

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.100 
versus the CPU and I think they did that
just<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.700> give<00:03:11.850> you<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.060> option<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:12.870> you

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
just to give you the option if you

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.950 
just to give you the option if you
wanted<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.590> render<00:03:14.070> them<00:03:14.160> with<00:03:14.280> your<00:03:14.400> CPU

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
wanted to render them with your CPU

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.290 
wanted to render them with your CPU
using<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.080> blender<00:03:16.350> internal<00:03:16.620> engine<00:03:17.300> okay

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
using the blender internal engine okay

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.170 
using the blender internal engine okay
so<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:19.680> that<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.340> main<00:03:20.520> thing<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:20.970> think

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
so that that is the main thing I think

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.460 
so that that is the main thing I think
that<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.450> need<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.600> look<00:03:21.750> at<00:03:21.960> when<00:03:22.320> you're

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
that you need to look at when you're

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.080 
that you need to look at when you're
talking<00:03:22.920> about<00:03:22.980> speeding<00:03:23.520> up<00:03:23.640> your<00:03:23.790> rendering

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090

we're going to look at rendering the

we're going to look at rendering the

best<00:03:59.820> thing<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.570> can<00:04:00.930> do<00:04:01.110> on<00:04:01.370> mine<00:04:02.370> and

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
best thing that I can do on mine and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.720 
best thing that I can do on mine and
what<00:04:04.050> what<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.440> tiles<00:04:04.680> are<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.130> that<00:04:05.160> when<00:04:05.580> you

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
what what the tiles are is that when you

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.010 
what what the tiles are is that when you
render<00:04:06.090> something<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:06.690> see<00:04:06.840> those

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
render something and you see those

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.800 
render something and you see those
little<00:04:07.110> boxes<00:04:07.380> build<00:04:07.920> your<00:04:08.240> your<00:04:09.240> render

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
little boxes build your your render

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.199 
little boxes build your your render
those<00:04:10.470> are<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:10.860> tiles<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.970> wouldn't

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
those are the tiles and you wouldn't

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.640 
those are the tiles and you wouldn't
think<00:04:12.270> it<00:04:12.390> matters<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:12.930> much<00:04:13.080> but<00:04:13.440> actually

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
think it matters that much but actually

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.000 
think it matters that much but actually
it<00:04:13.920> does<00:04:14.100> help<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:15.690> so<00:04:16.140> when<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.440> rendered<00:04:16.770> mine

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
it does help and so when I rendered mine

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.970 
it does help and so when I rendered mine
this<00:04:17.940> is<00:04:18.000> what<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.330> got<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.170> a<00:04:19.590> spaceship

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
this is what I got this is a spaceship

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.229 
this is what I got this is a spaceship
that<00:04:20.040> I've<00:04:20.280> been<00:04:20.430> working<00:04:20.730> on<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.120> the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
that I've been working on this is the

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.200 
that I've been working on this is the
rear<00:04:21.420> view<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:23.250> this<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:23.700> image<00:04:24.030> is

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
rear view and this this image is

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.810 
rear view and this this image is
actually<00:04:25.040> we<00:04:26.040> go<00:04:26.160> back<00:04:26.340> up<00:04:26.490> here<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.760> look

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
actually we go back up here and look

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.530 
actually we go back up here and look
it's<00:04:27.030> 19

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
it's 19

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.910 
it's 19
my<00:04:27.870> 1280<00:04:28.730> at<00:04:29.730> 100%<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.930> when<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:31.470> rendered<00:04:31.800> it

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
my 1280 at 100% and when I rendered it

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.130 
my 1280 at 100% and when I rendered it
at<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.460> was<00:04:32.730> it<00:04:33.090> was<00:04:33.210> at<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.600> this<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.810> the

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
at that I was it was at and this is the

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.300 
at that I was it was at and this is the
other<00:04:34.230> tip<00:04:34.530> by<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.800> way<00:04:34.950> this<00:04:35.100> is<00:04:35.280> a

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
other tip by the way this is a

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.500 
other tip by the way this is a
resolution<00:04:35.880> size<00:04:37.190> 1925<00:04:38.190> 1280<00:04:38.610> rendered<00:04:39.000> in

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
resolution size 1925 1280 rendered in

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.690 
resolution size 1925 1280 rendered in
just<00:04:39.840> over<00:04:40.080> seven<00:04:40.380> minutes<00:04:40.680> when<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.430> change

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
just over seven minutes when I change

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.380 
just over seven minutes when I change
this<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:41.910> seven<00:04:42.360> our<00:04:42.900> 1280<00:04:43.440> by<00:04:43.650> 720<00:04:44.210> then<00:04:45.210> it

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
this to seven our 1280 by 720 then it

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.420 
this to seven our 1280 by 720 then it
rendered<00:04:45.690> just<00:04:46.200> over<00:04:46.410> three<00:04:46.620> minutes<00:04:46.920> and

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
rendered just over three minutes and

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.460 
rendered just over three minutes and
also<00:04:47.910> of<00:04:48.420> course<00:04:48.660> if<00:04:48.840> you're<00:04:48.960> doing<00:04:48.990> just<00:04:49.200> like

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
also of course if you're doing just like

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.780 
also of course if you're doing just like
a<00:04:49.500> preview<00:04:49.920> or<00:04:49.980> something<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.460> can<00:04:50.610> knock

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
a preview or something you can knock

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.350 
a preview or something you can knock
down<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.150> percentage<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.780> render<00:04:52.080> and

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
down the percentage of the render and

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.810 
down the percentage of the render and
when<00:04:54.360> I<00:04:54.390> did<00:04:54.600> that<00:04:54.720> 50%<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:56.040> rendered<00:04:56.520> out<00:04:56.640> at

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
when I did that 50% it rendered out at

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.940 
when I did that 50% it rendered out at
just<00:04:57.390> under<00:04:57.480> a<00:04:57.660> minute<00:04:57.960> so<00:04:58.260> it's<00:04:58.770> really

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
just under a minute so it's really

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.950 
just under a minute so it's really
depends<00:04:59.700> as<00:04:59.850> far<00:05:00.060> as<00:05:00.120> a<00:05:00.180> resolution<00:05:00.420> on<00:05:00.780> what

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
depends as far as a resolution on what

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.790 
depends as far as a resolution on what
you're<00:05:01.110> trying<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.500> achieve<00:05:02.070> with<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.640> render

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
you're trying to achieve with the render

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.920 
you're trying to achieve with the render
so<00:05:04.800> that's<00:05:05.340> another<00:05:06.000> tip<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:09.510> fourth<00:05:09.720> thing

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
so that's another tip the fourth thing

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.320 
so that's another tip the fourth thing
is<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.710> number<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.160> samples<00:05:11.430> when<00:05:12.210> you're

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
is the number of samples when you're

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.000 
is the number of samples when you're
doing<00:05:12.540> cycles<00:05:12.960> render<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.680> have<00:05:13.830> these

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
doing cycles render you have these

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.890 
doing cycles render you have these
samples<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:16.730> mine<00:05:17.730> set<00:05:18.120> at<00:05:18.150> a<00:05:18.300> thousand<00:05:18.780> is

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
samples and mine set at a thousand is

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.230 
samples and mine set at a thousand is
not<00:05:19.590> really<00:05:20.040> high<00:05:20.340> enough<00:05:20.610> but<00:05:20.790> just<00:05:20.940> didn't

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
not really high enough but just didn't

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.440 
not really high enough but just didn't
you<00:05:21.870> know<00:05:21.990> to<00:05:22.650> do<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:22.980> time<00:05:23.670> testing<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.180> set<00:05:24.360> it

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
you know to do the time testing I set it

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.830 
you know to do the time testing I set it
to<00:05:24.540> a<00:05:24.570> thousand<00:05:25.430> if<00:05:26.430> you<00:05:26.640> don't<00:05:26.910> say<00:05:27.510> say<00:05:27.780> if

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
to a thousand if you don't say say if

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.230 
to a thousand if you don't say say if
you<00:05:27.930> have<00:05:28.050> like<00:05:28.230> I<00:05:28.740> don't<00:05:29.310> know<00:05:29.490> five<00:05:29.790> thousand

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
you have like I don't know five thousand

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.360 
you have like I don't know five thousand
or<00:05:30.360> something<00:05:30.720> if<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:31.800> find<00:05:32.010> that<00:05:32.100> you're

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
or something if you find that you're

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.830 
or something if you find that you're
doing<00:05:32.580> five<00:05:32.790> thousand<00:05:33.270> and<00:05:33.420> then<00:05:33.540> you'd<00:05:33.660> bump

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
doing five thousand and then you'd bump

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.630 
doing five thousand and then you'd bump
it<00:05:33.990> down<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.290> three<00:05:34.500> thousand<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.160> it's<00:05:35.340> given

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
it down to three thousand and it's given

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.550 
it down to three thousand and it's given
giving<00:05:35.970> you<00:05:36.090> basically<00:05:36.660> the<00:05:36.780> same<00:05:36.960> result<00:05:37.380> and

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
giving you basically the same result and

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.930 
giving you basically the same result and
you<00:05:37.620> can't<00:05:37.830> really<00:05:38.070> see<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.250> difference<00:05:38.430> then

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
you can't really see a difference then

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.900 
you can't really see a difference then
why<00:05:39.150> you<00:05:39.750> know<00:05:39.870> why<00:05:40.050> haven't<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:40.530> so<00:05:41.490> you<00:05:41.550> can

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
why you know why haven't I so you can

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.640 
why you know why haven't I so you can
knock<00:05:42.060> down<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.390> samples<00:05:42.840> just<00:05:43.080> just<00:05:43.440> find

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
knock down the samples just just find

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.930 
knock down the samples just just find
that<00:05:43.830> area<00:05:44.280> where<00:05:45.120> it<00:05:45.360> works<00:05:45.600> for<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.730> type<00:05:47.730> of

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
that area where it works for the type of

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.340 
that area where it works for the type of
you<00:05:48.240> know<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.420> quality<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.870> the<00:05:48.960> render<00:05:49.200> that

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
you know the quality of the render that

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.760 
you know the quality of the render that
you<00:05:49.470> need<00:05:49.700> so<00:05:50.700> that's<00:05:50.880> another<00:05:51.210> way<00:05:51.420> to<00:05:51.770> to

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
you need so that's another way to to

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.960 
you need so that's another way to to
speed<00:05:52.980> up<00:05:53.130> your<00:05:53.160> renders<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:54.870> last<00:05:55.760> way<00:05:56.760> that

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
speed up your renders the last way that

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.230 
speed up your renders the last way that
I'd<00:05:57.090> like<00:05:57.270> to<00:05:57.300> talk<00:05:57.540> about<00:05:57.930> is<00:05:58.850> if<00:05:59.850> you<00:05:59.970> go<00:06:00.180> to

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
I'd like to talk about is if you go to

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.650 
I'd like to talk about is if you go to
your<00:06:00.840> world<00:06:01.140> settings<00:06:01.820> there's<00:06:02.820> this<00:06:03.210> ambient

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
your world settings there's this ambient

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.520 
your world settings there's this ambient
occlusion<00:06:03.840> here<00:06:04.350> which<00:06:04.560> I<00:06:04.680> use<00:06:04.890> quite<00:06:05.130> a<00:06:05.190> bit

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
occlusion here which I use quite a bit

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.680 
occlusion here which I use quite a bit
and<00:06:07.530> it<00:06:08.100> helps<00:06:08.520> you<00:06:08.730> know<00:06:08.850> define<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.300> shadows

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
and it helps you know define the shadows

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.300 
and it helps you know define the shadows
in<00:06:10.020> your<00:06:10.080> render<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:10.620> it<00:06:10.710> looks<00:06:10.860> really<00:06:10.980> nice

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
in your render and it looks really nice

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.030 
in your render and it looks really nice
and<00:06:11.580> everything<00:06:11.750> but<00:06:12.750> again<00:06:13.620> if<00:06:13.770> you're<00:06:13.890> doing

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
and everything but again if you're doing

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.010 
and everything but again if you're doing
like<00:06:14.190> a<00:06:14.250> preview<00:06:14.700> or<00:06:14.820> something<00:06:15.210> or<00:06:15.390> if<00:06:15.630> it's

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
like a preview or something or if it's

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.690 
like a preview or something or if it's
not<00:06:16.170> really<00:06:16.410> needed<00:06:16.710> in<00:06:16.830> the<00:06:16.950> render<00:06:17.250> then

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
not really needed in the render then

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.140 
not really needed in the render then
just<00:06:17.910> turn<00:06:18.060> it<00:06:18.180> off<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:19.790> that's<00:06:20.790> pretty<00:06:21.030> much

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
just turn it off and that's pretty much

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.790 
just turn it off and that's pretty much
it<00:06:21.390> I<00:06:21.420> mean<00:06:21.660> those<00:06:21.810> are<00:06:21.960> some<00:06:22.200> quick<00:06:22.380> tips<00:06:22.440> that

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
it I mean those are some quick tips that

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.370 
it I mean those are some quick tips that
you<00:06:23.040> can<00:06:23.190> use<00:06:23.640> in<00:06:24.570> order<00:06:24.720> to<00:06:24.840> speed<00:06:25.200> up<00:06:25.230> your

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
you can use in order to speed up your

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.170 
you can use in order to speed up your
cycles<00:06:25.890> render<00:06:26.040> I'm<00:06:26.580> going<00:06:26.730> to<00:06:26.790> give<00:06:26.910> you<00:06:27.000> two

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
cycles render I'm going to give you two

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.290 
cycles render I'm going to give you two
lengths<00:06:27.570> so<00:06:27.780> the<00:06:28.230> first<00:06:28.440> one<00:06:28.680> is<00:06:28.980> a<00:06:29.490> link<00:06:30.000> to

graphics card you can have all kinds of
different<00:07:00.330> configurations<00:07:00.450> so<00:07:01.080> what<00:07:01.230> I<00:07:01.260> did

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 
different configurations so what I did

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.570 
different configurations so what I did
is<00:07:01.800> I<00:07:02.640> looked<00:07:02.850> at<00:07:02.940> this<00:07:03.030> dis<00:07:03.690> forum<00:07:04.200> and<00:07:04.580> seeing

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
is I looked at this dis forum and seeing

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.850 
is I looked at this dis forum and seeing
what<00:07:05.730> the<00:07:05.820> different<00:07:06.140> configurations<00:07:07.140> were

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 
what the different configurations were

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.070 
what the different configurations were
found<00:07:08.700> something<00:07:09.120> that<00:07:09.360> was<00:07:09.600> similar<00:07:09.840> to<00:07:09.990> mine

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
found something that was similar to mine

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.190 
found something that was similar to mine
and<00:07:10.670> just<00:07:11.670> kind<00:07:12.300> of<00:07:12.390> compare<00:07:12.690> the<00:07:12.720> different

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200 
and just kind of compare the different

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.930 
and just kind of compare the different
graphics<00:07:13.530> cards<00:07:14.010> that<00:07:14.160> people<00:07:14.280> were<00:07:14.490> using

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
graphics cards that people were using

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.180 
graphics cards that people were using
and<00:07:15.180> then<00:07:16.110> went<00:07:16.380> and<00:07:16.410> got<00:07:16.560> a<00:07:16.620> graphics<00:07:16.980> card

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190 
and then went and got a graphics card

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.160 
and then went and got a graphics card
that<00:07:17.220> I<00:07:17.340> could<00:07:17.550> for<00:07:17.790> basically<00:07:18.330> for<00:07:18.690> my<00:07:18.780> system

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.170 
that I could for basically for my system

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.050 
that I could for basically for my system
so<00:07:19.710> it'll<00:07:19.920> give<00:07:20.070> you<00:07:20.220> at<00:07:20.520> least<00:07:20.670> to<00:07:20.790> give<00:07:20.970> you

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 
so it'll give you at least to give you

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.570 
so it'll give you at least to give you
an<00:07:21.180> idea<00:07:21.330> of<00:07:21.930> what<00:07:22.740> other<00:07:22.860> people<00:07:23.190> are<00:07:23.220> using

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
an idea of what other people are using

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.400 
an idea of what other people are using
in<00:07:23.700> in<00:07:24.060> the<00:07:24.240> render<00:07:24.840> times<00:07:25.080> that<00:07:25.290> they're

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.410 
in in the render times that they're

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.440 
in in the render times that they're
getting<00:07:25.680> and<00:07:26.010> give<00:07:26.880> you<00:07:26.970> an<00:07:27.030> idea<00:07:27.150> what<00:07:27.420> kind

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:27.450 
getting and give you an idea what kind

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.330 
getting and give you an idea what kind
of<00:07:27.660> card<00:07:27.930> you<00:07:27.990> need<00:07:28.170> if<00:07:28.290> you<00:07:28.380> want<00:07:28.560> to<00:07:28.620> go<00:07:28.770> go

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.250 
get a different card okay so I hope you

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.370
