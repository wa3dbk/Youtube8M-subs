when you sew your side seams the stripes

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:54.320 
when you sew your side seams the stripes
will<00:03:45.660> kind<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:45.990> match<00:03:46.230> up<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:53.210> then<00:03:54.210> you're

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
will kind of match up and then you're

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.060 
will kind of match up and then you're
just<00:03:54.360> going<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.660> pin<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.650> all<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:55.980> way

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
just going to pin that all the way

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.620 
just going to pin that all the way
around<00:03:56.100> just<00:03:56.520> kind<00:03:56.910> of<00:03:56.940> hold<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.240> together<00:03:57.390> for

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
around just kind of hold it together for

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:05.630 
around just kind of hold it together for
the<00:03:57.990> next<00:03:58.110> step<00:04:04.130> so<00:04:05.130> now<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.340> are<00:04:05.400> going<00:04:05.520> to<00:04:05.550> take

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
the next step so now I are going to take

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.060 
the next step so now I are going to take
your<00:04:05.880> candy<00:04:06.240> corn<00:04:06.480> pattern<00:04:07.050> piece<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.620> using

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
your candy corn pattern piece and using

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.680 
your candy corn pattern piece and using
the<00:04:08.190> guidelines<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:08.820> I<00:04:08.970> have<00:04:09.210> on<00:04:09.360> there<00:04:09.540> you

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
the guidelines that I have on there you

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.500 
the guidelines that I have on there you
can<00:04:09.750> use<00:04:10.080> those<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.470> line<00:04:10.680> up<00:04:11.000> on<00:04:12.000> your<00:04:12.180> seams

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
can use those to line up on your seams

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.690 
can use those to line up on your seams
where<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.900> colors<00:04:13.230> connect<00:04:13.770> so<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.310> want<00:04:14.610> to

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
where the colors connect so you want to

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.670 
where the colors connect so you want to
have<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:15.420> tip<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.810> candy<00:04:16.140> corn<00:04:16.350> in<00:04:16.590> the

up<00:04:21.480> we're<00:04:21.600> just<00:04:21.750> going<00:04:21.870> to<00:04:21.930> pin<00:04:22.140> that<00:04:22.290> down

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.809 

and<00:04:30.169> once<00:04:30.889> you<00:04:31.009> have<00:04:31.159> that<00:04:31.189> pin<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.759> your

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
fabric pieces you can either trace

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.860 
fabric pieces you can either trace
directly<00:04:34.189> around<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.789> candy<00:04:35.120> corn<00:04:35.300> piece<00:04:35.599> or

directly around the candy corn piece or
you<00:04:36.139> can<00:04:36.349> so<00:04:36.710> directly<00:04:37.189> around<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.759> which<00:04:38.389> is

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
you can so directly around it which is

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:39.700 
you can so directly around it which is
what<00:04:38.689> i'm<00:04:38.780> going<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:38.960> do<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.379> where<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.530> have

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710

those<00:04:39.860> two<00:04:40.099> dark<00:04:40.550> colored<00:04:40.849> pins<00:04:41.289> you<00:04:42.289> are

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
those two dark colored pins you are

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.439 
those two dark colored pins you are
going<00:04:42.979> to<00:04:43.039> leave<00:04:43.189> that<00:04:43.219> open<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:44.090> turn<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
going to leave that open to turn the

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.369 
going to leave that open to turn the
whole<00:04:44.569> thing<00:04:44.599> inside<00:04:45.020> out<00:04:45.199> later<00:04:45.409> so<00:04:47.229> here<00:04:48.229> I'm

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
whole thing inside out later so here I'm

whole thing inside out later so here I'm
just<00:04:48.590> peeling<00:04:48.830> off<00:04:49.099> my<00:04:49.490> pattern<00:04:50.240> piece

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
just peeling off my pattern piece

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.439 
just peeling off my pattern piece
because<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:50.930> so<00:04:51.259> directly<00:04:51.680> onto<00:04:51.919> it<00:04:52.219> or<00:04:52.460> around

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
because I so directly onto it or around

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:59.619 
because I so directly onto it or around
it<00:04:56.889> so<00:04:57.889> then<00:04:58.159> you<00:04:58.250> should<00:04:58.430> have<00:04:58.610> this<00:04:58.939> and<00:04:59.270> then

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
it so then you should have this and then

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.839 
it so then you should have this and then
you're<00:04:59.840> just<00:04:59.870> going<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.199> cut<00:05:00.439> around<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.580> seam

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
you're just going to cut around the seam

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.490 
you're just going to cut around the seam
you<00:05:01.969> just<00:05:02.180> sewed<00:05:02.419> about<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.810> quarter<00:05:03.229> inch<00:05:03.259> away

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
you just sewed about a quarter inch away

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.980 
you just sewed about a quarter inch away
from<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:04.090> just<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.180> trim<00:05:05.389> off<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.659> excess

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
from it just to trim off the excess

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.339 
from it just to trim off the excess
fabric<00:05:07.870> and<00:05:09.669> then<00:05:10.669> you're<00:05:10.849> just<00:05:10.879> going<00:05:11.060> to

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
your scene but the seam allowance this

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.529 
your scene but the seam allowance this
is<00:05:15.259> going<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.500> help<00:05:16.250> turn<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.759> curves<00:05:17.090> when

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
is going to help turn the curves when

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.209 
is going to help turn the curves when
you<00:05:17.690> turn<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.930> whole<00:05:18.169> thing<00:05:18.199> right<00:05:18.530> side<00:05:18.560> out

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.589
