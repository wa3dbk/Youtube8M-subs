these<00:02:39.200> vehicles<00:02:39.500> obviously<00:02:40.490> cost<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.790> lot<00:02:40.880> of

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
these vehicles obviously cost a lot of

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.690 
these vehicles obviously cost a lot of
money<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.390> run<00:02:41.570> but<00:02:42.560> they<00:02:42.770> just<00:02:42.980> look<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.430> part

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
now the steering wheel on this is

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.740 
now the steering wheel on this is
relatively<00:02:52.430> large<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.240> it's<00:02:53.390> by<00:02:53.540> no<00:02:53.570> means

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
relatively large but it's by no means

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
agile okay I think what it's got power

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.260 
agile okay I think what it's got power
steering<00:03:15.980> or<00:03:16.370> force<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:16.910> but<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.240> doesn't

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
steering or force it is but it doesn't

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.670
