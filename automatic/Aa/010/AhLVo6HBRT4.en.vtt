okay<00:00:03.899> well<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:05.040> just<00:00:06.000> bought<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.690> Duramax<00:00:07.470> MX

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
okay well I just bought a Duramax MX

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.740 
okay well I just bought a Duramax MX
1500<00:00:09.000> generator<00:00:09.809> off<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.230> Amazon<00:00:10.940> and<00:00:11.940> I've

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
1500 generator off of Amazon and I've

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.210 
1500 generator off of Amazon and I've
seen<00:00:12.990> quite<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.620> few<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.920> these<00:00:14.099> generators

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
seen quite a few of these generators

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.060 
seen quite a few of these generators
with<00:00:17.220> various<00:00:17.640> different<00:00:18.920> different<00:00:19.920> name

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
with various different different name

plates<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:20.970> guess<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.359> would<00:00:21.570> say<00:00:22.820> it

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
plates on it I guess you would say it

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.450 
plates on it I guess you would say it
seems<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.420> you've<00:00:25.050> seen<00:00:25.260> I've<00:00:26.010> seen<00:00:26.039> quite<00:00:26.369> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
seems like you've seen I've seen quite a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.529 
seems like you've seen I've seen quite a
few<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.789> them<00:00:26.910> as<00:00:27.119> etq<00:00:28.050> or<00:00:28.320> UST<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.539> think

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
few of them as etq or UST or I think

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.200 
few of them as etq or UST or I think
Tractor<00:00:31.140> Supply<00:00:31.170> has<00:00:31.769> these<00:00:32.040> labeled<00:00:32.940> as<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
Tractor Supply has these labeled as the

sportsman
type<00:00:35.340> generators<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.719> thought<00:00:37.649> I'd<00:00:37.800> give

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
type generators so I thought I'd give

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.069 
type generators so I thought I'd give
one<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.820> these<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> shot<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.629> looked<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
one of these a shot this looked like it

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.490 
one of these a shot this looked like it
was<00:00:40.739> probably<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.489> best<00:00:41.700> deal<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.500> for

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
was probably the best deal for the for

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.170 
was probably the best deal for the for
the<00:00:43.590> money<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.860> was<00:00:44.040> spending<00:00:44.309> paid<00:00:44.610> about<00:00:44.760> 200

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
the money I was spending paid about 200

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.479 
the money I was spending paid about 200
bucks<00:00:45.300> shipped<00:00:46.079> which<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.129> thought<00:00:47.280> was<00:00:47.399> pretty

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
bucks shipped which I thought was pretty

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.220 
bucks shipped which I thought was pretty
pretty<00:00:48.000> decent<00:00:48.360> assuming<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.870> works<00:00:49.050> all

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
pretty decent assuming that it works all

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.900 
pretty decent assuming that it works all
right<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.590> just<00:00:49.770> put<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> box

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
right but just put it out of the box

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.930 
right but just put it out of the box
took<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> out<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.539> box<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:53.070> here<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.879> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
took it out of the box and here it is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.040 
took it out of the box and here it is
upside<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:54.750> with<00:00:54.960> plastic<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:56.870> it<00:00:57.870> looks

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
upside down with plastic on it it looks

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.139 
upside down with plastic on it it looks
fairly<00:00:58.320> well<00:00:58.559> built<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.039> what<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> is<00:01:02.030> needs<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
fairly well built for what it is needs a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.600 
fairly well built for what it is needs a
little<00:01:03.300> bit<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.769> there's<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> tool<00:01:05.070> package<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
little bit of there's a tool package it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.830 
little bit of there's a tool package it
looks<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.150> think<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.540> needs<00:01:06.720> any

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
looks like I don't think it needs any

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.320 
looks like I don't think it needs any
assemblage<00:01:07.490> that's<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.880> looking<00:01:09.150> at

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
assemblage that's what I was looking at

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.390 
assemblage that's what I was looking at
and<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:10.049> don't<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:10.860> does<00:01:11.659> so

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
and I don't know that it really does so

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.140 
and I don't know that it really does so
you<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.580> pull<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> over<00:01:15.060> here

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.640 

take<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.180> look<00:01:19.450> at<00:01:19.659> it<00:01:21.900> got<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:22.930> nice<00:01:23.110> twist<00:01:23.380> lock

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
take a look at it got a nice twist lock

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.289 
take a look at it got a nice twist lock
connector<00:01:23.979> no<00:01:24.369> that's<00:01:24.729> not<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:24.939> twist<00:01:25.150> lock

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
connector no that's not a twist lock

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.840 
connector no that's not a twist lock
connector<00:01:25.600> that's<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.049> standard<00:01:26.430> AC<00:01:27.430> plug

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
connector that's the standard AC plug

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.039 
connector that's the standard AC plug
about<00:01:28.270> that<00:01:29.070> okay<00:01:30.070> cool

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
about that okay cool

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.190 
about that okay cool
put<00:01:32.049> that<00:01:32.229> in<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.409> box<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.390> then<00:01:34.509> actually

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
put that in the box and then actually

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.249 
put that in the box and then actually
have<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.380> nice<00:01:35.590> manual<00:01:36.100> here

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
have a nice manual here

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.770 
have a nice manual here
okay<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:41.250> some<00:01:42.250> silica<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.820> keep<00:01:43.000> it<00:01:43.119> keep<00:01:43.630> the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
okay and some silica to keep it keep the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.859 
okay and some silica to keep it keep the
moisture<00:01:44.200> out<00:01:45.360> probably<00:01:46.360> why<00:01:46.509> it's<00:01:46.659> coming

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
moisture out probably why it's coming

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.160 
moisture out probably why it's coming
from<00:01:47.080> over<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.770> boat<00:01:47.950> in<00:01:48.070> China<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.390> here's

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
from over the boat in China and here's

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.390 
from over the boat in China and here's
the<00:01:50.319> unit<00:01:51.810> there's<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.929> backside

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.750 

now<00:01:56.970> I've<00:01:57.150> seen<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.020> heard<00:01:58.400> some<00:01:59.400> people<00:01:59.550> have

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
now I've seen and heard some people have

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.570 
now I've seen and heard some people have
said<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> choke<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.540> backwards<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:02.490> I

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
said that the choke is backwards and I

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.480 
said that the choke is backwards and I
don't<00:02:02.670> know<00:02:03.680> how<00:02:04.680> true<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.100> we're<00:02:05.400> gonna

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
don't know how true that is we're gonna

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.070 
don't know how true that is we're gonna
find<00:02:05.760> out<00:02:06.000> once<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.300> get<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.480> fueled<00:02:06.600> up<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:06.870> put

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
find out once I get it fueled up and put

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.360 
find out once I get it fueled up and put
some<00:02:07.200> oil<00:02:07.380> into<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:09.950> one<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.100> reasons

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
some oil into it and one of the reasons

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.920 
some oil into it and one of the reasons
why<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.550> decided<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.300> particular<00:02:12.570> model

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
why I decided on this particular model

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.920 
why I decided on this particular model
is<00:02:13.520> it's<00:02:14.520> got<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.880> 12<00:02:15.120> volt<00:02:15.330> charging<00:02:15.660> circuit

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
is it's got the 12 volt charging circuit

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.830 
is it's got the 12 volt charging circuit
which<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:17.130> was<00:02:17.760> planning<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.210> using<00:02:18.240> for<00:02:18.570> maybe

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
which I was planning on using for maybe

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.440 
which I was planning on using for maybe
some<00:02:19.050> amateur<00:02:19.410> radio<00:02:19.560> stuff<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:21.240> very

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
some amateur radio stuff and it's very

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.790 
some amateur radio stuff and it's very
important<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:21.990> have<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> circuit<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:22.710> I

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
important that I have a circuit that I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.500 
important that I have a circuit that I
can<00:02:23.420> tap<00:02:24.420> into<00:02:24.630> a<00:02:24.720> battery<00:02:25.110> maybe<00:02:25.380> run<00:02:26.330> run<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
can tap into a battery maybe run run the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.150 
can tap into a battery maybe run run the
radio<00:02:28.050> directly<00:02:28.410> from<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.620> battery<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:28.980> then

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
radio directly from the battery and then

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.190 
radio directly from the battery and then
turn<00:02:29.370> charge<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.850> from<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.060> stereo<00:02:30.360> here<00:02:30.510> and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
turn charge it from the stereo here and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.530 
turn charge it from the stereo here and
that<00:02:31.620> would<00:02:31.740> eliminate<00:02:31.980> my<00:02:32.480> requirement<00:02:33.480> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
that would eliminate my requirement to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.390 
that would eliminate my requirement to
have<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:34.340> have<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> power<00:02:35.640> supply<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:37.190> I'm<00:02:38.190> going

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
have a have a power supply so I'm going

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.070 
have a have a power supply so I'm going
to<00:02:38.460> fuel<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> up<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.150> we're<00:02:39.480> gonna<00:02:39.630> put<00:02:40.050> some

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
to fuel it up and we're gonna put some

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.500 
to fuel it up and we're gonna put some
gasoline<00:02:40.710> in<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.130> put<00:02:41.940> some<00:02:42.060> oil<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.450> I

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
gasoline in it and put some oil in it I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.230 
gasoline in it and put some oil in it I
guess<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:43.400> we'll<00:02:44.400> give<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.730> crank<00:02:44.940> here<00:02:45.120> in

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
guess and we'll give it a crank here in

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.870 
guess and we'll give it a crank here in
just<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.570> second
