you've<00:00:05.540> identified<00:00:05.750> the<00:00:06.350> giant<00:00:06.740> forest<00:00:07.010> hog

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.370 
you've identified the giant forest hog

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.110 
you've identified the giant forest hog
and<00:00:08.080> giant<00:00:09.080> forest<00:00:09.350> hogs<00:00:09.770> are<00:00:10.309> the<00:00:10.610> world's

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
and giant forest hogs are the world's

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.510 
and giant forest hogs are the world's
largest<00:00:11.389> wild<00:00:12.320> pig<00:00:12.650> so<00:00:13.070> they<00:00:13.340> are

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:13.520 
largest wild pig so they are

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.210 
largest wild pig so they are
appropriately<00:00:14.120> named<00:00:14.480> and<00:00:15.050> they<00:00:15.980> live<00:00:16.189> in

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
appropriately named and they live in

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.580 
appropriately named and they live in
family<00:00:16.550> groups<00:00:16.910> of<00:00:17.240> about<00:00:17.360> 20<00:00:17.960> individuals

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
family groups of about 20 individuals

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.990 
family groups of about 20 individuals
you<00:00:18.800> have<00:00:18.830> the<00:00:19.040> dominant<00:00:19.460> male<00:00:19.610> and<00:00:19.640> the

you have the dominant male and the
dominant<00:00:20.420> female<00:00:20.599> and<00:00:21.110> then<00:00:21.290> their<00:00:21.500> offspring

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
dominant female and then their offspring

forest<00:00:50.570> hog<00:00:50.899> enjoys<00:00:51.350> areas<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.339> bongo

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
forest hog enjoys areas that the bongo

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.450 
forest hog enjoys areas that the bongo
also<00:00:53.179> enjoys<00:00:53.570> which<00:00:53.839> are<00:00:54.079> clearings<00:00:54.980> in<00:00:55.280> the

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
also enjoys which are clearings in the

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
midst of a forest and the reason for

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.439 
midst of a forest and the reason for
that<00:00:57.829> is<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:58.219> they<00:00:58.370> can<00:00:58.550> graze<00:00:58.820> in<00:00:59.239> the

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
that is so they can graze in the

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.239 
that is so they can graze in the
clearing<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.050> then<00:01:00.230> hide<00:01:00.530> in<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.890> forest

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
clearing and then hide in the forest

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.910 
clearing and then hide in the forest
because<00:01:01.850> giant<00:01:02.480> forest<00:01:02.719> hogs<00:01:03.079> are<00:01:03.409> primarily

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
because giant forest hogs are primarily

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.640 
because giant forest hogs are primarily
grazers<00:01:04.670> which<00:01:04.940> is<00:01:05.089> unique<00:01:05.449> among<00:01:05.990> wild<00:01:06.380> pigs

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
grazers which is unique among wild pigs

to<00:01:16.490> find<00:01:16.730> another<00:01:17.330> family<00:01:17.960> of<00:01:17.990> giant<00:01:18.530> forest

Pig and once that's determined though
they<00:01:32.690> don't<00:01:32.870> ever<00:01:33.050> have<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.440> fight<00:01:33.620> again

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
they don't ever have to fight again

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.670 
they don't ever have to fight again
because<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:35.150> losing<00:01:35.660> male<00:01:35.870> knows<00:01:36.200> his<00:01:36.440> place

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
because the losing male knows his place

embarrassing and shameful for everyone

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.380 
embarrassing and shameful for everyone
involved<00:01:49.010> but<00:01:49.400> that's<00:01:49.580> how<00:01:49.730> it<00:01:49.850> works<00:01:50.060> in<00:01:50.300> the

involved but that's how it works in the
