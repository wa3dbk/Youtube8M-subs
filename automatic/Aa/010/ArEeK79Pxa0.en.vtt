the problem with those policy strategy

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.830 
the problem with those policy strategy
is<00:02:07.560> actually<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.520> are<00:02:08.670> not<00:02:08.940> putting

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
is actually if you are not putting

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.589 
is actually if you are not putting

enough effort and fast enough you are

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.460 
enough effort and fast enough you are
going<00:02:12.780> too<00:02:12.930> easy

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
going too easy

should be matched by the supply side so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.000 
should be matched by the supply side so
they<00:02:21.540> are<00:02:21.660> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.990> be<00:02:22.110> having<00:02:22.530> more<00:02:22.710> or<00:02:22.860> less

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
to be the challenge for Indonesia the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.650 
to be the challenge for Indonesia the
second<00:02:35.010> one<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.310> course<00:02:35.460> you<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:35.970> see<00:02:36.180> from

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
second one is of course you can see from

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.660 
second one is of course you can see from

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
really mainly because in the past and I

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.500 
really mainly because in the past and I
think<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.740> even<00:02:44.070> still<00:02:44.490> currently<00:02:45.000> Indonesia

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
think is even still currently Indonesia

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.449 
think is even still currently Indonesia
and<00:02:45.690> still<00:02:45.930> rely<00:02:46.350> more<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.980> natural

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
and still rely more on a natural

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.630 
and still rely more on a natural

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
resource export rather than the export

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.120 
resource export rather than the export

global economy is going down very

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.440 
global economy is going down very
sharply<00:04:09.930> by<00:04:10.680> doing<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.160> expansionary<00:04:11.580> policy

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
sharply by doing the expansionary policy

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.330 
sharply by doing the expansionary policy
both<00:04:12.630> on<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.840> fiscal<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.380> monetary<00:04:13.709> side<00:04:14.010> it

both on a fiscal and monetary side it

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.599 
both on a fiscal and monetary side it
was<00:04:14.880> right<00:04:15.209> in<00:04:16.010> 2009-2010<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:17.430> why

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
was right in 2009-2010 and that's why

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.250 
was right in 2009-2010 and that's why
they<00:04:17.790> need<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.030> consolidate<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.930> they<00:04:19.080> are

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
they need to consolidate and they are

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.930 
they need to consolidate and they are
now<00:04:19.470> consolidating<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:21.060> it<00:04:21.630> cannot<00:04:22.080> reverse

the<00:04:26.070> past<00:04:26.340> two<00:04:26.580> three<00:04:26.610> years<00:04:26.880> so<00:04:27.750> we<00:04:28.530> have<00:04:28.710> to

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
the past two three years so we have to

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.260 
the past two three years so we have to
deal<00:04:28.980> with<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.220> consequences

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
deal with the consequences

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.750 
deal with the consequences
so<00:04:30.630> for<00:04:31.050> for<00:04:31.500> China<00:04:31.740> definitely<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.550> case

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
so for for China definitely in this case

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.150 
so for for China definitely in this case
they<00:04:32.940> knew<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:34.290> consequence<00:04:34.920> of

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
they knew that the consequence of

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.910 
they knew that the consequence of
expansionary<00:04:35.730> policy<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:37.230> do<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.590> counter

expansionary policy to do the counter
cyclical<00:04:38.280> is<00:04:38.610> actually<00:04:39.180> now<00:04:39.780> appearing<00:04:40.770> in

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
cyclical is actually now appearing in

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.400 
cyclical is actually now appearing in
this<00:04:41.130> one<00:04:41.670> specific<00:04:42.450> sector<00:04:42.870> which<00:04:43.080> is<00:04:43.200> on<00:04:43.320> the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
this one specific sector which is on the

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.650 
this one specific sector which is on the
property<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:44.730> created<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.390> lot<00:04:45.420> of

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
property it created a lot of

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.690 
property it created a lot of
complication<00:04:46.380> because<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:46.950> linked<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.490> the

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
complication because it linked to the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.680 
complication because it linked to the
local<00:04:48.060> government<00:04:48.800> revenue<00:04:49.800> side<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:51.180> local

local government revenue side the local

local government revenue side the local
government<00:04:52.110> is<00:04:52.230> really<00:04:52.680> rely<00:04:53.100> on<00:04:53.370> their

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
government is really rely on their

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.940 
government is really rely on their
selling<00:04:54.480> land<00:04:54.750> for<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.080> property<00:04:55.650> in<00:04:55.800> this

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
selling land for the property in this

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.030 
selling land for the property in this
case<00:04:56.220> as<00:04:56.610> their<00:04:57.180> source<00:04:57.450> of<00:04:57.600> revenue<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.650> can

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
case as their source of revenue it can

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.060 
case as their source of revenue it can
also<00:04:59.400> hit<00:04:59.790> the<00:04:59.850> Filner<00:05:00.300> bit<00:05:00.540> of<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:01.070> financial

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
also hit the Filner bit of the financial

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.810 
also hit the Filner bit of the financial
system<00:05:02.280> banking<00:05:02.820> system<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.500> for<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:05.400> policy

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
system banking system so for the policy

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.270 
system banking system so for the policy
maker<00:05:06.030> there<00:05:06.390> really<00:05:07.020> tried<00:05:07.320> to<00:05:07.530> manage<00:05:07.770> this

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
maker there really tried to manage this

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.090 
maker there really tried to manage this
bubble<00:05:09.060> or<00:05:09.290> correcting<00:05:10.290> the<00:05:10.440> price<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.950> the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
bubble or correcting the price to the

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.190 
bubble or correcting the price to the
level<00:05:11.490> which<00:05:11.730> is<00:05:11.880> perceived<00:05:12.450> as<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:12.720> fair

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
level which is perceived as the fair

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.710 
level which is perceived as the fair
price<00:05:13.560> rather<00:05:14.160> than<00:05:14.520> excessive<00:05:15.180> price<00:05:15.480> that

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
price rather than excessive price that

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.750 
price rather than excessive price that
then<00:05:15.900> create<00:05:16.320> a<00:05:16.380> lot<00:05:16.620> of<00:05:16.740> complication<00:05:17.460> it

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
then create a lot of complication it

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.910 
then create a lot of complication it
will<00:05:18.270> takes<00:05:18.570> time<00:05:20.930> so<00:05:21.930> as<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.260> can<00:05:22.410> see<00:05:22.470> there

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
will takes time so as you can see there

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.470 
will takes time so as you can see there

having an impact on the on the emerging
economies<00:05:33.120> specifically<00:05:33.780> when<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.020> comes<00:05:34.260> to

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
economies specifically when it comes to

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.100 
economies specifically when it comes to
trade<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.130> this<00:05:35.250> is<00:05:35.400> reflected<00:05:36.300> in<00:05:36.450> exports

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
trade and this is reflected in exports

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.450 
trade and this is reflected in exports
and<00:05:37.230> imports<00:05:37.320> that<00:05:37.650> even<00:05:37.920> in<00:05:38.010> some<00:05:38.190> of<00:05:38.310> their

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
and imports that even in some of their

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.060 
and imports that even in some of their
current<00:05:38.850> account<00:05:38.940> figures<00:05:39.570> but<00:05:40.200> overall<00:05:40.860> you

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
current account figures but overall you

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.620 
current account figures but overall you
know<00:05:41.190> these<00:05:41.430> emerging<00:05:41.850> economies<00:05:42.330> are<00:05:42.360> still

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
know these emerging economies are still

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.470 
know these emerging economies are still
growing<00:05:43.080> really<00:05:43.350> rapidly<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:44.280> so<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:45.000> impact

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
growing really rapidly and so the impact

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.480 
growing really rapidly and so the impact
has<00:05:45.750> been<00:05:45.780> cushioned<00:05:46.470> by<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:46.710> GDP<00:05:47.250> growth

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
has been cushioned by the GDP growth

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.610 
has been cushioned by the GDP growth
that<00:05:47.700> they're<00:05:47.880> having<00:05:48.270> many<00:05:48.960> argued<00:05:49.440> that<00:05:49.560> a
