00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.740
 hi girls how are you from this week 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.569
 we continue with the videos dedicated to 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.010
 makeup base reviews in 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.289
 today I'm going to talk about double 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.969
 wear light de estilo der uploaded a photo 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.500
 instagram and several of you have told me 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.840
 said please do a review 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.880
 because I'm very interested in your opinion 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.099
 on the basis is a basis that what 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.710
 it promises is in long duration that it does not 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.710
 transfers has solar protection 10 that 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.169
 the free and promises a light coverage 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.609
 mean what it promises is good 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.430
 coverage at the same time as a finish 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.200
 natural I have to tell you that everything 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.720
 that promises he fulfills it also promises 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.130
 about 15 hours long and well I 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.410
 I have to tell you that it has taken 12 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.650
 hours from 9 to 9 that's what he has 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.110
 born 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.240
 more no but I understand that it lasts 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.580
 perfectly because really when I 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.530
 the quito is the perfect base even 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.060
 I led me to the sauna to check 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.100
 what happens with very hot environments 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.780
 is a perfect base to carry in 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.400
 summer you have to go to the 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.560
 office and you have to be so have a 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.660
 Professional and perfect look throughout 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.980
 the day for many hours is perfect 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.920
 for all those who have the skin 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.620
 from normal to mixed and fat because 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.270
 above all it favors a matte finish that 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.370
 not dry keeps the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.800
 hydration of the skin 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.640
 what else to say to you although it has protection 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.100
 solar 10 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.990
 I have photographed with my camera and 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.200
 works wonders does not generate me 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.760
 No kind of flashback try it on me 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.290
 case of wanting to take you an event 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.450
 try it because the good thing that it has is 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.250
 which has a very long duration although the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.920
 Mark says that the finish is a finish 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.990
 natural light is true but I would say 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.600
 which has a fairly average coverage 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.040
 pulling high so all that 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.780
 you have oily skin with marquitas 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.790
 imperfections and spots will go 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.320
 wonder as it is my case not that some 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.360
 acne marks because I cover them 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.830
 perfectly in terms of packaging and 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.600
 You see that it is perfect for traveling 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.490
 You can put this in your bag in 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.800
 any site and it comes well in this 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.960
 box you use this product and you want 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.880
 of course a long-term base 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.860
 I recommend that you accompany him with a 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.750
 long-lasting corrector and this the 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.760
 double wear is an authentic past me 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.890
 I have the zero tone one of the two this 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.899
 one and this 01 what happens with this 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.760
 corrector that is has a very finished 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.950
 similar to the base the difference is that 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.050
 it's a tad more hydrated then it's 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.820
 perfect for that area where when smiling 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.490
 always with the wrinkles can generate 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.980
 folds and resects and lasts perfect 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.290
 throughout the day it is very comfortable 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.030
 and apply even I also what here with 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.530
 some areas where I need a little bit 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.700
 of greater coverage purely I will make a 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.170
 video on the subject because I think that 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.330
 It can be very interesting about 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.010
 all those that have a greasy skin and in 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.260
 summer you need a product that motivates 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.420
 and that in my case I do not even 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.650
 I use it magnificent as is and after 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.660
 I put on a little bit of cream blush 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.760
 tell me what do you think I know that some in 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.930
 you use are happy if you have 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.060
 Any question or any doubt already 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.099
 you know you can write me leave the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.629
 comments as always I send you a 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.629
 huge kiss and until the next video
