00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
but if there's a way to differentiate

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.340

the same monster it just makes the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.460 
the same monster it just makes the
entire<00:01:57.119> experience<00:01:57.540> some<00:01:57.900> more<00:01:58.020> memorable

appropriate amount of weight and force

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.509 
appropriate amount of weight and force
behind<00:03:12.810> their<00:03:13.019> swings<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.530> think<00:03:14.070> will<00:03:14.160> be<00:03:14.280> far

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
behind their swings I think will be far

more immersive let me give an example

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.259 
more immersive let me give an example
most<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.859> time<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.640> as<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.820> hunter<00:03:18.120> are

most of the time you as a hunter are

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.849 
most of the time you as a hunter are
sitting<00:03:18.540> next<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.840> monster<00:03:19.260> poking<00:03:19.769> it

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
sitting next to a monster poking it

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
you're even hurting it it'd be great to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.330 
you're even hurting it it'd be great to
have<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.440> system<00:03:25.799> where<00:03:25.890> monsters<00:03:26.100> were

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
have a system where monsters were

visibly injured in a more pronounced way
I<00:03:28.380> know<00:03:29.310> monsters<00:03:29.730> can<00:03:29.880> break<00:03:30.060> their<00:03:30.239> face

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
I know monsters can break their face

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.910 
I know monsters can break their face
where<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.690> wings<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.290> be<00:03:31.320> perforated

underground anymore that would

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.699 
underground anymore that would
completely<00:03:45.299> change<00:03:45.420> how<00:03:46.049> everybody<00:03:46.410> fights

to break the face off of the Ovilus like
that

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.030 

now<00:03:57.569> I'll<00:03:57.840> be<00:03:57.959> honest<00:03:58.290> I'm<00:03:58.439> not<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.709> very

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
now I'll be honest I'm not a very

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.009 
now I'll be honest I'm not a very
competitive<00:03:59.549> person<00:03:59.760> I<00:04:00.360> don't<00:04:00.720> do<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:00.840> lot<00:04:00.930> of

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
competitive person I don't do a lot of

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.350 
competitive person I don't do a lot of
PvP<00:04:01.530> or<00:04:01.560> anything<00:04:01.890> like<00:04:02.159> that<00:04:02.220> but<00:04:02.939> I<00:04:03.000> really

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
PvP or anything like that but I really

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.940 
PvP or anything like that but I really
think<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.569> must<00:04:03.810> run<00:04:03.930> before<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.349> could

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
think that must run before you could

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.619 
think that must run before you could
really<00:04:05.370> benefit<00:04:05.790> with<00:04:06.120> some<00:04:06.390> sort<00:04:06.599> of

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
really benefit with some sort of

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.720 
really benefit with some sort of
competitive<00:04:06.989> interaction<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.829> mean<00:04:08.430> look<00:04:08.670> at

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
competitive interaction I mean look at

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.039 
competitive interaction I mean look at
the<00:04:08.849> quest<00:04:09.150> people<00:04:09.540> always<00:04:09.659> run<00:04:09.959> around

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
the quest people always run around

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.449 
the quest people always run around
trying<00:04:10.409> to<00:04:10.470> hit<00:04:10.650> each<00:04:10.739> other<00:04:10.890> at<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.189> end<00:04:11.310> of

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
trying to hit each other at the end of

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.520 
trying to hit each other at the end of
them<00:04:11.549> already<00:04:11.909> why<00:04:12.659> not<00:04:12.810> just<00:04:13.019> make<00:04:13.230> some<00:04:13.349> hold

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
them already why not just make some hold

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.050 
them already why not just make some hold
a<00:04:13.590> simple<00:04:13.920> mote<00:04:14.069> out<00:04:14.099> of<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.400> maybe<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.700> Dueling

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
a simple mote out of it maybe a Dueling

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.580 
a simple mote out of it maybe a Dueling
feature<00:04:15.269> or<00:04:15.689> even<00:04:15.900> something<00:04:16.079> simple<00:04:16.470> like<00:04:16.530> a

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
feature or even something simple like a

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.650 
feature or even something simple like a
reward<00:04:17.039> for<00:04:17.220> who<00:04:17.310> did<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.579> most<00:04:17.729> damage<00:04:17.910> if

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
reward for who did the most damage if

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.180 
reward for who did the most damage if
the<00:04:19.229> combat<00:04:19.560> was<00:04:19.680> tweaked<00:04:19.919> I<00:04:20.009> think

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
the combat was tweaked I think

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.039 
the combat was tweaked I think
competitive<00:04:20.609> PvP<00:04:21.060> or<00:04:21.269> team<00:04:21.509> competitions

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
competitive PvP or team competitions

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.930 
competitive PvP or team competitions
could<00:04:22.259> be<00:04:22.350> fun<00:04:22.590> they<00:04:23.400> wouldn't<00:04:23.669> have<00:04:23.789> to<00:04:23.910> be

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
could be fun they wouldn't have to be

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.029 
could be fun they wouldn't have to be
the<00:04:24.090> typical<00:04:24.270> deathmatch<00:04:24.960> or<00:04:25.169> whatever<00:04:25.470> what

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
the typical deathmatch or whatever what

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.800 
the typical deathmatch or whatever what
if<00:04:26.160> like<00:04:26.610> there<00:04:26.820> were<00:04:26.910> two<00:04:27.090> teams<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.720> they

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
if like there were two teams and they

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.210 
if like there were two teams and they
were<00:04:27.900> trying<00:04:28.139> to<00:04:28.169> capture<00:04:28.380> the<00:04:28.620> same<00:04:28.800> monster

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
were trying to capture the same monster

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.439 
were trying to capture the same monster
and<00:04:29.400> they<00:04:29.490> could<00:04:29.610> sabotage<00:04:30.000> each<00:04:30.120> other<00:04:30.270> by

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
and they could sabotage each other by

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.850 
and they could sabotage each other by
setting<00:04:30.750> up<00:04:30.840> different<00:04:30.930> kind<00:04:31.229> of<00:04:31.289> traps<00:04:31.620> or

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
setting up different kind of traps or

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.830 
setting up different kind of traps or
something<00:04:32.190> if<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.120> two<00:04:33.240> teams<00:04:33.449> were<00:04:33.570> fronting

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
something if the two teams were fronting

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.060 
something if the two teams were fronting
over<00:04:34.020> at<00:04:34.110> Genma<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:34.530> maybe<00:04:34.770> they<00:04:34.889> could<00:04:35.039> even

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
over at Genma and maybe they could even

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.010 
over at Genma and maybe they could even
have<00:04:35.370> their<00:04:35.490> own<00:04:35.520> ship<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.240> they<00:04:36.300> could<00:04:36.479> help

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
have their own ship and they could help

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.450 
have their own ship and they could help
kill<00:04:37.260> Jen<00:04:37.590> or<00:04:37.800> they<00:04:37.949> could<00:04:38.160> shoot<00:04:38.340> the<00:04:38.430> other

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
kill Jen or they could shoot the other
