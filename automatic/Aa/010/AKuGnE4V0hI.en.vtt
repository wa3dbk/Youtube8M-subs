00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
top of the block the most obvious ones

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.660 
top of the block the most obvious ones
are<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.729> solid<00:01:34.119> deck<00:01:34.329> design<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:35.079> the<00:01:35.710> extra

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
two bolts persona yeah and how important

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.319 
two bolts persona yeah and how important
is<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.329> have<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:41.409> know<00:01:41.530> there's<00:01:41.970> 18<00:01:42.970> head

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
is it to have you know there's 18 head

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.139 
is it to have you know there's 18 head
bolts<00:01:43.630> instead<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.340> four<00:01:45.340> bolts<00:01:45.640> per<00:01:45.880> cylinder

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
bolts instead of four bolts per cylinder

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.370 
bolts instead of four bolts per cylinder
as<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:47.049> get<00:01:47.229> with<00:01:47.409> a<00:01:47.439> big-block<00:01:47.649> Ford<00:01:48.100> well

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
as you get with a big-block Ford well

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.929 
as you get with a big-block Ford well
with<00:01:50.380> anything<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:51.040> more<00:01:51.189> clamping<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:51.759> have

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
with anything the more clamping you have

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.429 
with anything the more clamping you have
the<00:01:52.149> better<00:01:52.270> off<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.689> are

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
the better off you are

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.249 
the better off you are
to<00:01:53.829> keep<00:01:54.009> from<00:01:54.189> lifting<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.030> head<00:01:55.259> during

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
to keep from lifting the head during

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.240 
to keep from lifting the head during
high<00:01:56.470> cylinder<00:01:56.829> pressure<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.990> it's<00:01:59.740> obvious

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
high cylinder pressure so it's obvious

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:08.630 
high cylinder pressure so it's obvious
that<00:02:00.490> it's<00:02:00.880> better

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.170 

you

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.000 

okay<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.390> comparison<00:02:12.989> sakes<00:02:13.260> we've<00:02:13.590> got<00:02:13.830> a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
okay for comparison sakes we've got a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.100 
okay for comparison sakes we've got a
production<00:02:14.790> 460<00:02:15.569> block<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:15.900> we're<00:02:16.019> looking

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
that they're water jackets running in

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.380 
that they're water jackets running in
between<00:02:28.709> each<00:02:28.920> cylinder<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.060> cylinder

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
between each cylinder so the cylinder

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.220 
between each cylinder so the cylinder
walls<00:02:30.540> aren't<00:02:30.900> quite<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.379> thick

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.350 

taking<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.010> look<00:02:38.160> at<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> lifter<00:02:38.700> Valley<00:02:38.730> area

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
taking a look at the lifter Valley area

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.449 
taking a look at the lifter Valley area
of<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.840> Ford<00:02:40.410> Racing<00:02:40.590> block<00:02:41.010> and<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.250> looks

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
of the Ford Racing block and it looks

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.370 
of the Ford Racing block and it looks
pretty<00:02:41.880> similar<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.540> production<00:02:42.870> block<00:02:43.170> but

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
pretty similar to a production block but

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.550 
pretty similar to a production block but
at<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> same<00:02:43.739> time<00:02:44.069> there's<00:02:44.580> noticeably

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
at the same time there's noticeably

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.280 
at the same time there's noticeably
thicker<00:02:46.560> material<00:02:47.660> tell<00:02:48.660> us<00:02:48.780> why<00:02:49.080> don't<00:02:49.230> you

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
thicker material tell us why don't you

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.540 
thicker material tell us why don't you
explain<00:02:49.620> what<00:02:49.709> we're<00:02:49.830> looking<00:02:50.069> at<00:02:50.160> here<00:02:50.220> Chris

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
explain what we're looking at here Chris

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:51.140 
explain what we're looking at here Chris
ah

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
ah

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.220 
ah
just<00:02:51.810> like<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.050> said<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.860> does<00:02:53.130> look<00:02:53.310> thicker

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
just like you said it does look thicker

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.000 
just like you said it does look thicker
basically<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.350> material<00:02:55.470> all<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.920> way

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
basically the material all the way

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.770 
basically the material all the way
across<00:02:56.280> looks<00:02:56.640> about<00:02:56.850> 50<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.330> 70<00:02:57.660> percent

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
across looks about 50 to 70 percent

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.580 
across looks about 50 to 70 percent
thicker<00:02:59.120> so<00:03:00.120> that's<00:03:00.390> going<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.630> tie<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.900> tie

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
thicker so that's going to tie the tie

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.759 
thicker so that's going to tie the tie
the<00:03:01.650> banks<00:03:02.010> together<00:03:02.280> better<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:03.650> which<00:03:04.650> is

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
the banks together better the which is

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.440 
the banks together better the which is
also<00:03:05.040> going<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.220> make<00:03:05.400> me<00:03:05.550> not<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> shy<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.120> put<00:03:06.420> a

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
also going to make me not a shy to put a

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.610 
also going to make me not a shy to put a
bigger<00:03:06.690> lift<00:03:06.959> here<00:03:07.110> in

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.490 

okay<00:03:14.620> so<00:03:14.680> on<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.790> aftermarket<00:03:16.390> block<00:03:16.810> you

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
okay so on the aftermarket block you

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.080 
okay so on the aftermarket block you
still<00:03:17.740> have<00:03:17.890> the<00:03:18.010> same<00:03:18.190> provisions<00:03:18.700> for<00:03:18.850> motor

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
still have the same provisions for motor

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.610 
still have the same provisions for motor
mounts<00:03:19.860> water<00:03:20.860> drain<00:03:21.220> but<00:03:22.210> some<00:03:22.620> improvements

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
mounts water drain but some improvements

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.490 
mounts water drain but some improvements
would<00:03:23.740> be<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.520> screw<00:03:24.820> in<00:03:24.970> core<00:03:25.210> plugs

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
would be the screw in core plugs

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.260 
would be the screw in core plugs
it's<00:03:27.100> basically<00:03:27.730> fill<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.210> all<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.630> the<00:03:30.270> the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
it's basically fill in all the the the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.260 
it's basically fill in all the the the
pockets<00:03:31.720> that<00:03:31.780> were<00:03:31.960> in<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.200> stock<00:03:32.530> block

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
pockets that were in the stock block

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.160 
pockets that were in the stock block
which<00:03:34.270> you'll<00:03:34.420> see<00:03:34.600> over<00:03:34.750> here<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:37.170> giving

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
which you'll see over here and giving

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.670 
which you'll see over here and giving
you<00:03:39.540> basically<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.600> stronger<00:03:41.080> stronger

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
you basically a stronger stronger

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.560 
you basically a stronger stronger
all-around<00:03:42.160> block<00:03:42.520> everything<00:03:43.330> is<00:03:43.390> tied

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
all-around block everything is tied

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:51.410 
all-around block everything is tied
together<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.110> cylinders<00:03:44.530> very<00:03:44.770> well

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.320 

we're<00:03:52.420> looking<00:03:52.720> at<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.140> bottom

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
we're looking at the bottom

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.180 
we're looking at the bottom
a production<00:03:54.840> 460<00:03:55.410> block<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.830> as<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.070> can

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
a production 460 block and as you can

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.440 
a production 460 block and as you can
see<00:03:56.310> it's<00:03:56.430> pretty<00:03:56.640> standard<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.180> got<00:03:57.330> your

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
see it's pretty standard you got your

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.050 
see it's pretty standard you got your
two<00:03:57.690> bolt<00:03:57.900> caps<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.590> now<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.670> nice<00:03:59.850> thing

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
two bolt caps and now the nice thing

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.960 
two bolt caps and now the nice thing
about<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.540> 460<00:04:01.410> use<00:04:01.530> are<00:04:01.740> even<00:04:02.610> with<00:04:02.850> the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
about the 460 use are even with the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.490 
about the 460 use are even with the
production<00:04:03.390> block<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.750> pan<00:04:03.990> rails<00:04:04.230> are

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
production block you pan rails are

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.200 
production block you pan rails are
pretty<00:04:04.830> far<00:04:05.010> apart<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.460> you<00:04:05.640> can<00:04:05.670> get<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:05.940> pretty

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
pretty far apart so you can get a pretty

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.480 
pretty far apart so you can get a pretty
long<00:04:06.390> scrotum<00:04:06.900> there<00:04:07.050> easily<00:04:07.860> without<00:04:08.250> having

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
long scrotum there easily without having

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.970 
long scrotum there easily without having
to<00:04:08.640> grind<00:04:08.910> anything<00:04:09.420> but<00:04:09.960> that<00:04:10.590> being<00:04:10.860> said

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
to grind anything but that being said

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.800 
to grind anything but that being said
there's<00:04:11.490> still<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.790> lot<00:04:12.060> of<00:04:12.090> room<00:04:12.780> for

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
there's still a lot of room for

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.090 
there's still a lot of room for
improvement<00:04:13.050> as<00:04:13.590> we'll<00:04:13.770> see<00:04:15.080> with<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.500> Ford

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
improvement as we'll see with the Ford

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.940 
improvement as we'll see with the Ford
Racing<00:04:17.310> block<00:04:17.700> now<00:04:18.390> Chris<00:04:18.660> what<00:04:19.560> are<00:04:19.590> some<00:04:19.859> of

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
Racing block now Chris what are some of

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.650 
Racing block now Chris what are some of
the<00:04:20.040> improvements<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.549> see<00:04:20.790> here<00:04:21.209> versus

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
the improvements you see here versus

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.390 
the improvements you see here versus
what<00:04:21.840> we're<00:04:21.959> just<00:04:22.080> looking<00:04:22.350> at<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:23.130> most

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
what we're just looking at the most

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.880 
what we're just looking at the most
obvious<00:04:23.820> one<00:04:23.970> would<00:04:24.150> be<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.420> four<00:04:24.690> bolt<00:04:24.930> split

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
obvious one would be the four bolt split

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.180 
obvious one would be the four bolt split
caps<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.730> center<00:04:27.030> three<00:04:27.240> means<00:04:28.190> that's

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
caps in the center three means that's

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.330 
caps in the center three means that's
obviously<00:04:29.610> going<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.910> be<00:04:30.350> stronger<00:04:31.350> another

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
obviously going to be stronger another

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.840 
obviously going to be stronger another
major<00:04:32.850> difference<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.510> it's<00:04:34.140> very<00:04:34.200> very<00:04:35.190> thick

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
major difference is it's very very thick

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.490 
major difference is it's very very thick
there<00:04:36.030> on<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.240> pan<00:04:36.480> rail<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.110> bottom<00:04:37.410> of

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
there on the pan rail so the bottom of

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.710 
there on the pan rail so the bottom of
the<00:04:37.560> cylinders<00:04:38.010> tied<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.210> block<00:04:39.450> better

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
the cylinders tied to the block better

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.070 
the cylinders tied to the block better
and<00:04:40.500> that's<00:04:40.770> going<00:04:40.950> to<00:04:41.210> course<00:04:42.210> require<00:04:42.750> some

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
and that's going to course require some

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.810 
and that's going to course require some
grinding<00:04:43.470> with<00:04:43.680> larger<00:04:44.130> strokes<00:04:44.430> but<00:04:44.640> you're

grinding with larger strokes but you're

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.220 
grinding with larger strokes but you're
going<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:45.000> be<00:04:45.120> able<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.420> customize<00:04:45.750> your

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
wanted to basically try to step this up

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.120 
wanted to basically try to step this up
some<00:05:09.080> things<00:05:09.290> that<00:05:09.440> it<00:05:09.530> would<00:05:09.650> need<00:05:09.860> would<00:05:10.070> be

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
some things that it would need would be

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.170 
some things that it would need would be
splayed<00:05:11.120> caps<00:05:11.450> in<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.690> center<00:05:12.050> three<00:05:13.180> and

splayed caps in the center three and

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.600 
splayed caps in the center three and
maybe<00:05:14.389> hard<00:05:14.720> block<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.169> to<00:05:15.490> keep<00:05:16.490> the

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
maybe hard block it to keep the

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.020

cylinders from moving around that would

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.909
