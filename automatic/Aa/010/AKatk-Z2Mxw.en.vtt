your two pentatonic scale know this lick

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.890 
your two pentatonic scale know this lick
sounds<00:00:35.950> a<00:00:36.010> lot<00:00:36.220> harder<00:00:36.550> than<00:00:36.850> it<00:00:37.120> is<00:00:37.390> which<00:00:37.720> is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
sounds a lot harder than it is which is

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:52.260 
sounds a lot harder than it is which is
the<00:00:38.080> best<00:00:38.230> kind<00:00:38.379> of<00:00:38.500> liquor<00:00:38.980> here<00:00:39.430> we<00:00:39.519> go

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.300 

and<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.260> second<00:00:53.650> thing<00:00:53.680> we<00:00:53.890> can<00:00:54.010> do<00:00:54.130> with<00:00:54.280> that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
and the second thing we can do with that

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.020 
and the second thing we can do with that
is<00:00:54.640> we<00:00:54.700> can<00:00:55.450> take<00:00:55.690> each<00:00:56.310> level<00:00:57.310> of<00:00:57.340> an<00:00:57.760> atomic

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
is we can take each level of an atomic

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.790 
is we can take each level of an atomic
scale<00:00:58.450> there<00:00:58.690> on<00:00:58.750> each<00:00:58.900> string<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.410> just<00:00:59.590> add

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
scale there on each string and just add

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.710 
scale there on each string and just add
an<00:01:00.040> extra<00:01:00.340> note<00:01:00.550> to<00:01:00.880> so<00:01:01.360> now<00:01:01.450> we're<00:01:01.570> going<00:01:01.660> to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
an extra note to so now we're going to

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.070 
an extra note to so now we're going to
do<00:01:01.840> this<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:04.059> every<00:01:04.300> string<00:01:04.750> you're<00:01:04.900> going<00:01:05.020> to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
do this on every string you're going to

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.000
