I'll<00:01:31.619> try<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> go<00:01:32.009> pretty<00:01:32.220> quickly<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.090> big

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
I'll try to go pretty quickly the big

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.609 
I'll try to go pretty quickly the big
thing<00:01:33.479> that's<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.720> jump<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.439> full

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
thing that's gonna jump out on this full

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.840 
thing that's gonna jump out on this full
gauntlet<00:01:34.920> glove<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.579> actually<00:01:35.670> have

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
gauntlet glove is you actually have

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.210 
gauntlet glove is you actually have
milspec<00:01:36.570> thousand<00:01:37.170> denier<00:01:37.470> mesh<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.189> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
milspec thousand denier mesh so it's a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.010 
milspec thousand denier mesh so it's a
very<00:01:38.430> tightly<00:01:38.759> woven<00:01:39.060> mesh<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> back

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
very tightly woven mesh here on the back

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.569

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.280 
of the hand that's gonna flow a ton of
air<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:41.939> incorporates<00:01:42.450> well<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
air and then incorporates well with the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.109 
air and then incorporates well with the
perforated<00:01:43.860> leather<00:01:43.979> which<00:01:44.250> will<00:01:44.399> also<00:01:44.670> flow

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
perforated leather which will also flow

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
there's a reflective panel actually

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.160 
there's a reflective panel actually
built<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.640> behind<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.450> mesh<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
built in behind that mesh it's just a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.050 
built in behind that mesh it's just a
nice<00:01:52.380> nuance<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.070> safety<00:01:53.280> feature<00:01:53.520> we're

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
nice nuance it's a safety feature we're

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.940 
nice nuance it's a safety feature we're
excited<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.479> they<00:01:54.689> did<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.049> moving<00:01:55.710> towards

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
excited that they did it moving towards

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.440 
excited that they did it moving towards
the<00:01:56.040> back<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.399> hand<00:01:56.670> you're<00:01:57.119> gonna<00:01:57.210> notice

so<00:02:13.980> they're<00:02:14.100> using<00:02:14.250> real-deal<00:02:14.730> materials

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
so they're using real-deal materials

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.090 
so they're using real-deal materials
you're<00:02:15.330> also<00:02:15.450> over<00:02:15.780> $100<00:02:16.380> for<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.590> glove<00:02:16.830> so

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
you're also over $100 for this glove so

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.850 
you're also over $100 for this glove so
it's<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> reasonably<00:02:17.760> large<00:02:17.910> investment

the things it's harder to see but I
really<00:02:28.080> dig<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:31.940> micro<00:02:32.940> mesh

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
really dig is that you have micro mesh

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.660 
really dig is that you have micro mesh
on<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.959> inside<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.920> fingers<00:02:35.280> right<00:02:35.550> in

this kind of funny little area that's
never<00:02:37.500> really<00:02:37.770> gonna<00:02:37.860> be<00:02:38.040> crash<00:02:38.280> prone<00:02:38.630> what

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
never really gonna be crash prone what

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.760 
never really gonna be crash prone what

they've done is they know that that's an

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.350 
they've done is they know that that's an

you're gonna you're gonna be thankful
that<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.620> have<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:26.009> if<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:27.090> had<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.270> really

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:27.509 
that you have it if I had a really

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:28.850 
that you have it if I had a really
nitpick<00:04:27.900> it's<00:04:28.080> actually<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.350> hard<00:04:28.530> nitpick

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
nitpick it's actually a hard nitpick

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.430 
nitpick it's actually a hard nitpick
here<00:04:29.070> with<00:04:29.250> with<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.729> induction<00:04:30.330> I<00:04:30.660> think

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
here with with the induction I think

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.469 
here with with the induction I think
this<00:04:31.560> is<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.710> really<00:04:32.070> big<00:04:32.280> exposed<00:04:32.729> seam<00:04:33.030> now

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
this is a really big exposed seam now

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.150 
this is a really big exposed seam now
for<00:04:33.630> you<00:04:33.690> guys<00:04:33.840> dual<00:04:34.139> sporting<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.650> whatnot

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
for you guys dual sporting and whatnot

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.710 
for you guys dual sporting and whatnot
I<00:04:35.190> think<00:04:35.550> it's<00:04:35.669> not<00:04:35.820> a<00:04:35.850> big<00:04:36.060> deal<00:04:36.270> but<00:04:36.600> if

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
I think it's not a big deal but if

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.969 
I think it's not a big deal but if
you're<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.840> hardcore<00:04:37.110> Road<00:04:37.470> rider<00:04:37.710> that's

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
you're a hardcore Road rider that's

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.409 
you're a hardcore Road rider that's
really<00:04:38.220> thinking<00:04:38.370> about<00:04:38.550> that<00:04:38.789> lateral<00:04:39.150> side

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
really thinking about that lateral side

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.990 
really thinking about that lateral side
low<00:04:39.690> side<00:04:39.930> craft<00:04:40.199> protection<00:04:40.710> again<00:04:41.400> I'd<00:04:41.669> love

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
low side craft protection again I'd love

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.490 
low side craft protection again I'd love
to<00:04:42.120> see<00:04:42.240> them<00:04:42.360> offset<00:04:42.570> the<00:04:42.840> seam<00:04:43.080> or

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
to see them offset the seam or

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.600 
to see them offset the seam or
encapsulate<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.220> scene<00:04:44.400> with<00:04:44.580> another

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
encapsulate the scene with another

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.490 
encapsulate the scene with another
another<00:04:45.389> piece<00:04:45.630> of<00:04:45.660> leather<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.139> goes<00:04:46.289> all

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
another piece of leather that goes all

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.290

the<00:04:46.530> way<00:04:46.620> up<00:04:46.830> here<00:04:47.009> on<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.280> side<00:04:47.430> again<00:04:47.910> climb

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
the way up here on the side again climb

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.790 
the way up here on the side again climb
if<00:04:48.449> you're<00:04:48.570> listening<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:49.289> is<00:04:49.410> my<00:04:49.590> big

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
if you're listening that is my big

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.170 
if you're listening that is my big
nitpick<00:04:50.130> you're<00:04:50.280> looking<00:04:50.490> at<00:04:50.610> a<00:04:50.639> hundred<00:04:50.970> and

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
nitpick you're looking at a hundred and

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.999

fifty<00:04:51.360> dollar<00:04:51.509> Plus<00:04:51.900> glove<00:04:52.229> and<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:52.830> me<00:04:52.979> I

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:53.009 
fifty dollar Plus glove and to me I

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:54.770 
fifty dollar Plus glove and to me I
think<00:04:53.130> you<00:04:53.460> guys<00:04:53.639> can<00:04:53.820> kind<00:04:54.300> of<00:04:54.360> complete<00:04:54.750> the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
think you guys can kind of complete the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.810 
think you guys can kind of complete the
circle<00:04:55.229> there<00:04:55.410> and<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:56.100> finish<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.550> off<00:04:56.639> on

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
circle there and and finish it off on

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.879 
circle there and and finish it off on
the<00:04:56.910> side<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:57.270> overall<00:04:57.780> it's<00:04:58.260> really<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.590> nice

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
the side but overall it's really a nice

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.620 
the side but overall it's really a nice
option<00:04:59.340> from<00:04:59.460> climb<00:04:59.760> it<00:04:59.970> fits<00:05:00.240> well<00:05:00.419> within

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
option from climb it fits well within

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.939 
option from climb it fits well within
their<00:05:00.810> line<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.260> I<00:05:01.289> think<00:05:01.620> people<00:05:01.800> are<00:05:01.860> going

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
their line and I think people are going

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.379 
their line and I think people are going
to<00:05:02.010> be<00:05:02.130> excited<00:05:02.370> about<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.789> way<00:05:02.880> it<00:05:02.970> performs

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
to be excited about the way it performs

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.360 
to be excited about the way it performs
and<00:05:03.539> the<00:05:03.870> way<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.139> fits<00:05:04.470> between<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.919> mesh<00:05:05.190> and

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
and the way it fits between the mesh and

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.189 
and the way it fits between the mesh and
the<00:05:05.639> perforated<00:05:06.150> panels<00:05:06.389> as<00:05:06.630> well<00:05:06.690> as<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.020> nice
