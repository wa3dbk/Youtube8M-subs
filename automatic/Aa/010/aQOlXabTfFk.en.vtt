protective case out on the market and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.560 
protective case out on the market and
it's<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.220> direct<00:00:23.550> competitor<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.090> OtterBox

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
it's a direct competitor to the OtterBox

it's a direct competitor to the OtterBox
Commuter<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.260> let's<00:00:25.800> crack<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.250> into<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
Commuter so let's crack on into the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.950 
Commuter so let's crack on into the
packaging<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.150> I'll<00:00:27.210> show<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.359> exactly<00:00:27.720> what

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
packaging and I'll show you exactly what

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.870 
packaging and I'll show you exactly what
you<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.289> which<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.949> basically<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.699> case

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you get which is basically just the case

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.530 
you get which is basically just the case
itself<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.070> two-piece<00:00:32.610> case<00:00:32.850> which

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
itself so it is a two-piece case which

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.319 
itself so it is a two-piece case which
features<00:00:33.960> an<00:00:34.110> inner<00:00:34.290> silicone<00:00:34.710> layer<00:00:35.329> it's

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
features an inner silicone layer it's

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.299 
features an inner silicone layer it's
nothing<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.660> special<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.559> pretty

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
nothing really special it's just pretty

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.950 
nothing really special it's just pretty
standard<00:00:38.760> silicone<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.420> still<00:00:39.660> attracts

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
standard silicone and it still attracts

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.020 
standard silicone and it still attracts
a<00:00:40.050> little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.410> lint<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.770> dust<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.879> do

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
a little bit of lint and dust but you do

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.910 
a little bit of lint and dust but you do
have<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.270> hard<00:00:42.600> abs<00:00:42.809> plastic<00:00:43.559> shell<00:00:43.800> which

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
have this hard abs plastic shell which

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
have this hard abs plastic shell which
wraps<00:00:44.219> around<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.390> does<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.840> get

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
wraps around it so this does not get

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.490 
wraps around it so this does not get
much<00:00:46.170> dust<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.829> see<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> want

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
much dust as you can see so what I want

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.720 
much dust as you can see so what I want
to<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:49.920> pop<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> phone

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
to do now is just pop this on the phone

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.279 
to do now is just pop this on the phone
and<00:00:50.910> show<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.120> exactly<00:00:51.360> how<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.780> fits<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.110> it's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and show you exactly how it fits so it's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.439 
and show you exactly how it fits so it's
actually<00:00:52.350> pretty<00:00:52.680> simple<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.190> do<00:00:53.340> work<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
actually pretty simple to do work the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.430 
actually pretty simple to do work the
silicone<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.399> make<00:00:56.399> sure<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.730> all<00:00:56.910> in

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
silicone in there make sure it's all in

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.779 
silicone in there make sure it's all in
place<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.739> then<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> plastic<00:00:59.370> shell

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
place and then you get the plastic shell

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
place and then you get the plastic shell
I<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> start<00:01:00.660> through<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.989> volume

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
I like to start through the volume

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
I like to start through the volume
rocker<00:01:01.410> side<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.239> probably

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
rocker side just because it's probably

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.590 
rocker side just because it's probably
the<00:01:03.660> hardest<00:01:03.989> part<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.379> get<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:06.180> push

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the hardest part to get in and then push

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.870 
the hardest part to get in and then push
it<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:07.020> every<00:01:07.560> corner<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.100> make<00:01:08.430> sure<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.850> in

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it on every corner and make sure it's in

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.840 
it on every corner and make sure it's in
place<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.570> you'll<00:01:10.560> feel<00:01:10.830> site<00:01:11.130> click<00:01:11.430> once

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
place so you'll feel site click once

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.120 
place so you'll feel site click once
everything<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.450> place<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.979> just<00:01:13.979> make

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
everything is in place and just make

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
everything is in place and just make
sure<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> silicone<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.150> not<00:01:15.960> loose<00:01:16.229> or

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
sure the silicone is not loose or

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.260 
sure the silicone is not loose or
anything<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.310> basically<00:01:17.430> what

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
anything so this is basically what

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.359 
anything so this is basically what
you'll<00:01:18.509> end<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.750> with<00:01:19.009> so<00:01:20.009> one<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> major

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
you'll end up with so one of the major

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.039 
you'll end up with so one of the major
design<00:01:20.700> flaws<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.180> One<00:01:21.390> X<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.780> fact

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
design flaws with the One X is the fact

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.719 
design flaws with the One X is the fact
that<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> camera<00:01:22.619> /<00:01:22.770> choose<00:01:22.979> outwards<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that the camera / choose outwards as you

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.700 
that the camera / choose outwards as you
can<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.689> protrudes<00:01:25.110> more<00:01:25.409> than<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
can see so it protrudes more than the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.289 
can see so it protrudes more than the
back<00:01:25.890> itself<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> place<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.060> face

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
back itself so when you place this face

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.670 
back itself so when you place this face
down<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.750> cameras<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> first<00:01:28.409> thing<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
down the cameras the first thing to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.530 
down the cameras the first thing to
touch<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.009> surface<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.150> tough<00:01:30.329> case

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
touch a surface now the tough case

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.120 
touch a surface now the tough case
remedies<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.020> by<00:01:31.409> adding<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.829> little<00:01:31.920> bit<00:01:32.040> of

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
remedies that by adding a little bit of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.039

nice<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:01.420> ample<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.080> no<00:03:02.200> problems<00:03:02.590> with<00:03:02.770> it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
nice and ample so no problems with it

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.670 
nice and ample so no problems with it
now<00:03:03.700> take<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.940> look<00:03:04.030> at<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.450> back<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> tough

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
now take a look at the back of the tough

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.070 
now take a look at the back of the tough
case<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.070> can<00:03:06.220> see<00:03:06.340> this<00:03:06.490> is<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.730> textured<00:03:07.510> ABS

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
case you can see this is a textured ABS

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.220 
case you can see this is a textured ABS
plastic<00:03:08.290> shell<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.610> very<00:03:09.850> tough<00:03:10.240> when

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
plastic shell so it is very tough when

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.290 
plastic shell so it is very tough when
combined<00:03:11.709> with<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:12.070> silicone<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.970> can<00:03:13.120> throw

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
combined with the silicone you can throw

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.240 
combined with the silicone you can throw
this<00:03:13.450> around<00:03:13.630> no<00:03:13.959> real<00:03:14.200> problems<00:03:14.500> with<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:15.070> and

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
this around no real problems with it and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.860 
this around no real problems with it and
the<00:03:15.670> best<00:03:15.790> part<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.209> like<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.420> mentioned<00:03:16.600> is

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
the best part of it like I mentioned is

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.150 
the best part of it like I mentioned is
that<00:03:16.900> it's<00:03:17.110> texture<00:03:17.560> so<00:03:17.709> you'll<00:03:17.830> get<00:03:18.010> some

good scratch protection to the plastic

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.290 
good scratch protection to the plastic
itself<00:03:47.260> is<00:03:47.500> pretty<00:03:47.800> tough<00:03:48.130> now<00:03:48.970> if<00:03:49.060> you're<00:03:49.180> the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
itself is pretty tough now if you're the

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.640 
itself is pretty tough now if you're the
average<00:03:49.450> user<00:03:49.720> that<00:03:49.959> wants<00:03:50.320> something<00:03:50.590> to

average user that wants something to
protect<00:03:51.010> your<00:03:51.130> phone<00:03:51.340> because<00:03:51.550> you're<00:03:51.880> rather

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
protect your phone because you're rather

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.030 
protect your phone because you're rather
prone<00:03:52.300> to<00:03:52.480> dropping<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:53.140> or<00:03:53.320> an<00:03:53.440> awful<00:03:53.739> slips

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
prone to dropping it or an awful slips

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.470 
prone to dropping it or an awful slips
or<00:03:54.220> something<00:03:54.489> like<00:03:54.550> that<00:03:54.610> this<00:03:55.150> is<00:03:55.239> a<00:03:55.300> very

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
or something like that this is a very

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.050 
or something like that this is a very
good<00:03:55.570> case<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.900> go<00:03:56.140> for<00:03:56.440> it<00:03:56.650> retails<00:03:57.280> for<00:03:57.340> $35

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
good case to go for it retails for $35

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.520 
good case to go for it retails for $35
so<00:03:58.269> it's<00:03:58.390> definitely<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.810> premium<00:03:59.170> price<00:03:59.320> to

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
so it's definitely a premium price to

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.650 
so it's definitely a premium price to
pay<00:03:59.709> but<00:03:59.769> your<00:04:00.459> device<00:04:00.700> will<00:04:00.910> be<00:04:00.970> protected<00:04:01.540> if

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.540 
pay but your device will be protected if
you<00:04:01.780> put<00:04:01.930> this<00:04:02.080> on<00:04:02.290> your<00:04:02.440> phone<00:04:02.650> now<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.430> only

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
you put this on your phone now the only

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.009 
you put this on your phone now the only
two<00:04:03.760> cons<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.269> have<00:04:04.390> with<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:04.750> are<00:04:04.870> the

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
two cons that I have with it are the

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.690 
two cons that I have with it are the
fact<00:04:05.260> that<00:04:05.380> like<00:04:05.800> I<00:04:05.920> mentioned<00:04:06.100> the<00:04:06.430> volume

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
fact that like I mentioned the volume

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.400 
fact that like I mentioned the volume
rockers<00:04:07.000> are<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.150> little<00:04:07.239> bit<00:04:07.420> mushy<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:07.930> the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
rockers are a little bit mushy and the

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.050 
rockers are a little bit mushy and the
fact<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.860> isn't<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.160> slimmest<00:04:09.489> of<00:04:09.610> cases

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
fact that it isn't the slimmest of cases

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.090 
fact that it isn't the slimmest of cases
so<00:04:10.239> it<00:04:10.360> will<00:04:10.540> add<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.780> little<00:04:11.019> bit<00:04:11.200> of<00:04:11.260> bulk<00:04:11.890> to

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
so it will add a little bit of bulk to

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.259 
so it will add a little bit of bulk to
your<00:04:12.130> device<00:04:12.459> in<00:04:12.700> a<00:04:12.760> little<00:04:12.910> bit<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.060> weight

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
your device in a little bit of weight

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.090 
your device in a little bit of weight
but<00:04:13.330> the<00:04:14.080> trade-off<00:04:14.380> is<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.830> fact<00:04:15.010> that

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
but the trade-off is the fact that

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.530 
but the trade-off is the fact that
you'll<00:04:15.280> get<00:04:15.430> some<00:04:15.580> very<00:04:15.790> good<00:04:15.940> protection<00:04:16.299> out

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540
