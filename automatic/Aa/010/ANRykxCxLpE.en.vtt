of<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:52.079> younger<00:03:53.079> coaches<00:03:53.560> who<00:03:53.650> actually

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
of the younger coaches who actually

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.229 
of the younger coaches who actually
played<00:03:54.069> it<00:03:54.159> what's<00:03:54.310> for<00:03:54.430> dinner<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:55.030> played

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239

against<00:03:55.599> us<00:03:55.810> while<00:03:56.169> I<00:03:56.200> was<00:03:56.439> here<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.310> I

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
against us while I was here so and I

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.339 
against us while I was here so and I
think<00:03:57.549> better<00:03:57.969> format<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.629> they<00:03:58.810> understand

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
think better format is they understand

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.690 
think better format is they understand
what<00:03:59.439> kind<00:03:59.650> of<00:03:59.709> football<00:03:59.919> people<00:04:00.430> playing

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
what kind of football people playing

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.039 
what kind of football people playing
here<00:04:00.939> at<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.090> University<00:04:01.480> since<00:04:01.689> today<00:04:01.870> I

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
here at the University since today I

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.839 
here at the University since today I
think<00:04:02.139> that<00:04:02.530> is<00:04:02.709> more<00:04:03.370> important<00:04:03.790> than

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
think that is more important than

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.220 
think that is more important than
anything<00:04:04.120> if<00:04:04.389> you<00:04:04.510> have<00:04:04.659> a<00:04:04.689> coaching<00:04:05.049> staff

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
anything if you have a coaching staff

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.659 
anything if you have a coaching staff
doesn't<00:04:05.469> really<00:04:05.709> understand<00:04:06.099> the<00:04:06.189> tradition
