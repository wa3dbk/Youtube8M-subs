00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.900
 in nature it is necessary and also for the 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.690
 quality productions must be avoided 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.090
 monoculture the monoculture is not alone 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.490
 corn as we used to say when 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.930
 there is a culture there is corn after corn la 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.830
 monoculture is always that kind of 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.960
 animal 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.210
 so if you too at home in the 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.539
 your backyard always bred 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.400
 exclusively only 10 hens from eggs 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.230
 we have a monoculture there because those 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.629
 ten and free-range chickens are 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.590
 indeterminate ground eat only 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:39.350
 determined certain herbs and in 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.600
 several years is it is determined 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.520
 a pollution situation then a 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.200
 a certain point in a farm in the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.510
 your backyard but how was one made? 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.719
 time may very well be high 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.270
 in promiscuity chickens rabbit turkeys 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.290
 Pharaoh geese here we also put them 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.700
 together 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.260
 we put it on the other side where there 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.809
 it's the races we put the rabbits on 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.360
 with the geese here are turkeys with 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.600
 guinea fowl with chickens cei a fence 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.729
 wide respecting the space and that is the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.250
 wellness for every animal is possible 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.950
 detect these animals together 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.050
 even even with pork is 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.450
 obvious that those who breed pigs to this 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.640
 point must have a fence however in 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.209
 whoever remembers the old annexes 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.119
 rustic 

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:26.179
 below was the shelter of the pig and up 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.220
 a porter in the shelter of the hens 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.500
 after that sometimes there was also the 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.970
 rabbit and pigeon and why this 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.800
 of course just look at the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.170
 animal behavior when you 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.390
 go feed the pig yourself 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.429
 put in the trough put what you 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.740
 need to stay the pig animal is a 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.840
 he is immediately greedy and must not 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.729
 be no other animal and eat 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.830
 when he's done eating 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.750
 naturally he goes to sleep at this 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.330
 point chickens and other animals 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.479
 they even go out and eat over the 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.429
 pork and so it is absolutely 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.560
 possible to breed under certain conditions 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.869
 of course here in two minutes it is 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.060
 hard enough to say what they are 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.530
 conditions for which I will make an exterior 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.870
 together etc. and so on 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.660
 let's say it's possible 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.580
 every two months we work on the works 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.110
 and seasonal we put what to do which 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.990
 are the concentrations of animals 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.420
 etc. of the same environment there are 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.360
 different animal species living together e 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.610
 they are complementary to each other 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.010
 this is the condition that you will have to 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.320
 realize in your backyard if 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.080
 make this condition the animals 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.820
 they defend together they use better 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.900
 territory and we own gods 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.420
 exceptional products 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.980
 of course when we have so many 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.950
 animals in the same environment 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.720
 there is always danger even when yes 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.760
 he spoke I do n't know about the boulevard influence 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.280
 absolutely don't put chickens 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.860
 together do not put the chickens together 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.850
 together the pigs etc. but the problem 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.440
 sanitary 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.580
 we also see it in the influences of the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.790
 children at school depends 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.200
 basically by concentration 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.390
 the moment we have some 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.330
 excessive concentrations 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.760
 then the disease can arise if 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.940
 breeding is extensive disease 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.040
 therefore breeding in is not born 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.900
 extensive way and what we do 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.390
 also guarantees the quality of the products 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.390
 and avoid diseases and widespread
