hi<00:00:09.330> there<00:00:09.510> guys<00:00:09.690> Colin<00:00:10.200> here<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> thought<00:00:10.980> I

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
hi there guys Colin here and I thought I

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.590 
hi there guys Colin here and I thought I
would<00:00:11.309> put<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.550> out<00:00:11.670> of<00:00:11.700> your<00:00:11.880> misery<00:00:12.059> on<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 
would put you out of your misery on the

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.810 
would put you out of your misery on the
recent<00:00:12.900> amp<00:00:13.110> Blaine<00:00:13.650> full<00:00:13.980> test<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.580> tell<00:00:14.700> you

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
recent amp Blaine full test and tell you

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.760 
recent amp Blaine full test and tell you
which<00:00:15.030> amp<00:00:15.330> was<00:00:15.600> the<00:00:15.750> valve<00:00:15.930> and<00:00:16.170> which<00:00:16.529> one

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
which amp was the valve and which one

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.769 
which amp was the valve and which one
was<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.950> solid<00:00:17.340> state<00:00:17.550> now<00:00:18.180> before<00:00:18.450> we<00:00:18.570> get<00:00:18.660> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
was a solid state now before we get to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.820 
was a solid state now before we get to
the<00:00:18.869> answers<00:00:19.110> I'm<00:00:19.200> going<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.380> say<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.710> when<00:00:19.800> I

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the answers I'm going to say that when I

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.170 
the answers I'm going to say that when I
was<00:00:19.950> playing<00:00:20.099> these<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> room<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.880> thought

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
was playing these in the room I thought

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.179 
was playing these in the room I thought
I'd<00:00:21.330> got<00:00:21.509> them<00:00:21.630> sounding<00:00:22.020> pretty<00:00:22.349> similar<00:00:22.890> but

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
I'd got them sounding pretty similar but

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.440 
I'd got them sounding pretty similar but
when<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> recorded<00:00:23.759> them<00:00:23.880> down<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.210> listened

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
when I recorded them down and listened

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.760 
when I recorded them down and listened
to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.660> recordings<00:00:25.079> back-to-back<00:00:25.619> I

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
to the recordings back-to-back I

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.429 
to the recordings back-to-back I
realized<00:00:26.130> oh<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.329> really<00:00:27.570> obvious<00:00:28.259> it's

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
realized oh this is really obvious it's

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.839 
realized oh this is really obvious it's
obvious<00:00:28.529> which<00:00:28.980> one's<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.310> valve<00:00:29.520> and<00:00:29.700> which

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
obvious which one's the valve and which

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:30.950 
obvious which one's the valve and which
one's<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.119> solid-state<00:00:30.450> that's<00:00:30.720> going<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.899> be

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
one's the solid-state that's going to be

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.179 
one's the solid-state that's going to be
far<00:00:31.169> too<00:00:31.320> easy<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.680> everyone's<00:00:31.980> healing

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
far too easy in everyone's healing

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130 
far too easy in everyone's healing
iterate<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> was<00:00:33.420> quite<00:00:33.540> surprised<00:00:33.930> when

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
iterate so I was quite surprised when

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.930 
iterate so I was quite surprised when
you<00:00:34.230> prove<00:00:34.500> me<00:00:34.530> wrong<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:34.950> about<00:00:35.280> half<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.760> you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you prove me wrong and about half of you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.180 
you prove me wrong and about half of you
got<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.480> completely<00:00:37.050> wrong<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:38.100> that's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
got it completely wrong but that's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.729 
got it completely wrong but that's
probably<00:00:38.790> quite<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.360> good<00:00:39.750> thing<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.649> are

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
probably quite a good thing we are

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.560 
probably quite a good thing we are
bombarded<00:00:41.010> constantly<00:00:41.400> with<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.060> idea<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
bombarded constantly with the idea that

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.810 
bombarded constantly with the idea that
valve<00:00:43.020> amps<00:00:43.410> send<00:00:43.710> better<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.550> well<00:00:44.670> there's

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
valve amps send better and well there's

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
valve amps send better and well there's
a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:44.970> of<00:00:45.060> scientific<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.780> objective

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
a lot of scientific and objective

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.530 
a lot of scientific and objective
reasons<00:00:46.650> why<00:00:46.860> your<00:00:47.130> vinyl<00:00:47.340> valves<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.240> more

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
reasons why your vinyl valves do so more

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.230 
reasons why your vinyl valves do so more
pleasing<00:00:48.840> than<00:00:49.580> solid-state<00:00:50.580> amps<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
pleasing than solid-state amps that

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.090 
pleasing than solid-state amps that
doesn't<00:00:51.690> necessarily<00:00:51.840> mean<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.500> everyone

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
doesn't necessarily mean that everyone

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
doesn't necessarily mean that everyone
prefers<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.000> sound<00:00:54.240> of<00:00:54.450> a<00:00:54.540> valve<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
prefers the sound of a valve up to a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.560 
prefers the sound of a valve up to a
source<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:55.890> amp<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.700> it<00:00:56.790> does<00:00:57.030> mean<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.450> we

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
source the amp but it does mean if we

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.480 
source the amp but it does mean if we
can't<00:00:57.810> really<00:00:57.990> tell<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.740> is<00:00:58.950> which<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
can't really tell which one is which and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.069 
can't really tell which one is which and
the<00:00:59.700> sound<00:00:59.910> test<00:01:00.150> will<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.540> often<00:01:00.810> choose

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the sound test will just often choose

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.229 
the sound test will just often choose
the<00:01:01.200> one<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.739> best<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.430> call<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the one we like the best and call it the

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.960 
the one we like the best and call it the
valve<00:01:03.450> because<00:01:03.870> n<00:01:04.079> remains<00:01:04.589> valve<00:01:05.309> has<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.880> be

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
valve because n remains valve has to be

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
valve because n remains valve has to be
the<00:01:06.090> best<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.509> better<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.930> anyone<00:01:07.170> has<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.799> be

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
the best the better so anyone has to be

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.490 
the best the better so anyone has to be
the<00:01:08.070> valve<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.020> case<00:01:10.259> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the valve and that not the case and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.289 
the valve and that not the case and
you've<00:01:10.619> proved<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> reveal<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you've proved that so to reveal the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.649 
you've proved that so to reveal the
answers<00:01:12.750> amp<00:01:13.050> number<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.790> bagheera

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
answers amp number one was the bagheera

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.320 
answers amp number one was the bagheera
valve<00:01:16.290> amp<00:01:16.740> now<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.550> thought<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> sound<00:01:18.180> of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
valve amp now I thought the sound of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
valve amp now I thought the sound of
this<00:01:18.420> was<00:01:18.570> pretty<00:01:18.720> obviously<00:01:19.380> valve<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
this was pretty obviously valve at a

this was pretty obviously valve at a

much warmer response and filler

much warmer response and filler

a lot thinner and harsher on the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.730 
recording which I thought again would be
fairly<00:01:36.420> obvious<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
fairly obvious that it was the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.250 
fairly obvious that it was the
transistor<00:01:38.430> based<00:01:38.729> amplifier<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> think

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
transistor based amplifier but I think

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.539 
transistor based amplifier but I think
well<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.409> translated<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> lot<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> people

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
well that translated to a lot of people

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.149 
well that translated to a lot of people
was<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.940> was<00:01:42.180> somehow<00:01:42.750> clearer<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.619> mechs

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
was it was somehow clearer and the mechs

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.250 
was it was somehow clearer and the mechs
for<00:01:44.490> them<00:01:44.640> they<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.510> hear<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.930> very

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
for them they could hear it very

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.649 
for them they could hear it very
precisely<00:01:46.470> whereas<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.700> warmer<00:01:48.150> fuller<00:01:48.390> tone

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
precisely whereas the warmer fuller tone

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.109 
precisely whereas the warmer fuller tone
of<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:49.409> valve<00:01:49.619> may<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.130> sounded<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.640> bit<00:01:50.700> in

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
of the valve may be sounded a bit in

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.359 
of the valve may be sounded a bit in
muddy<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.049> not<00:01:52.200> quite<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> clarity<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
muddy are not quite the clarity of the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.570 
muddy are not quite the clarity of the
of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.090> transistor<00:01:54.810> am<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.189> means<00:01:56.430> that

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
of the transistor am so that means that

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.950 
of the transistor am so that means that
people<00:01:56.700> confused<00:01:57.180> about<00:01:57.270> what<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.659> sounded

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
people confused about what one sounded

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.750 
people confused about what one sounded
bit<00:01:58.229> on<00:01:58.439> which<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:58.830> didn't<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.340> heard<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> few

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
bit on which one didn't I heard a few

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.450 
bit on which one didn't I heard a few
comments<00:02:00.030> along<00:02:00.780> those<00:02:01.020> lines<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:02.100> once<00:02:02.310> again

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
comments along those lines so once again

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.789 
comments along those lines so once again
this<00:02:02.909> proves<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:03.510> for<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.810> sound<00:02:04.049> u<00:02:04.260> leik<00:02:04.500> not

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
this proves go for the sound u leik not

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.160 
this proves go for the sound u leik not
for<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.040> sounds<00:02:05.369> you're<00:02:05.490> told<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.119> better<00:02:06.750> if

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
for the sounds you're told is better if

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.839 
for the sounds you're told is better if
you<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.830> sound<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.189> sauce<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.670> amp

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
you like the sound the sauce the amp

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.609 
you like the sound the sauce the amp
then<00:02:09.209> don't<00:02:09.599> let<00:02:09.689> anyone<00:02:09.929> tell<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.500> it's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
then don't let anyone tell you that it's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.320 
then don't let anyone tell you that it's
not<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:11.039> good<00:02:11.189> an<00:02:11.280> amp<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.610> getting<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:12.060> vial<00:02:12.269> of

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
not as good an amp as getting a vial of

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.649 
not as good an amp as getting a vial of
amp

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
amp

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.660 
amp
go<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.140> sound<00:02:13.680> personally<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.519> don't

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
go for that sound personally I don't

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.699 
go for that sound personally I don't
think<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.060> can<00:02:15.180> top<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.870> sound<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.500> good

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
think you can top the sound of a good

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.739 
think you can top the sound of a good
valve<00:02:17.219> not<00:02:17.849> I'm<00:02:18.060> suggesting<00:02:18.299> that<00:02:18.629> the

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:18.749 
valve not I'm suggesting that the

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.019 
valve not I'm suggesting that the
bagheera<00:02:19.079> is<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.319> good<00:02:19.620> valve<00:02:20.040> amplifier<00:02:20.639> it

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:21.029 
bagheera is a good valve amplifier it

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:22.610 
bagheera is a good valve amplifier it
isn't<00:02:21.419> it's<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.599> cheap<00:02:21.810> one

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
isn't it's a cheap one

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.380 
isn't it's a cheap one
does<00:02:22.920> have<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.370> valve<00:02:23.580> characteristics

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
does have the valve characteristics

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.809 
does have the valve characteristics
recently<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.110> had<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> chance<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:26.069> playing<00:02:26.459> quite

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
recently I had a chance of playing quite

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.180 
recently I had a chance of playing quite
an<00:02:26.909> expensive<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.569> valve<00:02:27.870> marshal<00:02:28.620> ahead<00:02:28.950> and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
an expensive in valve marshal ahead and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.089 
an expensive in valve marshal ahead and
the<00:02:29.819> difference<00:02:30.239> is<00:02:30.799> incredible<00:02:31.799> so<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.010> you

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
the difference is incredible so if you

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.770 
the difference is incredible so if you
can<00:02:32.250> spend<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.700> money<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.180> really<00:02:33.599> good

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
can spend the money on a really good

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.539 
can spend the money on a really good
valve<00:02:34.049> out<00:02:34.319> then<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.739> will<00:02:34.920> get<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> better

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
valve out then you will get a better

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.619 
valve out then you will get a better
sound<00:02:35.909> but<00:02:36.980> again<00:02:37.980> very<00:02:38.370> subjective<00:02:38.849> if<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
sound but again very subjective if you

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.410 
sound but again very subjective if you
like<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.989> same-sized<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.769> go<00:02:41.459> for<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.060> so

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
like the same-sized it go for it so

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.910 
like the same-sized it go for it so
maybe<00:02:42.599> the<00:02:42.780> answers<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.200> us<00:02:43.349> have<00:02:43.530> surprised

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
maybe the answers of us have surprised

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.069 
maybe the answers of us have surprised
you<00:02:44.159> maybe<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.909> hasn't<00:02:45.120> maybe<00:02:45.540> your<00:02:45.720> market

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
you maybe it hasn't maybe your market

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.360 
you maybe it hasn't maybe your market
spent<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.440> you're<00:02:46.560> very<00:02:46.769> glad<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.129> got<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
spent on you're very glad you got to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.699 
spent on you're very glad you got to
jump<00:02:47.519> off<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.730> building<00:02:47.849> right<00:02:48.239> now<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:48.930> yeah

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
jump off a building right now but yeah

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.199 
jump off a building right now but yeah
I'm<00:02:50.069> gonna<00:02:50.250> do<00:02:50.430> some<00:02:50.610> more<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.819> these<00:02:50.940> blame

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
I'm gonna do some more of these blame

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.839 
I'm gonna do some more of these blame
full<00:02:51.450> sort<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.780> things<00:02:51.989> in<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.829> future<00:02:53.010> it's

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
full sort of things in the future it's

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.490 
full sort of things in the future it's
just<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.150> good<00:02:54.329> better<00:02:54.510> fun<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.780> think<00:02:55.109> rather

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
just a good better fun I think rather

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.830 
just a good better fun I think rather
than<00:02:55.650> try<00:02:56.069> to<00:02:56.129> prove<00:02:56.489> everyone<00:02:56.879> wrong<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.780> a

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
than try to prove everyone wrong just a

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.089 
than try to prove everyone wrong just a
good<00:02:58.019> bit<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.170> fun<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.500> see<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:58.709> we<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:58.920> guess

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
good bit of fun to see if we can guess

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.130 
good bit of fun to see if we can guess
what<00:02:59.459> gear<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.790> what<00:03:00.000> anyway<00:03:00.690> that's<00:03:00.930> enough

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
what gear is what anyway that's enough

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.729 
what gear is what anyway that's enough
for<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.410> one

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
for this one

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.329 
for this one
keep<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.160> load<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.549> I'll<00:03:02.670> see<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.030> later<00:03:03.120> guys
