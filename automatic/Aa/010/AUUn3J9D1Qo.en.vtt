00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.799
 welcome everyone you are on the channel 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 by lord channel and today I will 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:16.049
 review a car called infernus 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 as you notice this is not inferno composed 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.460
 mod on it is honda asuras the point is 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.080
 that infernus is a real prototype 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.470
 car here it is exactly all the details 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.420
 traced all the great model just 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 chic 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:39.050
 if you like it i will do 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 issues about various machines 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:48.260
 I am now at the test site 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:51.960
 where I note the time I will note the time and 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.920
 acceleration time and lap time later 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.340
 compare them with other machines to 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 it was honest I will not 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.430
 use nitro so let's stand 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.320
 on the line then I will tell why me 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.880
 like and to the farm with why is mine 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.290
 favorite car to start come dough 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.799
 for how much it accelerates from 0 to 80 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.040
 decided to take the number 80 because well, not 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.229
 all cars once visible only infernus 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.229
 accelerates to a hundred and twenty 3 and 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.119
 You can only compare it with others. 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.939
 80 kilometers per hour 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.090
 80 kilometers an hour drive any cars and 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.549
 so overclocking from 0 to 80 I will see later 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:53.329
 records count how much it will be and 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:53.329
 I will inform you so go 1 2 3 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:05.680
 80 so my next test is for 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.630
 how many times will the circle come i will drive three circles 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.060
 pick the best again by appointment 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.860
 choose the best time 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:22.260
 the medic is worth it he is not calling me calling 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.260
 no one calls and so 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:33.250
 important places and I'll start with the end 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.280
 will be started not I'm this white 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.400
 white stripes 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.450
 the fact is that the second third round and they 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.180
 will be on the go and will be held with 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.540
 overclocking that is if you left on 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.590
 starting line and I would start 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.900
 drove round 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.410
 Naturally more than the next 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.940
 others because others will not be started 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.720
 I will not come at speed 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.019
 accelerate and so well let's go now 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.480
 I will try to go the ideal route as 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.489
 perfect to the best of my ability i'm not 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.600
 I will use nitro to make it all 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.600
 everything was gorgeous 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.359
 the very first for us is not very good me 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.799
 It turned but still ahead of the two circles have 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:26.079
 everyone my driving style I will 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:30.389
 other machines enter the same way too 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.389
 so I thought the results would be fair 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.019
 I will compare the car in two 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.270
 the characteristics are overclocking from 0 to 80 and 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.330
 for how many I will drive the circle 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:47.890
 left a half circle important thing not to forget 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.230
 point of reference there she is white there 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.750
 medic what is worth it and I do not know where he came from 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:59.380
 generally took on infernuses very much 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:05.070
 it is good to take turns on controlled 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:08.200
 at any speed you go 120 or 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.380
 or less thought if even more would be 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.620
 everything is great just gorgeous and control 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.299
 agree so this is the third lap I 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.220
 a little rhinestone and moved out nothing 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.280
 other machines will also be Krivorukov 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:29.530
 managed that everything is fair to me 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:34.030
 already crossed the finish line and so ethics 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:38.890
 stand and summarize now I will 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:45.460
 count and informed you and so ready 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:49.120
 the results of my test and so overclocking from 0 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.790
 to 80 has passed for four and a half 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.330
 seconds and obskazal even closer to 5 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:59.760
 a little four and a half thing 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:04.740
 that there are no modern phones 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:08.520
 stopwatch problem further 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:12.599
 time during which I went round first 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:17.759
 I passed the lap in 26 seconds and the second lap 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:21.539
 was passed in for 24 and third lap for 25 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:26.190
 seconds so the best time is on the second 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:31.910
 the lap is 24 24 seconds 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:35.759
 For a sheet I will bring in the table all this will be 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:44.819
 so i will review other machines not 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:50.569
 only infernus compare so now about 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:50.569
 the price of the broadcast but worth 6 million 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.090
 discs and nitrogen are mounted on it 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.020
 still hydraulics but hydraulics my who not 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:05.370
 puts for the known reasons further one 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:09.080
 772 percent worth it to if 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.080
 repair workshop and 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:17.130
 his maximum speed is 123 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:22.310
 kilometer per hour is the fastest car 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.310
 in Game 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.460
 so I advise everyone and about 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.250
 manageability I think that heavy 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:35.150
 turning it plus they minus come back 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:37.160
 as the machine should be easily controlled 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.870
 at high speed and if there will be 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.600
 worn from side to side it will be 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.670
 tin and so and the final jump 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.810
 risky because i'm the owner and 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:50.270
 percentage shoot okay let's go at the end 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:55.090
 the tracks have two jumps I don't know on 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.090
 what I jumped cross on the highest 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.970
 I need to see the day in advance I do not see 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:06.230
 the difference here is high like 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:09.530
 nitrogen and i'm flying and here's such a perfect 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:14.960
 perfect straight bumper didn't even hit 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:17.270
 I just had a perfect jump 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.980
 gorgeous car did not hurt at all 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:25.340
 then I squeezed the subway late when already 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:29.120
 jumped it turned on oh well on this 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:31.850
 I finish the review infernus and all 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.950
 Thank you for your attention and write to 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:38.320
 comments which car would you like 

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.320
 see in the next issue
