00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:49.190 
so I don't know if I can bend this metal
sort<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.460> thick<00:02:41.730> oh<00:02:46.970> well<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.270> don't<00:02:48.810> know<00:02:49.050> it

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
sort of a thick oh well I don't know it

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.530 
sort of a thick oh well I don't know it
don't<00:02:49.260> look<00:02:49.470> all<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.710> thick

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
don't look all that thick

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.340 
don't look all that thick
it's<00:02:51.540> pretty<00:02:51.840> thin<00:02:52.110> really<00:02:52.380> post<00:02:53.310> it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
it's pretty thin really post it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.060 
it's pretty thin really post it
over<00:02:59.270> anyway<00:03:00.270> I've<00:03:00.780> done<00:03:00.990> Bennett<00:03:01.410> taking<00:03:01.980> it

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
over anyway I've done Bennett taking it

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.950 
over anyway I've done Bennett taking it
up<00:03:02.220> with<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.430> trying<00:03:03.300> to<00:03:03.390> pick<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.600> up<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:03.870> a

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
up with a trying to pick it up with a

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.910 
up with a trying to pick it up with a
loader<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:06.140> surprisingly<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.350> not<00:03:07.410> rusted

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
loader and surprisingly it's not rusted

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.390 
loader and surprisingly it's not rusted
through<00:03:09.200> terribly<00:03:10.200> bad<00:03:10.410> but<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:10.830> is<00:03:10.860> kind<00:03:11.310> of

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
through terribly bad but it is kind of

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.160 
through terribly bad but it is kind of
rusty<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:12.620> was<00:03:13.620> looking<00:03:13.890> at<00:03:13.980> this<00:03:14.190> up<00:03:14.370> here<00:03:15.170> this

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
rusty I was looking at this up here this

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.350 
rusty I was looking at this up here this
I<00:03:16.470> thought<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:16.890> was<00:03:17.220> spinning<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.880> think<00:03:18.180> it's

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
I thought it was spinning I think it's

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.470 
I thought it was spinning I think it's
actually<00:03:18.540> thicker<00:03:18.990> than<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.440> it's<00:03:19.890> uh<00:03:20.480> it's

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
actually thicker than that it's uh it's

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.120 
actually thicker than that it's uh it's
a<00:03:21.570> roll<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.810> galvanized<00:03:22.680> metal<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:25.130> it

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
a roll of galvanized metal and it

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.900 
a roll of galvanized metal and it
wouldn't<00:03:26.430> be<00:03:27.230> terribly<00:03:28.230> hard<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.740> fix<00:03:29.430> but<00:03:29.880> I

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
wouldn't be terribly hard to fix but I

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.250 
wouldn't be terribly hard to fix but I
don't<00:03:30.150> know<00:03:30.270> how<00:03:30.450> easy<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:31.020> would<00:03:31.110> be<00:03:31.140> to

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
don't know how easy it would be to

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.070 
don't know how easy it would be to
straighten<00:03:31.800> out<00:03:35.540> kind<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.660> edges<00:03:36.959> are

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
straighten out kind of the edges are

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.360 
straighten out kind of the edges are
kind<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.380> bent<00:03:37.620> up

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
kind of bent up

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.670 
kind of bent up
that's<00:03:39.849> it<00:03:40.090> but<00:03:40.980> actually<00:03:43.379> that's<00:03:44.379> probably

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
that's it but actually that's probably

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.670 
that's it but actually that's probably
as<00:03:45.069> thick<00:03:45.370> as<00:03:45.580> that<00:03:45.790> other<00:03:46.180> sheet<00:03:46.950> it's<00:03:47.950> smooth

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
as thick as that other sheet it's smooth

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.030 
as thick as that other sheet it's smooth
and<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.800> got<00:03:51.099> plenty<00:03:51.370> of<00:03:51.580> it<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:53.560> looks<00:03:53.830> in

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
and I got plenty of it that looks in

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.789 
and I got plenty of it that looks in
pretty<00:03:54.280> decent<00:03:54.580> shape<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:55.180> don't<00:03:55.330> know<00:03:55.420> what

pretty decent shape I don't know what

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.410 
pretty decent shape I don't know what

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.740 
do these no work would you recommend
using<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:18.160> galvanized<00:04:20.070> over<00:04:21.360> the<00:04:22.360> rusty

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
using the galvanized over the rusty

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.629 
using the galvanized over the rusty
sheetmetal<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:24.150> may<00:04:25.150> or<00:04:25.300> may<00:04:25.450> not<00:04:25.479> convinced

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
sheetmetal I may or may not convinced

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.790 
sheetmetal I may or may not convinced
I'm<00:04:27.639> pretty<00:04:28.030> sure<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:28.540> galvanized<00:04:29.080> looks

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
I'm pretty sure that galvanized looks

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.350 
I'm pretty sure that galvanized looks
like<00:04:29.979> it's<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.490> model<00:04:31.060> boy<00:04:31.500> so<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.970> all<00:04:34.120> being

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
like it's a model boy so it all being

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.080

fairly easy later we'll get this on

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.510 
fairly easy later we'll get this on
