00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello friends swami benders 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.670
 Today's mod will love it 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.770
 all lovers of emerald 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.690
 in general, the current mod will add maycroft 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.179
 so many things that you can 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.370
 make of emerald even your own world 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.130
 be able to make an emerald general let's 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.020
 let's start paul of weapons weapons 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.180
 by the way here in this mod is enough 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.350
 much here we have both ordinary sword and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.960
 healthy sword 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.539
 it still has and even katana and get a gun and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.369
 bow and arrow all one is different only by 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.439
 its damage and appearance ie 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.480
 By the way, I myself have just recently a leg while 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.730
 here's a weapon crooked called this 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.860
 so all these weapons are different by 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.250
 Damage for example big one will wear 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.770
 big and world Yezovsky sword h14 damage with 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 such damage unless on a dragon to go 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.930
 well, the smallest is an ordinary sword 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.360
 then we have 11 11 and 12 damage 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.340
 even we have a bow and arrow specifically 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.899
 for him if you shoot with 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 using this set using such 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.500
 arrows and mirold you well croft from the very 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.449
 things aren't that expensive either 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.239
 tolerable in general if you build from 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.010
 this bow and this arrow you will 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.350
 set fire to your goal like this 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.810
 way to burn wear very much 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.119
 damage it was cool enough 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.229
 generally let's watch the following things 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.479
 we go further 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.280
 tools that are added well 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.479
 everything is pretty standard here 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.040
 we have a complete set of tools 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.439
 for example shovel pickax ax even chopper 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.009
 there is and there is still some thing which 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.200
 called 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.000
 gaining stub in general is enough 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.729
 interesting thing and let me show 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.650
 how it works with it 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.810
 in such a way to blow up the territory 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.000
 around you it's dangerous enough because 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.159
 that you are likely to cause yourself damage 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.930
 but overall you were pretty cool 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.329
 honestly what seems to me like that 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.490
 the thing will be convenient to dig mine though how 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.590
 convenient you die immediately so not very 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.299
 convenient but the second thing is much more 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.850
 useful it will set fire 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.439
 set fire to a difficult but green flame and 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.479
 as you probably guessed help 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.700
 lighters we will make a portal to the world 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.469
 old wear from where it would seem to us 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.990
 the Wright brothers could be found 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.820
 only in the mountains and in 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.860
 he rarely met now he will 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.140
 much more likely to date with if you 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.099
 make a special portal and this one 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.290
 portal crafting 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.970
 let's go and see what else 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.250
 there is this fashion and then the third portal 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.500
 eat apple world idol eat emerald 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.900
 seed, meaning plants can be planted 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.239
 honey you will have wheat enough 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.040
 interesting is the world ice cake new 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.560
 all the standard can eat it and 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.680
 probably tasty enough though kushik not 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.569
 mineral cake is not my choice 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.849
 look further here we have all sorts 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.519
 mechanisms that are associated with samira dam 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.330
 This emerald stove and emerald 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.670
 there is no and 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.709
 emerald torch and dies in 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.470
 light bulbs camera 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.239
 Ledovskaya door and obse affairs died out to us 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.459
 should expect see how it works 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.170
 on choporova sardines that green 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.620
 dynamite is interesting enough so 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.170
 Harry 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.890
 hey well what are you alone buddy what are you not 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.930
 blow up 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.180
 Well, he exploded after some time 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.099
 as you can see the explosion is much more than from 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.019
 normal dynamite but not so straight 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.940
 quite the same we have a nemirovskaya 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.860
 Klitschko how it differs different us 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.480
 speed much faster she 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.760
 will melt than a regular stove further 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.239
 There is an option numbers Ledovsky and where he 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.549
 simpler 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.709
 stronger than a normal obs then 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.209
 this is uber obsidian as far as i know 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.970
 let's just do it now 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.010
 from this world of Lviv obsidian 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.230
 portal and actually about such 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.090
 portal but for now we will not enter it 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.829
 two more doors the usual door which 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.730
 you can open it looks cool 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.489
 virality 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.650
 and 2 is the obsidian world before the Emeralds 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.350
 skaya doors and rip far more difficult than 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.480
 iron door and it is activated exactly 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.970
 just like a regular iron door 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.220
 lever or torch but we still have 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.690
 here, of course, the torches of peace 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.660
 how is it without him so green 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.730
 the light is cool enough but the dispenser is well 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.370
 I won't talk about him wait 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.870
 bacon go distribute bacon honestly not 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.000
 I know what this thing is write in 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.130
 comments well and last you forgot 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.600
 show here still have steps here 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.639
 such here and hole ice steps 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.100
 cool enough well and now let's 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:06.200
 go straight to heaven 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.850
 but rather dying out a new world and now 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.220
 I hope to generate 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.140
 nothing will fly out as it usually happens 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.910
 when i 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.880
 show mods that add different 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.489
 generation and we fall as the flow of your well 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.650
 division we fall into lacquer that 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.900
 strangely enough friends because in 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.390
 the description of this mod was written that he 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.350
 will add emerald skimmer that is 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.650
 description 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.450
 lying to be honest but none the less sorry 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.610
 of course there is no peace of the Lithuanian world 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.830
 you will have to look and mirolds in the usual 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.690
 world well, we are in hell for now and let you 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.700
 show more funny thing that is in 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.650
 This has all sorts of fashion world Ledovskikh 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.600
 things that I really understand 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.300
 would be absolutely useless like for example and 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.520
 world of Mordovia sticks ice dust 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.020
 which can not be laid out that is she 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.150
 uses most likely only in craft 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.570
 torches of some kind and peace 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.640
 bone too all useless yundo is 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.100
 skyworm sky potion and this kind 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.530
 useful this potion that if you 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.140
 knock it overlaid you absolutely everything 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.680
 effects that minecraft have 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.080
 It will speed jumping invisibility 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.790
 the nausea effect is generally all that is 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.040
 general guys it's time to end with this 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.490
 mod such a drug addict and simple 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.560
 but tax emeralds do not happen 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.150
 On this, friends are basically everything 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.950
 thanks for watching you would be 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.950
 deliver dumped bye bye bye bye
