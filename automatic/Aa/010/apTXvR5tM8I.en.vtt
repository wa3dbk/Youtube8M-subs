00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.640
 so for this beginner course I you 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.160
 proposes in fact that we link two 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.950
 parties a couple part and a part 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.190
 chorus so a couple part and who is going 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.250
 play arpeggios with small 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.680
 specificities I explain this to you after 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.240
 and a chorus part that we will play in 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.610
 agree with power ropes etc 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.320
 the things you already know so 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.769
 the best is that I play you then 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.539
 I'll break it down after you go 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:37.539
 two three cases 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.409
 and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.790
 Oh 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.079
 so that's the first agreement that's very 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.460
 simple which I won to replay the doubs 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.899
 on the big rhin gorge in the 8th box 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.860
 the accord of the gela shudder empty and 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:52.069
 I'm going to play the octave back on 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.069
 the d string in the 10th box and I 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.429
 just want to come by p &amp; g mekas 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.429
 rope 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:17.330
 then I go back down right thing 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:20.150
 a group of 6 note 1 2 3 5 6 knowing 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.459
 that's specificity so where do these notes 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.380
 it's that when I play the half rope 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.390
 I'm serious in the most acute Notes 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.360
 the rope on the rope 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.190
 leader with the other two horns 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.359
 on the rope but it's more acute than 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.630
 our that I'm ringing on the coast 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.630
 below 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.130
 if I have something quite confusing 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.130
 compared to the right hand 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.299
 if I were a little bit the notes that 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.810
 launched to body so in fact everything 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.879
 simply I will play so the 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.700
 console what would we acquire 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:03:01.440
 Huge and help with tonic cistes tonic 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.700
 fifth second chord I'm just going 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.540
 recover change there what to come 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.459
 a reverse always the rope of a vision 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.459
 that in 2012 and luxey the train station of the city 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:20.299
 which would make us at that moment a 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.379
 tonic of the caps and 7 eminem card 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.810
 then I 'm going absolutely thing but I 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:31.110
 be low for the second cyclo 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:35.849
 okay so I my friends on bass 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:40.519
 I always hurt us there was what 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:47.579
 offered comical minor quarters 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:48.750
 tony case it was minor tinner and 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.060
 then I will change a little bit 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.329
 the agreement since I'm playing well at the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.879
 low and I'll finally do that when 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.810
 david always i'm going to play high at the 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:05.269
 second box and I always added 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:13.519
 insolent what will we do all 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:13.519
 major pieces 6 t he to say 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.919
 so that's frankly okay 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.919
 arrested 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.980
 the next part in the head does present 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:52.180
 no particular difficulties is 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:53.230
 that agreements of 15 only thing that I 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.050
 actually do it is when I see the 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.760
 rope with the hue on the rope of the 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.550
 to get a little more thickness in 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.230
 do I double the fifth to the octave to 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.230
 below what makes a cardboard 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.930
 which allows to get on board 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.620
 it's more interesting and 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:15.789
 it's more effective for this kind of 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.789
 piece here
