so as you see I have a blue arrow show

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.779 
so as you see I have a blue arrow show
which<00:00:12.809> I'll<00:00:13.049> be<00:00:13.169> using<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.740> get<00:00:13.949> to<00:00:14.249> a<00:00:14.280> secret

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:14.789 
which I'll be using to get to a secret

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.419 
which I'll be using to get to a secret
flagpole<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.539> this<00:00:15.690> level<00:00:16.110> so<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.800> secret

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:17.429 
flagpole in this level so that secret

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.339 
flagpole in this level so that secret
flagpole<00:00:17.939> leads<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:20.060> water<00:00:21.060> pipe<00:00:21.330> which<00:00:21.810> the

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:22.349 
flagpole leads to a water pipe which the

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.759 
flagpole leads to a water pipe which the
world<00:00:22.589> pipe<00:00:22.830> leads<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.669> the<00:00:23.820> castle<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:25.560> you

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
world pipe leads to the castle so if you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.230 
world pipe leads to the castle so if you
come<00:00:25.949> here<00:00:26.099> there<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.550> new<00:00:26.730> enemy<00:00:26.939> which

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
come here there is this new enemy which

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.519
