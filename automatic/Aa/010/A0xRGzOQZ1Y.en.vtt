00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.770
 hi is game addiction today release 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.170
 war thunder videos will be different 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.930
 from the rest we will talk not only 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.780
 and not so much gameplay as about history 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.790
 military equipment and start with the top 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.680
 German aircraft on 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.360
 the lack of effectiveness of which 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.760
 many players complain 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.370
 my try to answer the question as 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.030
 how strong they should be on 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.030
 really 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.370
 let me introduce you to the legend 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.489
 fighter aircraft of the second world 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.580
 messerschmitt bf-109 which in the ussr 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.280
 got the nickname skinny no doubt this 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.710
 outstanding fighting machine but at the same time 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.820
 and this is noticed not only by pros but also 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.670
 ordinary players 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.010
 noticeably lagging behind classmates but 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.690
 because the technique in the game is set up in theory 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.970
 exact compliance with flight 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.520
 technical characteristics of real 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.290
 prototypes in this case lag 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.509
 which we see should be somehow 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.360
 due historically let's 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.369
 let's figure it out 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.830
 its origin is the famous sirir from 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.700
 messerschmidt obep 108 which was 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.520
 designed in 1934 and in the Luftwaffe 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.710
 used as a connected aircraft exactly 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.500
 This car gave Willy Messerschmitt 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.320
 proper experience in creating a monoplane part 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.070
 solutions used on 108 one to 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.590
 moved to one and 109 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.110
 the first combat 109 received the designation a 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.689
 bc and managed to take part in 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.450
 civil war in spain there them 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.299
 Soviet and 16 were the main opponents 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.850
 Nicholas Polykarpov Combat Designs 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.040
 the quality of the machines were plus or minus close and 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.220
 much was solved by the skill of flight personnel 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.080
 each side 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.560
 almost to the end of the spanish war appeared 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.019
 new modification bf-109 e received 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.170
 nickname emil on him set 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.780
 daimler benz engine 601 a instead 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.959
 junkers 210 g which gave a significant 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.250
 increase in maximum speed and 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.100
 the climb rate has also been enhanced 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.150
 armament added 2 root cannons 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.100
 firms erlika 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.560
 the weight of the aircraft increased 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.430
 slightly and aerodynamics even 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.610
 improve 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.010
 Perhaps it is a modification of Emil can 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.890
 considered the most successful aircraft of the series 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.050
 it was he who became the pinnacle of the development of the ride 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.230
 originally pledged power on 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.390
 strength architecture 109 with perfect 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.660
 for its time balance of speed and 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.200
 maneuverability 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.640
 Friedrich bf 109f became a development 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.370
 more powerful engine 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.209
 + field modernization system which 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.790
 among the players 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.610
 known as suspensions with this wing and 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.739
 its mechanization flaps and ailerons and 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.450
 the like were virtually none 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.310
 affected 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.980
 respectively, aerodynamics deteriorated and 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.080
 as a result, the horizontal decreased 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.239
 maneuverability machine constructors 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.580
 sacrificed flight qualities for 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.790
 Frederick's fighting power became the embodiment 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.230
 all that you can survive from the design and 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.420
 and technical maximum ideally development 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.670
 the series should have ended exactly on 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.340
 Frederick and Messerschmitt would start 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.310
 development of a fundamentally new machine 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.920
 Alas, this idea was abandoned and started 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:51.019
 the fatal way of degradation model 1941 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.030
 the year appeared bf-109 g 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.430
 gustav further attempts him 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.560
 upgrades were more like walking 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.709
 around all the time something tossed 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.230
 corrected was released about 17 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.180
 models of Gustav car turned 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.610
 too heavy due to the new engine 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.950
 which let and gave an increase in 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.910
 speeds but significantly worsened 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.269
 aerodynamics 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.100
 and overall flight performance 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.290
 get a vicious circle when installing 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.380
 more powerful engine increases and 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.030
 fuel consumption and coolant consumption 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.919
 more weight means you need to increase 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.440
 structural strength and this 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.840
 if without alteration of the whole scheme is solved 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.570
 only weighting parts harder 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.990
 details means the engine is needed even more powerful 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.930
 and harder and start over with 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.750
 weighting machines themselves are increasing and 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.520
 dimensions that are bad for 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.770
 aerodynamics designers have come to that 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.139
 that since the sixth model began 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.470
 use wood and low quality 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.710
 steel and the tail wheel became 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.110
 non-retractable 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.840
 all to somehow reduce the mass 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.870
 simply speaking, Gustav himself was already 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.310
 raped and cars from architecture 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.860
 who squeezed the last drops 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.770
 about the heir of gustav bf-109 to 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.360
 you can not talk too much, he continued 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.880
 same glorious tradition 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.729
 even more powerful engine enhanced 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.169
 weapons is not surprising that the top 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.849
 skinny in the game flies like on rails 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:25.099
 looking at this development of the series becomes 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.050
 obviously how and when messerschmidt and 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.419
 lost air superiority 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.550
 Germanyâ€™s opponents are much more 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.500
 intelligently developed their own air force 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.539
 adopting new types 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.680
 fighters and properly 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.800
 modify old 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.840
 109 killed first weight 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.539
 dice culture last modified 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.750
 weighed almost one and a half times more than 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:50.479
 109-b opened essentially the same 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.900
 and no reinforcement designs help 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:56.510
 could no longer have been technological 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.630
 optimum am friedrich technology 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.220
 maximum and all further 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.280
 let's talk technology have played their 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.919
 role and some aspects of construction 109 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.180
 firstly primitive and ineffective 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.250
 wing mechanization 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.690
 precisely because of this thin bad 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.020
 maneuvers in a horizontal plane 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.060
 Secondly, the cockpit device that gave not 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.970
 A sufficient overview which, moreover, 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.130
 deteriorated with each new modification all 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.830
 these flaws were initially perceived 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.599
 as permissible but little by little 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:30.680
 accumulated aggravated and brighter 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:33.670
 manifested themselves Messerschmitt behind 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.860
 advanced fighter 43 44 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.540
 years the sky was captured by a British hacker 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.090
 tempest mk5 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.720
 The latest Soviet Spitfire models 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.720
 la-7 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.350
 and yak-3 and american mustangs with 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.600
 lightning 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.060
 our reasoning confirms and 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.070
 the initial gene of the headquarters of the Luftwaffe General 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.870
 Halder 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.330
 the point was not only that release 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.730
 aircraft did not increase new types 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.100
 no aircraft were also foreseen at the end 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.170
 wars we flew cars of the same types 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.480
 let it be deeply modernized as 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:07.930
 at the beginning of the war it was the largest 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:11.290
 the failure of our aviation industry 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.360
 all your feedback is required 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.670
 leave in the comments whether you want not 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.410
 only gaming but also historical videos 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.720
 about war thunder military equipment 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.790
 if the date what you want to know 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:26.910
 write soon 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.910
 and with you there was gambling see you soon
