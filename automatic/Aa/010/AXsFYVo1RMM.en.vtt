00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
pencil like beam down the road with the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.080 
pencil like beam down the road with the
LED<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> area<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.700> front<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> your

straight<00:02:07.590> white<00:02:07.890> light<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.179> installation

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
straight white light so the installation

straight white light so the installation
piece<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.259> video<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
piece of this video is going to be a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.470 
piece of this video is going to be a
little<00:02:11.160> bit<00:02:11.340> longer<00:02:11.550> than<00:02:11.730> normal<00:02:11.790> because

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
little bit longer than normal because

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
little bit longer than normal because
drag<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.050> managed

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
drag is managed

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.470 
drag is managed
cover<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.100> many<00:02:14.250> hardly<00:02:14.640> models<00:02:14.940> with<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.240> few

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
cover so many hardly models with so few

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.390 
cover so many hardly models with so few
part<00:02:15.780> numbers<00:02:16.080> there<00:02:16.500> are<00:02:16.650> some<00:02:16.860> specific

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
part numbers there are some specific

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.040 
part numbers there are some specific
things<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:18.090> should<00:02:18.270> know<00:02:18.390> about<00:02:18.420> various

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
models so let's sort of break them down

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.970 
models so let's sort of break them down
as<00:02:20.700> we<00:02:21.120> go<00:02:21.270> through<00:02:21.570> each<00:02:21.600> lamp<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.590> five<00:02:22.800> and

as we go through each lamp the five and
three-quarter<00:02:23.460> inch<00:02:23.610> headlamp<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.630> is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
three-quarter inch headlamp this is

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.390 
three-quarter inch headlamp this is
going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.260> used<00:02:25.440> as<00:02:25.560> we<00:02:25.710> set<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:25.980> Sportsters

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
going to be used as we set on Sportsters

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.160 
going to be used as we set on Sportsters
and<00:02:26.580> Dinah's<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.210> Sportster<00:02:27.750> fellows<00:02:28.050> you

and Dinah's you Sportster fellows you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.210 
and Dinah's you Sportster fellows you
might<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.410> looking<00:02:28.650> at<00:02:28.740> this<00:02:28.800> saying<00:02:29.040> well
