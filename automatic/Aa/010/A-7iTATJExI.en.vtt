to them or not but you did bring up a
good<00:00:56.610> an<00:00:57.090> interesting<00:00:57.570> point<00:00:57.840> about<00:00:57.960> how

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
good an interesting point about how

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.619 
good an interesting point about how
these<00:00:58.530> been<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> long<00:00:59.670> flight<00:01:00.059> probably<00:01:00.329> for

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
these been a long flight probably for

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.420 
these been a long flight probably for
these<00:01:00.750> people<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.410> they've<00:01:01.649> did<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
these people and now they've did a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.500 
these people and now they've did a
missed<00:01:02.730> approach<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.239> they're<00:01:03.329> coming

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
missed approach and they're coming

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.060 
missed approach and they're coming
around<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> buildings<00:01:04.949> are

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
around but you can see the buildings are

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.380 
around but you can see the buildings are
getting<00:01:05.309> larger<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.790> he's<00:01:05.909> getting<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.270> little

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
getting larger so he's getting a little

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.840 
getting larger so he's getting a little
bit<00:01:06.600> lower<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> 405<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:08.070> sure<00:01:08.220> so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
bit lower there is the 405 for sure so

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.399 
bit lower there is the 405 for sure so
he'll<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> ground<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.960> just<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
he'll be here on the ground in just a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.530 
he'll be here on the ground in just a
second<00:01:10.950> or<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.490> mean<00:01:11.970> get<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.420> bit

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
second or so I mean get a little bit

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.940 
second or so I mean get a little bit
tighter<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.260> watch<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.650> make<00:01:13.799> this

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
tighter so we can watch and make this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.039 
tighter so we can watch and make this
landing<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.119> see<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> he's<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> very

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
landing but you can see it he's a very

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.170 
landing but you can see it he's a very
steady<00:01:16.409> very<00:01:16.560> slow<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.790> come<00:01:17.939> over<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
steady very slow it's just come over the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.969 
steady very slow it's just come over the
fence<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.290> should<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.470> seeing<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
fence there so it should be seeing the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.580 
fence there so it should be seeing the
runway<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.210> second<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.720> there's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
runway here in just a second and there's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.080 
runway here in just a second and there's
the<00:01:22.799> runway<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.400> we're<00:01:23.549> looking<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the runway and we're looking for the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.120 
the runway and we're looking for the
numbers<00:01:24.509> those<00:01:25.170> are<00:01:25.320> those<00:01:25.409> big<00:01:25.680> numbers<00:01:26.009> we

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
numbers those are those big numbers we

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.380 
numbers those are those big numbers we
see<00:01:26.310> painted<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> ground<00:01:27.060> that's<00:01:27.210> where

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
see painted on the ground that's where
