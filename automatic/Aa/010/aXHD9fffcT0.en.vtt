honest to me they seem very very simple
to<00:02:22.850> understand<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.900> maybe<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.709> easier<00:02:24.950> just

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
to understand so maybe it's easier just

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.370 
to understand so maybe it's easier just

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.320 
haul it to the right hand side yes I
think<00:04:37.370> this<00:04:37.580> is<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.760> intensity<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.240> color

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
think this is the intensity the color

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:45.580 
think this is the intensity the color
goes<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.230> full<00:04:39.380> brightness<00:04:39.680> again<00:04:44.590> other

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
goes to the full brightness again other

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.610 
goes to the full brightness again other
thing<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:45.980> can<00:04:46.100> do<00:04:46.280> there<00:04:46.460> as<00:04:46.640> well<00:04:46.850> as<00:04:47.620> again

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
thing you can do there as well as again

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.190 
thing you can do there as well as again
on<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:49.250> wheel<00:04:49.460> if<00:04:49.670> you<00:04:50.390> hold<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.750> down<00:04:51.080> at

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
on the wheel if you hold that down at

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.310 
on the wheel if you hold that down at
the<00:04:51.230> bottom<00:04:52.570> adults<00:04:53.570> it<00:04:53.660> keeps<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.960> color<00:04:54.140> but

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
the bottom adults it keeps the color but

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.650 
the bottom adults it keeps the color but
it<00:04:54.380> just<00:04:54.530> gets<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.280> brightness<00:04:55.760> down<00:04:55.790> you<00:04:56.510> can

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
it just gets the brightness down you can

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.800 
it just gets the brightness down you can
probably<00:04:56.870> see<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.200> yet<00:04:57.410> in<00:04:57.500> Lord<00:04:57.710> Lord

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
probably see that yet in Lord Lord

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.180 
probably see that yet in Lord Lord
likewise<00:04:59.810> if<00:05:00.260> I<00:05:00.350> push<00:05:00.500> it<00:05:00.620> back<00:05:00.770> up<00:05:00.950> from<00:05:01.100> the

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
likewise if I push it back up from the

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.300 
likewise if I push it back up from the
top<00:05:02.260> you'll<00:05:03.260> see<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.590> color<00:05:03.800> starts<00:05:04.190> to

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
top you'll see the color starts to

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.830 
top you'll see the color starts to
increase<00:05:04.550> as<00:05:04.730> well<00:05:07.090> if<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.270> want<00:05:08.420> to<00:05:08.450> cycle

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
increase as well if you want to cycle

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.270 
increase as well if you want to cycle
through<00:05:08.900> all<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.440> colors<00:05:09.770> in<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.920> lab<00:05:10.100> that's

see<00:05:37.400> I'm<00:05:37.670> actually<00:05:38.000> quite<00:05:38.270> impressed<00:05:38.420> with

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
see I'm actually quite impressed with

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.010 
see I'm actually quite impressed with
the<00:05:38.930> lamp<00:05:39.140> and<00:05:40.360> forty<00:05:41.360> three<00:05:41.510> ninety<00:05:41.810> five

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
the lamp and forty three ninety five

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.920 
the lamp and forty three ninety five
from<00:05:42.290> Amazon<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.940> decided<00:05:43.940> to<00:05:44.060> all<00:05:44.150> three<00:05:44.780> of

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
from Amazon I decided to all three of

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.210 
from Amazon I decided to all three of
them<00:05:45.170> just<00:05:45.350> because<00:05:45.560> I<00:05:45.710> think<00:05:45.830> they're<00:05:46.100> that

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
them just because I think they're that

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.160 
them just because I think they're that
good<00:05:46.280> so<00:05:47.210> hopefully<00:05:47.510> I'll<00:05:47.840> be<00:05:47.870> able<00:05:47.990> to

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
good so hopefully I'll be able to

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.380 
good so hopefully I'll be able to
configure<00:05:48.440> all<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:48.890> lamps<00:05:49.430> on<00:05:49.670> to<00:05:49.970> one<00:05:50.240> or
