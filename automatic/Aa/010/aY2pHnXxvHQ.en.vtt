five<00:01:52.210> kills<00:01:52.509> in<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.840> second<00:01:53.229> round<00:01:53.350> and<00:01:53.619> I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
five kills in the second round and I

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.100 
five kills in the second round and I
obtained<00:01:54.399> my<00:01:54.460> hair<00:01:54.759> now<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.479> enemy<00:01:55.929> did

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
obtained my hair now the enemy did

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.230 
obtained my hair now the enemy did
obtain<00:01:56.320> himself<00:01:56.830> an<00:01:56.979> emergency<00:01:57.490> airdrop<00:01:57.940> and

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
obtain himself an emergency airdrop and

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.359 
obtain himself an emergency airdrop and
so<00:01:58.750> they<00:01:58.899> still<00:01:59.140> had<00:01:59.259> one<00:01:59.470> package<00:01:59.890> back<00:02:00.130> there

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
so they still had one package back there

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.770 
so they still had one package back there
so<00:02:00.490> i<00:02:00.520> think<00:02:00.610> i<00:02:00.819> got<00:02:00.940> like<00:02:01.119> one<00:02:01.300> or<00:02:01.420> two<00:02:01.450> kills

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
so i think i got like one or two kills

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.419 
so i think i got like one or two kills
and<00:02:01.990> then<00:02:02.110> my<00:02:02.229> hair<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.590> literally<00:02:02.920> saved<00:02:03.250> my

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
and then my hair you literally saved my

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.770 
and then my hair you literally saved my
ass<00:02:03.550> right<00:02:03.849> there<00:02:04.030> because<00:02:04.179> i<00:02:04.390> know<00:02:04.450> would

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
ass right there because i know would

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.870 
ass right there because i know would
have<00:02:04.899> gotten<00:02:05.050> killed<00:02:05.289> by<00:02:05.410> this<00:02:05.590> guy<00:02:05.800> I<00:02:06.099> think

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
have gotten killed by this guy I think

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.550 
have gotten killed by this guy I think
he<00:02:06.970> was<00:02:07.060> probably<00:02:07.209> trying<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:08.110> lay<00:02:08.319> down<00:02:08.349> a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
he was probably trying to lay down a

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.130 
he was probably trying to lay down a
tactical<00:02:09.520> insertion<00:02:09.880> back<00:02:10.060> here<00:02:10.270> now<00:02:10.660> this

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
tactical insertion back here now this

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.440 
tactical insertion back here now this

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
with my harpy sense of my own heartbeat

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.510 
with my harpy sense of my own heartbeat
sensor<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:16.000> was<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:17.440> know<00:02:17.470> killing<00:02:18.069> guys<00:02:18.340> how

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
they was walking by and I think it was

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.300 
they was walking by and I think it was
funny<00:02:21.489> because<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.790> didn't<00:02:22.030> have<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> silencer<00:02:22.750> I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
funny because I didn't have a silencer I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.010 
funny because I didn't have a silencer I
think<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.370> think<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.790> can't<00:02:25.150> member<00:02:25.300> but<00:02:25.989> I

if<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:51.159> start<00:02:51.430> out<00:02:51.549> at<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.909> bottom<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.269> the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
if you start out at the bottom of the

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.949 
if you start out at the bottom of the
stairs<00:02:52.689> down<00:02:52.930> there<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:54.459> can<00:02:54.639> easily<00:02:54.849> get<00:02:55.299> get

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
stairs down there you can easily get get

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:56.870 
stairs down there you can easily get get
the<00:02:55.989> enemy

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
the enemy

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.950 
the enemy
spawn<00:02:58.040> egg<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.310> then<00:02:59.730> when<00:03:00.060> they<00:03:00.270> are<00:03:00.420> that

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
spawn egg and then when they are that

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.460 
spawn egg and then when they are that
arm<00:03:01.230> when<00:03:01.980> their<00:03:02.160> flag<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.550> downstairs<00:03:03.470> it's

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
arm when their flag is downstairs it's

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.870 
arm when their flag is downstairs it's
pretty<00:03:04.800> much<00:03:04.980> over<00:03:05.190> because<00:03:05.610> they<00:03:05.760> are

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
pretty much over because they are

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.700 
pretty much over because they are
literally<00:03:06.150> spawn<00:03:06.540> trap<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.990> they<00:03:07.140> only<00:03:07.320> spawn

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
literally spawn trap and they only spawn

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.470 
literally spawn trap and they only spawn
pretty<00:03:08.070> much<00:03:08.250> at<00:03:08.460> two<00:03:08.700> points<00:03:08.970> either<00:03:09.270> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
pretty much at two points either the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.800 
pretty much at two points either the
backbone<00:03:09.930> shooting<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.410> right<00:03:10.620> now<00:03:11.810> someone

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
backbone shooting that right now someone

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.640 
backbone shooting that right now someone
needs<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.050> plane<00:03:13.290> or<00:03:13.530> near<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.920> flag<00:03:14.190> but<00:03:14.880> uh

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
needs a plane or near the flag but uh

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.830 
needs a plane or near the flag but uh
like<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.800> said<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:17.370> think<00:03:17.790> now<00:03:18.000> personally<00:03:18.660> if

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
like I said I think now personally if

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.390 
like I said I think now personally if
you<00:03:19.110> would<00:03:19.350> want<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.920> get<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.070> new<00:03:20.250> clean

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
you would want to get a new clean

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.030 
you would want to get a new clean
capture<00:03:20.640> flag<00:03:21.030> by<00:03:21.210> yourself<00:03:21.660> or<00:03:22.140> with<00:03:22.200> some

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
capture flag by yourself or with some

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.320 
capture flag by yourself or with some
teammates<00:03:23.430> or<00:03:23.640> anything<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.030> like

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
teammates or anything like that like

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.230 
teammates or anything like that like
I've<00:03:24.510> been<00:03:24.690> doing<00:03:24.960> I<00:03:25.800> would<00:03:26.490> recommend<00:03:26.820> doing

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
I've been doing I would recommend doing

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.530 
I've been doing I would recommend doing
a<00:03:28.020> capture<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.410> flag<00:03:28.500> on<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.670> terminal<00:03:30.420> because

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
a capture the flag on a terminal because

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.580 
a capture the flag on a terminal because
i<00:03:30.900> think<00:03:31.320> really<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.950> easiest<00:03:33.200> map<00:03:34.200> and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
i think really is the easiest map and

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.140 
i think really is the easiest map and
really<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.160> can<00:03:35.220> do<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.520> in<00:03:35.640> any<00:03:35.820> type<00:03:36.120> of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
really you can do it in any type of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.080 
really you can do it in any type of
objective<00:03:36.810> game<00:03:37.350> mode<00:03:37.640> but<00:03:38.640> i<00:03:38.670> think<00:03:38.820> is<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
objective game mode but i think is the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.890 
objective game mode but i think is the
most<00:03:39.480> easiest<00:03:39.900> math<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:41.210> to<00:03:42.210> get<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.390> new<00:03:42.630> card

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
most easiest math to to get a new card

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.930 
most easiest math to to get a new card
on<00:03:43.080> me<00:03:43.200> i<00:03:43.230> think<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:43.860> because<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.670> know

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
on me i think so because like I know

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.250 
on me i think so because like I know
there's<00:03:45.210> a<00:03:45.270> lot<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.450> corners<00:03:45.810> than<00:03:45.960> anything

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
there's a lot of corners than anything

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.810 
there's a lot of corners than anything
like<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.410> but<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.010> mean<00:03:47.040> when<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.460> figure<00:03:47.790> out

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
like that but I mean when you figure out

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.910 
like that but I mean when you figure out
the<00:03:47.970> spawn<00:03:48.240> points<00:03:48.630> for<00:03:48.780> these<00:03:48.900> guys<00:03:49.110> it's

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
the spawn points for these guys it's

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.550 
the spawn points for these guys it's
it's<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.880> know<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.840> know<00:03:51.990> you<00:03:52.020> get<00:03:52.320> your<00:03:52.470> new
