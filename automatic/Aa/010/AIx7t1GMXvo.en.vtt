for planet pulse it's Thursday April
fourth<00:00:20.670> end<00:00:20.939> I'm<00:00:21.779> Rick<00:00:22.109> Lavigne<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.680> think

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
fourth end I'm Rick Lavigne I think

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.099 
fourth end I'm Rick Lavigne I think
that's<00:00:23.430> an<00:00:23.580> interesting<00:00:24.180> jump<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.660> use<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
that's an interesting jump to use the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.439 
that's an interesting jump to use the
word<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.470> query<00:00:25.890> early<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.609> use<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.939> concept<00:00:27.390> of

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
word a query early to use the concept of

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.080 
word a query early to use the concept of
aquarius<00:00:27.990> moon<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.590> emotion<00:00:29.369> synthase<00:00:29.939> yeah

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
aquarius moon and emotion synthase yeah

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.240 
aquarius moon and emotion synthase yeah
that's<00:00:30.390> true<00:00:30.779> well<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.439> not<00:00:31.560> an<00:00:31.710> inquest<00:00:31.949> at

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
that's true well it's not an inquest at

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.220 
that's true well it's not an inquest at
oxymoron<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.329> course<00:00:33.360> I'm<00:00:33.719> being<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.050> bit

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
oxymoron and of course I'm being a bit

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.760 
oxymoron and of course I'm being a bit
facetious<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> idea<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.120> that

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
facetious but the idea here is that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.500 
facetious but the idea here is that
Aquarius<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> bit<00:00:38.280> emotionally<00:00:39.090> detached

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
Aquarius is a bit emotionally detached

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.720 
Aquarius is a bit emotionally detached
and<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.260> moon<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.770> our<00:00:40.980> feelings<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.550> it's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
and the moon is our feelings and it's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.060 
and the moon is our feelings and it's
how<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:41.969> attach<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.690> often<00:00:43.469> when<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> moon<00:00:43.920> is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
how we attach and often when the moon is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.479 
how we attach and often when the moon is
in<00:00:44.219> Aquarius<00:00:44.789> we<00:00:45.239> tend<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.050> stand<00:00:46.739> back<00:00:47.100> from

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
in Aquarius we tend to stand back from

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.090 
in Aquarius we tend to stand back from
the<00:00:47.579> messiness<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:49.350> our<00:00:49.379> feelings<00:00:49.890> are

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the messiness of what our feelings are

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.479 
the messiness of what our feelings are
and<00:00:50.280> look<00:00:50.430> at<00:00:50.550> them<00:00:50.730> more<00:00:50.969> as<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.320> conceptual

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
and look at them more as a conceptual

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.459 
and look at them more as a conceptual
oddity<00:00:53.489> perhaps<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> advantage

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
oddity perhaps right but the advantage

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.200 
oddity perhaps right but the advantage
of<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.010> being<00:00:56.399> more<00:00:56.520> objective<00:00:57.090> oh

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
of that is being more objective oh

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750 
of that is being more objective oh
absolutely<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:58.350> certainly<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.190> today<00:00:59.550> we

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
absolutely it certainly is but today we

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.490 
absolutely it certainly is but today we
don't<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.510> objective<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.170> that's<00:01:01.379> I

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
don't get to be objective and that's I

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.200 
don't get to be objective and that's I
think<00:01:01.530> where<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.039> were<00:01:02.160> coming<00:01:02.670> from<00:01:02.940> at<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
think where you were coming from at the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.670 
think where you were coming from at the
very<00:01:03.390> beginning<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.379> what's<00:01:04.559> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
very beginning of this what what's so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.620 
very beginning of this what what's so
interesting<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.909> traditional

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
interesting is that in traditional

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.109 
interesting is that in traditional
astrology<00:01:07.260> Saturn<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.220> associated<00:01:09.090> with

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
astrology Saturn was associated with

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.649 
astrology Saturn was associated with
Aquarius<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.260> modern<00:01:10.830> astrology<00:01:11.520> Uranus<00:01:12.479> is

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
Aquarius in modern astrology Uranus is

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.330 
Aquarius in modern astrology Uranus is
associated<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.350> Aquarius<00:01:13.890> they're<00:01:14.130> very

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
associated with Aquarius they're very

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.859 
associated with Aquarius they're very
different<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.880> we're<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.600> both

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
different and we're going to get both

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.289 
different and we're going to get both
today<00:01:16.290> because<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.159> Aquarius<00:01:17.610> moon<00:01:17.880> has<00:01:18.119> its

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
today because that Aquarius moon has its

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.170 
today because that Aquarius moon has its
moments<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.869> freedom<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.619> freakiness<00:01:20.180> when

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
moments of freedom and freakiness when

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.320 
moments of freedom and freakiness when
it<00:01:21.530> harmonizes<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.560> Uranus<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.729> end<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it harmonizes with Uranus but we end the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.480 
it harmonizes with Uranus but we end the
day<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.840> moon<00:01:25.080> Saturn<00:01:25.650> aspect<00:01:26.220> which

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
day with a moon Saturn aspect which

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.120 
day with a moon Saturn aspect which
plants<00:01:27.090> feet<00:01:27.360> solidly<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> ground<00:01:28.860> that's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
plants feet solidly on the ground that's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.609 
plants feet solidly on the ground that's
right<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.579> moon<00:01:29.759> ends<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.240> squaring<00:01:30.900> Saturn<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
right the moon ends up squaring Saturn a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.910 
right the moon ends up squaring Saturn a
square<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.640> an<00:01:32.820> aspect<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.570> conflict<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.590> of

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
square is an aspect of conflict or of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.130 
square is an aspect of conflict or of
tension<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.820> needs<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.329> resolved<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
tension that needs to be resolved and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.950 
tension that needs to be resolved and
when<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> moon<00:01:37.860> squares<00:01:38.340> Saturn<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.659> like

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
when the moon squares Saturn it's like

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
when the moon squares Saturn it's like
we<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:40.920> our<00:01:41.100> emotions<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.820> gone

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
we know that if our emotions have gone

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
we know that if our emotions have gone
out<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.630> bounds<00:01:43.229> which<00:01:43.619> chances<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.369> they

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
out of bounds which chances are they

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.870 
out of bounds which chances are they
have<00:01:44.840> then<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:46.110> are<00:01:46.850> confronted<00:01:47.850> with

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
have then we are confronted with

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.359 
have then we are confronted with
something<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.659> forces<00:01:49.530> us<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.740> pull<00:01:50.100> back<00:01:50.310> in
