 years after Joseph had died 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.589
 the fact that jose had done so much for egypt 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.349
 must have meant very little to the new governor 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.490

 the evil king 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.030
 he was afraid because there were many Israelites in Egypt 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.790
 for this reason he ordered that all newborn males be thrown into the 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.950
 waters of the nile

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.520
 He let the boy float on the waters of the nile between the reeds 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.760
 near the shore 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.000

 6 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.100

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.820
 as his own son 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.840

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.440
 Israelite to feed the child 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.140

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.980
 His town 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.350
 over the years the disgust like that is was growing by the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.760
 terrible way in which the people were suffering under the account of the Egyptians 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.700
 although he had been taken to the royal palace when he was still very 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.570
 boy 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.530
 Moses never forgot some of the things he had learned from his 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.620
 parents in their own home 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.990

 when he was 40 years old he killed an Egyptian because he was hitting one of 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.289
 his Israelite brothers 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:20.309
 Moses had decided to defend the people of God instead of enjoying 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.729
 a life of riches in the king's palace 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.659
 he was afraid that the Egyptians would kill him so he fled to a place called 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.569
