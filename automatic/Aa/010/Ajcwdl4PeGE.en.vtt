 among the many subjects that we are going to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.960

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.009
 high notes singing bass notes as 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.649

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.190
 is singing and praising God may 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.780

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.900
 Finally various churches is there have been no 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.470
 quartets in the branch to god but if you have 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.570

 responsible people who accept 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.590
 called and are committed to 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.390
 that very well 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.149
 If you want to form the quartet already have 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.810
 your four friends that you them 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.220
 they sing 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.610
 1st t 9 second tenor baritone underneath 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.080
 how to know that each one of us have 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.630
 a vocal tessitura 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.369
 we have a vocal extension so it's 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.570
 important, do you know what your 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.360
 vocal extension 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.799
 but why this is so important is 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.780
 important for you to set up your 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.369
 repertoire 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.140
 Anyway, we can not go out singing. 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.239
 all of music right? 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.170
 a lot of people like to sing songs 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.850
 more serious but there are things I can not 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.310
 sing songs so keenly if you do not 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.930
 can get there but it is so 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.030
 important you ride very large 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.549
 repertoire so you can make a 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.970
 work different from god so let's go 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.610
 seek to do what is pleasing to 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.560
 God damn eyes that man does 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.630
 Work your desired mind 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.760
 sometimes the word then how do I 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.920
 I make music for them. 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.620

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.620

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.460

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.400

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.730
 Note that you have to do the part all 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.040
 even because that business of 7 heard 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.150
