00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.410 
I think meaningful habitat restoration

I<00:04:56.140> think<00:04:56.919> we're<00:04:57.070> standing<00:04:57.280> in<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.640> unique<00:04:57.970> area

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
I think we're standing in a unique area

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.930 
I think we're standing in a unique area
where<00:04:58.600> we<00:04:58.720> actually<00:04:58.900> have<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.650> opportunity

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
where we actually have the opportunity

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.029 
where we actually have the opportunity
to<00:05:00.940> tear<00:05:01.539> us<00:05:01.660> back<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.080> channel<00:05:02.410> wall<00:05:02.590> and

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
to tear us back the channel wall and

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.860 
to tear us back the channel wall and
restore<00:05:03.729> some<00:05:03.970> of<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.150> connections<00:05:04.600> to<00:05:04.780> the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
restore some of the connections to the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.330 
restore some of the connections to the
historic<00:05:05.260> floodplain<00:05:05.680> so<00:05:06.070> that's<00:05:06.220> an

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
historic floodplain so that's an

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.950 
historic floodplain so that's an
exciting<00:05:06.760> piece<00:05:06.910> of<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.180> restoration<00:05:07.780> work

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
exciting piece of the restoration work

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.710 
exciting piece of the restoration work
that<00:05:08.650> we<00:05:08.740> really<00:05:09.039> think<00:05:09.460> will<00:05:09.820> be<00:05:10.210> a<00:05:10.240> visible

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
that we really think will be a visible

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.980 
that we really think will be a visible
demonstration<00:05:11.650> of<00:05:11.950> how<00:05:12.840> revitalization<00:05:13.840> and

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
demonstration of how revitalization and

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.020 
demonstration of how revitalization and
restoration<00:05:14.470> is<00:05:14.560> going<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:14.770> take<00:05:14.889> place<00:05:15.039> this

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
restoration is going to take place this

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.100 
for my children and other people's
children<00:06:34.309> it's<00:06:35.309> hard<00:06:35.489> not<00:06:35.610> to<00:06:35.729> get<00:06:35.819> emotional

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
children it's hard not to get emotional

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.029 
children it's hard not to get emotional
because<00:06:37.110> that's<00:06:37.409> really<00:06:37.649> what<00:06:37.799> it's<00:06:37.919> all

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
because that's really what it's all

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.889 
because that's really what it's all
about<00:06:38.069> is<00:06:38.579> saving<00:06:38.789> the<00:06:39.089> earth<00:06:39.269> for<00:06:39.599> future

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:39.899

write a new chapter it is as bold as

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.840 
write a new chapter it is as bold as

Derby's but even richer because it has

Derby's but even richer because it has

of restoring what once was as well as
