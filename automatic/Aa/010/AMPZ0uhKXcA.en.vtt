00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.780
 hey my dear friends and welcome 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.240
 to a new episode of minecraft 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.189
 terminus I'm just curious 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.320
 Here's the round right there 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.499
 I chose skate robi 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.029
 like five others , but it is 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.380
 At home with us, we are too 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.579
 played home as it is in the chat 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.560
 I thought we might play in 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.819
 this round or in that order then 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.199
 Just a new card 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.419
 as it looks but then unfortunately 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.699
 not he plays is at home again 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.780
 but now good old home i 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.059
 would say it starts 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.370
 may the war begin a new round 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.929
 star - is launched we are one 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.929
 the king seems and can not get up 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:47.870
 out of the royal field or just baghdad 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.550
 so strong that königsfeld is expanded 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.559
 that is also a very interesting thing 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.449
 The king can even go to her now 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.890
 Out the back this is a very very 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.749
 interesting thing was before the comes 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.219
 Do not even go there 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:59.420
 Königigsfeld will be expanded a bit 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.010
 we also see everything out of sight 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.659
 the king we have the same 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.159
 holy bow I do not look now 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.269
 on the enchantment i want mine 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.190
 team would rather help here i would like 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.240
 rather support my team here what 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.710
 we are also very interesting 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.300
 have also got a sword so 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.390
 before that, the king had only the 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.950
 enemy the bow and yes had no 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.930
 The real problem is somehow 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.270
 melee but had to stop always 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.280
 with the fernkampf was for help 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.390
 should know where you will be too 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.470
 you destroy now standing in here 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.460
 carved kings field 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.900
 then I'll have you soon 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.240
 otherwise it can destroy that 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.970
 my soldiers my lackeys or me 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.830
 make it with the bow 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.380
 the great thing done nicely 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.110
 means also always empty wait I watch 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.880
 Often list that was the belief of me 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.650
 Firefighters were that long somebody 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.840
 names or with f he starts again 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.570
 what this marcel or this clarifies and 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.550
 I believe the departure of the pia and the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.260
 he did that well on everyone 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.480
 fall what I have from the remarkable 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.240
 or very nice is that you are above 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.460
 active conqueror sees two active ones 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.480
 Guardian 5 because you can see that very well and 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.980
 especially on the remaining time 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.480
 not very nice with the ad 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.130
 above that is actually that too 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.960
 most important and right you can see that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.580
 Secondary speaks so that in the team 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.560
 the guard is team is actually 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.290
 No matter you have to know blue or red 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.780
 and the king of the rulers no soldiers 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.360
 more you grab yourself like 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.220
 we already know the opponent has 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.170
 no more soldiers, I wanted to say 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.459
 I never wanted to judge him the famous 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.200
 It can not be that we are not soldiers 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.300
 our team is fighting for more 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.920
 brave and yes right you see secondary 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.480
 as the guardian or more points one has 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.120
 or how much one is actually 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.489
 we do not need a relative second 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.620
 really know but up there 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.150
 active upper and active guardian like that 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.330
 very very important and the way it looks 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.950
 have the really good work as good 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.989
 very good work done by our team 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.070
 atm asd 1130 double pack double 6 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.920
 somehow come now also decision 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.260
 show in chat both the old spawn 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.959
 or apropos items spawn we can f3 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.610
 yes, that could be one 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.360
 coordinate that this is somewhere 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.040
 is near 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.330
 that somehow that is suitable 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.860
 then I can find that good 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.360
 will take show now 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.730
 it's actually becoming relative here as well 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.769
 regularly updated and I would say 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.150
 the king the chief physician death we have 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.500
 We can win a new round 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.870
 play so I think that's very 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.390
 very interesting as we are here for everyone 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.980
 Autumn time and served nice new updates 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.510
 get or provided 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.190
 I get the ad 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.720
 actually very stylish and think so 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.070
 that will be fine now 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.140
 view of the king but look at it 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.760
 I should be able to see all this now 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.440
 times which server I go on where 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.400
 are coming here twelve of twelve 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.200
 that starts immediately 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.730
 However, in the chat that is somewhere 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.280
 error that I should buy premium 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.290
 to dream full servers but the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.730
 youtuber wants that too 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.920
 I've also said that 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.450
 is synonymous if you actually the whole 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.100
 time on it then you also get on 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.510
 the server on it always this 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.010
 message gets but I would like now 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.720
 also do not explicitly kick down 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.799
 That's why I'm going to open now 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.450
 these servers actually go 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.859
 was still empty and now then 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.930
 Accordingly, it has only become full 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.100
 I'll fly around a bit like that 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.170
 there you can do it all here 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.370
 take a look and otherwise 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.680
 we can actually always 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.700
 wanted to directly here so it was said 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.350
 I just want to go back 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.609
 burgfeld i do not always want to 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.780
 at home I play knows just 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.950
 Not at all why the cape pressed me 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.709
 I also chat and I will 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.450
 realized that there is so much experience 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.489
 request over-demand at once 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.579
 and I'm supposed to do / party then 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.250
 Let's see / party under and command 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.200
 do yes / party yes, apparently 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.520
 do not spare her you do not do me 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.320
 sorry I've tried I wanted it 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.100
 did not make party but was not yes 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.840
 I tried it 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.350
 does not work if your video is very much 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.490
 rather only works properly 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.300
 I can not play the command 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.790
 if there is any 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.590
 I do not know why / party command 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.180
 should give as if the hat 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.940
 or how it looks like I do not know 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.260
 definitely play the same 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.250
 probably again at home is yes 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.300
 okay to swim or the same 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.950
 web but it would be very nice if 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.210
 had variety and the people did not 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.220
 always playing at home and yes 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.760
 hello melons head lost about 55 or 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.230
 I already noticed you after 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.970
 A short break is also possible 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.310
 On we are here again 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.960
 the side of the guards 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.300
 unbelievably 50 points again 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.160
 you should start 50 points but now 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.560
 we are not king but we are 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.720
 now, of course, the active right 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.100
 soldier we belong to the guardian party 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.220
 and then of course they are more active 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.540
 foot soldiers club then introduce us to this 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.920
 times personally against the king and 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.690
 are not themselves king shall ye 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.370
 I wanted to lure me into a trap like that 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.690
 but that's not the best option 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.710
 worked or or is the grave only 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.540
 I just do not know how many 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.550
 But life looks like the beaver 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.990
 we have to build the types have regret 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.550
 then we mix in here again 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.110
 done by our team one here yes 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.090
 unfortunately one is attacked or 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.410
 one destroyed but we can already 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.920
 settle here again we get this one 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.270
 easily broken knocked the 123 the 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.530
 we will break people 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.390
 we manage to do that wonderfully 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.640
 we made it but then we became 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.900
 of course done once again 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.850
 little bit of delay 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.890
 when so many people play and how 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.510
 if you please one should on this theme 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.610
 I can understand it 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.270
 that the spawn is random but at this 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.060
 old dar 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.170
 No one's gonna be there. 12.19 I know 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.040
 Not at all if you at all at all items 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.240
 it can come to it 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.280
 there is in any case as a team 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.100
 but can move forward I try also 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.630
 no matter old mine therefore my team as possible 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.070
 good support here with arrows 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.360
 Of course I'm not that good 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.080
 Above all , I would shoot again 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.550
 released 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.690
 which is why we can say yes 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.400
 do not need to think anymore 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.170
 I wanted to do on the scoreboard q 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.150
 how many are alive and how many are not 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.800
 Robben is the ad is at once 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.720
 gone gone I find that a great pity 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.740
 At later respawn the indicator 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.270
 do not keep up there 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.670
 It would then seem to have been fixed 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.630
 be this mistake and whether the 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.030
 We do not want mistakes I wanted 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.700
 I say help to a cuban behind 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.780
 I support him but do not bring 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.090
 he already has alone 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.889
 regulated and that's why I would say 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.150
 Let's see where some red ones 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.400
 like this one, for example 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.740
 hans thill or whatever that means 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.990
 Hans kelsen we would be to destroy 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.550
 or if we prevent it from happening 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.430
 let's king so we can sort him out 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.099
 close to get here with the type 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.080
 the blue army wien us and then 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:58.340
 we also have the chance the same 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.900
 to attack the king then what we do directly 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.080
 sometimes we will do it too 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.340
 we are now set here 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.779
 the king will somehow endure 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.999
 we are now in prison first 

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:09.919
 I'm looking for the old level I'll be 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:12.050
 now here from above l playing there is that 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:14.090
 item definitely determines one 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.650
 wrong page, we look at there and 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.029
 a red foot soldier still lives 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.379
 we'll try somehow here too 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:20.360
 I destroy that we have here 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:21.800
 our beautiful darts your mates 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.240
 I have your enemies but I have not 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.469
 not explicitly on my camera to 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.300
 targeted lovemaking 

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:27.349
 he also had to notice 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.060
 every case would be too 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:31.129
 accordingly defeated the foot soldier 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.740
 and the king of the ora is free again 

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:35.389
 our team the nice weather the team 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.830
 blue will hopefully be up there 

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.419
 fold royal beautiful 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.610
 Unfortunately, I have not experienced it 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.770
 but we have won with it we will 

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.969
 also once again victorious 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.710
 i think that's very nice we are our team 

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:47.210
 interacts as we do good teamwork 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.819
 and therefore always 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.379
 in siek rausholen well I would then 

00:07:49.819 --> 00:07:53.120
 but this one say that I am myself 

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:54.620
