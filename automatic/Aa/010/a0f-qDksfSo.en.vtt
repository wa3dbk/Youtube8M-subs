00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.230
 attempts to craft and in n the god of worms okay 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.230
 go 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.050
 in order to brighten aka 47 redline I 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.770
 spent my last sandals and bought 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.660
 ten guns 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.180
 prohibited quality from the same 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.790
 collections that your Che does not load 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.890
 my guns and but that doesn't matter on its 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.190

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.140
 I bought the next gun this is 4 famas 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.500

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.930

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.370
 to craft a p90 triangle of another 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.989
 antiques chance of dropping my 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.860
 Kalasha is only thirty 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.710
