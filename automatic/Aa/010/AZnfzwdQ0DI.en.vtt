00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.010
 welcome humans to a dossier more than 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.350
 art survival and vol let's deal with the 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.679
 deal or post auroux as kind of lopo 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.089
 saurus fucking trees of the Jurassic period 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.799
 carnivore and temperament I have my 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.629
 doubts but I think it refers to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.180
 whims until he spits you in the face 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.940
 we turn to its modus operandi and its mode 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.430
 Wild weird creature is a little more 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.980
 big that the known one of the cars and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.170
 I think that here he puts that extends and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.360
 extends frequently as most 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.969
 of the aggressors in combat we go that 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.249
 let's be careful also if I repeat myself in 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.679
 the phrases is because in the dossier 

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:39.690
 they repeat a lot especially when they name 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.249
 the word island this creature has 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.320
 some traits that are not common in the 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:46.019
 deal or post auroux has a very call 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.730
 shrill and a decorative crest plus the 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.120
 skin of his neck I think these are 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.649
 used to attract their partners and 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:58.260
 as well as intimidate its predators in 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 place to attack their full prey 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.059
 wolves to bruce spits poison for 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.880
 weaken and paralyze before moving to 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.280
 kill we passed the domestication and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.710
 is that 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.850
 because of his sharp scream and his ability 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.710
 to attack the intruders the range the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.729
 auroux wolves or again it seems more 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:21.880
 suitable as a guardian dog due to 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.640
 its small size and that is inappropriate 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.860
 as a mount and we have finished I do not know 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.600
 who writes this dossier but who knows 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.750
 that has had missing photographs in 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.310
 English if what you heard right to 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.830
 these heights a game have missing 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.020
 autography they have to take care of it that's a 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.490
 small detail unimportant but 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.320
 good that is there I also want 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.750
 take advantage in thanking all those people 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.000

 effort that I do for you that you 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.800
