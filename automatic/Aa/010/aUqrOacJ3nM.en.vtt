 and that I bring to you today I bring you one 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:09.120
 extreme game with the ms mc and the tag 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.970
 45 you told me to use the gun in 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.950
 gameplays is worth then what I did and good 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:17.460
 because as in online is giving me 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.039
 pretty disgusting I got extremely extreme 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.779
 playing several games since in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.779
 extreme you do not need that good 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.119
 connection to kill by gun and not 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.279
 he does not need to kill him with many 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.640
 shots with a couple of shots and one in the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.980
 head with the gun as is normal what 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.620
 you kill justice and get me here you saw 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.130
 double shot to the head with the 45 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.450
 you will see during all clean 15.123 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.510
 he killed another 4 because he already kills an uncle 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.590
 he managed to take out household removal the agr iba 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.870
 to see several scenes like that several scenes 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.610
 that with the gun they have a lot of game in 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.770
 end you'll see that I'm going somewhere 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.960
 quite acceptable within what fits 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.780
 it's a part that I just got 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.940
 to see how it came out is worth 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 see how I was given 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.210
 and the truth is that if you want me to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.070
 bring more extremes and you love the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.110
 extreme the extreme is my thing, if not 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.930
 you know, I'm from the end of modern warfare 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.270
 3 always played an extreme the truth is 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.820
 that some friends of mine dragged me 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.070
 play in the normal good that seen the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.880
 team and it kills me this from a shot to the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.340
 low head furious with the gun and what 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.950
 said I am more than extremes is always 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.930
 playing extreme and and he said it to me 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.660
 dragged to play to the confirmed down 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.970
 in standard mode where the bullets were 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.570
 missing more bullets and even the banks 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.280
 they took good games then good 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.930
 so I get used to it and that's why and 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.050
 as everyone plays to that style of 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.420
 game ends up giving way like kim says 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.130
 but if you want me, I'm better 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.650
 I'm pretty much better since I have 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.350
 better aim 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.930
 I have good reflexes when it comes to 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.290
 shoot ok I turn fast and so on 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.690
 etc 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.460
 if gray or bag more games with the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.830
 gun with any gray weapon and without 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.770
 extreme I will not abandon the games 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.790
 normal, do not panic, it's not worth it 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:19.110
 no ultimatum something from the ultimatum to 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.180
 online voucher and now let's see what the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.220

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.050

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.910

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.870
 correcting as you see this gameplay 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.879
 I tried to say the word a few times 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.440
 prohibited a crisis that I charged one to 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:51.010

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.269

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.739
 explanation we wanted to tell 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.989
