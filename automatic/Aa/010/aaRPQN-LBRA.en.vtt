00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
storyline I couldn't stand was Jennifer

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.900 
storyline I couldn't stand was Jennifer
Lopez's<00:03:02.770> so<00:03:03.070> that's<00:03:03.220> where<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.490> disagree<00:03:03.880> with

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910

her okay she I liked her but that's

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.370 
her okay she I liked her but that's
probably<00:03:06.820> just<00:03:06.910> because<00:03:07.240> I<00:03:07.570> would<00:03:07.900> love<00:03:08.140> her

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
probably just because I would love her

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.890 
probably just because I would love her
to<00:03:08.410> do<00:03:08.710> many<00:03:08.980> things<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.400> me<00:03:09.520> and<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.210> have<00:03:10.720> no

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
to do many things to me and so I have no

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.270 
to do many things to me and so I have no
problem<00:03:11.230> watching<00:03:11.350> her<00:03:11.680> on<00:03:11.800> screen<00:03:12.010> doing

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
problem watching her on screen doing

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.160 
problem watching her on screen doing
just<00:03:12.400> about<00:03:12.490> anything<00:03:12.670> so<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:13.660> didn't<00:03:13.930> mind<00:03:14.020> her

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
just about anything so I didn't mind her

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.680 
just about anything so I didn't mind her
so<00:03:14.320> speaking<00:03:14.710> of<00:03:14.980> doing<00:03:15.430> things<00:03:15.760> Cameron<00:03:16.420> Diaz

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
so speaking of doing things Cameron Diaz

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.140 
so speaking of doing things Cameron Diaz

I think she either worked out took

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.840 
I think she either worked out took
steroids<00:03:19.450> she<00:03:19.990> was<00:03:20.110> very<00:03:20.320> toned<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.010> her<00:03:21.610> face

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
steroids she was very toned and her face

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.070 
steroids she was very toned and her face
looked<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.150> little<00:03:22.390> stretched<00:03:22.660> out<00:03:22.900> in<00:03:23.020> this

looked a little stretched out in this
movie<00:03:23.410> which<00:03:23.650> she<00:03:23.830> looked<00:03:24.040> I'm<00:03:24.220> not<00:03:24.430> saying

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640

interesting<00:03:29.440> than<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.620> others<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.190> that's

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
interesting than the others and that's

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.380 
interesting than the others and that's

situations<00:04:06.220> but<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.700> movies<00:04:06.940> nothing<00:04:07.239> like

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
situations but the movies nothing like

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.660 
situations but the movies nothing like
that's<00:04:07.840> just<00:04:08.020> one<00:04:08.260> little<00:04:08.440> tiny<00:04:08.739> aspect<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.520> it

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
that's just one little tiny aspect of it

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.520 
that's just one little tiny aspect of it
that's<00:04:10.180> true<00:04:10.480> I<00:04:10.660> think<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.959> was<00:04:11.170> them<00:04:11.320> trying

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.050 
that's true I think that was them trying
to<00:04:11.590> get<00:04:11.680> guys<00:04:11.890> in<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.250> theater<00:04:12.280> yeah<00:04:12.670> did<00:04:12.910> come

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
see it obviously that was like my

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.720 
see it obviously that was like my
favorite<00:04:14.650> storyline<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.310> think<00:04:15.550> I<00:04:15.580> was<00:04:15.670> the

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
Riley I think it's a basic

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.260 
Riley I think it's a basic
straightforward<00:05:38.840> comedy<00:05:39.650> there's

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
straightforward comedy there's

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.040 
straightforward comedy there's
artistically<00:05:41.270> there's<00:05:41.479> nothing<00:05:41.810> amazing

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
artistically there's nothing amazing

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.809 
artistically there's nothing amazing
even<00:05:42.469> though<00:05:42.560> there<00:05:42.770> was<00:05:42.889> a<00:05:42.919> few<00:05:43.190> scenes<00:05:43.550> where

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
even though there was a few scenes where

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.930 
even though there was a few scenes where
they<00:05:43.880> transitioned<00:05:44.509> through<00:05:44.690> all<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.940> where

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
they transitioned through all the where

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.790 
they transitioned through all the where
they<00:05:47.029> give<00:05:47.180> women<00:05:47.449> sonar<00:05:48.139> on<00:05:48.349> their<00:05:48.469> bellies
