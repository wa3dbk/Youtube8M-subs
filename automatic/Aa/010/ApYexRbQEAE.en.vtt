 it's a complete game 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.950
 the truth is that it is not the first time 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.810
 I play once if it's the second time 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.390
 but the truth of the game I liked 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.520
 too much and I do not know the truth I feel like 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.440
 to buy it but it's going to come out on the 30th 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.750

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.590
 Well, if I can, I do not know how to save 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.900
 more money and you can buy me some 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.520

 the people who are members of dry goal 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.489

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.200
 worth more to members 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.909

 buy the game the truth is very 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.950
 entertaining the game but better I'm going to 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.730
 expect them to take 30 when they want 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.510
 leave in this year if I 'm not wrong if 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.510

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.260
 the truth because yes I thought he is 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.169
 guzmán was going to be the same nonsense that 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.400
 They liked it 60 but not me that did not 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.069
 I am the truth the graphics do not 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.230
 I notice a lot although in halo 2 the truth 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.530
 yes that you notice too much the graphics 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.709
 but I think it's the same but 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.860
 Well, not in the case of multi white 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.260
 3 Believe me that base one is going to be a like 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.389
 I tell them a graphics change the truth 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.430
 very, very big that is going to be noticed 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.820
 too many people have even 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.280
 seen when they have already played in the 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.020

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.479
 in the white canon 3 in the third and 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.910
 the aguán like the pressure 34 is 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.460

 So, here is the truth, a lot 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.990
 difference but then I really 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.360

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.010
 soldiers of the future but we are in the 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.900
