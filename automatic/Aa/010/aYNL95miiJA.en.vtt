I<00:01:50.850> wasn't<00:01:51.149> really<00:01:51.240> too<00:01:51.540> into<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.350> don't

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
I wasn't really too into it and I don't

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.359 
I wasn't really too into it and I don't
really<00:01:52.680> remember<00:01:52.890> much<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:55.070> dialogue<00:01:56.070> or

Patrick's Day update and this can go

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.969 
Patrick's Day update and this can go
either<00:04:37.419> way<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.720> mean<00:04:37.900> update<00:04:38.410> itself<00:04:38.710> wasn't

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
either way I mean update itself wasn't

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.300 
either way I mean update itself wasn't
too<00:04:39.250> big<00:04:39.490> there<00:04:39.729> was<00:04:39.820> only<00:04:40.260> one<00:04:41.260> decoration<00:04:42.040> I

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
too big there was only one decoration I

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.850 
too big there was only one decoration I
think<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:43.060> one<00:04:43.270> building<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.020> one<00:04:44.350> character

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
think and one building and one character

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.060 
think and one building and one character
I<00:04:45.070> think<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.820> man<00:04:46.810> my<00:04:47.199> memory<00:04:47.500> is<00:04:47.560> kind<00:04:47.740> of<00:04:47.830> shady

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
I think I man my memory is kind of shady

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.760 
I think I man my memory is kind of shady
anyway<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.510> wasn't<00:04:49.720> too<00:04:49.960> big<00:04:50.139> to<00:04:50.260> begin<00:04:50.380> with

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
anyway it wasn't too big to begin with

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.250 
anyway it wasn't too big to begin with
so<00:04:51.150> obviously<00:04:52.150> with<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.479> being<00:04:52.720> said<00:04:52.810> there

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
so obviously with that being said there

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.719 
so obviously with that being said there
wasn't<00:04:53.440> too<00:04:53.710> many<00:04:53.860> st.<00:04:54.220> Patrick's<00:04:54.669> Day

symptoms are from America so you can't

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.219

the<00:06:30.669> snakes<00:06:30.969> the<00:06:31.570> eggs<00:06:31.780> were<00:06:31.960> kind<00:06:32.169> of<00:06:32.260> a<00:06:32.349> pain

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:32.530 
the snakes the eggs were kind of a pain

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:33.270 
the snakes the eggs were kind of a pain
in<00:06:32.650> the<00:06:32.680> ass

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
in the ass

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.879

you<00:06:33.370> know<00:06:33.460> I<00:06:33.490> moved<00:06:33.820> past<00:06:34.120> it<00:06:34.360> but<00:06:35.020> it'll<00:06:35.860> be

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
you know I moved past it but it'll be

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.350 
you know I moved past it but it'll be
kind<00:06:36.130> of<00:06:36.190> nice<00:06:36.310> to<00:06:36.370> see<00:06:36.639> it<00:06:36.730> back<00:06:36.940> although<00:06:37.240> I

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
kind of nice to see it back although I

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.330 
kind of nice to see it back although I
don't<00:06:37.480> think<00:06:37.660> it<00:06:37.960> will<00:06:38.220> considering<00:06:39.220> that

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
don't think it will considering that

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.390 
don't think it will considering that
whacking<00:06:39.580> day<00:06:39.940> was<00:06:40.630> an<00:06:40.900> only<00:06:41.290> one<00:06:41.740> episode<00:06:41.950> of

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
whacking day was an only one episode of

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.980 
whacking day was an only one episode of
The<00:06:42.460> Simpsons<00:06:42.639> and<00:06:43.060> never<00:06:43.300> ever<00:06:43.510> mentioned

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:43.990 
The Simpsons and never ever mentioned

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.250 
The Simpsons and never ever mentioned
again<00:06:44.580> it<00:06:45.580> doesn't<00:06:46.450> leave<00:06:46.600> much<00:06:46.930> room<00:06:46.990> for

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
again it doesn't leave much room for

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.180 
again it doesn't leave much room for
discussion<00:06:47.590> so<00:06:48.280> I<00:06:49.440> probably<00:06:50.440> missed<00:06:50.889> a

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.190 
discussion so I probably missed a

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.770 
discussion so I probably missed a
holiday<00:06:51.580> event<00:06:51.910> but<00:06:52.090> I<00:06:52.120> can't<00:06:52.419> really<00:06:52.510> think

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
holiday event but I can't really think

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.300 
holiday event but I can't really think
of<00:06:52.900> it<00:06:53.020> right<00:06:53.200> now<00:06:53.380> I'll<00:06:53.710> probably<00:06:53.889> think<00:06:54.250> of

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
of it right now I'll probably think of

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.430 
of it right now I'll probably think of
it<00:06:54.430> as<00:06:54.490> soon<00:06:54.639> as<00:06:54.730> I<00:06:54.910> click<00:06:55.419> the<00:06:55.660> stop<00:06:56.410> button
