talking<00:02:40.230> about<00:02:40.590> FBX<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.610> tutorial<00:02:42.590> so

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
talking about FBX in this tutorial so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.310 
talking about FBX in this tutorial so
you<00:02:45.020> open<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.080> up<00:02:46.220> load<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.640> raw<00:02:47.940> file<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.450> then

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
you open it up load the raw file in then

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.720 
you open it up load the raw file in then
on<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.620> right<00:02:50.420> change<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.660> settings<00:02:52.050> to

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
on the right change the settings to

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.040 
on the right change the settings to
export<00:02:53.730> as<00:02:53.930> FBX<00:02:55.310> 2012<00:02:56.310> or<00:02:56.580> 2013<00:02:57.300> I'm<00:02:57.630> pretty

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
export as FBX 2012 or 2013 I'm pretty

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.450 
export as FBX 2012 or 2013 I'm pretty
sure<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.700> then<00:03:00.060> down<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:01.130> think<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.250> under

sure and then down I think is under

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.320 
sure and then down I think is under
binary<00:03:02.940> or<00:03:03.150> something<00:03:03.480> put<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.810> as<00:03:03.930> ASC<00:03:04.920> III

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.950 
binary or something put it as ASC III
that's<00:03:06.330> important<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.440> has<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.770> be<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:08.100> sei<00:03:08.520> I

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
that's important it has to be a sei I

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.890 
that's important it has to be a sei I
now<00:03:09.960> change<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.710> export<00:03:11.190> directory<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.420> the

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
like a wall that you know the dimensions

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.920 
like a wall that you know the dimensions
of<00:05:17.230> in<00:05:17.440> Revit<00:05:17.830> say<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.430> wall<00:05:18.670> is<00:05:18.940> a<00:05:18.970> 10<00:05:19.750> Aries

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930

animating and really whatever you want
to<00:07:18.410> do<00:07:18.760> so<00:07:19.760> I<00:07:20.800> hope<00:07:21.800> this<00:07:21.980> this<00:07:22.850> helped<00:07:23.210> it<00:07:23.780> some

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
to do so I hope this this helped it some

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.250 
to do so I hope this this helped it some
I<00:07:24.830> think<00:07:25.310> cycles<00:07:25.850> will<00:07:26.360> certainly<00:07:26.840> blender

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.260 
I think cycles will certainly blender

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.620 
I think cycles will certainly blender
internal<00:07:27.560> is<00:07:27.860> a<00:07:27.890> much<00:07:28.730> faster<00:07:29.090> rendering

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
internal is a much faster rendering

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.370 
internal is a much faster rendering
engine<00:07:30.290> then<00:07:31.360> Revit<00:07:32.360> I<00:07:32.510> guess<00:07:32.780> depending<00:07:33.290> on

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:33.380 
engine then Revit I guess depending on

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.340 
engine then Revit I guess depending on
what<00:07:33.500> kind<00:07:33.650> of<00:07:33.770> computer<00:07:34.040> you<00:07:34.490> have<00:07:34.670> but<00:07:35.360> yeah

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:36.350 
what kind of computer you have but yeah

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:39.220 
what kind of computer you have but yeah
it<00:07:36.890> gives<00:07:37.070> you<00:07:37.220> more<00:07:37.730> freedom<00:07:37.970> I<00:07:38.450> found<00:07:39.020> I

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:39.230 
it gives you more freedom I found I

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:46.420 
it gives you more freedom I found I
found<00:07:39.320> anyway<00:07:40.120> so<00:07:41.120> there<00:07:41.840> you<00:07:41.900> go<00:07:41.960> okay<00:07:43.420> thanks
