the<00:02:38.500> same<00:02:38.740> thing<00:02:39.010> for<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.340> body<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:40.090> body<00:02:40.240> is

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
the same thing for the body the body is

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.180 
the same thing for the body the body is
the<00:02:40.720> exact<00:02:40.990> same<00:02:41.230> thing<00:02:41.590> except<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.100> a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
the exact same thing except it's a

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.860 
the exact same thing except it's a
little<00:02:42.310> more<00:02:42.610> oval<00:02:42.970> shape<00:02:43.210> compared<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
little more oval shape compared to the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.110 
little more oval shape compared to the
head<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.650> here's<00:02:44.860> my<00:02:45.040> head<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:45.460> my<00:02:45.640> body<00:02:45.670> and

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
head so here's my head and my body and

head so here's my head and my body and
as<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.570> can<00:02:46.720> see<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.200> proportions<00:02:47.800> are<00:02:48.130> like

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
as you can see the proportions are like

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.880 
as you can see the proportions are like
so<00:02:48.720> with<00:02:49.720> some<00:02:49.870> light<00:02:50.050> felting<00:02:50.500> wool<00:02:50.530> you're

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
just going to take a small pinch of it

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.230 
just going to take a small pinch of it
roll<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.080> into<00:02:53.290> kind<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.100> small<00:02:54.520> triangle

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
roll it into kind of a small triangle

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.970 
roll it into kind of a small triangle
and<00:02:55.390> you're<00:02:55.750> going<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.080> needle<00:02:56.560> felt<00:02:56.800> this

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
and you're going to needle felt this

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.010 
and you're going to needle felt this
onto<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:57.580> front<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.270> head<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.750> this<00:02:58.870> is

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
onto the front of the head and this is

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.960 
onto the front of the head and this is
going<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.410> be<00:02:59.560> where<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.920> kittens<00:03:00.130> faces<00:03:00.790> at

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.970 
as you can see no glue is required for
this<00:03:04.450> process<00:03:04.690> at<00:03:05.020> all<00:03:05.140> all<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.560> need<00:03:05.740> is<00:03:05.860> your

this process at all all you need is your

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.530 
this process at all all you need is your
felting<00:03:06.400> needle<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:07.030> just<00:03:07.180> poked<00:03:07.390> it

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
felting needle and you just poked it

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.540 
felting needle and you just poked it
several<00:03:07.810> times<00:03:08.080> so<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.650> covered<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.130> bottom<00:03:09.430> of

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
several times so I covered the bottom of

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.000 
several times so I covered the bottom of
the<00:03:09.640> face<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.390> center<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:10.960> the<00:03:11.110> belly<00:03:11.290> now

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
just folded the felting roll into what

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.430 
just folded the felting roll into what
looks<00:03:15.820> like<00:03:15.880> a<00:03:15.970> triangle<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:16.690> gently<00:03:17.410> just

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
looks like a triangle and gently just

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.010 
looks like a triangle and gently just
needle<00:03:17.950> felt<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.370> into<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.700> flat<00:03:18.940> triangle<00:03:19.360> be

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
needle felt this into a flat triangle be

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.930 
needle felt this into a flat triangle be
sure<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.320> be<00:03:20.440> very<00:03:20.470> careful<00:03:21.250> not<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.460> poke<00:03:21.790> your

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
fingers on the edges I know this video

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.490 
fingers on the edges I know this video
looks<00:03:25.090> like<00:03:25.300> I'm<00:03:25.570> needle<00:03:25.930> felting<00:03:26.260> very

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
looks like I'm needle felting very

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.470 
looks like I'm needle felting very
quickly<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:27.280> making<00:03:27.670> these<00:03:27.790> objects<00:03:28.240> very

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
quickly and making these objects very

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.660 
quickly and making these objects very
fast<00:03:28.750> but<00:03:29.140> this<00:03:29.620> process<00:03:29.830> actually<00:03:30.190> takes<00:03:30.580> a

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
fast but this process actually takes a

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.760 
fast but this process actually takes a
really<00:03:31.030> long<00:03:31.210> time<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.780> took<00:03:31.810> me<00:03:31.990> more<00:03:32.560> than

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
really long time it took me more than

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.370 
really long time it took me more than
half<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.160> day<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.370> create<00:03:33.850> this<00:03:34.000> Kitty<00:03:34.270> so<00:03:35.170> once

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
half a day to create this Kitty so once

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.810 
half a day to create this Kitty so once
you<00:03:35.470> created<00:03:35.860> two<00:03:36.010> ears<00:03:36.280> you're<00:03:36.520> going<00:03:36.700> to

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
you created two ears you're going to

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.240 
you created two ears you're going to
make<00:03:37.000> four<00:03:37.330> kitten<00:03:37.660> paws<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.710> roll<00:03:38.950> some

make four kitten paws just roll some

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.620 
make four kitten paws just roll some
needle<00:03:39.610> felt<00:03:39.850> into<00:03:40.150> what<00:03:40.300> looks<00:03:40.450> like<00:03:40.510> a

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
needle felt into what looks like a

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.420 
needle felt into what looks like a
cylinder<00:03:40.990> and<00:03:41.470> as<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.650> can<00:03:41.740> see<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:41.980> needle

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
cylinder and as you can see I needle

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.040 
cylinder and as you can see I needle
felted<00:03:42.760> one<00:03:42.910> end<00:03:43.120> but<00:03:43.300> not<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.600> other<00:03:43.810> and

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
felted one end but not the other and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.600 
felted one end but not the other and
that's<00:03:44.290> important<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:44.920> you<00:03:45.010> can<00:03:45.190> stick<00:03:45.430> the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
that's important so you can stick the

I'm<00:04:03.280> going<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.730> use<00:04:03.850> this<00:04:03.970> stream<00:04:04.270> to<00:04:04.420> form<00:04:04.660> all

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
I'm going to use this stream to form all

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.870 
I'm going to use this stream to form all
the<00:04:04.930> detailing<00:04:05.350> on<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.860> face<00:04:06.100> of<00:04:06.310> cause<00:04:06.640> in

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
the detailing on the face of cause in

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.840 
the detailing on the face of cause in
the<00:04:06.970> body<00:04:07.260> each<00:04:08.260> paw<00:04:08.710> will<00:04:09.100> need<00:04:09.310> two<00:04:09.550> black

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
the body each paw will need two black

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
strings covering each side of the paw so

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.700 
strings covering each side of the paw so
it<00:04:12.700> looks<00:04:12.940> more<00:04:13.120> like<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.360> kittens<00:04:13.810> paw<00:04:14.080> it
