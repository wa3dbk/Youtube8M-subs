00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
fan song that Eden wrote because I've

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.630 
fan song that Eden wrote because I've
been<00:00:29.110> obsessed<00:00:29.500> with<00:00:29.619> it<00:00:29.800> for<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.130> last<00:00:30.310> week

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
been obsessed with it for the last week

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.060 
been obsessed with it for the last week
and<00:00:31.029> I<00:00:31.449> learned<00:00:31.720> it<00:00:31.900> in<00:00:32.080> develop<00:00:32.440> less<00:00:32.920> than

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
and I learned it in develop less than

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.320 
and I learned it in develop less than
three<00:00:33.220> days<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.510> if<00:00:35.199> it<00:00:35.470> sucks
