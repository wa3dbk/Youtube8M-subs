personally um it's kind of getting too

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.770 
personally um it's kind of getting too
stale<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.030> duties<00:00:54.210> maybe<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
stale I think all duties maybe like a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.930 
stale I think all duties maybe like a
year<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.289> late<00:00:55.559> yeah<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:56.699> would<00:00:56.820> put

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
year or two late yeah if they would put

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.250 
year or two late yeah if they would put
this<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> few<00:00:57.360> years<00:00:57.480> ago<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.050> in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
this out a few years ago I think I'm in

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.080 
this out a few years ago I think I'm in
groundbreaking<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:00:59.730> titanfall

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
groundbreaking but I think titanfall

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.750 
groundbreaking but I think titanfall
really<00:01:00.719> stole<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> flame<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> call<00:01:02.670> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
really stole the flame from the call of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.060 
really stole the flame from the call of
duty<00:01:02.820> franchise<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> while<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.890> feel

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
duty franchise for a while and I feel

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.350 
duty franchise for a while and I feel
like<00:01:05.100> there's<00:01:05.309> they're<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.610> copying<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.119> lot

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
like there's they're just copying a lot

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.719
