00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.589
 this is our three legged sicily 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.500
 I also have this presidency at that time 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.290
 I made both of them video 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.970
 explained how to plant such 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:27.440
 cuts and this year I join 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.550
 the plant is not cut except in the 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.040
 Spring keeps the cut and she 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.490
 should keep growing and the 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.490
 checkered 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.280
 now if the plants into the 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.300
 I will come to the winter quarters 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.860
 of course, all shoot long 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:57.280
 will cut back earlier this too 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.470
 transplanted I show you 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.019
 so learn now again from you 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.900
 sees that the first branch above 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.030
 So now progressing 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.460
 and here you can see for example completely 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.869
 clearly that two first 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.950
 Opposite that would be natural 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:18.660
 Change in the spring because that is 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.500
 not quite so great but overall 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.180
 gets the plants meanwhile 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.530
 structure and if you are a bit 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.560
 patience can be so through 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.160
 definitely put on your own clothes and 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.160
 shape yourself too 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.920
 here you can see the interfaces and 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.450
 cut him off last year and 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:54.050
 all of this has grown and after that 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.050
 Now we could close it all up
