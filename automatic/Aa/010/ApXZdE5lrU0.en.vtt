 hello very good everyone I'm Juan with 94 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.890
 welcome to week 58 of the top 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.110
 weekly we start 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.240
 and we start with the number 10 we do not 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.670
 We are going to cruise but if it is here 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.520
 this super is already so luxurious with 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.920
 garcia 94 of mica and be that it catches 3 not 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.120
 four enemies in the back and what 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.400
 take advantage taking the 4 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.900
 and in number 9 we have to this one 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.150
 uniform that sends us a clip from 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.460
 houston 2025 a quick clip a clip 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.470
 frantic there we see that he has sc 4 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.700
 thus getting his first low ups 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.090
 the stairs he takes it with 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.650
 tranquility visualizes the radar finishes 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.210
 with that second enemy with bad 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.190
 intentions and with a shotgun at hand 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.510
 upload recharge strips of 4 to catch 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.920
 respond and finish with the fourth victim 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.950
 wait at the desk to finish 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.260
 the fifth that came out that was going to upload 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.170
 not happy ends with the sixth with sc 4 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.450
 seventh and when climbing the stairs with the 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.490
 eighth 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.440
 and in number 8 we have a clip that we 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.420
 send david mejia from modern warfare 3 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.770
 there we see him consul in 96 clear yes 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.780
 with that first low but not with the 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.400
 second is how bad this has 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.320
 sniper that despite being so 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.720
 fast aiming with the sight makes 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.270
 too many marker hits so sometimes 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.850
 you have to have prepared that second shot 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.229
 of grace although David Mejia is going to 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.420
 do superbly covering the area 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.070
 of aisle since it's going to charge eight 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.680
 victims nothing more and nothing less 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.080
 finally the enemies finish until the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.970
 scrotum of him not and go directly to 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.100
 I'm crazy about him even though David tells me 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.030
 you do not go to my zone because you have not passed 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.030
 the feet by the doormat 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.130
 and in number 7 we have sand and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.720
 sorry isra 1994 in expresses and we saw 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.820
 that withdrawing from 4g does not affect anyone 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.280
 but nothing happens isra will not let you 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.189
 escape because he goes with his shotgun to 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.200
 collect and recycle your sheet and see the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.210
 second third victim very quickly 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.310
 is going to load 7 in total a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.840
 very fast way and taking all the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 badges to score both the team and 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.270
 to his streak and we see that it ends with the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.270
 last the seventh victim very good click 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.860

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.300

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.120
 with his diamond mp7 to mortal and 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.040
 shooting from the hip with the laser 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.260
 get the first low and the second 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.450
 that almost killed him a precision there by 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.460
 part of mortals will not place the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:46.340
 pump will change if you take the shotgun and 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.110
 attentive to this kill bill of 1 2 3 4 and 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.440
 finally 5 to complete his run of 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.440
 7 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.050
 and at number 4 we'll get into the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.170
 Ivan 95 paper found in the 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.730
 carrier map wielding that pw in mode 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.130
 find and destroy some that are 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.710
 find the first victim ending now 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.750
 with her recharge she takes it with 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.080
 tranquility quickly finds the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.360
 second that good there is a shot 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.940
 that at such a short distance can be lethal 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.320
 a great failure of precision on the part of the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.930
 enemy but what matters is that Ivan 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.700
 still standing still giving cane with that pw 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.190
 ends with the third enemy by the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.170
 back and soon with the third but 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.160
 sorry with the room that goes with shield and 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.680
 he can not finish him 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.420
 with that c4 since he wears a vest 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.770
 bulletproof is going to have to get closer is going to 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.650
 have to take risks to finally 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.950
 ending the fourth enemy is not going to 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.860
 it would be no problem to kill him 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.210
 recharge is positioned wait we see that it 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.490
 is going to throw the team to the back because 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.290
 the only one remaining survivor in his 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.080
 team is doing is the dead is 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.720
 still let's go he has 11 left for the 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.060
 full team strip is saturated and dora has 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.070
 revealed his position sniffs for 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.550
 finally end that trip with the 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.140
 last enemy 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.700
 and at number 3 we have a clip 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.080
 frantic and of a lot of quality 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.080
 sent by quique where the 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.030
 Flag must and will end with 5 a fit 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.030
 of 5 that's what it is to take a flag 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.050
 and in number 2 I ask you a lot 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.299
 attention to this piece of clip sent 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.820
 8 where the killer is only front 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.519
 to six enemies in search and destroy and 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.800
 he just defends himself with the b-23 in this 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.510
 burst gun that sometimes is 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 as effective as for example now 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.110
 from the hip where it ends with the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.570
 third victim the matador 8 already 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.420
 continuation with the fourth even from 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.130
 the distance this one dares with everything and 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.780
 vigilant because the enemy rivals 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.210
 they have placed the pump but nothing happens 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.880
 he finally ends up with those two for 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.830
 get the full team plus that 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.470
 deactivation of the pump and therefore 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.710
 the round won like that is played look up and 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.710
 destroy 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.360
 and attentive to number one because this clip 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:58.300
 you do not see every day we see you see 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.180
 I honored Newtown food with that triple 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.180
 cow with the this one of this machine gun 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.979
 light as effective on this map there 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.110
 we see how it goes and good adds and follows 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.050
 to finally finish with eleven victims 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.419

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.919
