the<00:04:45.490> fly<00:04:45.669> simulator<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.510> so<00:04:47.440> I<00:04:47.470> can<00:04:47.680> do<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.800> for

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
the fly simulator and so I can do it for

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.280 
the fly simulator and so I can do it for
real<00:04:48.160> go<00:04:48.430> go<00:04:48.850> out<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:49.570> Sears<00:04:49.810> Tower<00:04:49.870> and

real go go out to the Sears Tower and
come<00:04:50.470> back<00:04:50.620> it's<00:04:51.070> no<00:04:51.250> small<00:04:51.640> coincidence<00:04:52.479> that

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
come back it's no small coincidence that

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.350 
come back it's no small coincidence that
this<00:04:53.260> majestic<00:04:54.130> airport<00:04:54.640> is<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:55.120> home
