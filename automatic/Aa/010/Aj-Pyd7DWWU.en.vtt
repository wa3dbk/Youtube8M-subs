00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hi everyone welcome here on stock 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.220
 droid 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.069
 today we will see an application that is 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.840
 call com sicurity that will allow us 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.509
 mainly we will not show you how 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.969
 put a sequence before yours 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 applications to avoid access by 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:23.189
 but there are even more intruders we go to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.619
 see this app has been 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.080
 developed by the developers of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.630
 clean master in the image you know 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.660
 you already have some with driving in nature 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.110
 general smattering general and le 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.610
 main functions are say a 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.760
 mainly from antivirus this 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.739
 application 15 then scan the fd la 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.690
 internal memory to check if there is 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.969
 some viruses 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.680
 then it also allows us to add one 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.570
 black list of calls not 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.059
 we therefore want to receive 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.430
 this is nice too 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.770
 what we are here for today is precisely a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.050
 plot he had then added this 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.870
 graphic sequence but not only when 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.689
 someone has gone wrong and rare visca will be 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 a photo with the front camera on 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.560
 person who tried to access the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.750
 your application so you'll know who 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.189
 he tried to read but I turned 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.840
 this is a feature we liked 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.250
 to you and this can really be said that 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.200
 he has just snatched a functional one 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.619
 nice then we go to see 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.810
 we are going to see cm seacure.it 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.939
 then meanwhile opens up mall and there 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.030
 we find ourselves immediately in front of this mega 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.380
 bubble-shaped button with writing 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.470
 check that as you have already understood 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.680
 lets you scan the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.470
 our smartphone but the core the juice 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.360
 of the application we find it in this 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.149
 menu a control sd cards 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.280
 will check between a kind of scan 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.829
 however our sd card clean up files 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.810
 useless refers us to the play store where 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.189
 we can download which file is what if 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.649
 you don't know the application anyway 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.600
 allows you to clean unnecessary files look 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.549
 a bit a block let's see later 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.210
 those we mentioned earlier about 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.800
 phone to things that stick with 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.890
 Scotch then 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.690
 search phone allows to locate 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.820
 we had left the smartphone not you 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.490
 I love then we give the proof translations 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.160
 where your phone makes the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.500
 your phone screams just fine 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.800
 Congratulations anyway whether you have a 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.630
 very useful function 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.770
 also what we find block phone calls 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.800
 so as we have already said the 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.690
 possibility to avoid phone calls 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.520
 from certain numbers we can choose 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.620
 and in the setting he had a little 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.810
 usual things scan me planned 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.440
 in short, a bit more settings 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.140
 clean private content change languages 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.450
 so let's see these things 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.510
 the core of the core of what 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.420
 had to show that up lock up lorca 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.130
 here it is in this first screen 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.150
 we can choose the applications that 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.130
 anyway we can go to later 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.110
 change even after the 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.970
 applications we want to block them 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.680
 use this pattern now 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.560
 select for example whatsapp then 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.710
 schio block we do not know a pattern 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.010
 so randomly here's something like that 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.260
 a success like that is blocked 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.300
 john muciaccia would say 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.610
 from here you see that we can still in 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.560
 a second time 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.330
 select multiple applications such as 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.880
 applying this pattern now let's go 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.550
 to see how it behaves then we open 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.170
 whatsapp and see that the graphics are too 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.120
 genuinely very nice I like it 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.110
 see below 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.180
 let's say the finger wherever we carry it 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.940
 however we have this function which is 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.370
 on the temporary block that allows us 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.920
 what then not leaving this 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.930
 setting once we have it 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.670
 typed the pattern until it does 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.930
 we block the screen he doesn't 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.370
 will require more at the next opening 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.340
 so if for example we do it 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.050
 then we do others we have passed without 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.570
 never lock the screen will not come 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.280
 asked again the beat we can 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.350
 choose instead that after three minutes there 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.060
 he asks in any case it is true time 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.430
 even if we didn't lock the screen 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.209
 each time he asks us for the pattern that it is 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.650
 recommended I prefer sincerante 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.490
 the latter maybe how it can take 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.739
 even my phone while 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.120
 it is not yet locked and therefore can have 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.730
 access to applications I don't want 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.470
 that we are seen 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.170
 also then see that if we 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.020
 once wrong the combination does not 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.000
 nothing will happen because in short he says 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.670
 you too can once 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.310
 miss the combination but the second one 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.490
 once a photo will be taken it us 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.810
 let's make a face and now it will have 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.600
 then took the picture when we 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:47.450
 we're going to put up the right password 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.730
 and we will see the picture of yours of ours 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.790
 we say our intruder character who 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.300
 wanted to turn on our application 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.550
 so this is in short it is cm closes 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.380
 so a general tool that allows us 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.640
 of product scan files that block 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.500
 call all those functions anyway 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.600
 that you saw that still make it 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.850
 the application is very complete let's say 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.850
 regarding this type of 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:15.210
 functions we feel we can recommend it 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:18.990
 see you download it from bandai is 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:22.820
 liked a little shameful that never free 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:27.960
 day even today's video ends here 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:31.650
 what the same stop t - shirt though 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:34.260
 will be approved anyway sooner or later a 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:40.470
 freeing the first pristine the 3 sts 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:42.660
 let's say a little party put a like 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:46.170
 if you enjoyed this video let us 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:49.440
 know in comments comments things to be 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.300
 telling us in general is also a good memory 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:56.620
 we all see ourselves as next 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.479
 the idea is good to say that at the moment yes 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:07.169
 we put some scotch we can also 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:11.729
 sell them you heard party pain 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.729
