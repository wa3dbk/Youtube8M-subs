00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.400 

the<00:00:08.029> thing<00:00:08.210> that's<00:00:08.360> really<00:00:08.480> great<00:00:08.750> about<00:00:08.809> evo

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
the thing that's really great about evo

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.499 
the thing that's really great about evo
shape<00:00:09.679> is<00:00:09.860> that<00:00:10.130> you<00:00:10.519> start<00:00:10.790> the<00:00:10.940> system<00:00:11.300> and

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
shape is that you start the system and

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.539 
shape is that you start the system and
instantly<00:00:12.080> you<00:00:12.290> get<00:00:12.530> a<00:00:12.769> variety<00:00:13.219> of<00:00:13.250> shapes

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
instantly you get a variety of shapes

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.669 
instantly you get a variety of shapes
which<00:00:13.969> designers<00:00:14.480> can<00:00:14.630> then<00:00:14.809> evolve<00:00:15.349> to

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
which designers can then evolve to

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.440 
which designers can then evolve to
whatever<00:00:15.980> they<00:00:16.190> need<00:00:16.340> to<00:00:16.370> the<00:00:16.790> user<00:00:16.940> just<00:00:17.240> has

to either select the shapes that they

to either select the shapes that they
like<00:00:19.610> or<00:00:19.940> if<00:00:20.660> they<00:00:20.780> want<00:00:20.930> to<00:00:20.960> be<00:00:21.080> a<00:00:21.110> bit<00:00:21.260> more

concept evo shape is not just being used

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.340 
concept evo shape is not just being used
for<00:01:27.970> consumer<00:01:28.970> product<00:01:29.299> design<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.930> we've

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
for consumer product design and we've

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.780 
for consumer product design and we've
also<00:01:30.500> got<00:01:30.770> architects<00:01:31.310> that<00:01:31.400> are<00:01:31.549> really

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
also got architects that are really

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.850 
also got architects that are really
interested<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.360> using<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:32.840> in<00:01:33.080> one<00:01:33.380> case<00:01:33.560> an

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
interested in using it in one case an

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.340 
interested in using it in one case an
architect<00:01:34.490> used<00:01:34.880> evo<00:01:35.240> shape<00:01:35.510> to<00:01:35.750> generate<00:01:36.140> a

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
architect used evo shape to generate a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.469 
architect used evo shape to generate a
series<00:01:36.830> of<00:01:36.979> inspirational<00:01:37.970> shapes<00:01:38.270> that

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
series of inspirational shapes that

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.690 
series of inspirational shapes that
meant<00:01:38.900> something<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.320> him<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:39.740> encapsulated

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
meant something to him and encapsulated

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.030 
meant something to him and encapsulated
the<00:01:40.880> design<00:01:41.390> aesthetic<00:01:41.930> those<00:01:42.530> shapes<00:01:42.830> were

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
the design aesthetic those shapes were

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.100 
the design aesthetic those shapes were
then<00:01:43.189> used<00:01:43.430> by<00:01:43.700> an<00:01:43.760> industrial<00:01:44.270> designer<00:01:44.299> to

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
then used by an industrial designer to

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:58.380 
then used by an industrial designer to
create<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.530> security<00:01:45.950> camera

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.810 

in<00:01:59.390> this<00:02:00.080> case<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.710> designer<00:02:01.220> was<00:02:01.370> so

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
in this case the designer was so

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.670 
in this case the designer was so
inspired<00:02:02.270> by<00:02:02.390> using<00:02:02.720> Iver<00:02:03.140> shape<00:02:03.320> they<00:02:03.500> went

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
inspired by using Iver shape they went

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.590 
inspired by using Iver shape they went
on<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:04.130> design<00:02:04.610> another<00:02:04.760> product<00:02:05.150> and<00:02:05.510> the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
on to design another product and the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.900 
on to design another product and the
desk<00:02:05.810> lamp<00:02:06.080> it<00:02:06.410> was<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.710> geometry<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.610> shape

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
desk lamp it was the geometry to shape

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.850 
desk lamp it was the geometry to shape
that<00:02:08.420> was<00:02:08.510> evolved<00:02:08.930> by<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.140> designer<00:02:09.590> that

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
that was evolved by the designer that

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.980 
that was evolved by the designer that
inspired<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.640> idea<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.240> incorporating<00:02:11.540> the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
inspired the idea of incorporating the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.260 
inspired the idea of incorporating the
spotlight<00:02:12.440> into<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> diffuser<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:14.150> is

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
spotlight into the diffuser and this is

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.360 
spotlight into the diffuser and this is
a<00:02:14.300> really<00:02:14.600> good<00:02:14.750> example<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:15.380> where<00:02:15.800> Eva<00:02:16.130> shape

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
a really good example of where Eva shape

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.730 
a really good example of where Eva shape
does<00:02:16.700> not<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.120> inspire<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.750> styling<00:02:18.260> but

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
does not just inspire the styling but

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.250 
does not just inspire the styling but
also<00:02:18.920> new<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:19.910> innovative<00:02:20.630> product

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260
