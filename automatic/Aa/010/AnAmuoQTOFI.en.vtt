00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370 

hey<00:00:00.269> guys<00:00:00.480> so<00:00:00.599> we<00:00:00.690> noticed<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.230> last

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
hey guys so we noticed in the last

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.649 
hey guys so we noticed in the last
single<00:00:02.190> loop<00:00:02.340> drawstring<00:00:02.939> video<00:00:03.240> there<00:00:03.570> was

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
single loop drawstring video there was

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.059 
single loop drawstring video there was
one<00:00:03.810> part<00:00:04.020> that<00:00:04.049> was<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.259> little<00:00:04.560> bit<00:00:04.680> tricky<00:00:04.830> to

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
one part that was a little bit tricky to

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.460 
one part that was a little bit tricky to
catch<00:00:05.310> on<00:00:05.730> camera<00:00:06.240> so<00:00:06.420> we<00:00:06.509> tried<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.960> couple

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
catch on camera so we tried a couple

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.049 
catch on camera so we tried a couple
different<00:00:07.649> cameras<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.460> time<00:00:08.670> we'll<00:00:08.820> see<00:00:08.970> if

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
different cameras this time we'll see if

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.790 
different cameras this time we'll see if
this<00:00:09.179> helps<00:00:09.330> are<00:00:09.570> not<00:00:09.719> kind<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.110> an<00:00:10.200> experiment

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
this helps are not kind of an experiment

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.589 
this helps are not kind of an experiment
but<00:00:10.920> I'll<00:00:11.040> really<00:00:11.519> slow<00:00:11.849> down<00:00:11.880> on<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.269> part

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
but I'll really slow down on that part

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.789 
but I'll really slow down on that part
too<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:13.049> first<00:00:13.259> I'll<00:00:13.380> just<00:00:13.410> go<00:00:13.590> through<00:00:13.620> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
too but first I'll just go through the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.350 
too but first I'll just go through the
whole<00:00:13.830> thing<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.880> like<00:00:14.969> tying<00:00:15.210> our<00:00:15.330> shoes

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
whole thing so just like tying our shoes

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.000 
whole thing so just like tying our shoes
we<00:00:15.660> have<00:00:15.750> got<00:00:15.900> like<00:00:16.109> our<00:00:16.320> left<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.859> our<00:00:16.980> right

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
we have got like our left and our right

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.420 
we have got like our left and our right
shoelaces<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.090> guess<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.510> then<00:00:19.380> pull<00:00:20.160> tight

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
shoelaces I guess and then pull tight

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.040 
shoelaces I guess and then pull tight
through<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.180> opening<00:00:23.570> just<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.750> show<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
through the opening just to show the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.130 
through the opening just to show the
whole<00:00:25.140> process<00:00:26.359> move<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.570> loop<00:00:27.720> pull<00:00:29.990> so<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
whole process move the loop pull so the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.420 
whole process move the loop pull so the
tricky<00:00:31.470> part<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:32.009> after<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> very<00:00:33.090> first<00:00:33.149> step

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
tricky part is after the very first step

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.729 
tricky part is after the very first step
right<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.420> what<00:00:36.690> do<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.290> this

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
right here so what do we do here so this

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.610 
right here so what do we do here so this
left<00:00:38.390> shoelace<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.780> guess<00:00:39.960> we'll<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.230> call<00:00:40.500> it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
left shoelace I guess we'll just call it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
left shoelace I guess we'll just call it
that<00:00:40.649> we're<00:00:41.430> backing<00:00:41.790> we're<00:00:41.940> looking<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that we're backing we're looking for the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.459 
that we're backing we're looking for the
loop<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:43.410> comes<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.750> opening<00:00:46.170> here

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
loop that comes out of the opening here

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.350 
loop that comes out of the opening here
this<00:00:46.680> initial<00:00:47.340> drawstring<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.059> that's<00:00:48.180> what

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
this initial drawstring and that's what

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.720 
this initial drawstring and that's what
we're<00:00:48.480> backing<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.989> left<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.460> through<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
we're backing this left one through is

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.720 
we're backing this left one through is
just<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.510> opening<00:00:52.250> then<00:00:53.250> we're<00:00:53.399> pulling

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
just that opening then we're pulling

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.840 
just that opening then we're pulling
tight<00:00:53.940> after<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.530> I'll<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.829> again

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.760 

the<00:00:59.850> only<00:01:00.120> loop<00:01:00.629> we're<00:01:00.840> looking<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the only loop we're looking for is the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.579 
the only loop we're looking for is the
one<00:01:01.920> coming<00:01:02.219> out<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.789> opening<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.589> left

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
one coming out of the opening there left

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.850 
one coming out of the opening there left
one<00:01:04.799> backs<00:01:05.100> through<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:06.439> get<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.560> back<00:01:07.710> in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
one backs through that get it back in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
one backs through that get it back in
the<00:01:07.920> hand<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.340> pull<00:01:08.490> tight<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:09.570> area<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.900> think

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the hand and pull tight one area I think

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.679 
the hand and pull tight one area I think
that<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.530> be<00:01:10.560> tricky<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.640> when<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.600> to

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that can be tricky is when we get to

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.109 
that can be tricky is when we get to
that<00:01:12.810> point<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:14.010> back<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.369> out<00:01:14.490> two<00:01:14.850> loops

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that point if we back it out two loops

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.969 
that point if we back it out two loops
so<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.750> go<00:01:15.869> through<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.170> initial<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
so we go through this initial one and

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.200 
so we go through this initial one and
maybe<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.310> additional<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:19.790> like<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
maybe this additional one here like so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.330 
maybe this additional one here like so
it<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.840> falls<00:01:22.020> apart<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.159> have<00:01:23.310> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it just falls apart so we just have to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.510 
it just falls apart so we just have to
back<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.790> through<00:01:23.970> one<00:01:27.650> just<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.100> first

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
back it out through one just that first

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.460 
back it out through one just that first
one<00:01:29.850> there<00:01:32.780> one<00:01:33.780> thing<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.140> about<00:01:34.170> this

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
one there one thing I like about this

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.679 
one there one thing I like about this
process<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.070> after<00:01:35.640> we've<00:01:35.820> accomplished

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
process is that after we've accomplished

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.510 
process is that after we've accomplished
that<00:01:36.810> loop<00:01:37.110> through<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> loop<00:01:37.680> thing<00:01:37.860> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
that loop through the loop thing you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.620 
that loop through the loop thing you
really<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.299> anymore

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
really don't have to do it anymore

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.260 
really don't have to do it anymore
it's<00:01:39.840> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.049> done<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.790> as<00:01:41.790> long<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.150> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
it's kind of done for as long as you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
it's kind of done for as long as you
want<00:01:42.450> forever<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.960> kind<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.590> leave<00:01:43.799> mine<00:01:44.009> like

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
want forever I kind of leave mine like

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.679 
want forever I kind of leave mine like
that<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.090> know<00:01:45.119> run<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.450> through<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that when I you know run it through the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.780 
that when I you know run it through the
wash<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.259> leave<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.399> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
wash I just leave it that way and you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.429 
wash I just leave it that way and you
just<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.270> do<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> last<00:01:48.659> step<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.350> you

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
just have to do the last step and you

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.139 
just have to do the last step and you
can<00:01:49.560> see<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.860> when<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.100> disassemble<00:01:52.970> if<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
can see that when you disassemble if I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.670 
can see that when you disassemble if I
can<00:01:54.329> get<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:56.990> you're<00:01:57.990> still<00:01:58.200> kind<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.469> left

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
can get it you're still kind of left
