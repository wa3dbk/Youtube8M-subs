00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
motor generator units the new one is

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.979 
motor generator units the new one is
powered<00:02:16.810> by<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.989> flow<00:02:17.319> of<00:02:17.349> hot<00:02:17.680> exhaust<00:02:18.010> gases

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.360 
powered by the flow of hot exhaust gases
the<00:02:19.989> other<00:02:20.110> one<00:02:20.290> still<00:02:20.560> uses<00:02:20.950> brake<00:02:21.160> energy

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
the other one still uses brake energy

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.520 
the other one still uses brake energy
from<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.819> rear<00:02:21.970> wheels<00:02:22.209> it's<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.230> lot<00:02:23.470> more

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
from the rear wheels it's a lot more

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.039 
from the rear wheels it's a lot more
powerful<00:02:24.010> now<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:25.209> better<00:02:25.390> impact<00:02:25.810> now

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
powerful now the better impact now

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.660 
powerful now the better impact now
stores<00:02:26.380> ten<00:02:26.620> times<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.130> amount<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.489> energy

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
stores ten times the amount of energy

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.880 
stores ten times the amount of energy
that's<00:02:28.269> enough<00:02:28.630> for<00:02:28.810> 33<00:02:29.319> seconds<00:02:29.680> per<00:02:29.860> lap

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
that's enough for 33 seconds per lap

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.729 
that's enough for 33 seconds per lap
rather<00:02:30.370> than<00:02:30.549> 6.6<00:02:31.239> as<00:02:31.390> before<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.349> double

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
rather than 6.6 as before and a double

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.140 
rather than 6.6 as before and a double
boost<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.160> 160<00:02:33.970> horsepower<00:02:35.790> therefore<00:02:36.790> more

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
boost of 160 horsepower therefore more

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.330 
boost of 160 horsepower therefore more
talk<00:02:37.480> which<00:02:38.170> means<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:38.620> tougher<00:02:38.829> to<00:02:38.890> control

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
talk which means it's tougher to control

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.670 
talk which means it's tougher to control
getting<00:02:39.790> on<00:02:39.879> the<00:02:39.910> power<00:02:40.319> so<00:02:41.319> we<00:02:41.410> can<00:02:41.530> expect

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
getting on the power so we can expect

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.350 
getting on the power so we can expect
lots<00:02:42.250> more<00:02:42.519> battles

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
lots more battles

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.600 
lots more battles
the<00:02:44.930> outside<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.620> aerodynamics<00:02:46.250> have

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
the outside and the aerodynamics have

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.700 
the outside and the aerodynamics have
also<00:02:46.910> changed<00:02:47.120> quite<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.510> lot<00:02:47.600> our<00:02:48.230> feet<00:02:48.530> move

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
also changed quite a lot our feet move

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.470 
also changed quite a lot our feet move
down<00:02:48.980> because<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.520> nose<00:02:49.700> comes<00:02:50.000> down<00:02:50.210> for

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
down because the nose comes down for
