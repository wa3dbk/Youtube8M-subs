00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
welcome to golf struck today we're going

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.299 
welcome to golf struck today we're going
to<00:00:07.130> talk<00:00:07.370> about<00:00:07.400> one<00:00:07.910> of<00:00:07.940> our<00:00:08.240> more<00:00:08.990> difficult

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
to talk about one of our more difficult

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.940 
to talk about one of our more difficult
problems<00:00:10.309> which<00:00:10.639> is<00:00:10.880> finding<00:00:11.630> the<00:00:12.320> right<00:00:12.350> feel

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
problems which is finding the right feel

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.779 
problems which is finding the right feel
for<00:00:13.370> distance<00:00:13.850> with<00:00:14.180> our<00:00:14.360> chip<00:00:14.600> shots<00:00:15.520> if<00:00:16.520> we

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
for distance with our chip shots if we

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.000 
for distance with our chip shots if we
can<00:00:16.970> hit<00:00:17.119> landing<00:00:17.600> spots<00:00:17.900> consistently<00:00:18.770> and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
can hit landing spots consistently and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.359 
can hit landing spots consistently and
predictably<00:00:20.380> we<00:00:21.380> can<00:00:21.590> knock<00:00:21.769> that<00:00:21.949> ball<00:00:22.160> up

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
predictably we can knock that ball up

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.279 
predictably we can knock that ball up
close<00:00:22.609> enough<00:00:22.939> to<00:00:23.119> one<00:00:23.300> putt<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:23.840> save<00:00:24.259> a

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
close enough to one putt and save a

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.579 
close enough to one putt and save a
stroke<00:00:24.619> a<00:00:24.650> hole<00:00:25.090> so<00:00:26.090> here's<00:00:26.539> my<00:00:26.750> suggestion<00:00:27.230> as

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:27.589 
stroke a hole so here's my suggestion as

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.159 
stroke a hole so here's my suggestion as
the<00:00:27.830> way<00:00:27.980> we<00:00:28.160> get<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:28.820> feel<00:00:29.089> of<00:00:29.359> where<00:00:29.779> we<00:00:29.960> want

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
the way we get the feel of where we want

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.679 
the way we get the feel of where we want
to<00:00:30.259> land<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:30.650> ball<00:00:30.800> we<00:00:31.789> need<00:00:32.000> to<00:00:32.119> start<00:00:32.419> by

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
to land the ball we need to start by

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.750 
to land the ball we need to start by
always<00:00:33.050> asking<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:33.650> golfers<00:00:34.070> question<00:00:34.580> which

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
always asking the golfers question which

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.720 
always asking the golfers question which
is<00:00:35.150> where<00:00:36.079> do<00:00:36.230> I<00:00:36.289> need<00:00:36.620> to<00:00:36.800> finish<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:40.250> land<00:00:40.489> my

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
is where do I need to finish to land my

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.490 
is where do I need to finish to land my
ball<00:00:40.969> there<00:00:41.510> there<00:00:41.989> there<00:00:42.649> or<00:00:43.039> there<00:00:44.350> when<00:00:45.350> we

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
ball there there there or there when we

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.010 
ball there there there or there when we
swing<00:00:45.860> at<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:46.219> club's<00:00:46.520> own<00:00:46.730> natural<00:00:47.300> speed<00:00:47.780> as

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
swing at the club's own natural speed as

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.130 
swing at the club's own natural speed as
we<00:00:49.010> lengthen<00:00:49.309> that<00:00:49.699> arc<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.539> club<00:00:50.840> travels

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
we lengthen that arc the club travels

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.279 
we lengthen that arc the club travels
faster<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.579> the<00:00:52.730> ball<00:00:52.940> will<00:00:53.120> go<00:00:53.270> farther<00:00:53.600> as<00:00:53.899> we

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
faster so the ball will go farther as we

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.650 
faster so the ball will go farther as we
shorten<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.829> arc<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.579> club<00:00:55.879> travels<00:00:56.390> slower

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
shorten the arc the club travels slower

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.590 
shorten the arc the club travels slower
so<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.260> ball<00:00:57.469> will<00:00:57.649> go<00:00:57.800> shorter<00:00:58.250> distance<00:00:58.699> so

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
so the ball will go shorter distance so

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.259 
so the ball will go shorter distance so
the<00:00:59.780> magic<00:00:59.989> of<00:01:00.410> pendulum<00:01:00.920> speed<00:01:01.250> is<00:01:01.519> all<00:01:01.940> we

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
the magic of pendulum speed is all we

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.420 
the magic of pendulum speed is all we
need<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.539> do<00:01:02.809> as<00:01:02.989> a<00:01:03.019> player<00:01:03.410> is<00:01:03.739> control<00:01:04.400> the

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
need to do as a player is control the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.750 
need to do as a player is control the
length<00:01:04.790> of<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:05.090> arc<00:01:05.500> once<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:06.710> have<00:01:06.980> found<00:01:07.400> a

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
length of that arc once you have found a

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.370 
length of that arc once you have found a
finished<00:01:08.180> position<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:08.900> it's<00:01:09.049> a<00:01:09.170> guess

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
finished position and it's a guess

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.100 
finished position and it's a guess
initially<00:01:10.100> for<00:01:10.939> example<00:01:11.390> if<00:01:11.570> I<00:01:11.750> were<00:01:11.900> going<00:01:12.049> to

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
initially for example if I were going to

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.190 
initially for example if I were going to
toss<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.770> ball<00:01:12.950> with<00:01:13.280> my<00:01:13.490> arm<00:01:13.759> to<00:01:14.689> that<00:01:14.900> rock

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
toss the ball with my arm to that rock

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.560 
toss the ball with my arm to that rock
my<00:01:15.830> arm<00:01:16.040> would<00:01:16.250> simply<00:01:16.700> have<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:17.090> go<00:01:17.240> through

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
my arm would simply have to go through

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.260 
my arm would simply have to go through
to<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.869> rock<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:18.470> I<00:01:18.680> would<00:01:18.860> hit<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.100> rock<00:01:19.310> but

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
to the rock and I would hit the rock but

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.300 
to the rock and I would hit the rock but
when<00:01:20.450> I<00:01:20.479> put<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.780> club<00:01:21.079> in<00:01:21.229> my<00:01:21.350> hand<00:01:21.650> now<00:01:21.920> my<00:01:22.100> arm

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
when I put a club in my hand now my arm

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.210 
when I put a club in my hand now my arm
got<00:01:22.520> longer<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:23.869> can<00:01:23.960> no<00:01:24.229> longer<00:01:24.259> swing<00:01:24.950> to

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
got longer so I can no longer swing to

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.600 
got longer so I can no longer swing to
the<00:01:25.400> rock<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.000> ball<00:01:26.210> will<00:01:26.390> go<00:01:26.540> too<00:01:26.600> far<00:01:27.310> so<00:01:28.310> we

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
the rock the ball will go too far so we

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.539 
the rock the ball will go too far so we
have<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.060> guess<00:01:29.350> where<00:01:30.350> do<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:30.650> need<00:01:30.829> to<00:01:31.159> finish

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
have to guess where do I need to finish

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.330 
have to guess where do I need to finish
in<00:01:31.850> order<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.299> hit<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.630> rock<00:01:32.899> and<00:01:33.890> once<00:01:34.159> you

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
in order to hit that rock and once you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.069 
in order to hit that rock and once you
have<00:01:34.490> found<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:34.939> finished<00:01:35.299> position<00:01:35.810> that<00:01:35.990> you

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
have found a finished position that you

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.800 
have found a finished position that you
say<00:01:36.290> I<00:01:36.320> think<00:01:36.500> that'll<00:01:37.220> work<00:01:37.329> now<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:38.360> take

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
say I think that'll work now you take

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.710 
say I think that'll work now you take
the<00:01:39.020> club<00:01:39.229> back<00:01:39.399> equidistant<00:01:40.399> and<00:01:40.549> feel<00:01:41.509> your

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
the club back equidistant and feel your

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.560 
the club back equidistant and feel your
body<00:01:41.960> motion<00:01:42.619> your<00:01:42.770> body<00:01:43.009> turn<00:01:43.430> pull<00:01:44.420> you

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
body motion your body turn pull you

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.109 
body motion your body turn pull you
through<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:44.960> finish<00:01:45.439> position<00:01:45.939> so<00:01:46.939> your

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
through to that finish position so your

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.030 
through to that finish position so your
mind<00:01:47.390> is<00:01:47.630> always<00:01:47.840> focused<00:01:48.500> on<00:01:48.649> where<00:01:48.890> you're

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
mind is always focused on where you're

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.340 
mind is always focused on where you're
going<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:50.210> simply<00:01:50.509> swing<00:01:50.990> away<00:01:51.140> from

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
going and you simply swing away from

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.160 
going and you simply swing away from
where<00:01:51.770> you're<00:01:51.920> going<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:53.390> try<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.689> get<00:01:53.990> where

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
where you're going to try to get where

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.959 
where you're going to try to get where
you're<00:01:54.290> going<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:54.829> it<00:01:55.130> would<00:01:55.280> look<00:01:55.430> like<00:01:55.490> this

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
you're going so it would look like this

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.990 
you're going so it would look like this
where<00:01:56.960> am<00:01:57.079> I<00:01:57.170> going<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.500> finish<00:01:57.680> take<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.820> back

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
where am I going to finish take it back

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.630 
where am I going to finish take it back
equidistant<00:01:59.899> stop<00:02:00.590> there<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.100> then<00:02:01.340> feel

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
equidistant stop there and then feel

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.880 
equidistant stop there and then feel
your<00:02:01.670> body<00:02:02.030> pull<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.899> through<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.860> that

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
your body pull you through to that
