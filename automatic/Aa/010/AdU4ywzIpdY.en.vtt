00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
digested by the body at all so that is

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.210 
digested by the body at all so that is
exactly<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> talk<00:01:18.450> about<00:01:18.479> when<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.140> mean<00:01:20.040> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
exactly what I talk about when I mean to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.060 
exactly what I talk about when I mean to
say<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.880> not<00:01:20.909> eat<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.630> between<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.590> start

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
say do not eat in between if you start

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.350 
say do not eat in between if you start
eating<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.640> between<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.210> will<00:01:24.299> be

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
eating in between there will be

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.350 
eating in between there will be
partially<00:01:24.900> cooked<00:01:25.110> food<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.070> your<00:01:26.369> body<00:01:26.610> which

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
partially cooked food in your body which

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
partially cooked food in your body which
can<00:01:27.570> never<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:28.020> cooked<00:01:28.259> because<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> new

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
can never get cooked because the new

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
can never get cooked because the new
food<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.130> already<00:01:29.310> entered<00:01:29.670> inside<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
food is already entered inside then the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.420 
food is already entered inside then the
body<00:01:30.840> tries<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> cook<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.770> food<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.400> you

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
body tries to cook that food then you

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.450 
body tries to cook that food then you
add<00:01:32.759> something<00:01:33.090> also<00:01:33.450> eventually<00:01:33.990> what<00:01:34.470> what

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
add something also eventually what what

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.539 
add something also eventually what what
is<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.700> outcome<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.470> totally<00:01:37.470> material<00:01:38.340> which

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
is the outcome is totally material which

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.550 
is the outcome is totally material which
can<00:01:38.790> neither<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.270> digested<00:01:39.780> by<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.930> body<00:01:40.079> nor

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
can neither be digested by the body nor

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.350 
can neither be digested by the body nor
me<00:01:40.740> thrown<00:01:40.950> out<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> body<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.759> that's<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
me thrown out of the body and that's the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.409 
me thrown out of the body and that's the
beginning<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.899> your<00:01:43.079> disorder
