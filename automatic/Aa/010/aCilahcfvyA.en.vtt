can see very bird-like turquoise feet
going<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:41.909> there's<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.239> schleich<00:02:42.480> logo<00:02:42.900> there

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
going on there's the schleich logo there

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.759 
going on there's the schleich logo there
there's<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.310> little<00:02:44.430> dewclaw<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.420> back

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
there's the little dewclaw on the back

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.190 
there's the little dewclaw on the back
very<00:02:46.769> nice<00:02:47.069> really<00:02:47.939> nice<00:02:48.120> creases<00:02:48.720> coming<00:02:49.079> up

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
very nice really nice creases coming up

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.349 
very nice really nice creases coming up
here<00:02:49.470> as<00:02:49.620> we<00:02:50.159> join<00:02:50.340> up<00:02:50.519> with<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.790> tail<00:02:51.060> and

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
here as we join up with the tail and

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.289 
here as we join up with the tail and
again<00:02:51.989> this<00:02:52.109> fine<00:02:52.470> scaling<00:02:53.459> just<00:02:53.489> carries<00:02:54.180> on

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
again this fine scaling just carries on

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.759 
again this fine scaling just carries on
all<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.840> way<00:02:54.930> down<00:02:55.139> the<00:02:55.290> tail

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
all the way down the tail

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.449 
all the way down the tail
it's<00:02:56.069> nice<00:02:56.310> gentle<00:02:57.299> curve<00:02:57.599> in<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.900> tail<00:02:58.280> as<00:02:59.280> we

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
it's nice gentle curve in the tail as we

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.679 
it's nice gentle curve in the tail as we
come<00:02:59.639> around<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.000> other<00:03:00.060> side<00:03:00.389> you<00:03:00.540> can

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
come around to the other side you can

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.000 
come around to the other side you can
see<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> musculature<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> little<00:03:01.739> bit<00:03:01.859> more

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
see the musculature is a little bit more

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.920 
see the musculature is a little bit more
pronounced<00:03:02.489> on<00:03:02.609> that<00:03:02.790> side<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.720> makes

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
pronounced on that side and that makes

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.899 
pronounced on that side and that makes
sense<00:03:04.230> because<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.950> muscle<00:03:05.310> is<00:03:05.459> pulling<00:03:05.819> the

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
sense because the muscle is pulling the

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.330 
sense because the muscle is pulling the
tail<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.419> way<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.349> it's<00:03:07.500> flexing<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.159> this

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
tail this way so it's flexing on this

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.580 
tail this way so it's flexing on this
side<00:03:08.609> which<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.060> really<00:03:09.659> nice<00:03:09.840> informed

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
side which is really nice informed

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.740 
side which is really nice informed
design<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.970> can<00:03:12.120> see<00:03:12.269> here<00:03:12.480> there's<00:03:12.629> some

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
design you can see here there's some

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.750 
design you can see here there's some
really<00:03:12.900> nice<00:03:13.129> folds<00:03:14.129> joining<00:03:14.489> up<00:03:14.579> with<00:03:14.609> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
really nice folds joining up with the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.610 
really nice folds joining up with the
back<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.239> leg<00:03:15.480> as<00:03:15.629> it<00:03:15.750> moves<00:03:15.930> forward<00:03:16.440> you

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
back of this leg as it moves forward you

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.009 
back of this leg as it moves forward you
can<00:03:17.519> see<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.729> skin<00:03:18.030> stretching<00:03:18.569> across<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
can see the skin stretching across the

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.729 
can see the skin stretching across the
muscles<00:03:19.409> really<00:03:20.190> lovely<00:03:20.790> detail<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:22.590> can

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
in the SH like adult Carnotaurus for

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.179 
in the SH like adult Carnotaurus for
comparison<00:05:02.539> you<00:05:02.689> can<00:05:03.080> see<00:05:03.379> these<00:05:03.529> two<00:05:03.740> really

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:04.189 
comparison you can see these two really

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:06.279 
comparison you can see these two really
complement<00:05:04.819> each<00:05:04.939> other<00:05:05.240> but<00:05:05.750> there<00:05:05.900> are<00:05:06.050> some

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:06.289 
complement each other but there are some

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.499 
complement each other but there are some
clear<00:05:06.620> design<00:05:07.069> differences<00:05:07.520> in<00:05:07.819> terms<00:05:08.060> of<00:05:08.330> the

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509 
clear design differences in terms of the

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.230 
clear design differences in terms of the
sculpt<00:05:09.099> especially<00:05:10.099> in<00:05:10.189> terms<00:05:10.460> of<00:05:10.699> the<00:05:10.969> head

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
sculpt especially in terms of the head

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.300 
sculpt especially in terms of the head
sculpt<00:05:11.689> and<00:05:11.840> also<00:05:12.379> the<00:05:12.500> ridges<00:05:12.860> going<00:05:13.099> along

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
sculpt and also the ridges going along

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.129 
sculpt and also the ridges going along
the<00:05:13.460> back<00:05:13.669> I<00:05:13.939> would<00:05:14.300> say<00:05:14.330> that<00:05:14.659> this<00:05:14.810> smaller

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
the back I would say that this smaller

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.740 
the back I would say that this smaller
version<00:05:15.680> looks<00:05:16.219> more<00:05:16.430> akin<00:05:16.699> to<00:05:16.759> Carnotaurus

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
version looks more akin to Carnotaurus

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.959 
version looks more akin to Carnotaurus
that<00:05:17.990> we<00:05:18.080> see<00:05:18.289> in<00:05:18.469> Disney's<00:05:19.189> dinosaur<00:05:19.789> from
