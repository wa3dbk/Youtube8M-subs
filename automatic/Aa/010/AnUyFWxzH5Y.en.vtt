sparked in my mind what was Ryan's
childhood<00:03:36.700> childhood<00:03:37.299> like<00:03:37.890> that<00:03:38.890> raised<00:03:39.220> him

childhood childhood like that raised him

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.890 
childhood childhood like that raised him
into<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:39.820> all-american<00:03:40.540> as<00:03:40.630> we<00:03:40.780> have

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
into this all-american as we have

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.380 
into this all-american as we have

previously discussed you know and and I

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.390 
previously discussed you know and and I
was<00:03:43.570> thinking<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:44.019> said<00:03:44.079> Ryan<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.620> bet<00:03:44.829> he<00:03:45.130> would

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
was thinking I said Ryan I bet he would

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.870 
was thinking I said Ryan I bet he would
have<00:03:45.519> been<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:46.269> very<00:03:46.870> hard<00:03:47.019> person<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.880> be

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
have been a very hard person to be

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.759 
have been a very hard person to be
around<00:03:49.090> because<00:03:49.269> you're<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:49.840> competitive<00:03:50.230> and

but uh yeah it was a little

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.639 
but uh yeah it was a little
disappointing<00:05:16.539> that<00:05:17.020> I<00:05:17.080> didn't<00:05:17.319> reach<00:05:17.499> my

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:17.649

full height I feel like I had two or

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.760 
full height I feel like I had two or
three<00:05:19.300> more<00:05:19.569> inches<00:05:19.869> that<00:05:20.199> I<00:05:20.229> could<00:05:20.469> get<00:05:20.589> out

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
three more inches that I could get out

three more inches that I could get out

but I think you still have it in you the
two<00:05:22.209> or<00:05:22.360> three<00:05:22.539> inches<00:05:22.749> I<00:05:22.930> think<00:05:22.990> they're

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
two or three inches I think they're

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.739
