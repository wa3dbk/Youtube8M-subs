 fights on the roads and can not 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 understand why this is a bad idea and 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.659
 as we have a blacksmith firm mines and keep 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.400

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.490
 can be found everywhere in beer peony as 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.799
 the rule is to complain about stupid healers 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.630
 lack of command tactics and in general 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.040
 the fact that his team consists of stupid 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.049
 crabs incapable of anything 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.540

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.300
 help your team due to lack of 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.320
