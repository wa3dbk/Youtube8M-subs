00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.950 
this going to be the last silver pack w
open<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:47.620> it<00:01:48.130> doesn't<00:01:48.490> seem<00:01:48.760> to<00:01:49.180> be<00:01:49.390> one

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
open and it doesn't seem to be one

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.990 
open and it doesn't seem to be one
that's<00:01:50.590> going<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.860> guess<00:01:51.010> anything<00:01:51.370> good<00:01:51.700> so

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
that's going to guess anything good so

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.149 
that's going to guess anything good so
we're<00:01:52.540> gonna<00:01:52.690> discard<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:53.799> I<00:01:53.860> don't<00:01:54.070> really

team of seasoned players that I've just
come<00:02:43.000> out<00:02:43.090> now<00:02:43.269> will<00:02:43.599> probably<00:02:43.989> rise<00:02:44.200> in<00:02:44.410> price

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
of gone down quite a bit because of you

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.830 
of gone down quite a bit because of you
know<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.790> so<00:03:10.030> many<00:03:10.090> people<00:03:10.209> were<00:03:10.510> opening

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
know that so many people were opening

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.140 
know that so many people were opening
pacsun<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.650> isn't<00:03:11.920> really<00:03:12.069> that<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.880> most

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
pacsun this isn't really that the most

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.420 
pacsun this isn't really that the most
consistent<00:03:13.590> aren't<00:03:14.590> really<00:03:14.860> isn't<00:03:15.160> really

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
consistent aren't really isn't really

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.339 
consistent aren't really isn't really
like<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.880> most<00:03:16.060> amazing<00:03:16.360> team<00:03:17.019> this<00:03:17.170> season

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
like the most amazing team this season

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.710 
like the most amazing team this season
and<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:18.340> all<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:18.940> squads<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.420> are<00:03:19.540> going<00:03:19.660> to

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
and of all the squads that are going to

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.509 
and of all the squads that are going to
be<00:03:19.810> coming<00:03:19.840> out<00:03:20.230> so<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.769> think<00:03:20.980> people<00:03:21.400> will

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
be coming out so I think people will

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.190 
be coming out so I think people will
kind<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.849> you<00:03:22.180> know<00:03:22.209> hold<00:03:22.540> their<00:03:22.660> horses<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.989> bit

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
kind of you know hold their horses a bit

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.590 
kind of you know hold their horses a bit
and<00:03:23.380> try<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.829> just<00:03:24.400> relax<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.910> bit<00:03:25.000> before<00:03:25.060> you

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
and try and just relax a bit before you

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.900 
and try and just relax a bit before you
know<00:03:25.720> maybe<00:03:26.109> like<00:03:26.290> BPL<00:03:26.799> teen<00:03:27.400> season<00:03:27.730> comes
