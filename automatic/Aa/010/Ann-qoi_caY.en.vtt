00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.169 
like the Flying Tigers theme or black
everything<00:01:56.110> out<00:01:56.439> make<00:01:56.860> it<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:57.130> semi-gloss<00:01:57.759> and

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
everything out make it a semi-gloss and

edges all straight lines with duct work
coming<00:02:08.140> in<00:02:08.880> so<00:02:09.929> that's<00:02:10.929> our<00:02:11.170> next<00:02:11.440> hurdle<00:02:13.319> you

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
coming in so that's our next hurdle you

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.590 
coming in so that's our next hurdle you
got<00:02:14.440> an<00:02:14.560> anti-sway<00:02:15.040> bar<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:16.030> think<00:02:16.480> it'd

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
got an anti-sway bar to it I think it'd

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.840 
got an anti-sway bar to it I think it'd
be<00:02:16.630> very<00:02:16.720> stable<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.470> terms<00:02:17.709> were<00:02:18.040> anima<00:02:18.640> sway

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
be very stable in terms were anima sway

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.870 
be very stable in terms were anima sway
bar<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.830> doesn't<00:02:21.190> tip<00:02:21.370> because<00:02:21.730> we've

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
bar so that it doesn't tip because we've

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.970 
bar so that it doesn't tip because we've
got<00:02:22.060> back<00:02:22.360> wheels<00:02:22.690> 13<00:02:23.200> inches<00:02:23.440> wide<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.860> you

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
it'll come up on the edge of the wheel

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.179 
it'll come up on the edge of the wheel
the<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:29.440> side<00:02:29.680> will<00:02:29.830> dip<00:02:30.010> down<00:02:30.040> yeah

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189
