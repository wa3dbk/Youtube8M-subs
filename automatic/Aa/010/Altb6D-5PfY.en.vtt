00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
going to glide this by casting it outlet

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.600 
going to glide this by casting it outlet
and<00:01:56.200> hit<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.410> water<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.860> just<00:01:57.220> kind<00:01:57.370> of<00:01:57.400> lift

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
and hit the water you just kind of lift

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.430 
and hit the water you just kind of lift
your<00:01:57.790> rod<00:01:57.940> tip<00:01:58.180> up<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.540> then<00:01:58.630> let<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.900> glide<00:01:59.170> in

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
your rod tip up and then let it glide in

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.020 
your rod tip up and then let it glide in
until<00:01:59.740> there's<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.980> swoop<00:02:00.190> in<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.430> line<00:02:00.610> fall

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
until there's a swoop in the line fall

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.880 
until there's a swoop in the line fall
and<00:02:01.420> you're<00:02:01.930> going<00:02:02.050> to<00:02:02.080> reel<00:02:02.290> your<00:02:02.409> slack<00:02:02.680> up

and you're going to reel your slack up
raise<00:02:03.400> your<00:02:03.610> rod<00:02:03.790> tip<00:02:03.820> up<00:02:04.270> about<00:02:04.870> three<00:02:05.200> or

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
raise your rod tip up about three or

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.230 
raise your rod tip up about three or
four<00:02:05.380> inches<00:02:05.409> deep<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:06.310> know

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
four inches deep you know

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.300 
four inches deep you know
and<00:02:09.380> when<00:02:10.380> it<00:02:10.470> falls<00:02:10.650> down<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.070> can<00:02:11.190> actually

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
and when it falls down it can actually

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.400 
and when it falls down it can actually
settle<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> grass<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.810> could<00:02:12.960> snatch<00:02:13.260> it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
settle on the grass you could snatch it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.360

up<00:02:13.500> out<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.710> there<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:13.860> it'll<00:02:14.070> come<00:02:14.130> out<00:02:14.280> of

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
up out of there and it'll come out of

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.980 
up out of there and it'll come out of
there<00:02:14.460> clean<00:02:14.730> because<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.150> kill<00:02:15.360> weight<00:02:15.540> will

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
there clean because the kill weight will

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.360 
there clean because the kill weight will
set<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.320> down<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> grass<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.130> legs

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.850 
set it down on the grass and the legs
almost<00:02:17.910> like<00:02:18.360> act<00:02:18.600> like<00:02:18.780> landing<00:02:19.170> gear<00:02:19.380> so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
almost like act like landing gear so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.620 
almost like act like landing gear so
keep<00:02:20.040> up<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.520> tiny<00:02:20.700> little<00:02:21.000> bit<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.210> skin

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
crawfish scent on there and let's go hit

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.500 
crawfish scent on there and let's go hit
these<00:02:25.500> pockets<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.130> reel<00:02:26.670> these<00:02:26.850> edges<00:02:27.330> with

the<00:02:27.600> bombshell<00:02:27.810> turtle<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.440> see<00:02:28.590> if<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:28.770> can

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the bombshell turtle and see if we can

00:02:28.950 --> 00:03:00.980 
the bombshell turtle and see if we can
change<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:29.970> slow<00:02:30.270> bite<00:02:30.510> into<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.980> show<00:02:31.980> bite

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
8 was one that I got hooked it really

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.040 
8 was one that I got hooked it really
broke<00:03:12.280> my<00:03:12.340> heart<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:12.790> let<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.060> go<00:03:13.240> like<00:03:13.630> three

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
broke my heart I let it go like three

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.860 
broke my heart I let it go like three
times<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.560> three<00:03:14.680> times<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.220> swam<00:03:15.460> off<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:15.970> I

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
times and three times it swam off and I

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.970 
times and three times it swam off and I
filleted<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.760> split<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:18.880> open<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.770> in<00:03:20.770> its

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
filleted it split it open and in its

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.490 
filleted it split it open and in its
belly<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.550> turtle<00:03:21.940> about<00:03:22.030> that<00:03:22.300> size<00:03:22.630> I'd

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
belly the turtle about that size I'd

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.080 
belly the turtle about that size I'd
never<00:03:23.680> really<00:03:24.010> thought<00:03:24.040> much<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.490> it<00:03:24.730> until<00:03:24.880> he

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
never really thought much of it until he

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.210 
never really thought much of it until he
brought<00:03:26.050> these<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.470> showed<00:03:26.650> them<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.860> me<00:03:27.040> but

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
brought these and showed them to me but

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.720 
brought these and showed them to me but
it<00:03:27.310> makes<00:03:27.460> perfect<00:03:27.550> sense<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:28.540> know<00:03:29.730> they're

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
it makes perfect sense you know they're

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.660 
it makes perfect sense you know they're
opportunistic<00:03:31.240> feeders<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.190> water<00:03:33.370> on

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
opportunistic feeders in the water on

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.960 
opportunistic feeders in the water on
the<00:03:33.880> surface<00:03:34.330> right<00:03:34.540> below<00:03:34.960> the<00:03:35.140> surface

the surface right below the surface

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.510 
the surface right below the surface
pretty<00:03:36.970> cool
