00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.050 
no this oh ok this seaweed is first now
stay<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.560> if<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.160> put<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.459> down<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
stay here is if you put this down on the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.539 
stay here is if you put this down on the
skin<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:16.350> touches<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.709> oil<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> skin

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
skin and it touches the oil on the skin

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.880 
skin and it touches the oil on the skin
first<00:02:18.060> before<00:02:18.569> this<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.200> powder<00:02:19.440> like<00:02:19.769> it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
first before this the powder like it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.280 
first before this the powder like it
sticks<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.640> hard<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.030> blend<00:02:21.330> out<00:02:21.600> but<00:02:22.200> if

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
sticks and it's hard to blend out but if

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.870 
sticks and it's hard to blend out but if
you<00:02:22.380> put<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.709> on<00:02:22.920> it'll<00:02:23.280> absorb<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
you put this on it'll absorb all the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.670 
you put this on it'll absorb all the
moisture<00:02:23.910> then<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:24.810> easier<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.290> blend<00:02:25.470> this

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
moisture then it's easier to blend this

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530 
moisture then it's easier to blend this
out<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.190> looks<00:02:26.400> softer<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:26.970> more<00:02:27.030> natural

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
out so it looks softer and more natural

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.539 
out so it looks softer and more natural
ok<00:02:27.810> great<00:02:28.140> but<00:02:28.470> don't<00:02:28.709> like<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.400> like

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
because usually the worry about is know

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.729 
because usually the worry about is know
you<00:03:15.030> could<00:03:15.359> do<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:16.139> know<00:03:16.230> what<00:03:16.379> I<00:03:16.560> don't

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
you could do that you know what I don't

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.990 
you could do that you know what I don't
know<00:03:16.829> if<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:16.980> would<00:03:17.040> do<00:03:17.189> a<00:03:17.219> concealer<00:03:17.700> for<00:03:17.879> an

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
know if I would do a concealer for an

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.970 
know if I would do a concealer for an
area<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.389> large<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.260> would<00:03:19.620> probably<00:03:19.739> do

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
area that large I would probably do

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.190 
area that large I would probably do
something<00:03:20.219> oh<00:03:20.519> man<00:03:21.090> on<00:03:21.209> video<00:03:21.329> do<00:03:21.659> so<00:03:21.840> space

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
something oh man on video do so space

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.619 
something oh man on video do so space
their<00:03:22.409> body<00:03:22.650> on<00:03:23.129> my<00:03:23.340> own<00:03:23.459> it's<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.120> water<00:03:24.359> base

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
their body on my own it's a water base

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.539 
their body on my own it's a water base
all<00:03:25.169> right<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.439> it's<00:03:25.530> got<00:03:25.799> no<00:03:25.980> Colligan<00:03:26.430> app

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
all right and it's got no Colligan app

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.679 
all right and it's got no Colligan app
so<00:03:26.790> there's<00:03:27.030> not<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.419> get<00:03:27.510> any

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
so there's not going to get any

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.479 
so there's not going to get any
reflection<00:03:28.169> off<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.349> camera<00:03:28.829> which<00:03:29.370> is

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
reflection off the camera which is

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.039 
reflection off the camera which is
better<00:03:29.669> and<00:03:29.909> it's<00:03:30.120> easier<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.540> blend<00:03:30.689> out<00:03:30.870> and

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
better and it's easier to blend out and

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.530
