 I bring you my Christmas special and it's 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.360
 about a very frequent question for me 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.670
 in these dates within real life 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.189
 especially with friends and people who 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.680
 this year allowed me to meet and good 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.439

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.930

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.730
 Austin's house ribera good in the house 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.059

 ribera I hope you like it to start 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.219
 the night we all get together I put something 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.410
 of music on the stereo the computer and 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.050
 that just to start at about 11 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.940
 complete all preparations to the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.640
 twelve o'clock we shout merry christmas 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.650
 we make a good cider toast nothing 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.930
 expensive just a drink and we happened to give 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.660
 hugs to everyone with nice wishes and 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.510
 other things to then move on to a rich 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.579
 dinner will seem to you then that I am very 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.850
 wolverine because now I will describe you from 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.560
 what's dinner at home first 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.170
 inevitable is the white spaghetti already 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.299
 they know with cream and ham besides being able 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.470
 put a little more salt or sauce 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.780
 tree chili 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.060
 continuing to the main courses you can 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.040
 choose a constant small variety 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.530
 between breaded chicken breasts 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.390
 simple way or if you prefer it in 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.350
 a presentation stuffed with ham and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.090
 cheese 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.340
 On the other hand you can choose a mole 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.100
 special style with chicken meat and 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.290
 whether it's the whole piece or the sown the truth 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.060
 it's all very rich especially if not 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.680
 you forget to accompany these meats 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.960
 prepared with their respective 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.330
 supplements like rice in tomato for 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.880
 accompany potatoes in chipotle sauce that 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.119
 they give flavor and itching to the dish or a 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.340
 rich and sweet russian salad whatever 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.590
 the dish that you choose the truth that you 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.350
 you will be satisfied but then 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.060
 you just have dinner it's time for dessert 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.220
 always a delicious piece of 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.290
 Neapolitan flan home cooked in a bath 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.850
 Mary, the truth is that I tried the 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.150
 many different places and none 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.950
 comes to my house is not to brag 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.229
 to continue the gluttony we would be 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.480
 talking about a cake of three milks for 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.490
 supposedly bathed in a whole layer of 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.410
 chocolate syrup then in the part 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.810
 high and last but not least 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.710
 important we are talking about a 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.020
 sweet salad 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.110
 apple with lights equally since to me 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.600
 mother loves all delicious but 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.790
 canada that ends before the morning 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.880
 come again open gifts around 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.490
 of the tree we are not ostentatious some 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.500
 you serve a pair of present garments that 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.000
 in general they allude to the characteristics 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.310
 of each of the members of the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.040
 family not only beautiful things that we 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.470
 they happened only to fulfill in my case 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.990
 always the gift is personalized is 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.060
 say except for the materials myself 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.310
 He made everything for example gifts 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.280
 book dividers discs movies 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.500
 with own videos is to say everything done 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.240
 by me and only taken to exit in some 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.790
 stationery or place where you can get 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.330
 the final product here ends the night of 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.310
 24 and early morning of the 25th after a 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.910
 good nap of about 10 hours or maybe 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.740
 plus 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.020
 it's time to reheat the food that 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.240
 They were left over and after a second binge 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.280
 epic comes one of the classic ones of the 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.800
 home play board games and video games 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.330
 all gathered the truth that this 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.760
 tradition is from before me 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.770
 existence itself but has prevailed by 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.080
 more than 20 years in a row 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.080
 there is always a big smile for everything 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.570
 this and of course the day flies by to 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.210
 finalized a video in style 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.490
 Yearbook to see as a family and even here 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.920
 the Christmas of my house arrives although this 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.020
 year will be a bit different since it does not 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.030
 we will do so since family members who 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.250
 come to see us these dates in this 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.440
 occasion they will come to the following week in 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.450
 New year and not to do is exceeded 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.640
 amount of food twice in seven 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.530
 days we have opted to buy something a 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.780
 little less durable so you do not throw away 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.000
 the food and not bored and we decided that 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.100
 this Christmas we will buy a package of 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.920
 chick that in you if I raffle 'for 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.170
 a pizza the truth that is something affectionate 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.420
 even so but it will prevent us from being 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.820
 eat the same as well as save a couple 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.040
 of pesos to the stock market but all that 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.380
 I said before it will continue for the new year in 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.989
 that date will launch further home 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.910
 the window first we go to mass I should 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.980
 recognize that it is the only mass to which 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.290
 we attend all year long then 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.870
 we return to light candles as 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.090
 good omen year just past twelve 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.100
 the rumble is heard throughout the house with 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.470
 whistles and espantasuegras 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.450
 100 balloons that I inflated to lung 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.310
 clean my family thunders them like 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.040
 representation that disappears what 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.140
 bad in this year that comes from me 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.850
 inflate each and every one of the 100 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.120
 balloons augurs a year full of work 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.030
 and projects after that eat lentils 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.280
 for abundance grapes for money and 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.860
 Of course I should have dressed up with something new for 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.870
 that date hugs and dinners follow 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.120
 Like only this dinner comes 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.000
 accompanied by typical romeritos of these 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.970
 dates and white pozole with possibility 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.790
 to accompany it with lemon sauce radishes 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.550
 onion and toast with cream that's 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.950
 inevitable at the table for desserts 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.500
 the range increases a little more and the rice 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.870
 with milk arrives to be served all 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.790
 It remains the same as I told you before if everything 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.580
 it would be a great start to the year 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.740
 and a warm and cozy Christmas because it is 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.900

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.240

 that many will criticize 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.199
