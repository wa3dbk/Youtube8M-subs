00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.200
 walk by me such the plant 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.259
 on this beautiful sunny day so I 'm here 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.260
 close to pedro am park near 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.800
 botanical garden and this neighborhood that is 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.260
 known as the gay district of the plant 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.869
 It's where many gay people live. 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.910
 then this personal video Yes today is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.240
 at the request of some people 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.270
 who have been asking me how the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.840
 my experience is to live in a room 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.570
 rented here so when I came I came 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.649
 to live with the young man with whom I would 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.870
 work, I 'll tell you something 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.440
 for you the worst thing you can 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.260
 to do is live and work with the person 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.860
 very complicated very stressful 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.739
 So it's at the beginning that I was going to pay 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.440
 300 dollars for the room 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.530
 But when I got there, it passed some 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.659
 days there is already the water bill and only 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.229
 We're going to have to split the account. 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.040
 water and soon thereafter came the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.710
 light 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.710
 and as it was coming the heat is not 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.380
 I arrived in May and we had to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.360
 divide the light bill and as soon as it is already 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.860
 was saying that he would have to split the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.409
 cable is the charge of having tv and the internet 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.820
 so I actually paid $ 300 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.090
 by the room 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.549
 divided the energy that usually came 110 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.590
 120 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.430
 so I had to pay $ 60 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.689
 energy had to pay 35 for internet 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:50.820
 I had to pay 35 of the cable cord 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.030
 tv and had that is at the end of the week 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.229
 when I received my full amount in the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.759
 end of the month 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.500
 almost half was for him because he was 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.540
 a lot of things to pay 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.969
 not to mention that my room had not 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.710
 television had no cable output in my 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.050
 room but he said he had to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.690
 pay as it had a TV in the room 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.830
 What if I did not watch my problem? 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.680
 that had 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.770
 So, do not mess with me. 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.190
 I paid well so I think super 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.950
 important you and you question is 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.050
 when you rent the room and want 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.640
 really know what you're going to have to 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.730
 pay because the first thing the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.570
 people listen, you're going to pay that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.510
 value 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.860
 and all-inclusive only then come the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.300
 divisions 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.730
 something else we had to 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.210
 split the supermarket also speaks a 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.250
 thing the worst thing you do 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.730
 because we were going to do a supermarket was 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.790
 almost $ 200 a week because he 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.140
 filled the beer cart 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.459
 soda to eat in the cafe 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.490
 in the morning 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.550
 everything things that I do not like I do not like 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.050
 none of this krilow if these little things 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.209
 candy in the morning so I just finished 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.550
 paying for many things that I do not 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:16.320
 consumed then science is very 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:20.130
 stressful is too complicated then okay 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.510
 I do not advise you to live in 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.030
 rented room 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.340
 you really clarify why I 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.930
 I have richly paid for a room 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.760
 but in practice I shared the apartment 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.010
 So for you that's coming, you do not 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.370
 need to share an apartment 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.500
 okay so it reaches us is through 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.470
 shy do not know how things work 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.600
 and a lot of people take advantage of it then 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.250
 when you have already been formed already know how 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.890
 things work 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.930
 Can you question, look, I do not want to. 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.970
 television in my room I do not watch 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.760
 Television, I stay on my computer. 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.950
 so I do not want to stop the cable tv 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.200
 soon ended up because in the first 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.790
 times you need to save your 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.280
 Money, I do not know what you're going through 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.250
 really matter and a lot of people that 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.280
 does not have the Brazilian channel knows then 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.410
 when you arrive is you need 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.019
 save the internet, okay, because 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.750
 everybody needs internet 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.200
 supermarket make your own shopping 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.990
 but there is that question that you depend on 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.630
 of the person to go to the supermarket 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.600
 the following arrived at the end of the week you 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.850
 received your day of the week call a taxi 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.310
 It's if you went to live in communities. 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.460
 always has a supermarket by 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.050
 near goes naked au march tries to find out the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.010
 place is cheaper 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.770
 This drug publix supermarket staff is 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.930
 too expensive is a place like that for you 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.840
 what is beginning life is not worth the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.030
 Shame on you and spend your money there 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.300
 because you buy very few things 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.850
 in these places because everything costs a lot 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.690
 expensive then you have to try to find out 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.540
 the places where it costs cheaper and or 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.880
 Mars is still cheaper despite being 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.420
 expensive is still cheaper than gathers 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.840
 and publix okay then when you go 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.550

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.580

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:29.280
 if your separate supermarket buying 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.440
 What are you really going to use what you 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.390
 really need because my 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.150
 My experience at the beginning was good. 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.400
 complicated the second time when I went 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.500
 living in the fourth place of the girl was 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.290
 cool and I had already broken my face in 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.050
 wall so I even bought my 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.390
 I will not do mine myself. 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.010
 supermarket and thus save from my 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.690
