let's<00:00:01.079> take<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.290> look<00:00:01.469> at<00:00:01.680> interactive

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
let's take a look at interactive

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.769 
let's take a look at interactive

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
radiosity and render man Ras mode first

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.100 
radiosity and render man Ras mode first
we<00:00:07.200> have<00:00:07.379> our<00:00:07.529> set<00:00:07.770> it's<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.610> part<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.690> scare

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
we have our set it's a part of the scare

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.870 
we have our set it's a part of the scare
floor<00:00:10.290> from<00:00:10.620> monsters<00:00:10.950> University<00:00:11.099> we're

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
floor from monsters University we're

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.640 
floor from monsters University we're
gonna<00:00:12.000> use<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.780> light<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.290> create<00:00:13.500> some

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
gonna use a light to create some

gonna use a light to create some
interactive<00:00:14.450> global<00:00:15.450> illumination<00:00:15.680> it's<00:00:16.680> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
interactive global illumination it's a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.130 
interactive global illumination it's a
large<00:00:16.980> set<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.609> there's<00:00:17.730> 20<00:00:18.090> 1.6<00:00:18.900> million

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
large set so there's 20 1.6 million

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.950 
large set so there's 20 1.6 million

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
triangles in this particular room we're

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.300 
triangles in this particular room we're
going<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.350> using<00:00:22.769> three<00:00:23.070> bounce

interactive radiosity first thing that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
interactive radiosity first thing that
we'll<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.840> start<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.470> rear<00:00:28.680> end<00:00:28.859> during

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
we'll do is start the rear end during

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.890 
we'll do is start the rear end during
session<00:00:29.369> from<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> render<00:00:30.210> man<00:00:30.390> menu<00:00:30.689> by

session from the render man menu by

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.260 
session from the render man menu by
selecting<00:00:30.929> rerender<00:00:31.880> pixels<00:00:32.880> will<00:00:33.030> start

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
selecting rerender pixels will start

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.729 
selecting rerender pixels will start
coming<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.840> which<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.110> our<00:00:34.290> image<00:00:34.530> tool

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
coming in to it which is our image tool

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.940 
coming in to it which is our image tool
we<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.219> see<00:00:35.460> they're<00:00:35.850> coming<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.950> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
we can see they're coming in the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.180 
we can see they're coming in the
interactively<00:00:38.850> rendering<00:00:39.210> uses<00:00:39.570> progressive

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
interactively rendering uses progressive

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.709 
interactively rendering uses progressive
refinements<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.610> pixels<00:00:42.510> will<00:00:42.690> be

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
refinements so the pixels will be

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.900 
refinements so the pixels will be
coarser<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.350> then<00:00:43.860> gradually<00:00:44.489> refine

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
coarser and then gradually refine

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.510 
coarser and then gradually refine
themselves<00:00:47.660> obviously<00:00:48.739> we<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> light<00:00:50.160> in

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
themselves obviously we have a light in

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.600 
themselves obviously we have a light in
the<00:00:50.910> scene<00:00:51.090> there's<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.570> light<00:00:52.399> casting<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the scene there's one light casting the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.700 
the scene there's one light casting the
light<00:00:53.789> down<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.420> hallway<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.530> can

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
light down the hallway there we can

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
light down the hallway there we can
change<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.640> position<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> light<00:00:57.539> by

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
change the position of the light by

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.650 
change the position of the light by
grabbing<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.469> moving<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.420> seeing<00:01:00.420> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
grabbing it and moving it and seeing it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.950 
grabbing it and moving it and seeing it
update<00:01:02.059> interactively<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.570> light<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.930> just

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
update interactively the light is just

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.880 
update interactively the light is just
casting<00:01:05.420> light<00:01:06.420> directly<00:01:06.869> down<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
casting light directly down on to the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.910 
casting light directly down on to the
floor<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.570> light<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.960> see<00:01:09.990> bouncing<00:01:10.650> onto

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
floor so the light you see bouncing onto

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.920 
floor so the light you see bouncing onto
the<00:01:11.010> walls<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.850> actually<00:01:12.390> indirect

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the walls is actually indirect

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.249 
the walls is actually indirect
illumination<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:14.010> direct<00:01:14.400> lighting

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
illumination it's not direct lighting

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
illumination it's not direct lighting
and<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.500> free<00:01:16.799> bounce<00:01:17.180> global<00:01:18.180> illumination

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and it's free bounce global illumination

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.670 
and it's free bounce global illumination
so<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.909> light<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.210> repositioned<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.439> can

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
so as the light is repositioned you can

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.490 
so as the light is repositioned you can
see<00:01:22.979> exactly<00:01:23.790> how<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.500> indirect

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
see exactly how that indirect

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
see exactly how that indirect
illumination<00:01:25.759> is<00:01:26.759> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.390> propagate

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
illumination is going to propagate

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.190 
illumination is going to propagate
throughout<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.979> scene<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:30.750> we've<00:01:30.930> moved

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
throughout the scene so here we've moved

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.080 
throughout the scene so here we've moved
the<00:01:31.290> light<00:01:31.700> down<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:33.290> down<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.439> giant

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
the light down this down this giant

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.429 
the light down this down this giant
giant<00:01:36.090> kind<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.509> cold<00:01:36.720> word<00:01:36.900> war<00:01:37.140> here

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.620 

next<00:01:42.159> we<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.369> change<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:42.880> color<00:01:43.390> temperature

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
next we can change the color temperature

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.889 
next we can change the color temperature
every<00:01:44.380> time<00:01:44.560> we<00:01:44.799> added<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.520> parameter<00:01:46.299> move<00:01:46.780> a

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
every time we added a parameter move a

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.490 
every time we added a parameter move a
light<00:01:47.140> that<00:01:47.710> causes<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.630> the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
light that causes the the the

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.230 
light that causes the the the
progressive<00:01:50.979> rendering<00:01:51.130> to<00:01:51.490> start<00:01:51.700> over<00:01:51.909> and

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
progressive rendering to start over and

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.359 
progressive rendering to start over and
reset<00:01:52.689> itself<00:01:52.930> so<00:01:53.289> we'll<00:01:53.439> get<00:01:53.590> coarser<00:01:54.009> pixels

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
reset itself so we'll get coarser pixels

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.789 
reset itself so we'll get coarser pixels
which<00:01:54.549> will<00:01:54.729> gradually<00:01:55.090> refine<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.380> converge

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
which will gradually refine and converge

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.200 
which will gradually refine and converge
to<00:01:57.219> a<00:01:57.610> correct<00:01:58.179> solution<00:01:59.490> if<00:02:00.490> we<00:02:00.640> position<00:02:00.819> the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
to a correct solution if we position the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.679 
to a correct solution if we position the
camera<00:02:01.569> and<00:02:02.069> just<00:02:03.069> let<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.579> light<00:02:04.030> go<00:02:04.270> and<00:02:04.509> the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
camera and just let the light go and the

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:05.550 
camera and just let the light go and the
rendering<00:02:04.899> go

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
rendering go

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.499 
rendering go
it'll<00:02:06.240> refine<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.600> become<00:02:08.110> more<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.679> more

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
it'll refine and become more and more

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.360 
it'll refine and become more and more
accurate<00:02:10.680> but<00:02:11.680> as<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.980> move<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.250> camera

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
accurate but as you move the camera

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.860 
accurate but as you move the camera
around<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.790> still<00:02:13.060> have<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.269> pretty<00:02:13.510> good<00:02:13.750> idea

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
around you still have a pretty good idea

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.220 
around you still have a pretty good idea
of<00:02:14.970> how<00:02:15.970> those<00:02:16.150> shots<00:02:16.569> going<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.840> be<00:02:16.900> composed

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
of how those shots going to be composed

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.350 
of how those shots going to be composed
how<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.069> lighting<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.580> actually<00:02:18.910> falling<00:02:19.150> in

useful<00:02:24.459> as<00:02:24.700> an<00:02:25.209> artist<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.750> be<00:02:25.780> able<00:02:26.049> to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
useful as an artist to be able to

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.410 
useful as an artist to be able to
position<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.590> light<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.280> set<00:02:27.970> up<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.209> shot

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
position the light and set up the shot

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.390 
position the light and set up the shot
and<00:02:28.720> then<00:02:29.110> seventh<00:02:29.680> send<00:02:29.950> them<00:02:30.040> off<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.190> the

light<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:57.940> case<00:02:58.150> we<00:02:58.329> can<00:02:58.510> move<00:02:58.600> it<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
light in this case we can move it to the

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.849 
light in this case we can move it to the
dark<00:02:59.200> corner<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.889> then<00:03:00.660> increase<00:03:01.660> the

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
dark corner and then increase the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
exposure of the light that will increase

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.780 
exposure of the light that will increase
the<00:03:05.019> intensity<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.859> and<00:03:06.100> how<00:03:06.310> much<00:03:06.519> light

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
the intensity of it and how much light

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.349 
the intensity of it and how much light
is<00:03:06.970> it<00:03:07.090> being<00:03:07.299> propagated<00:03:08.260> into<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.829> corner

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
is it being propagated into that corner

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.629 
is it being propagated into that corner
and<00:03:10.359> we<00:03:11.019> can<00:03:11.049> see<00:03:11.319> that<00:03:11.470> very<00:03:11.620> quickly<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.370> all

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
and we can see that very quickly so all

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.039 
and we can see that very quickly so all
that<00:03:12.819> is<00:03:13.030> free<00:03:13.299> bounce<00:03:13.480> global<00:03:13.959> illumination

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
that is free bounce global illumination

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.569 
that is free bounce global illumination
and<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:16.000> can<00:03:16.180> see<00:03:16.359> exactly<00:03:16.750> how<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:18.100> light<00:03:18.400> is

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
and we can see exactly how that light is

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.729 
and we can see exactly how that light is
