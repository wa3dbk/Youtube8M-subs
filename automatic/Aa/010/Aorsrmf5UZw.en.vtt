00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
these are this is substantial this is

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.650 
these are this is substantial this is
this<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> side<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.430> building<00:00:23.660> this

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
this is like the side of a building this

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.509 
this is like the side of a building this
is<00:00:24.750> one<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> my<00:00:25.050> favorite<00:00:25.560> vehicles<00:00:26.010> lancha

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
is one of my favorite vehicles lancha

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.929 
is one of my favorite vehicles lancha
obviously<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.510> not<00:00:27.570> pristine<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.939> Harold

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
obviously it's not pristine and Harold

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.910 
obviously it's not pristine and Harold
yank<00:00:30.300> who<00:00:30.539> knows<00:00:30.720> where<00:00:30.960> he<00:00:31.080> yanked<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.679> out

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
yank who knows where he yanked this out

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.160 
yank who knows where he yanked this out
of<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.390> one<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.899> should

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
of but I think this is one we should

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.190 
of but I think this is one we should
never<00:00:34.469> try<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.460> restore<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.719> that's

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
never try to restore and that's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900 
never try to restore and that's
something<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.770> lot<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.280> people<00:00:38.489> over

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
something that a lot of people over

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.819 
something that a lot of people over
restore<00:00:39.329> cars<00:00:39.660> or<00:00:39.989> take<00:00:40.170> cars<00:00:40.440> where<00:00:40.680> it's

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
restore cars or take cars where it's

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.170 
restore cars or take cars where it's
just<00:00:40.890> fun<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.520> look<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.850> them<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> way<00:00:42.149> they

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
just fun to look at them the way they

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.729 
just fun to look at them the way they
are<00:00:42.360> rather<00:00:42.750> than<00:00:42.989> making<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.379> look<00:00:43.559> like

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
are rather than making them look like

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.680 
are rather than making them look like
they<00:00:43.950> weren't<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.180> were<00:00:45.239> new<00:00:45.300> making

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
they weren't when they were new making

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.060 
they weren't when they were new making
them<00:00:45.780> better<00:00:45.899> than<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.170> were<00:00:46.260> new<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:46.920> so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
them better than they were new right so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.190 
them better than they were new right so
this<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.340> neat<00:00:47.520> leaving<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.059> this<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
this is neat leaving it like this the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.810 
this is neat leaving it like this the
future<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> sit

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
future of this it's just going to sit

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
future of this it's just going to sit
here<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.270> enjoyed<00:00:51.570> by<00:00:51.600> everyone<00:00:51.809> well<00:00:52.530> we

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
here and be enjoyed by everyone well we

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.590 
here and be enjoyed by everyone well we
will<00:00:53.190> bring<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.789> new<00:00:54.030> museum<00:00:54.449> when

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
will bring this to the new museum when

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.080 
will bring this to the new museum when
it's<00:00:54.719> built<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.260> will<00:00:56.100> probably<00:00:56.640> take<00:00:56.850> some

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
it's built and will probably take some

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.470 
it's built and will probably take some
steps<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.690> make<00:00:57.840> sure<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.230> doesn't<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:59.480> fall

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
steps to make sure it doesn't just fall

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.290 
steps to make sure it doesn't just fall
apart<00:01:01.399> but<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> ought<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.030> left

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
apart but I think it ought to be left

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.289 
apart but I think it ought to be left
with<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.660> its<00:01:03.949> worn<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.430> patina<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
with all its worn this and patina and

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.380 
with all its worn this and patina and
the<00:01:06.630> great<00:01:07.439> way<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> wood<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.430> gone<00:01:08.700> let
