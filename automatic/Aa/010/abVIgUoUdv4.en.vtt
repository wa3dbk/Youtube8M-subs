plug 3 full DS dsi or 3ds games in the
back<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:14.969> then<00:00:15.389> switch<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.289> games<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.940> do

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.880 
back and then switch the games as you do
with<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> little<00:00:18.630> switch<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.529> this

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
with the little switch here and this

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
with the little switch here and this
allows<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.609> take<00:00:21.119> three<00:00:21.359> games<00:00:21.570> with<00:00:21.840> you

on the go would that actually have to

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.509 
on the go would that actually have to
flip<00:00:24.210> flop<00:00:24.449> cartridges<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.279> possibly<00:00:26.279> lose

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
flip flop cartridges and possibly lose

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.950 
flip flop cartridges and possibly lose
them<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.910> long<00:00:27.029> run<00:00:27.090> now<00:00:27.570> here's<00:00:27.750> how<00:00:27.900> the

kind<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.270> scratching<00:01:54.810> sound<00:01:55.290> I'm<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.740> sure<00:01:55.799> it

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
kind of scratching sound I'm not sure it

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.850 
kind of scratching sound I'm not sure it
messes<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> game<00:01:57.149> at<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.740> know

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860

messes up the game at all but you know
it<00:01:59.159> doesn't<00:01:59.219> seem<00:01:59.820> like<00:01:59.880> it'd<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.509> very<00:02:00.540> good

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
it doesn't seem like it'd be very good

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.200 
it doesn't seem like it'd be very good
for<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.920> cartridge<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.610> scratched<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
for the cartridge to be scratched and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.179 
for the cartridge to be scratched and
everything<00:02:03.570> over<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.409> over<00:02:04.530> something<00:02:05.040> else

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
everything over and over something else

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.219 
everything over and over something else
I<00:02:05.340> did<00:02:05.579> notice<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.630> sometimes

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
I did notice is that is sometimes

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.710 
I did notice is that is sometimes
depending<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.009> how<00:02:08.160> you're<00:02:08.399> holding<00:02:08.550> your<00:02:09.239> D<00:02:09.539> s

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
depending on how you're holding your D s

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.010 
depending on how you're holding your D s
it<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:09.959> really<00:02:10.470> easy<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:11.310> push<00:02:12.209> some<00:02:12.510> pressure

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
it is really easy to push some pressure

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.020 
it is really easy to push some pressure
on<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.710> does<00:02:13.950> pop<00:02:14.220> out<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.520> its<00:02:14.700> slot

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
on it and it does pop out of its slot

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.610 
on it and it does pop out of its slot
because<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.600> spring<00:02:15.810> loaded<00:02:16.020> like<00:02:16.440> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
because it is spring loaded like the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.590 
because it is spring loaded like the
games<00:02:16.860> are<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.850> if<00:02:18.060> you're<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.420> middle

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
games are and so if you're in the middle

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.090 
games are and so if you're in the middle
of<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.780> game<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.230> might<00:02:19.380> not<00:02:19.530> want<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.800> slide

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
of a game you might not want to slide

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.220 
of a game you might not want to slide
your<00:02:20.280> finger<00:02:20.610> off<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.150> L&amp;R<00:02:21.630> button<00:02:22.050> and

going<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.870> add<00:02:31.050> too<00:02:31.680> much<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.400> thickness

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
going to add too much to the thickness

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.790 
going to add too much to the thickness
of<00:02:32.970> your<00:02:33.060> DSi<00:02:34.020> 3ds<00:02:34.590> or<00:02:35.270> nintendo<00:02:36.270> DS<00:02:36.480> lite<00:02:36.800> now

we haven't yet found that it really
causes<00:03:09.300> any<00:03:09.570> significant<00:03:10.500> damage<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:10.920> the

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
game it is a little tough to get the

game it is a little tough to get the
games<00:03:13.110> in<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.410> out<00:03:13.500> but<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.010> could<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:14.220> a

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
games in and out but that could be a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.650 
games in and out but that could be a
good<00:03:14.520> thing<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:15.090> you're<00:03:15.210> not<00:03:15.300> going<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.540> be

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
good thing so you're not going to be

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
losing them falling out of the device so
