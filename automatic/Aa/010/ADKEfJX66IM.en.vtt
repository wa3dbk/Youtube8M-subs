00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.270
 In Brazil, wine is associated with heat as something expensive and appropriate for 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.930
 special occasions 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.770
 the national production has not yet taken off and is concentrated 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.939
 mainly in the south of the country 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:17.109
 the Brazilian wine goes so far as to suffer prejudice but the experts 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.210
 guarantee that here 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.450
 quality robot for consumption and bursting at the 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.179
 population embrace the idea and clear government 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.999
 decrease taxes on reporting to dbm janitors 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.260
 opening a bottle of wine is synonymous with celebration 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.240
 but in many cultures it is more than that no food studies 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.730
 have already reported that one household per day does 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.280
 heart 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.360
 in Brazil with 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.260
 are still very low with an annual average of only two liters 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.900
 In order to have an idea, the Brazilian should have Italy 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.370
 looking for beer that consumes wine in brazil are usually from 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.310
 descendants of Europeans the Brazilian does not have this culture and has 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.530
 of the beer cachaça caipirinha 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.160
 The whole difficulty is the high tax burden of about 60% of the 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.600
 a bottle of national wine are imposed the result 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 is that the cost-benefit ratio of Brazilian production ceases to be 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.580
 attractive 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.920
 confident every year the story does not 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.500
 a wine that we may not have had because it will find it the same 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 so a product a little better 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.929
 even with intensity on the back of the defense 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.779
 they have good prospects in Brazil is a market that has moved almost 13 

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:56.859
 billion reais last year 10% more than in 2009 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.580
 and there is still great potential for growth 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.900
 for the experts lack to approach the consumer doubt that still seems a 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.320
 Carapine drink sensibly with your brand as having a quality product 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.019
 and announcing 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.019
 do demonstrate dodo I like let's see 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.559
 I ask and you become a customer 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:23.049
 even though the Brazilian had money, he did not come to a big 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.749
 sector in são paulo she produces organic wines will not forgive in france 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.900
 we do not use any chemicals to take a fearful attitude we use 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.570
 methods 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.389
 mechanics I have experience in this now 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.679
 can prove to you with you said to g1 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.980
 But it's nice to go with the meal. 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.690
 it may be that the purchase of weapons and close the freshly baked at the edge of the pool 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.849
 what 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.929
 one comments differently attention at noon 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:54.900
 I do not understand pink wine. 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.929
 the palm trees while 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.929
 let us then see if this difference really is present 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.699
 It's very tasty, he'll need it. 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:12.079
 he is very soft and wants to be with 25 grams of sugar but with many 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.169
 ideas and also more of a kind 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.149
 The world's largest wine producers are families who are 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:22.609
 both in business recognition passed from generation to generation here in Brazil 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.859
 we have good quality wines wines in the sparkling highlights 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.609
 the consumer is really looking for sparkling 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.509
 it's not just over the end of the year 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.119
 is consuming ex-smoker the year 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:37.659
 every day every week at any time 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.869
 thereby becoming more accessible 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:41.909
 next day quality 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.909
 fortunately 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.529
 of this 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:52.049
 who
