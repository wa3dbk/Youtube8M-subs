riding hard packed and a lot of a lot of
pavement<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.780> would<00:01:39.930> say<00:01:40.049> 60%<00:01:40.979> pavement<00:01:41.790> it's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
pavement I would say 60% pavement it's

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.600 
pavement I would say 60% pavement it's
got<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> fork<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.200> it

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
got the fork on it

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.580 
got the fork on it
preload<00:01:44.610> adjustable<00:01:45.180> shock<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.140> obviously

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
preload adjustable shock on it obviously

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.830 
preload adjustable shock on it obviously
on<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> fork<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> lockout<00:01:48.270> which<00:01:48.689> is

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
on the fork and in the lockout which is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660 
on the fork and in the lockout which is
was<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> must<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.950> big<00:01:50.100> thing<00:01:50.310> because<00:01:50.430> of

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
was a must and a big thing because of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.080 
was a must and a big thing because of
where<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> ride<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:52.369> have<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.610> disc<00:01:53.820> brakes

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
where I ride I have to have disc brakes

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.929 
where I ride I have to have disc brakes
um<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.979> probably<00:01:55.979> could<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.490> away<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
um I probably could get away with the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.609 
um I probably could get away with the
rim<00:01:57.240> brakes<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:57.840> I'm<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> fan<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
rim brakes but I'm just not a fan of

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.429 
rim brakes but I'm just not a fan of
them<00:01:58.860> simply<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:01.110> know<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
them simply just because you know the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.590 
them simply just because you know the
suck<00:02:01.979> gets<00:02:02.189> packed<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:03.329> that

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
suck gets packed in there and all that

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.260 
suck gets packed in there and all that
so<00:02:04.070> it's<00:02:05.070> got<00:02:05.189> both<00:02:05.369> quick-release<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:06.030> front

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
so it's got both quick-release on front

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.410 
so it's got both quick-release on front
rear

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420

honestly<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.690> almost<00:03:17.260> never<00:03:17.560> use<00:03:17.920> them<00:03:18.100> hard

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
honestly I almost never use them hard

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.640 
honestly I almost never use them hard
whenever<00:03:19.359> I<00:03:19.450> lived<00:03:19.630> in<00:03:19.750> my<00:03:19.840> old<00:03:20.019> place<00:03:20.320> I

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
whenever I lived in my old place I

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.199 
whenever I lived in my old place I
actually<00:03:20.950> use<00:03:21.459> them<00:03:21.640> quite<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.880> bit<00:03:22.060> more

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
actually use them quite a bit more

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.319 
actually use them quite a bit more
there's<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.570> lot<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.840> downhill<00:03:23.880> but<00:03:24.880> uh<00:03:24.940> yeah

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
there's a lot of downhill but uh yeah

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.699 
there's a lot of downhill but uh yeah
like<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.510> said<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:25.750> got<00:03:25.840> it's<00:03:26.170> got<00:03:26.230> probably

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
like I said it's got it's got probably

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.199 
like I said it's got it's got probably
about<00:03:26.950> 300<00:03:27.340> miles<00:03:27.459> on<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:27.700> wish<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.030> had<00:03:28.120> an

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
about 300 miles on I wish I had an

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.270 
about 300 miles on I wish I had an
odometer<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.170> wish<00:03:29.320> my<00:03:29.530> app<00:03:29.709> on<00:03:29.890> my<00:03:30.010> phone

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
odometer and I wish my app on my phone

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.770 
odometer and I wish my app on my phone
because<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.609> usually<00:03:30.700> use<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.150> every<00:03:31.359> time<00:03:31.540> but

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
because I usually use it every time but

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.300 
because I usually use it every time but
it<00:03:31.870> sometimes<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.500> doesn't<00:03:32.650> work<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.070> then<00:03:33.130> it

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
it sometimes it doesn't work and then it

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.250 
it sometimes it doesn't work and then it
doesn't<00:03:33.790> calculate<00:03:34.269> exactly<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.900> mileage

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
doesn't calculate exactly the mileage

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.740 
doesn't calculate exactly the mileage
that<00:03:35.290> ran<00:03:35.820> but<00:03:36.820> other<00:03:37.000> than<00:03:37.239> really<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.540> rear

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
that ran but other than really the rear

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.180 
that ran but other than really the rear
deflector<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.530> pain<00:03:38.709> on<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:38.890> crank

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
deflector and the pain on the crank

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.280 
deflector and the pain on the crank
that's<00:03:39.400> really<00:03:39.670> all<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:39.850> ran<00:03:40.209> into<00:03:40.600> with<00:03:40.930> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
that's really all I ran into with the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.580 
that's really all I ran into with the
giant<00:03:41.620> Rome<00:03:42.720> I've<00:03:43.720> been<00:03:43.900> looking<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.350> want<00:03:44.530> to

get a second bike I'm just a maybe a
little<00:03:46.720> bit<00:03:46.900> more<00:03:47.049> of<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.230> cruiser<00:03:47.530> because

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
little bit more of a cruiser because

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.620 
little bit more of a cruiser because

pounds definitely I mean I could pick it

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.630 
pounds definitely I mean I could pick it
up<00:03:54.459> one<00:03:54.640> hand<00:03:54.850> no<00:03:55.060> problem<00:03:55.530> but<00:03:56.530> uh<00:03:56.560> see<00:03:57.549> it's

to worry about anything like that the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.240 
to worry about anything like that the
chain<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:12.519> boiled<00:04:13.090> it<00:04:13.150> twice<00:04:13.420> now<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:14.069> did<00:04:15.069> ride

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
chain I boiled it twice now I did ride

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.339 
chain I boiled it twice now I did ride
last<00:04:15.549> week<00:04:15.849> without<00:04:16.150> any<00:04:16.359> Lube<00:04:16.780> on<00:04:16.930> it<00:04:17.080> forgot

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:17.349 
last week without any Lube on it forgot

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:18.060 
last week without any Lube on it forgot
the<00:04:17.470> lube<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.799> up

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
the lube it up

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.920 
the lube it up
because<00:04:18.490> I<00:04:18.580> actually<00:04:19.090> washed<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.690> chain

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
because I actually washed the chain

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.630 
because I actually washed the chain
wiped<00:04:20.260> it<00:04:20.380> all<00:04:20.470> down<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.920> I<00:04:21.010> forgot<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.250> relive

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
wiped it all down and I forgot to relive

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.670 
wiped it all down and I forgot to relive
it<00:04:21.790> but<00:04:21.970> it's<00:04:22.630> been<00:04:22.780> lubed<00:04:22.960> now<00:04:23.140> so<00:04:23.410> it's<00:04:23.530> good

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
it but it's been lubed now so it's good

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.120 
it but it's been lubed now so it's good
to<00:04:23.710> go

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
to go

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.400 
to go
cables<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.180> all<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.390> are<00:04:25.510> fine<00:04:25.750> let's<00:04:26.320> say

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
cables and all that are fine let's say

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.840 
cables and all that are fine let's say
the<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.770> brakes<00:04:26.980> could<00:04:27.190> use<00:04:27.340> a<00:04:27.370> little<00:04:27.670> bit<00:04:27.760> of

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
the the brakes could use a little bit of

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.130 
the the brakes could use a little bit of
adjustment<00:04:28.210> which<00:04:28.420> is<00:04:28.450> really<00:04:28.810> easy<00:04:28.930> just

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
adjustment which is really easy just

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.390 
adjustment which is really easy just
like<00:04:29.320> your<00:04:29.470> side<00:04:29.650> pull<00:04:29.890> brakes

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
like your side pull brakes

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.580 
like your side pull brakes
cantilever<00:04:30.970> brakes<00:04:31.330> it's<00:04:32.080> all<00:04:32.230> cable

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
cantilever brakes it's all cable

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.230 
cantilever brakes it's all cable
actuated<00:04:32.740> they're<00:04:33.250> not<00:04:33.400> hydraulics<00:04:34.060> so

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
actuated they're not hydraulics so

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.100 
actuated they're not hydraulics so
that's<00:04:34.420> always<00:04:34.600> good

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
that's always good

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.960 
that's always good
and<00:04:35.800> now<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:35.950> shocks<00:04:36.310> like<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.580> said<00:04:36.760> it's<00:04:36.850> got

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
and now the shocks like I said it's got

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.400 
and now the shocks like I said it's got
good<00:04:37.180> seals<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.720> everything<00:04:38.080> they're<00:04:38.230> real

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
good seals and everything they're real

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.620 
good seals and everything they're real
real<00:04:38.440> rolls<00:04:38.830> strong<00:04:39.250> I've<00:04:39.970> taken<00:04:40.210> some<00:04:40.480> pretty

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
real rolls strong I've taken some pretty
