about the FT one nine hundred frames per
second<00:00:34.350> at<00:00:34.410> 4k<00:00:34.790> blew<00:00:35.790> everybody<00:00:36.270> away<00:00:36.770> but

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
second at 4k blew everybody away but

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.290 
second at 4k blew everybody away but
there's<00:00:37.950> some<00:00:38.100> differences<00:00:38.610> with<00:00:38.850> between

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
there's some differences with between

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.470

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that's right now are we recording in the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.710 
that's right now are we recording in the
camera<00:01:11.159> we're<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.760> recording<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> camera

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
camera we're not recording in the camera

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.719 
camera we're not recording in the camera
we<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.049> an<00:01:13.200> optical<00:01:13.530> base<00:01:13.830> station<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
we have an optical base station so the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
we have an optical base station so the
connection<00:01:15.270> back<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> base<00:01:16.020> station<00:01:16.170> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
connection back to the base station is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.399 
connection back to the base station is
using<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> synthy<00:01:18.000> fiber<00:01:18.330> connection<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
using a synthy fiber connection and the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
using a synthy fiber connection and the
reporting<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:19.979> actually<00:01:20.310> done<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> base

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
reporting is actually done in the base

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.480 
reporting is actually done in the base
station<00:01:21.540> back<00:01:22.020> at<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> equipment<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.250> have

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
station back at the equipment so we have

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.130 
station back at the equipment so we have
really<00:01:23.909> high-end<00:01:24.479> professional

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
really high-end professional

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.200 
really high-end professional
applications<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.100> camera<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.729> what's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
applications in this camera and what's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.240 
applications in this camera and what's
what's<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:27.810> distance<00:01:28.290> how<00:01:28.439> far<00:01:28.470> away<00:01:28.920> from<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
what's my distance how far away from the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.069 
what's my distance how far away from the
base<00:01:29.490> station<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.150> get<00:01:30.420> thousand<00:01:30.840> meters

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
base station can I get thousand meters

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.350 
base station can I get thousand meters
that<00:01:31.619> was<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.979> meters<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.909> those<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.090> us

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that was in meters and for those of us

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.649 
that was in meters and for those of us
who<00:01:33.509> use<00:01:33.540> miles<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.680> feet<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.150> kilometer

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
who use miles or feet so one kilometer

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.140 
who use miles or feet so one kilometer
that's<00:01:36.900> about<00:01:37.290> almost<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.890> mile<00:01:38.070> mm-hmm<00:01:38.640> so

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
that's about almost a mile mm-hmm so

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.120 
that's about almost a mile mm-hmm so
roughly<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.570> mile<00:01:39.810> that's<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.409> long<00:01:40.680> distance

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
roughly a mile that's a long distance

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.660 
roughly a mile that's a long distance
yeah

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
yeah

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.550 
yeah
well<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> need<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.509> stadium<00:01:42.720> because

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
well you need that in a stadium because

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560 
well you need that in a stadium because
you<00:01:43.649> never<00:01:43.770> quite<00:01:44.100> know<00:01:44.310> where<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> truck<00:01:45.390> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
you never quite know where the truck is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.999 
you never quite know where the truck is
gonna<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> camera<00:01:46.500> might<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
gonna be and the camera might be on the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.219 
gonna be and the camera might be on the
opposite<00:01:47.460> end<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.420> need<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.659> long<00:01:48.930> distance

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
opposite end so you need a long distance

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.490 
opposite end so you need a long distance
I<00:01:49.820> know<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.509> FT<00:01:51.840> ones<00:01:52.020> been<00:01:52.259> used

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
I know now I know the FT ones been used

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.230 
I know now I know the FT ones been used
in<00:01:52.649> football<00:01:53.040> games<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.640> lot<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.909> sporting

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
in football games and a lot of sporting

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.440 
in football games and a lot of sporting
events<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.259> sort<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.530> see<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.180> sort<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.240> as

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
events and I sort of see this sort of as

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.660 
events and I sort of see this sort of as
maybe<00:01:58.259> almost<00:01:58.710> even<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> shoulder-mounted

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
maybe almost even as a shoulder-mounted

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.599 
maybe almost even as a shoulder-mounted

in<00:02:09.489> that<00:02:09.610> current<00:02:09.879> regard<00:02:10.179> depends<00:02:10.629> on<00:02:10.750> the

in that current regard depends on the
customer<00:02:11.019> application<00:02:11.860> but<00:02:11.980> that's<00:02:12.129> what

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
customer application but that's what

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
customer application but that's what
we're<00:02:12.430> thinking

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
we're thinking

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.869 
we're thinking
this<00:02:13.569> also<00:02:13.810> has<00:02:14.230> we've<00:02:15.099> been<00:02:15.310> into<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.610> lot<00:02:15.849> of

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
this also has we've been into a lot of

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.440 
this also has we've been into a lot of
events<00:02:16.269> near<00:02:17.260> water<00:02:17.590> or<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.819> motorcycle

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
events near water or in motorcycle

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.270 
events near water or in motorcycle
racing<00:02:19.780> where<00:02:19.900> there's<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.110> lot<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.440> dust<00:02:20.650> so

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
racing where there's a lot of dust so

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.180 
racing where there's a lot of dust so
we've<00:02:21.459> made<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.910> much<00:02:22.379> much<00:02:23.379> more<00:02:23.560> rugged<00:02:23.860> in

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
we've made this much much more rugged in

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.009 
we've made this much much more rugged in
that<00:02:24.519> regard<00:02:24.849> because<00:02:25.030> it's<00:02:25.299> small<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:25.599> it's

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
that regard because it's small and it's

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.600 
that regard because it's small and it's
going<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.230> be<00:02:26.319> out<00:02:26.470> in<00:02:26.680> remote<00:02:26.860> locations

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
going to be out in remote locations

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.000 
going to be out in remote locations
right<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.810> weather<00:02:29.290> resistant<00:02:29.799> dust

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
right so weather resistant dust

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.130 
right so weather resistant dust
resistant<00:02:30.610> correct<00:02:30.970> oh<00:02:31.180> he's<00:02:31.569> nice<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.959> have

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
resistant correct oh he's nice to have

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.930 
resistant correct oh he's nice to have
on<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.319> piece<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.650> cattle<00:02:32.860> solutely<00:02:33.430> especially

now the sensor a lot of cameras a lot of

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.289 
now the sensor a lot of cameras a lot of

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.990 
design we put a lot of investment into
the<00:02:50.470> sensor<00:02:50.860> technology<00:02:51.519> because<00:02:51.670> that's<00:02:51.849> the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
the sensor technology because that's the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.390 
the sensor technology because that's the
a<00:02:52.150> key<00:02:52.420> ingredient<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.829> camera<00:02:54.190> being

a key ingredient in a camera being

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.460 
a key ingredient in a camera being
successful<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.510> customers<00:02:56.019> wanted<00:02:56.319> to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
successful and the customers wanted to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.059 
successful and the customers wanted to
adopt<00:02:56.739> that<00:02:56.890> technology<00:02:57.160> it's<00:02:58.090> 4k<00:02:59.069> global

shutter<00:03:00.250> correct<00:03:00.879> which<00:03:01.420> is<00:03:01.569> really<00:03:01.780> nice<00:03:01.900> so

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
shutter correct which is really nice so

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.229

no<00:03:02.230> more<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.709> gel<00:03:02.980> okay<00:03:03.280> that's<00:03:03.790> right<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.150> if

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
no more this gel okay that's right so if

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.670 
no more this gel okay that's right so if
you're<00:03:04.360> moving<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.690> camera<00:03:04.959> it's<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.530> nice

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
you're moving the camera it's a nice

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.309 
you're moving the camera it's a nice
steady<00:03:06.190> flow<00:03:06.609> yes<00:03:07.359> I<00:03:07.480> wouldn't<00:03:07.959> couldn't

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
steady flow yes I wouldn't couldn't

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.340 
steady flow yes I wouldn't couldn't
imagine<00:03:08.650> jello<00:03:09.100> cam<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.660> don't<00:03:10.660> work<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.870> no

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
imagine jello cam it don't work that no

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.280

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
lenses that's right and what's the size

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.259 
lenses that's right and what's the size
of<00:03:16.329> the<00:03:16.450> sensor<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:16.989> super<00:03:17.290> 35<00:03:18.000> fabulous<00:03:19.000> yeah

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
of the sensor so super 35 fabulous yeah

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.750 
of the sensor so super 35 fabulous yeah
so<00:03:19.989> it<00:03:20.500> seems<00:03:20.709> like<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:20.950> full<00:03:21.160> system<00:03:21.609> we<00:03:21.670> have

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
so it seems like a full system we have
