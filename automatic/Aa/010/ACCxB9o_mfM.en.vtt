00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
advice so we're gonna change the fuel

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.139 
advice so we're gonna change the fuel
filter<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.739> start<00:00:55.980> off<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.340> sometimes<00:00:57.030> when

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
filter to start off with sometimes when

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.580 
filter to start off with sometimes when
the<00:00:57.239> fuel<00:00:57.420> filters<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.930> clogged<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.410> won't

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the fuel filters are clogged they won't

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.490 
the fuel filters are clogged they won't
let<00:00:58.770> enough<00:00:59.489> gas<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.809> through<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> gas

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
let enough gas going through the gas

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.950 
let enough gas going through the gas
lines<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.949> order<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.340> actually<00:01:02.940> maintain<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
lines in order to actually maintain the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.859 
lines in order to actually maintain the
car<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.670> could<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> problem<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
car on so that could be a problem it

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.280 
car on so that could be a problem it
could<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> faulty<00:01:07.710> fuel<00:01:08.490> pump<00:01:09.020> it<00:01:10.020> could<00:01:10.200> be

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
could be a faulty fuel pump it could be

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.630 
could be a faulty fuel pump it could be
an<00:01:10.380> electrical<00:01:10.530> problem<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.250> computer

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
an electrical problem like a computer

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.179 
an electrical problem like a computer
which<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.630> hope<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.110> won't<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
which we hope it won't be because you

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.249 
which we hope it won't be because you
know<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.880> gets<00:01:15.299> more<00:01:15.450> more<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.170> more

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
know it just gets more more and more

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.570 
know it just gets more more and more
expensive<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.369> starting<00:01:17.970> off<00:01:18.060> small<00:01:19.549> it's<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
expensive so starting off small it's a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.350 
expensive so starting off small it's a
little<00:01:20.790> windy<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.240> bear<00:01:21.479> with<00:01:21.509> me

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
well lexus ES 395 there's our fuel pump

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.940 
well lexus ES 395 there's our fuel pump
little<00:01:38.340> thing<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:39.560> basically<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:40.920> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
got to do the line top nut and the feed

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.210 
got to do the line top nut and the feed
from<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> gas<00:01:48.720> tank<00:01:49.170> bag<00:01:51.979> put<00:01:52.979> these<00:01:53.100> two

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
from the gas tank bag put these two

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.090 
from the gas tank bag put these two
lines<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:54.110> take<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.290> slide<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.829> out<00:01:55.979> of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
lines on take and slide this one out of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.660 
lines on take and slide this one out of
its<00:01:56.250> bracket<00:01:58.189> installed<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.340> with<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> new<00:01:59.640> one

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
its bracket installed it with a new one

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.260 
its bracket installed it with a new one
should<00:02:00.710> be<00:02:01.710> simple<00:02:02.040> enough<00:02:02.100> I'm<00:02:02.460> gonna<00:02:02.579> try<00:02:03.210> to

should be simple enough I'm gonna try to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.820 
should be simple enough I'm gonna try to
get<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> done

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
get it done

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.600 
get it done
and<00:02:05.030> hopefully<00:02:06.030> won't<00:02:06.120> shut<00:02:06.330> up<00:02:06.360> again<00:02:07.610> again
