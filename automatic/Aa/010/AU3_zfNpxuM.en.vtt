here from like you know minor scrapes
maybe<00:01:01.079> bumps<00:01:01.620> maybe<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.550> small<00:01:02.910> drop<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.750> not

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
maybe bumps maybe a small drop it's not

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.600 
maybe bumps maybe a small drop it's not
a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.229> padding<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> protection<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.460> on

a lot of padding and protection going on
but<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:05.909> keeps<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.450> really<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:07.380> slim<00:01:08.010> as

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
but that keeps it really really slim as

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.820 
but that keeps it really really slim as
you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:09.630> much<00:01:09.810> thicker<00:01:10.350> than<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you can see not much thicker than a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.880 
you can see not much thicker than a
filled<00:01:11.790> manila<00:01:12.299> envelope<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.170> will<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.680> it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
filled manila envelope if you will so it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.070 
filled manila envelope if you will so it
has<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> suede<00:01:14.670> microfiber<00:01:15.210> finish<00:01:15.900> which

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
has like a suede microfiber finish which

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690

gives<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> nice<00:01:16.530> grip<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.040> then<00:01:17.460> this

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
gives you nice grip and then this

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.010 
gives you nice grip and then this
pattern<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> front<00:01:18.330> which<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.840> what

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
pattern on the front which is what

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
pattern on the front which is what
allows<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> turn<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.640> case<00:01:20.970> into<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
allows you to turn this case into a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.640 
allows you to turn this case into a
stand<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.080> when<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> your

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
stand so when you get to your

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.039 
stand so when you get to your
destination<00:01:22.909> flip<00:01:23.909> open<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.270> flap<00:01:24.540> slide

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
destination flip open the flap slide

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.640 
destination flip open the flap slide
your<00:01:25.080> iPad<00:01:25.950> out<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.820> close<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.110> class

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
your iPad out like so close the class

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.980 
your iPad out like so close the class
and<00:01:29.009> then<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.150> magnetic<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.900> it

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and then this is all magnetic and it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.289 
and then this is all magnetic and it
kind<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.229> naturally<00:01:31.770> forms<00:01:32.520> together<00:01:32.729> into

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
kind of naturally forms together into

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.450 
kind of naturally forms together into
this<00:01:33.450> little<00:01:33.840> kind<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.439> wedge<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.189> then<00:01:35.340> you

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
this little kind of wedge and then you

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.090 
this little kind of wedge and then you
can<00:01:35.579> take<00:01:35.759> your<00:01:35.880> iPad<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.540> place<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.350> onto<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
can take your iPad and place it onto the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.060 
can take your iPad and place it onto the
case<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:39.210> now<00:01:39.420> formed<00:01:39.900> into<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> stand<00:01:40.470> like

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
case that's now formed into a stand like

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.730 
case that's now formed into a stand like
so<00:01:41.520> that's<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.509> horizontal<00:01:43.200> position<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so that's the horizontal position it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.370 
so that's the horizontal position it
will<00:01:43.860> also<00:01:44.009> work<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.899> portrait<00:01:45.899> mode<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.350> well

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
will also work in portrait mode as well

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.490 
will also work in portrait mode as well
if<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.040> look<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.079> totally<00:01:49.079> secure

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
if you look like that and totally secure
