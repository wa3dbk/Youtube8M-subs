now I'm going to stand up so I can find
the<00:03:30.830> center<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.940> ribs

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:51.520 

just<00:03:43.220> like<00:03:43.400> so

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.340 

and<00:03:52.100> this<00:03:52.340> one<00:03:52.640> is<00:03:53.000> attaching<00:03:53.840> really<00:03:54.140> good

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
and this one is attaching really good

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:06.250 
and this one is attaching really good
and<00:03:54.740> I'm<00:03:55.630> gonna<00:03:56.630> put<00:03:56.960> something<00:03:58.840> top<00:04:01.000> women<00:04:05.260> so

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
and I'm gonna put something top women so

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.680 
and I'm gonna put something top women so
let<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.830> sit<00:04:07.250> for<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:10.430> few<00:04:10.580> minutes<00:04:10.820> so<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:11.480> think

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
let it sit for a few minutes so I think

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.490 
let it sit for a few minutes so I think
so<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.590> can<00:04:12.830> dry<00:04:13.100> properly
