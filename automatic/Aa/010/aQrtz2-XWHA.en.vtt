so<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:04.830> is<00:00:04.950> Arlen<00:00:05.430> convert<00:00:05.940> Arlen<00:00:06.629> hundred

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
so this is Arlen convert Arlen hundred

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.520 
so this is Arlen convert Arlen hundred
from<00:00:07.290> facebook<00:00:07.740> wants<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.130> know<00:00:09.410> are<00:00:10.410> there

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
from facebook wants to know are there

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.789 
from facebook wants to know are there
solar<00:00:10.830> systems<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.670> stars<00:00:12.389> what<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.410> mean<00:00:13.620> by

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
solar systems of stars what I mean by

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.460 
solar systems of stars what I mean by
this<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.730> there<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.150> system<00:00:15.480> with<00:00:15.839> an<00:00:15.990> upper

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
this is is there a system with an upper

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.370 
this is is there a system with an upper
or<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.789> supermassive<00:00:17.789> parent<00:00:18.570> star<00:00:18.900> with

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
or a supermassive parent star with

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.890 
or a supermassive parent star with
orbiting<00:00:19.920> smaller<00:00:20.340> stars<00:00:20.820> but<00:00:21.359> with<00:00:21.539> smaller

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
orbiting smaller stars but with smaller

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.040 
orbiting smaller stars but with smaller
stars<00:00:22.230> having<00:00:22.470> planets<00:00:23.039> serving<00:00:23.430> as<00:00:23.550> moons<00:00:24.150> so

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
stars having planets serving as moons so

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.870 
stars having planets serving as moons so
its<00:00:25.320> star<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.920> parent<00:00:26.310> system<00:00:26.699> would<00:00:26.849> have

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
its star in the parent system would have

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.960 
its star in the parent system would have
its<00:00:27.240> own<00:00:27.449> sub<00:00:27.840> solar<00:00:28.170> system<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.980> no<00:00:29.490> dr.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
its own sub solar system and no dr.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.209 
its own sub solar system and no dr.
Tyson<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.929> can't<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.470> say<00:00:31.590> yes

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
Tyson you can't just say yes

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.850 
Tyson you can't just say yes
we<00:00:32.369> call<00:00:32.640> them<00:00:32.850> galaxies<00:00:33.690> oh<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.350> because<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
we call them galaxies oh and because you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.400 
we call them galaxies oh and because you
always<00:00:35.070> want<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.460> know<00:00:35.579> where<00:00:36.300> we're<00:00:36.690> from

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
there so even took me to one of the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
there so even took me to one of the
local<00:01:13.979> pubs<00:01:14.250> that's<00:01:14.580> always<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.880> funny<00:01:15.240> menu

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
local pubs that's always a funny menu

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.030 
local pubs that's always a funny menu
that's<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.990> they<00:01:16.080> had<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> college<00:01:16.770> town

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that's it they had in a college town

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.670 
that's it they had in a college town
absolutely<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.080> that<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.380> three<00:01:19.590> in

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
absolutely so that was it like three in

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.190 
absolutely so that was it like three in
the<00:01:19.740> afternoon<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> yeah<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.930> they<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.170> a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the afternoon so yeah here they have a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.600 
the afternoon so yeah here they have a
lot<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> very<00:01:22.650> good<00:01:22.680> problems<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.340> Ohio

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
lot of very good problems in Ohio

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.200 
lot of very good problems in Ohio
alright<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.350> way<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.799> works<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
alright so the way it works is if you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
alright so the way it works is if you
look<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.509> night<00:01:27.689> sky<00:01:27.720> half<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> stars

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
look at the night sky half of the stars

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.940 
look at the night sky half of the stars
you<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.759> aren't<00:01:30.299> solo<00:01:30.840> stars<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.439> all<00:01:31.560> they're

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you see aren't solo stars at all they're

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.100 
you see aren't solo stars at all they're
double<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.460> multiple<00:01:32.850> triple<00:01:33.600> quadruple

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
double and multiple triple quadruple

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.499 
double and multiple triple quadruple
star<00:01:34.290> systems<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:35.220> yeah<00:01:35.700> even<00:01:36.210> for

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
star systems really yeah even for

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.499 
star systems really yeah even for
example<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:38.369> nearest<00:01:38.759> star<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.390> Sun

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
example the nearest star to the Sun

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.140 
example the nearest star to the Sun
Alpha<00:01:40.350> century<00:01:40.710> yes<00:01:41.189> that's<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> multiple<00:01:41.970> star

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
Alpha century yes that's a multiple star

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.300 
Alpha century yes that's a multiple star
system<00:01:42.630> okay<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.320> nearest<00:01:43.680> star<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
system okay the nearest star and the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.520 
system okay the nearest star and the
star<00:01:44.520> system<00:01:44.820> school<00:01:45.000> Proxima<00:01:45.630> century

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
star system school Proxima century

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.590 
star system school Proxima century
that's<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:47.040> right<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.420> have

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that's right right so you can have

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.020 
that's right right so you can have
multiple<00:01:48.780> star<00:01:49.320> systems<00:01:49.770> if<00:01:50.280> they<00:01:50.340> are<00:01:50.549> far

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
multiple star systems if they are far

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.469 
multiple star systems if they are far
enough<00:01:51.240> away<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.380> another<00:01:53.000> then<00:01:54.000> each

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
enough away from one another then each

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.359 
enough away from one another then each
one<00:01:54.869> could<00:01:55.079> then<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.500> its<00:01:55.680> own<00:01:55.799> planetary

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
one could then have its own planetary

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.440 
one could then have its own planetary
system<00:01:56.850> not<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> problem<00:01:57.570> that's<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:59.450> if

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
system not a problem that's it but if

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.410 
system not a problem that's it but if
they<00:02:00.689> are<00:02:00.750> too<00:02:00.960> close<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.619> another<00:02:01.969> as<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
they are too close to one another as the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060 
they are too close to one another as the
planet<00:02:03.840> comes<00:02:04.079> around<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.530> back<00:02:04.680> stretch

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
planet comes around to back stretch

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.910 
planet comes around to back stretch
right<00:02:05.850> its<00:02:06.240> gravitational<00:02:06.899> Allegiance<00:02:07.710> can

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
right its gravitational Allegiance can

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.279 
right its gravitational Allegiance can
be<00:02:08.039> compromised<00:02:08.580> ah<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.110> doesn't

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
be compromised ah so it just doesn't

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:23.670 
be compromised ah so it just doesn't
know<00:02:10.560> no<00:02:11.280> one's<00:02:11.550> well<00:02:11.790> belongs<00:02:12.209> your<00:02:12.750> dad

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.730 

so<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.190> can't<00:02:25.520> sew<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.720> want<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.260> system

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
so you can't sew so you want a system

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.590 
so you can't sew so you want a system
that's<00:02:27.920> far<00:02:28.250> enough<00:02:28.370> away<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.000> that<00:02:29.330> the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
that's far enough away so that the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.620 
that's far enough away so that the
orbits<00:02:30.080> are<00:02:30.260> stable<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.880> gravitationally

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
orbits are stable and gravitationally

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.780 
orbits are stable and gravitationally
stable<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:33.350> means<00:02:33.560> you're<00:02:33.740> not<00:02:33.770> perturbed<00:02:34.400> by

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
stable it means you're not perturbed by

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.820 
stable it means you're not perturbed by
somebody<00:02:35.270> else<00:02:35.420> tugging<00:02:35.840> on<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.620> yeah<00:02:36.770> you

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
somebody else tugging on you so yeah you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.110 
somebody else tugging on you so yeah you
can<00:02:37.070> have<00:02:37.250> these<00:02:37.400> we<00:02:37.580> haven't<00:02:37.850> discovered

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
can have these we haven't discovered

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.560 
can have these we haven't discovered
them<00:02:38.360> yet

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
them yet

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.850 
them yet
but<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:40.100> any<00:02:40.250> big<00:02:40.520> large<00:02:40.940> scale<00:02:41.270> but<00:02:42.080> yeah<00:02:42.500> but

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
but in any big large scale but yeah but

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.200 
but in any big large scale but yeah but
it<00:02:42.950> can<00:02:43.100> happen<00:02:43.400> we<00:02:43.520> it<00:02:43.640> definitely<00:02:44.060> can

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
the fact that we're gonna have a a solar

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.540 
the fact that we're gonna have a a solar
system<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.970> soap<00:02:53.210> opera<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:53.750> love<00:02:54.050> uh<00:02:54.080> yeah<00:02:54.980> it's

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
system of soap opera I love uh yeah it's

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.250 
system of soap opera I love uh yeah it's
um<00:02:55.700> it's<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.120> solar<00:02:56.360> system<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.810> source<00:02:56.990> it's

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
um it's a solar system of source it's

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.400 
um it's a solar system of source it's
the<00:02:57.350> solar<00:02:57.560> system<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:57.980> sources
