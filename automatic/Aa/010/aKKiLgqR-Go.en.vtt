00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.789
 hello and welcome here at p 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.980
 c max i am the christel and not only 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.379
 in the new month start with one 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.090
 win mega-cool contests 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.580
 is there an amd gaming calculator in the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.289
 inner 904 designer housing installed 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.550
 became a s rock fm 288 extreme 4+ on 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.859
 We find this the heart of the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.640
 computer in richmond processor in one 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.030
 dac 6800 k suffices to ensure performance 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.160
 should 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.120
 This is cooled with a cooler 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 the house be quiet 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.200
 in shamrock top flow sr1 this is 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.820
 as well as the power supply and two of his 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.560
 Young fans of be quiet not yet 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.030
 See because there are delivery problems 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.960
 but of course in the end product 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.190
 recover 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.590
 an amd radeon memory 8 gb kit with 1866 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.600
 megahertz cl9 is also installed 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.620
 for the graphic claim is the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.080
 tricks of the 9th 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 270 of decay to dispose of too good 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.420
 last we still have 128 gb 64 ssd of 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.010
 offset technology installed 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.750
 you will also find all the components 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.760
 times in the video description, therefore 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.140
 would have to do to win this calculator 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.000
 First of all, go to the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.370
 main time of the pc maximum competition 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.960
 articles of this gaming pc there applies 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.610
 it then under the application raptor 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.290
 to accomplish some tasks 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.760
 a task is for example to ours 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.670
 last video that was a comparison test 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.590
 between a car and mittelhessen one 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.909
 ask to answer what is 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.710
 then you will be there for the question 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.000
 Other tasks are also experienced 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.430
 for example our youtube channel here 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.140
 to subscribe or a facebook like 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.760
 left on the pc max fans 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.350
 By the way, you will find that too 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.880
 again under video limit so 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.140
 more conditions fulfilled the higher 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.030
 of course the probability of this 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.710
 So winning a computer was fulfilling as 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.270
 three, you are three steps closer 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.900
 Calculate you have the maximum profit 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.190
 chance 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.780
 Last but not least, of course, only the can 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.880
 say that we press your thumbs 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.080
 press and we'll see you in the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.729
 next videos if you have the channel 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.380
 of course subscribed until then one 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.560
 hard time until next time 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560
 bye
