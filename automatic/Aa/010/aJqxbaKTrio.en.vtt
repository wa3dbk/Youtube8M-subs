okay so in the last video we log into a
system<00:00:12.520> that<00:00:12.789> we've<00:00:13.029> installed<00:00:13.420> the<00:00:13.629> GUI<00:00:13.840> on

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
system that we've installed the GUI on

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.730 
system that we've installed the GUI on
and<00:00:14.520> we<00:00:15.520> installed<00:00:16.029> the<00:00:16.390> hyper-v<00:00:17.200> management

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
and we installed the hyper-v management

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.460 
and we installed the hyper-v management
tools<00:00:18.390> remote<00:00:19.390> management<00:00:19.750> tools<00:00:20.110> on<00:00:20.380> the

tools remote management tools on the

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.720 
tools remote management tools on the
system<00:00:21.390> but<00:00:22.390> now<00:00:22.570> we<00:00:22.630> need<00:00:22.930> to<00:00:23.140> get<00:00:23.730> hyper-v

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
system but now we need to get hyper-v

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.390 
system but now we need to get hyper-v
the<00:00:25.420> hyper-v<00:00:25.840> role<00:00:26.050> on<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.680> remote<00:00:27.100> system

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
the hyper-v role on the remote system

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.270 
the hyper-v role on the remote system
and<00:00:28.210> there's<00:00:29.140> a<00:00:29.200> couple<00:00:29.350> ways<00:00:29.500> we<00:00:29.619> can<00:00:29.949> do<00:00:30.130> that

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.280 
and there's a couple ways we can do that

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.590 
and there's a couple ways we can do that
we<00:00:30.699> can<00:00:30.880> do<00:00:31.300> it<00:00:31.420> from<00:00:31.600> this<00:00:32.590> remote<00:00:32.860> system

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
we can do it from this remote system

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.180 
we can do it from this remote system
what<00:00:34.600> we<00:00:34.690> want<00:00:34.930> to<00:00:34.989> do<00:00:35.110> is<00:00:35.200> add<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.470> server<00:00:35.829> here

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
and we added it on the domain so we can

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.389 
and we added it on the domain so we can
just<00:00:39.880> go<00:00:40.030> ahead<00:00:40.090> and<00:00:40.329> find<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:41.410> server<00:00:41.920> from

the domain here or you could put the
name<00:00:46.120> in<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:46.600> search<00:00:46.840> for<00:00:47.050> it<00:00:47.140> that<00:00:47.380> way<00:00:47.559> as

in here real quick and we can see that

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.470 
in here real quick and we can see that
the<00:05:29.090> hyper-v<00:05:29.480> role<00:05:29.630> is<00:05:29.810> install<00:05:30.260> now<00:05:30.590> and<00:05:31.480> if

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
the hyper-v role is install now and if

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.070 
the hyper-v role is install now and if
we<00:05:32.600> want<00:05:32.780> to<00:05:32.840> check<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.260> feature<00:05:33.550> also<00:05:35.080> under

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
we want to check the feature also under

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.400 
we want to check the feature also under

role<00:05:39.410> administration<00:05:40.250> tools<00:05:41.140> and<00:05:42.670> we<00:05:43.670> can<00:05:43.850> see

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
role administration tools and we can see

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.740 
role administration tools and we can see
that<00:05:44.240> we<00:05:44.420> have<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:45.410> pirate<00:05:46.040> shell<00:05:46.750> module

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
that we have the pirate shell module

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.460 
that we have the pirate shell module
here<00:05:48.580> cancel<00:05:49.580> out<00:05:49.640> of<00:05:49.670> there<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:50.230> now<00:05:51.230> all<00:05:51.260> we

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
here cancel out of there and now all we

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.320 
here cancel out of there and now all we
need<00:05:51.740> to<00:05:51.770> do<00:05:51.980> it<00:05:52.130> goes<00:05:52.370> to<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.730> hyper-v

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
need to do it goes to the hyper-v

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.250 
need to do it goes to the hyper-v
manager<00:05:53.990> and<00:05:54.940> connect<00:05:55.940> back<00:05:56.210> to<00:05:56.480> this<00:05:56.780> remote

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
manager and connect back to this remote

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.310 
manager and connect back to this remote
system<00:05:57.910> so<00:05:58.910> we're<00:05:59.390> going<00:05:59.690> to<00:05:59.750> connect<00:06:00.230> the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
system so we're going to connect the

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:16.329 
hosts set up and come bigger and we can

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:18.600 
hosts set up and come bigger and we can

environment I'm not going to go into

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.729

that<00:06:26.619> and<00:06:26.949> this<00:06:27.069> this<00:06:27.519> video<00:06:28.209> but<00:06:28.689> take<00:06:29.469> a<00:06:29.499> look

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:29.739 
that and this this video but take a look

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:33.449 
that and this this video but take a look
in<00:06:29.919> the<00:06:30.099> the<00:06:30.489> settings<00:06:31.019> that<00:06:32.189> that<00:06:33.189> you<00:06:33.309> can

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:33.459 
in the the settings that that you can

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.069 
in the the settings that that you can
configure<00:06:33.759> for<00:06:34.089> this<00:06:34.209> host<00:06:34.419> and<00:06:34.779> I'll

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:35.079 
configure for this host and I'll

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:37.889 
configure for this host and I'll
probably<00:06:35.639> go<00:06:36.639> over<00:06:36.669> some<00:06:37.149> of<00:06:37.179> this<00:06:37.360> stuff<00:06:37.419> in

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:37.899 
probably go over some of this stuff in

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:40.589 
probably go over some of this stuff in
another<00:06:38.259> video
