but<00:01:52.100> due<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.549> fact<00:01:52.700> that<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.939> finesse<00:01:53.420> has

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
but due to the fact that the finesse has

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.260 
but due to the fact that the finesse has
been<00:01:53.960> boosted<00:01:54.500> bumped<00:01:54.890> down<00:01:55.009> imagine<00:01:55.609> I'm

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
been boosted bumped down imagine I'm

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.819 
been boosted bumped down imagine I'm
sure<00:01:56.539> that<00:01:56.689> would<00:01:56.780> have<00:01:56.899> gone<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.170> look<00:01:57.590> at<00:01:57.710> the

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
sure that would have gone in look at the

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.560 
sure that would have gone in look at the
dip<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.340> power<00:01:58.579> feegle<00:01:59.000> gets<00:01:59.299> behind

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
dip and the power feegle gets behind

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.870 
dip and the power feegle gets behind
that<00:01:59.869> shot<00:02:00.229> as<00:02:00.439> well<00:02:00.619> it's<00:02:01.189> something<00:02:01.340> not<00:02:01.729> to

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
that shot as well it's something not to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.300 
that shot as well it's something not to
be<00:02:01.909> trifled<00:02:02.299> with<00:02:02.630> here<00:02:03.380> he<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:03.560> again<00:02:03.649> just<00:02:04.189> as

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
be trifled with here he is again just as

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.709 
be trifled with here he is again just as
it<00:02:04.429> looks<00:02:04.549> like<00:02:04.670> he's<00:02:04.789> about<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:05.090> cross<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.420> few

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
it looks like he's about to cross a few

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.889 
it looks like he's about to cross a few
step<00:02:05.990> over<00:02:06.259> fakies<00:02:06.740> fakies<00:02:07.609> again<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.360> what

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
step over fakies fakies again and what

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.450 
step over fakies fakies again and what
does<00:02:09.050> he<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.289> weak<00:02:09.650> foot<00:02:09.980> which<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.250> four

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
does he do a weak foot which is four

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.580 
does he do a weak foot which is four
stars<00:02:10.730> and<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.300> was

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
stars and it was

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.470 
stars and it was
that<00:02:11.709> bad<00:02:11.950> i<00:02:12.160> mean<00:02:12.340> ii<00:02:12.610> miss<00:02:12.910> not<00:02:13.150> gonna<00:02:13.300> lie<00:02:13.450> i

everyone<00:02:20.590> but<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> finish<00:02:21.550> shot<00:02:21.910> at<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.150> end

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
everyone but the finish shot at the end

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.570 
everyone but the finish shot at the end
was<00:02:22.480> not<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.810> best<00:02:23.050> but<00:02:23.349> nevertheless<00:02:23.830> we<00:02:24.430> can

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
watching this finish just look at it I

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.759 
watching this finish just look at it I
have<00:02:31.450> never<00:02:31.720> seen<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:32.200> didn't<00:02:32.500> know<00:02:32.590> they<00:02:32.709> could

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
have never seen I didn't know they could

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.199 
have never seen I didn't know they could
finish<00:02:33.129> like<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.580> i<00:02:33.610> mean<00:02:33.670> i<00:02:33.819> knew<00:02:34.000> they

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
finish like that i mean i knew they

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.330 
finish like that i mean i knew they
changed<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.599> dynamics<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.260> fifa<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.190> that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
changed the dynamics of fifa but that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.770 
changed the dynamics of fifa but that
was<00:02:36.519> just<00:02:36.549> absolutely<00:02:37.150> brilliant<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.629> way

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
was just absolutely brilliant the way

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.410 
was just absolutely brilliant the way
his<00:02:38.019> body<00:02:38.620> turned<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.760> ball<00:02:39.819> was<00:02:40.150> so

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
his body turned on that ball was so

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.150 
his body turned on that ball was so
realistic<00:02:40.780> there<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.620> hitting<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.950> crossbar

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
realistic there is hitting the crossbar

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.610 
realistic there is hitting the crossbar
again<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.819> really<00:02:43.269> liked<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:43.959> goal<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.319> know<00:02:44.500> I

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
again I really liked that goal I know I

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.289 
again I really liked that goal I know I
mean<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:44.980> score<00:02:45.250> quite<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.459> few<00:02:45.640> nice<00:02:45.849> girls<00:02:46.150> in

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
mean I score quite a few nice girls in

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.110 
mean I score quite a few nice girls in
this<00:02:46.420> but<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.590> there'll<00:02:48.190> be<00:02:48.220> few<00:02:48.519> nicer<00:02:48.940> ones

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
this but and there'll be few nicer ones

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.180 
this but and there'll be few nicer ones
coming<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.989> was<00:02:50.200> just<00:02:50.230> really

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
coming up but that was just really

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.479 
coming up but that was just really
really<00:02:51.489> nice<00:02:51.819> to<00:02:52.030> finish<00:02:52.239> in<00:02:52.569> terms<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.650> how

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
really nice to finish in terms of how

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.699 
really nice to finish in terms of how
the<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:55.450> know<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.690> physics<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.319> game<00:02:56.500> has

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
the you know the physics of the game has

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.830 
the you know the physics of the game has
evolved<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.459> changed<00:02:57.489> you<00:02:57.940> know<00:02:57.970> changed<00:02:58.690> but

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
evolved and changed you know changed but

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.990 
evolved and changed you know changed but
here<00:02:59.620> he<00:02:59.709> is<00:02:59.739> again<00:02:59.829> using<00:03:00.370> pay<00:03:00.549> honestly

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
here he is again using pay honestly

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.970 
here he is again using pay honestly
sometimes<00:03:01.180> he's<00:03:01.629> really<00:03:02.110> slow<00:03:02.440> but<00:03:02.620> he<00:03:02.769> lik

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
sometimes he's really slow but he lik

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.430 
sometimes he's really slow but he lik
when<00:03:03.129> he<00:03:03.220> has<00:03:03.370> acres<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.879> space<00:03:04.060> like<00:03:04.299> this

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
when he has acres of space like this

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.509 
when he has acres of space like this
look<00:03:05.440> at<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.620> nice<00:03:05.860> little<00:03:05.980> brain<00:03:06.250> but<00:03:06.430> when

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
look at that nice little brain but when

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.920 
look at that nice little brain but when
he<00:03:06.610> has<00:03:06.700> acres<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.150> space<00:03:07.360> like<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.690> he's

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
he has acres of space like that he's

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.360 
he has acres of space like that he's
just<00:03:08.140> brilliant<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:08.769> when<00:03:08.920> he's<00:03:09.010> kind<00:03:09.280> of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
just brilliant but when he's kind of

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.949 
just brilliant but when he's kind of
when<00:03:09.849> he<00:03:09.940> knows<00:03:10.120> he<00:03:10.269> has<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.390> get<00:03:10.599> Pat<00:03:10.780> wall

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
when he knows he has to get Pat wall

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.869 
when he knows he has to get Pat wall
when<00:03:11.140> he<00:03:11.170> knows<00:03:11.440> when<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:11.920> know<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.340> have<00:03:12.579> to<00:03:12.610> try

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
when he knows when I know I have to try

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:14.009 
when he knows when I know I have to try
and<00:03:12.940> get<00:03:13.060> past<00:03:13.180> three<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.569> four<00:03:13.780> instead<00:03:13.959> of

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
and get past three to four instead of

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.500 
and get past three to four instead of
one<00:03:14.319> or<00:03:14.470> two<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.799> there's<00:03:15.340> less<00:03:15.850> space<00:03:16.209> I

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
one or two and there's less space I

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.180 
one or two and there's less space I
don't<00:03:16.840> know<00:03:16.900> he<00:03:17.019> feels<00:03:17.260> like<00:03:17.440> he's<00:03:17.620> scared<00:03:18.010> I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
don't know he feels like he's scared I

strength<00:04:06.310> before<00:04:06.489> even<00:04:06.790> using<00:04:07.120> because<00:04:07.299> a<00:04:07.329> lot

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
strength before even using because a lot

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.360 
strength before even using because a lot
of<00:04:07.540> players<00:04:07.720> have<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:08.169> really<00:04:08.650> crappy<00:04:09.010> strength

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370

out of ten 7.5 that's still decent

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.629 
out of ten 7.5 that's still decent
that's<00:04:30.720> not<00:04:30.930> bad<00:04:31.139> but<00:04:31.439> you'd<00:04:31.889> give<00:04:32.129> a<00:04:32.159> 9<00:04:32.430> out<00:04:32.610> of

to<00:04:38.729> even<00:04:38.789> get<00:04:39.060> seven<00:04:39.539> but<00:04:39.719> I<00:04:40.050> mean<00:04:40.439> it<00:04:40.889> made<00:04:41.250> up

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
to even get seven but I mean it made up

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.740 
to even get seven but I mean it made up
for<00:04:41.430> it<00:04:41.669> with<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.909> way<00:04:42.090> his<00:04:42.300> dribbling

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
for it with the way his dribbling

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.510
