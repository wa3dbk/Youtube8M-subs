 this meat that piggy was young for 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.680
 boys do not know the girl that is, I thought 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.660
 what is there to be very literate 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.840
 professionals to determine the market 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.730
 how long and how much will be prepared as 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:46.079
 except cooking technique 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.610

 you need meat Slain to closed closed 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.870
 the meat is extinguished by turning on the stove and the meat 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.019
 It will stew it in water just to water 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.489
 something adds salt yet and how much 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.770
 time must pass like a little water 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.920
 evaporated were ready ie all the water 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.470
 evaporates means the meat is already drained 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.390
 she dragged here and the next algorithm a 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.960
 the next is adding masses will be meat 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.270
 fry meat after being extinguished 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.270
 water is evaporated water is added oil and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.509
 the meat starts to roast until golden 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.939
 crust or not this when on 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:40.409
 fried in butter until different 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:44.159
 seasoning add pepper salt pepper and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.670
 I will eat carrots a little bit add 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.140
 flour 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.090
 so that it turns out the fields at the end all 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.119
 filled and will not be offended 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.189
 myasko in the gravy supplies he will then 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:04.250
 there is seasoning salt and then something else 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:04.250
 you flood missed than you flood with water 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.190
 but now the west and such is all 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.620
 almost ready it will be without 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.990
 stroganov it can be mixed with buckwheat 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:19.290
 porridge everything is clear a very interesting dish 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.370
 we just listened to the chef 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.920
 Italian restaurant sometimes clearer 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.520
 who told how the typical is prepared 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.940
 an Italian dish without planets shared 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.120
 like this is filled with water very steam 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.360
 rises need to work carefully and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.790
 shuffled 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.510
 water boils when all the technology 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.950
 real ones and try 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.930
 and trying to remove the foam only but such 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.430
 here's the case 1 for take very watch out 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.710
 Foam on the chips to run away with the flesh the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.560
 there is actually water all over now 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.630
 pans gone now I have to fry a couple 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.810
 meat already appears as possible 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.120
 a professional is this crust on meat 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.520
 even as you want to it because to 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.400
 to the little heads 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.400
 head that they were beautiful no need 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.220
 add 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.739
 the next ingredient is carrot court in 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.830
 usually usually fried one separately works 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.180
 Whose roses are warming up but good meat 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.310
 almost done 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.950
 his day almost ready all the fires 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.250
 Well, now in a separate pan to fry 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.080
 we see beautifully carrot and onion 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.650
 now do not fry and everything will be mixed 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.860
 right so what we're doing now is that 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.720
 happens we have to put on 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.959
 a bit added about the attack 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.090
 where the carrot has added a bowl look like 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.280
 carne meat get tired from the top pours 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:57.070
 we follow the hands of the magician fray 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.680
 carrots right in the meat we have to 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.900
 mix or leave 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.790
 just smooth it with some salt water 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.620
 because besides paprika there is still there 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.810
 arm 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.870
 Innochka fried sound where you lived 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.689
 with meat along with a folder along with paprika 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.200
 I put both rations in meat and paprika 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.799
 in meat 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:21.169
 and on top added now did 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.169
 sailor's carrots and onions 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.190
 very interesting and tasty and now water i 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.090
 so I understand it will evaporate and remain on 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.580
 the length of a little finger and steel although 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.490
 I could no longer pour the water correctly but 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.470
 it will be a bit dry 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.830
 so that myasko languished a little more 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.300
 a little bit with all the ingredients 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.330
 western now well unfortunately you are not 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:04.470
 can feel the marathon here 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:06.540
 smells like meat in some bavarian let's say 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.350
 so the restaurant smells and now 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.580
 bring beer anyone still bright 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.580
