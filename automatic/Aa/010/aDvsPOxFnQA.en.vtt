00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.630 
obviously this is without playing it and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
as innovating as I expected it to be

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.770 
as innovating as I expected it to be
with<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.309> being<00:00:38.340> get<00:00:38.879> pumped<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.360> being<00:00:39.600> like

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
with it being get pumped as being like

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
Xbox one and the ps4 I thought it would

be<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> real<00:00:45.719> big<00:00:45.960> improvement<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.800> new

engine<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> completely<00:00:48.480> new<00:00:48.600> game<00:00:49.020> as

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
engine and a completely new game as

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.010 
engine and a completely new game as
opposed<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> old<00:00:50.309> core<00:00:50.579> duties<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.690> it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
opposed to the old core duties but it

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.860 
opposed to the old core duties but it
turns<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:53.039> yet<00:00:53.610> another

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
turns out just to be like yet another

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.260 
turns out just to be like yet another
normal<00:00:54.870> everyday<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:56.129> every<00:00:56.550> year<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.120> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
normal everyday or every year and you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.360 
normal everyday or every year and you
all<00:00:57.390> call<00:00:57.690> duty<00:00:57.989> release<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.770> mean<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.219> better

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
all call duty release I mean it's better

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.250 
all call duty release I mean it's better
than<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> previous<00:00:59.850> titles<00:01:00.539> but<00:01:00.809> it's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
than the previous titles but it's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
than the previous titles but it's
nothing<00:01:01.559> substantially<00:01:02.340> different<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:03.090> was

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
nothing substantially different I was

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.210 
nothing substantially different I was
really<00:01:03.840> expecting<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.589> be<00:01:04.739> something

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
really expecting it to be something

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.609 
really expecting it to be something
completely<00:01:05.489> different<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.750> Treyarch

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
completely different to the Treyarch

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.530 
completely different to the Treyarch
and<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> Infinity<00:01:08.400> Ward<00:01:08.580> games<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.360> just

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
and the Infinity Ward games but it just

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
and the Infinity Ward games but it just
seems<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.049> next<00:01:10.200> step<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.770> from<00:01:11.130> modern

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
seems like the next step on from modern

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.490 
seems like the next step on from modern
warfare<00:01:11.640> 3<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.720> at<00:01:12.780> least<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.049> time<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.409> have

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
warfare 3 but at least this time we have

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.149 
warfare 3 but at least this time we have
taken<00:01:13.710> some<00:01:14.189> cues<00:01:14.549> from<00:01:14.580> black<00:01:15.090> ops<00:01:15.270> 2<00:01:15.540> and

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
taken some cues from black ops 2 and

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.530 
taken some cues from black ops 2 and
implemented<00:01:17.159> some<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> those<00:01:17.610> kind<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.090> good

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
implemented some of those kind of good

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240 
implemented some of those kind of good

which<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:42.000> think's<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.540> lot<00:01:42.720> better<00:01:42.899> than<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
which I think's a lot better than the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.319 
which I think's a lot better than the
old<00:01:43.200> prestige<00:01:43.770> system<00:01:44.280> I've<00:01:44.729> never<00:01:45.090> been<00:01:45.299> a

old prestige system I've never been a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.359 
old prestige system I've never been a
big<00:01:45.570> fan<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.780> prestiging<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.100> don't

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
big fan of prestiging because I don't

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.280 
big fan of prestiging because I don't
like<00:01:47.520> losing<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> things<00:01:48.899> I've<00:01:49.020> unlocked

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
like losing all the things I've unlocked

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.190

progress each soldier individually which

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
now instead of selecting perks from

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.960 
now instead of selecting perks from
three<00:02:24.930> different<00:02:25.170> tiers<00:02:25.410> they've<00:02:26.010> taken<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
three different tiers they've taken the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.360 
three different tiers they've taken the

and taken that to the next level

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.900 
and taken that to the next level
which<00:02:31.380> means<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.770> can<00:02:31.890> now<00:02:32.010> select<00:02:32.280> multiple

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
which means you can now select multiple

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.120 
which means you can now select multiple
perks<00:02:33.240> from<00:02:33.600> various<00:02:34.350> different<00:02:34.650> categories

perks from various different categories

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.650 
perks from various different categories
although<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.730> think<00:02:35.820> they've<00:02:36.090> may<00:02:36.210> have<00:02:36.300> taken

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
although I think they've may have taken

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.170 
although I think they've may have taken
this<00:02:36.750> one<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.990> little<00:02:37.170> bit<00:02:37.290> too<00:02:37.470> far<00:02:37.740> and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
this one a little bit too far and

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.760 
this one a little bit too far and
granted<00:02:39.180> too<00:02:39.390> many<00:02:39.600> options<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:40.620> was

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
granted too many options like was

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.290 
granted too many options like was

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
mentioned in the reveal event if you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300 
mentioned in the reveal event if you
sacrifice<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:43.050> second<00:02:43.530> weapon<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.130> some

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
sacrifice a second weapon and some

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.250 
sacrifice a second weapon and some
equipment<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:45.210> know<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.570> ability<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:46.140> have

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
equipment you know the ability to have

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.370 
equipment you know the ability to have
up<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.620> 11<00:02:47.160> perks<00:02:47.490> at<00:02:47.820> once<00:02:48.060> which<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.020> little

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
up to 11 perks at once which is a little

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.840 
up to 11 perks at once which is a little
bit<00:02:49.470> overkill<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:49.980> my<00:02:50.100> opinion<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.550> don't<00:02:50.580> know

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
bit overkill in my opinion I don't know

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.130 
bit overkill in my opinion I don't know
how<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.180> going<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.390> work<00:02:51.570> in<00:02:51.750> terms<00:02:51.900> of

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
how this is going to work in terms of

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.170 
how this is going to work in terms of
balance<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.830> it's<00:02:53.340> gonna<00:02:53.520> be<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> little<00:02:54.060> bit

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
balance and it's gonna be a little bit

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.230 
balance and it's gonna be a little bit
difficult<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.810> keep<00:02:55.260> track<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:56.240> unfortunately

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
difficult to keep track of unfortunately

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.910 
difficult to keep track of unfortunately
another<00:02:57.390> drawback<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:58.020> my<00:02:58.170> opinion<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.740> that

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
another drawback in my opinion is that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.680 
another drawback in my opinion is that
they've<00:02:59.130> gone<00:02:59.640> back<00:02:59.820> to<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.150> modern<00:03:00.510> warfare

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
they've gone back to the modern warfare

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.230 
they've gone back to the modern warfare
3<00:03:00.900> kill<00:03:01.530> streak<00:03:01.800> system<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.340> assault<00:03:02.760> support

and<00:03:03.840> specialists<00:03:04.470> as<00:03:05.130> I've<00:03:05.460> discussed<00:03:05.790> before

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
and specialists as I've discussed before

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.540 
and specialists as I've discussed before
I<00:03:06.180> thought<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.720> idea<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.290> those<00:03:07.590> three<00:03:07.920> strike

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
I thought the idea of those three strike

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.580 
I thought the idea of those three strike
packages<00:03:09.060> was<00:03:09.300> quite<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.780> good<00:03:09.900> idea<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.500> in

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
packages was quite a good idea but in

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.170 
packages was quite a good idea but in
practice<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:11.310> didn't<00:03:11.490> really<00:03:11.700> work<00:03:11.880> out<00:03:12.120> too

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
practice it didn't really work out too

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.720 
practice it didn't really work out too
well<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:13.440> table<00:03:13.770> saw<00:03:13.950> your<00:03:14.160> assault<00:03:14.490> kill

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
well the table saw your assault kill

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.670 
well the table saw your assault kill
streaks<00:03:15.030> are<00:03:15.180> all<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.600> countered<00:03:16.080> by<00:03:16.290> yet

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
streaks are all that countered by yet

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.729 
streaks are all that countered by yet
support<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.430> then<00:03:18.390> we<00:03:18.420> saw<00:03:18.690> some<00:03:18.989> support

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
support and then we saw some support

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.010 
support and then we saw some support
kill<00:03:19.950> streaks<00:03:20.250> game<00:03:20.520> abused<00:03:21.180> as<00:03:21.510> such<00:03:21.660> as<00:03:21.810> the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
kill streaks game abused as such as the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
EMP the stealth bomber it just made the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.810 
EMP the stealth bomber it just made the
game<00:03:24.600> pretty<00:03:24.989> frustrating<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.890> both<00:03:26.340> parties

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
game pretty frustrating for both parties

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.550 
game pretty frustrating for both parties
which<00:03:27.480> pretty<00:03:27.720> much<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.080> left<00:03:28.320> the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
which pretty much just left the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.710 
which pretty much just left the
specialist<00:03:29.250> package<00:03:29.580> which<00:03:29.760> was<00:03:30.000> what<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.480> used

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
specialist package which was what I used

some audio and visual enhancements I

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.059

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
like the reverb audio that they've

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.950 
like the reverb audio that they've
introduced<00:04:59.580> much<00:04:59.879> like<00:05:00.120> battlefield<00:05:00.629> where

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
introduced much like battlefield where

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.170 
introduced much like battlefield where
your<00:05:01.199> gun<00:05:01.469> sounds<00:05:01.979> sound<00:05:02.639> different<00:05:03.029> if

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
although I think the gun sounds did

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.529 
although I think the gun sounds did
sound<00:05:07.560> a<00:05:07.919> little<00:05:08.039> flat<00:05:08.789> or<00:05:09.000> high-pitched

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
which made them quite fake I don't know

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.959 
which made them quite fake I don't know
if<00:05:11.849> this<00:05:12.090> is<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.509> final<00:05:13.259> version<00:05:13.529> of<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:13.969> of

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
released it'll also be interesting to

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.170

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:27.509 
Xbox 360 and the next-gen consoles but

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.080 
Xbox 360 and the next-gen consoles but
little<00:05:28.110> touches<00:05:28.469> like<00:05:28.500> that<00:05:28.710> sub<00:05:29.189> D<00:05:29.490> rendering

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
little touches like that sub D rendering

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.320 
little touches like that sub D rendering
and<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:30.900> new<00:05:31.349> kind<00:05:31.650> of<00:05:31.800> sniper<00:05:32.279> rifle<00:05:32.819> scoping

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
and the new kind of sniper rifle scoping

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.209 
and the new kind of sniper rifle scoping
system<00:05:33.719> which<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.259> blows<00:05:34.469> out<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.710> background

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:35.219 
system which it blows out the background

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.240 
system which it blows out the background
is<00:05:35.400> pretty<00:05:36.000> cool<00:05:36.240> so<00:05:37.229> one<00:05:37.650> more<00:05:37.830> thing<00:05:37.860> I<00:05:38.129> like

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
is pretty cool so one more thing I like

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.119 
is pretty cool so one more thing I like
the<00:05:38.279> look<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.699> was<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.210> slide<00:05:39.690> vault<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.500> lean

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:41.129 
the look of was the slide vault and lean

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.850 
the look of was the slide vault and lean
movement<00:05:41.879> features<00:05:42.449> its<00:05:43.379> barest<00:05:43.650> though<00:05:43.830> I

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
movement features its barest though I

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.350 
movement features its barest though I
mean<00:05:44.370> these<00:05:44.520> are<00:05:44.729> things<00:05:44.909> that<00:05:45.000> could<00:05:45.240> have

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
mean these are things that could have

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.839 
mean these are things that could have
been<00:05:45.389> introduced<00:05:46.020> in<00:05:46.259> any<00:05:46.500> call<00:05:46.740> duty<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:47.699> it's

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
been introduced in any call duty so it's

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:49.640 
been introduced in any call duty so it's
a<00:05:47.909> shame<00:05:48.120> they've<00:05:48.330> had<00:05:48.509> to<00:05:48.659> wait<00:05:48.870> for<00:05:49.259> call<00:05:49.560> of

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
a shame they've had to wait for call of

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.070 
a shame they've had to wait for call of
duty<00:05:49.919> ghosts<00:05:50.339> on<00:05:50.550> these<00:05:51.029> next-gen<00:05:51.569> consoles

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
duty ghosts on these next-gen consoles

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.990 
duty ghosts on these next-gen consoles
for<00:05:52.379> a<00:05:52.409> simple<00:05:52.770> little<00:05:52.919> addition<00:05:53.669> like<00:05:53.789> this

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
for a simple little addition like this

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.839 
for a simple little addition like this
but<00:05:54.409> it's<00:05:55.409> finished<00:05:55.740> it's<00:05:55.860> all<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.159> little

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
but it's finished it's all the little

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:57.950 
but it's finished it's all the little
things<00:05:57.060> that<00:05:57.150> I've<00:05:57.330> kind<00:05:57.539> of<00:05:57.569> picked<00:05:57.719> out

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
things that I've kind of picked out

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.360 
things that I've kind of picked out
those<00:05:58.080> things<00:05:58.319> alike<00:05:58.620> and<00:05:58.919> all<00:05:59.009> the<00:05:59.159> main

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
those things alike and all the main

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.040 
those things alike and all the main
features<00:05:59.879> that<00:05:59.909> they're<00:06:00.210> promoting<00:06:00.719> and<00:06:00.900> kind

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
features that they're promoting and kind

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.570 
features that they're promoting and kind
of<00:06:01.139> things<00:06:01.319> I'm<00:06:01.529> not<00:06:01.979> too<00:06:02.129> fussed<00:06:02.430> about

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
of things I'm not too fussed about

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.939 
of things I'm not too fussed about
alright<00:06:03.539> completely<00:06:04.020> dislike<00:06:04.469> all<00:06:04.680> together

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
alright completely dislike all together

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.249 
alright completely dislike all together
so<00:06:05.759> I<00:06:05.789> think<00:06:06.029> I'm<00:06:06.330> definitely<00:06:06.479> still<00:06:06.900> looking

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
so I think I'm definitely still looking

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.529 
so I think I'm definitely still looking
forward<00:06:07.680> to<00:06:07.979> what<00:06:08.250> titanfall<00:06:08.699> is<00:06:09.089> my<00:06:09.270> number

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:09.539

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.600 
forward to what titanfall is my number
one<00:06:09.689> game<00:06:09.930> I'm<00:06:10.529> not<00:06:10.650> so<00:06:10.800> sure<00:06:10.830> in<00:06:11.099> the<00:06:11.189> schedule

of<00:06:11.729> release<00:06:12.029> date<00:06:12.300> so<00:06:12.449> I'm<00:06:12.509> guessing<00:06:12.900> core

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
of release date so I'm guessing core

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.619
