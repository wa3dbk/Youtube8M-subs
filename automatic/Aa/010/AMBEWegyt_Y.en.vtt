the field road fur trappers like all of
that<00:00:12.740> that's<00:00:13.740> all<00:00:14.009> where<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.219> trap<00:00:14.549> this

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
that that's all where we trap this

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.939 
that that's all where we trap this
winter<00:00:15.120> that's<00:00:15.540> my<00:00:15.719> main<00:00:15.929> line<00:00:16.170> as<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.859> can

winter that's my main line as you can
see<00:00:17.160> multiple<00:00:17.580> times<00:00:17.820> there<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:19.730> that<00:00:20.730> line<00:00:20.970> I

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
see multiple times there and that line I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.679 
see multiple times there and that line I

trapline here's our basically our entire
water<00:00:52.350> line<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> mean<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.070> still<00:00:53.250> set<00:00:53.460> beaver

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
water line I mean we still set beaver

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.150 
water line I mean we still set beaver
traps<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.360> traps<00:00:55.170> for<00:00:55.320> other<00:00:55.440> water<00:00:55.739> animals

and other places but this part here
stewart<00:00:58.920> lake<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.730> where<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.359> catch<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
stewart lake that's where we catch the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240 
stewart lake that's where we catch the
brunt<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.109> our<00:01:01.230> muskrat<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.710> beaver<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
winter you can kind of see it splits up

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.350 
winter you can kind of see it splits up
over<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> middle<00:01:06.650> but<00:01:07.650> um<00:01:08.119> that<00:01:09.119> like

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
over here in the middle but um that like

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.840 
over here in the middle but um that like
there<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.780> about<00:01:10.020> eight<00:01:10.170> miles<00:01:10.380> long<00:01:10.850> all

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
there is about eight miles long all

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.030 
there is about eight miles long all
together<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.170> was<00:01:13.260> trapping<00:01:13.470> both<00:01:13.770> sides

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
together and I was trapping both sides

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.560 
together and I was trapping both sides
of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> road<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.460> white<00:01:14.850> strip<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
of the road that white strip there is

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.539 
of the road that white strip there is
the<00:01:15.689> road<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.680> I've<00:01:16.770> got<00:01:16.799> parking<00:01:17.369> there

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
we catch most of our muskrat and beaver

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100 
we catch most of our muskrat and beaver
and<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.939> catch<00:01:33.150> other<00:01:33.329> stuff<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:33.900> too

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and we catch other stuff out there too

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.770 
and we catch other stuff out there too
but<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:35.009> our<00:01:35.189> water<00:01:35.400> line<00:01:35.670> section<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
but that's our water line section of the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.140 
but that's our water line section of the
trap<00:01:36.990> line<00:01:37.020> right<00:01:37.380> there<00:01:37.700> now<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.939> see

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
trap line right there now you can see

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.460 
trap line right there now you can see
we're<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.509> down<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.840> road<00:01:39.869> from<00:01:39.990> stewart

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
we're just down the road from stewart

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.130 
we're just down the road from stewart
lake<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.729> East<00:01:42.000> line<00:01:42.240> entrance<00:01:42.659> here<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
lake and this East line entrance here is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.840 
lake and this East line entrance here is
through<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.680> water<00:01:43.710> line<00:01:44.159> i<00:01:44.189> call<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
through it like water line i call it the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.420 
through it like water line i call it the
strapline<00:01:45.649> because<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.799> runs<00:01:47.009> these<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
strapline because it runs these to the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.550 
strapline because it runs these to the

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.449 
ten miles from any highway or real good
roadway<00:03:50.180> right<00:03:50.540> there<00:03:50.950> but<00:03:51.950> then<00:03:52.070> you<00:03:52.160> see<00:03:52.340> if

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
roadway right there but then you see if

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.130 
roadway right there but then you see if
we<00:03:52.549> come<00:03:52.730> just<00:03:52.970> over<00:03:53.440> we're<00:03:54.440> at<00:03:54.620> sleeve<00:03:55.459> lake

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
we come just over we're at sleeve lake

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.960 
we come just over we're at sleeve lake
and<00:03:57.140> I<00:03:57.230> know<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.440> guy<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.709> traps<00:03:58.100> down<00:03:58.340> at<00:03:58.580> the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
and I know a guy the traps down at the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.690 
and I know a guy the traps down at the
far<00:03:59.180> edge<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.480> sleeve<00:03:59.750> lake<00:04:00.160> so<00:04:01.160> unless<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.549> got

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
far edge of sleeve lake so unless I got

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.520 
far edge of sleeve lake so unless I got
more<00:04:01.940> traps<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.540> got<00:04:02.780> fur<00:04:03.049> and<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.410> other

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
more traps that I got fur and the other

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.979 
more traps that I got fur and the other
portions<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.220> line<00:04:04.400> we'll<00:04:04.959> leave<00:04:05.959> that

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
portions of the line we'll leave that

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.690 
portions of the line we'll leave that
side<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.440> sleep<00:04:06.709> like<00:04:06.890> alone<00:04:07.160> we<00:04:07.370> might<00:04:07.519> come

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
side of sleep like alone we might come

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.120 
side of sleep like alone we might come
over<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.000> this<00:04:08.120> side<00:04:08.360> a<00:04:08.390> little<00:04:08.660> bit<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.130> trap

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
over to this side a little bit and trap

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.650 
over to this side a little bit and trap
because<00:04:10.310> there<00:04:10.489> should<00:04:10.519> be<00:04:10.820> good<00:04:11.060> kyoot<00:04:11.420> and

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
because there should be good kyoot and

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.050 
because there should be good kyoot and
probably<00:04:12.620> some<00:04:12.769> wolf<00:04:13.010> Fisher<00:04:13.370> Martin<00:04:13.790> in<00:04:13.910> that

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
probably some wolf Fisher Martin in that

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.259 
probably some wolf Fisher Martin in that
area<00:04:14.470> but

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
area but

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.599 
area but
just<00:04:17.079> figured<00:04:17.229> I'd<00:04:17.470> show<00:04:17.889> you<00:04:17.919> our<00:04:18.160> trap<00:04:18.400> line

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
just figured I'd show you our trap line

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.129 
just figured I'd show you our trap line
this<00:04:18.789> winter<00:04:19.090> where<00:04:19.419> I'd<00:04:19.569> do<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:19.930> quite

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
this winter where I'd do it quite

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.080 
this winter where I'd do it quite
significantly<00:04:20.739> hope<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.609> catch<00:04:21.759> some<00:04:21.940> good

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
significantly hope to catch some good

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.300 
significantly hope to catch some good
