00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.520
 this little tutorial for all 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.820
 those users of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.529
 playstation 3 that are youtubers or to 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.939
 unless they like to record their gameplays 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.130
 upload them to good it's hard to think 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.690
 another website that is not youtube but 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.579
 good all those people who have 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.980
 the problem that I have in these 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.710
 moments is that I can not record my 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.410
 gameplays listen to this this does not 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.640
 explain yet 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:50.239
 of playstation 3 with the capturing the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.730
 cat let's put here to see if the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.370
 we bring 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.520
 h of 60 which is the last version that has 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.780
 come out if you know this capturing 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.559
 can not record gameplays from 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.059
 playstation3 because he can not because with 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.540
 the previous version we're going to take it 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.610
 these cables this could only be 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.960
 record gameplays from play station 3 by 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:18.759
 av medium cable since the hdmi what 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.610
 they have blocked the great ones 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.990
 these were bad words that I said of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.680
 playstation then the only way to 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.660
 record was by means of the cable avy the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.520
 cat catcher earlier version 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.220
 previous if it supported what it was 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.070
 that kind of cables with the new version 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.250
 does not bring support for that cable only 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.470
 it's by means of hdmi and it's also can 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.910
 check and in this video I was there 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.310
 making inquiries 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.080
 I was checking on the internet how 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.030
 could they be able to record my 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.060
 birthday of playstation 3 since there 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.070
 game every white day 2 which 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.500
 It is one of my favorite games 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.750
 and it took me good games I consider myself 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.310
 there decent 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.490
 so many people of you in my 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.439
 another gaming channel like it like this 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.209
 grab that case then I decided to 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.459
 do this little tutorial and buy me 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.900
 What is the next product for 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:19.140
 start what they need is an hdmi 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.860
 splitter splitter or separator hdmi and 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.620
 splitter one by two this one of the brand 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.260
 now and this one is very cheap I 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.580
 I got 20 dollars on ebay if you go to 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.550
 website of them because it will cost you a 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.370
 little bit more which is margin 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.230
 logical and this for 20 dollars I think that 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.920
 it is very good this we are going to show you 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.360
 how is this little monster according to 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.210
 chosen in the videos I've seen 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.170
 this product this device that 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.510
 allows you to decrypt or unblock what 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.030
 what is the hdmi of playstation 3 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.670
 playstation 3 we will use what is the hdmi 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.400
 of output we will put it I think here in 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.440
 this side the input yes and at the time of 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.240
 leave here one goes for the TV and the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.630
 another goes for what is our 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.940
 capture the cat hd at the moment 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.580
 leave here and go unblocked what 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.040
 it's the hdmi signal that's what I've 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.970
 heard you're just going to see how it works 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.950
 this comes this look what is this the 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.810
 device itself and there is one thing that 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.110
 I think something bad is that you have it 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.670
 have to connect it to the current 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.040
 obligatorily which I think I do not 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.270
 like it a lot because it's a device more 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.430
 that is going to have to have connected the 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.470
 all the time you want to record my 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.350
 gameplays but if it works gentlemen I 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.720
 I think it's a perfect option for 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.950
 to be able to take those games so effectively that 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.070
 we throw what is white all 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.720
 we put it here and this is all 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.250
 what is coming and we will proceed to 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.360
 do the tutorial to see if it is 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.380
 true 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.230
 this works gentlemen we already made 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.090
 good friends , we're back and now we're going 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.670
 to bring what is the tutorial itself 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.950
 check nothing else the mess check the 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.860
 cablerÃ­o that thrown we are going to interest 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.070
 this good and good let's try to 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:16.190
 explain it as best as possible first you go 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:18.620
 to need three hdmi cables and 3 1 2 3 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.510
 so that's why it's good 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.060
 first it's going to be the hdmi cable that comes out 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.760
 of our playstation3 we are going to try 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.980
 to move here as quickly as possible 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.640
 playstation3 truth the cable comes out the 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:35.330
 which one will go to the explorer's part 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:39.010
 where it only has one step 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.200
 number 1 first cable hdmi playstation3 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.090
 in explaining which one goes here and here is 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.420
 on the power cable that gives you 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.460
 energy that is electricity 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.690
 first hdmi second hdmi cable is going to be 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.940
 which you can use any of these 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.820
 two ports does not matter in what position 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:01.030
 put them this will go to what is 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.500
 our catcher the cat h of 60 in 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.870
 which side will go smoking will go in the 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:10.600
 side where it also connects for the 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:14.050
 side of the computer which says hdmi 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.000
 or the entry of hdmi 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.670
 that is the second step the second cable 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.370
 hdmi which comes from explaining to the 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.320
 capturing and it is step number 2 and the 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.920
 step number 3 is very simple sir that 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.410
 it's the third hdmi which goes on the other 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:34.330
 port of what is the explorer and goes 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:37.210
 directly to our television that does not 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.750
 I know if it looks clearly there is third 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:44.230
 hdmi cable which is this goes straight to 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.630
 what is our television that we have 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.070
 done then something that is not up to 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.470
 moment is not so easy so much science 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.900
 sorry which is to pass directly 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.320
 image of the cable to playstation by 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.620
 half d 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.240
 to our television the only thing that is 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.120
 new and that's what we were trying 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:06.850
 to teach on this day is that with the 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:09.700
 program the cat program h of 60 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.850
 did not catch us what was signal by 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.790
 medium of hdmi and the east the capture of the 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.920
 cat h of 60 does not support for 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.080
 be able to capture by means of av cable 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.400
 as you can see here in our program 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.350
 the cat we already have what is the image 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.390
 of playstation 3 in our software or 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.540
 the program's captor is the 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.950
 software what is the the hd cat and 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.440
 There we have it, gentlemen, I have it here 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.080
 for example right now in 720 with 60 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.060
 pictures we can leave it like this or yes 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.580
 preferably you can throw it to 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.260
 1080 p with 30 frames 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.920
 you can play him there in what is the 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.840
 settings as you can see here 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.760
 and you can choose what you want 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.950
 look here I did not even have 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.340
 put playstation3 but it's 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:58.020
 configured on what is this xbox one and 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.350
 from a this grabs what is the signal 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.330
 I think that is more than perfect 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.390
 it does not give us any kind of problems and so 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:11.670
 It is the way you can capture 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:14.250
 playstation3 gameplay in what is your 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.010
 capturing the cat h of 60 I hope that 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:21.240
 has been understood or rather I hope 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:24.830
 that has explained me three men 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:27.720
 hdmi cables this explain which one 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.100

 so they can buy it is where 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.720
 it worked to me logically there are many 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.670
 other brands but this one worked for me 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.990

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.080
