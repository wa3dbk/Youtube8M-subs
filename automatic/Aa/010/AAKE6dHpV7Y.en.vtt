00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.450
 another youtuber maybe you 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.720
 so 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.220
 for that is so that more 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.039

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.360
 The theme and I just look 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.460

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.469
 So youtuber I wish her

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.760

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.109
 Come on then just click away and we 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.320
 Just see us in my next one 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.660

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.680
 video or just until the next video 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.560
 Well, mr pretty I'm never larissa 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.450
 from the canal la la rua and the one 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.000
 secret tip today is all about 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.000
 really nice full and long eyelashes 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.369
 and I always have it right 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.830
 beautiful full long great expressive 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.110
 eyelashes wanted and was then 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.820
 always something carefully eyelashes 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.799
 because I always personally 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.509
 The fear was that she was not with me 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.610
 act and you always hear a lot of the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.799
 a heavy total of eyelashes 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.150
 series while the others then totally 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.430
 they say nothing at all 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.439
 and I personally was there 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.990
 always a little scared then 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.700
 around 80 euros for a eyelash serum 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.040
 spend and that's the end of it all 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.930
 did not work and then I thought 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.909
 Just give me a try 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.460
 few household remedies left me there 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.890
 Internet-informed and then got up 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.229
 import products tried but nothing 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.939
 has really shown an effect until 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.340
 I once read that exactly 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.770
 Two products mixed together 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.090
 super good result 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.149
 and then I have something else too 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.269
 what I personally mixed 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.299
 just like to use and thereby 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.349
 it's almost like a blink of a lot of rome 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.629
 I created myself 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.400
 have mixed together and since then I 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.959
 my eyelashes are so much used 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.209
 getting better are much much longer 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.140
 and denser and fuller profi 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.840
 healthier 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.040
 that's why my video is like that today 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.260
 a club gets around and I hope 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.700
 you like the video and you can 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.129
 take something for you, and that the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.299
 museum with you also works and 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.730
 I would say we jump now 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.510
 right in the on the rhine and for yours 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.220
 eyelash serum needs the 1 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.409
 Castor oil you can do in the pharmacy 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.170
 get and the well-known 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.239
 Coconut oil what you can find in every drugstore 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.430
 could and then every reformhaus and the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.189
 two ingredients are virtually ours 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.389
 main ingredients then still the most important 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:04.280
 some baby oil interdental brush or 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.290
 you should have a mascara brush there 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.689
 but be careful that the bar is straight 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.879
 is and not kinked and one 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.859
 he thinks best of empty containers 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.739
 that he is not too big here 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.480
 this is now a shower gel a little 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.150
 size of a shower gel of the body 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.919
 There are 60 milliliters in there and probably 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.530
 pay particular attention to this is 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.269
 up here is a normal shower gel 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.769
 Closure is and we start now 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.690
 directly with our two 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.180
 key ingredients 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.669
 that's the coconut oil and then 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.470
 still the castor oil and I have it here 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.419
 a small funnel comes with 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.090
 all this small on high surfaces 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:43.729
 with the plug in up here 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.370
 and then I give something less than that 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:48.590
 half of the vial size 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.720
 rizinus So here are 60 milliliter 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.400
 in there so I give about 25 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.400
 milliliters of castor oil in the vial 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.599
 Now I give just as much again 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.120
 Coconut oil also about 25 again 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.219
 milliliters since the coconut oil but always 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.599
 rather a firm consistency has me 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.530
 the whole now only with one again 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.569
 lighter on 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.340
 be careful in any case 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.539
 but we definitely need the oil 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.150
 liquid around in the flash 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:23.889
 then get the whole thing done 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.060
 back in the vial with a pure name 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.349
 is a bit careful now because 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.349
 that is not so handy here 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.980
 the whole thing now looks very good 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.900
 the two layers if the tenant has 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.120
 already a bit connected and 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.400
 below, the puzzle is still separate and 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.410
 I'll give up the coconut oil separately now 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.940
 another small shot of baby oil 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.040
 you do not necessarily have to do that 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.450
 does not have a big effect now but me 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.070
 I just like that for my own 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.470
 That's why I always give it that way 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.419
 about half a teaspoon more 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:02.780
 and almost fill the vials as yet 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:03.830
 ready for the finished serum and 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.770
 Now we have everything together 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.210
 Shake eyelash serum quasi finished 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.460
 but you do not know how it is 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.080
 applies and now that I explain to you 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.669
 why the lid was so important because 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.360
 Now we can explain this here 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.710
 just open up here and that's why 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.320
 It was also so important that we have one 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.390
 straight mascara brush for take 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.330
 now it could just be up here 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.350
 stuck and then pull out again 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.660
 and it is almost already 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.150
 stripped of excess product 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.290
 like a real mascara too and 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.660
 then you can just do that with yours 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.729
 eyelash brush eyelashes to your or 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.710
 Apply eyebrows depending on where you are 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.690
 have problems in that now synonymous 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.370
 already with the hawaii itself 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.220
 Hope you understood that 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.289
 how that works and yes the sense and 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.169
 purpose of this serums so if you it so 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.910
 It can just call that up 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.500
 a similar principle works like 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.720
 eyelash series eyelash series 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.150
 are so made that they are almost the 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.440
 extend the life of the eyelashes and 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.090
 The eyelashes grow longer then 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.960
 because they fail later and what these 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.760
 this eyelash serum is what I am now 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.010
 made myself just exactly makes 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.169
 because it means that there are so many 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.729
 good ingredients has the whole 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.160
 different oils maintain that in turn 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.780
 the eyelashes and the eyelashes 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.669
 super maintained by the oils and 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.740
 If they are approached, they will fall as well 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.360
 later, and they will 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.270
 is longer of course now has 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.100
 not in extreme effect like a eyelash 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.890
 serum as you can see there but such pictures 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.660
 My eyelashes are much fuller 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.060
 become healthier and longer and me 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.880
 think we make so many 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.740
 hair care products always 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.030
 the hair but think of our eyelashes 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.730
 We do not want to cheat every day 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.650
 lots of thick layers of mascara on it 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.590
 and what I say again 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.540
 once wanted this eyelash serum here 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.370
 what did you yourselves that this 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.500
 since coconut oil is in it will be back 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.700
 sure who can see it here so it 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.630
 would then always a bit 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.030
 warm up 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.920
 if you use it and what super super 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.780
 important is I have you just that 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.670
 two versions once showed this 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.970
 eyelashes brush and then only 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.830
 these little donto dental brushes and 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.840
 Although it's because you have to 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.370
 This brush always really always 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.530
 wash again and again if you like that 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.930
 used and cleaned because otherwise it is 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.430
 A great every day is bacteria 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.950
 to distribute on your eye what he yes 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.240
 definitely I do not want it if I have to 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.310
 then you can do a lot of work 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.900
 either each time as a batting to the 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.450
 new purchase which in the long run very much 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.970
 expensive or you just take this 

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.020
 Dental brush these just smaller there 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.690
 then you have to just a bit 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.460
 Fumble more but there you can 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.930
 just take each new and is new 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.330
 then just throw it away 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.010
 that's sort of the two things i do 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.870
 would recommend you so that you 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.580
 just do not give you bacteria to the 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.260
 lubricated eyes and then something else 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.180
 happened in the eyes and I hope 

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.800
 you liked the video that you guys
