00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.130
 you will buy meat sold at 50 cents 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.750
 per kg probably not 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.330
 yet each time she went to the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.240
 supermarket that you buy frankfurters from 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.730
 chicken or turkey good these products 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.300
 they contain mechanically separated meat 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.890
 which costs very little 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
 these are products that contain from 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.210
 40 to 90 percent of this subject 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.830
 before 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.350
 these envelopes are also sold at a 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.480
 very interesting price but 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
 considering the production costs of 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.399
 distribution and profit margins 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.950
 of the manufacturer's distributor comes 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.760
 spontaneously questioning the quality of 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.920
 product 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.760
 but what is separate chicken meat 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.039
 mechanically 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.949
 these are chicken carcasses by 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.500
 turkey deprived of thigh wings 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.390
 of the chest of the hill of the paws that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.640
 they are put in a big meat and silk 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.710
 pressed to other pressures 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.690
 at this point the whole passes into a 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.420
 filter to eliminate the most parts 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.640
 coarse of the bones and you get one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 pink pulp to which they are added 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.990
 then all other ingredients like the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.830
 aromas friendly to the trip and others to give 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.600
 a consistency to the buses for the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.700
 consumer can recognize however the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.340
 frankfurters made with separate meat 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.189
 mechanically because the wordings are 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 shown on the labels 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.670
 unfortunately these are characters 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.740
 really microscopic hard to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.640
 read but the law provides for this 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.860
 precise indication at the supermarket not 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.290
 you have to be too deluded by colors 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.990
 and other writings that appear label 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.689
 such as bred in Italy 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.579
 without the gm because in reality it is 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.520
 of products all made with meat 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.770
 mechanically separated if found for 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.619
 case of turkey chicken frankfurters 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.930
 made with real chicken meat cost 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.579
 double even triple but try the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.939
 because the taste changes 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.939
 to the next
