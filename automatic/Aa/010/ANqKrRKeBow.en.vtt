00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.180 
get into a good defensive stance what
I'm<00:00:11.940> always<00:00:12.120> taught<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.809> was<00:00:12.990> always<00:00:13.200> taught<00:00:13.590> is

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
I'm always taught I was always taught is

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.029 
I'm always taught I was always taught is
to<00:00:14.400> try<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.820> shoulder<00:00:15.179> width<00:00:15.330> apart<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:16.049> like

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
to try to be shoulder width apart I like

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.490 
to try to be shoulder width apart I like
to<00:00:17.070> put<00:00:17.340> my<00:00:17.369> right<00:00:17.670> foot<00:00:17.940> forward<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.289> i

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
to put my right foot forward so that i

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.250 
to put my right foot forward so that i
can<00:00:19.710> either<00:00:20.250> direct<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.480> defensive<00:00:22.020> players

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
can either direct the defensive players

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.779 
can either direct the defensive players
offensive<00:00:22.859> player<00:00:23.070> where<00:00:23.340> he<00:00:23.430> wants<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> go

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
offensive player where he wants to go

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.420 
offensive player where he wants to go
and<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:25.050> can<00:00:25.289> react<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.650> little<00:00:25.680> bit<00:00:25.949> better<00:00:26.160> if

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and I can react a little bit better if

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.089 
and I can react a little bit better if
I'm<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:26.789> too<00:00:27.150> wide<00:00:27.420> if<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:28.740> shoulder

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
I'm not too wide if I'm just shoulder

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.669 
I'm not too wide if I'm just shoulder
width<00:00:29.220> apart<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.939> think<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.230> react<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
width apart I think that I can react a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.799 
width apart I think that I can react a
little<00:00:31.710> bit<00:00:31.980> easier<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:33.059> I'm<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.390> ball<00:00:33.630> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
little bit easier if I'm on the ball of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.799 
little bit easier if I'm on the ball of
my<00:00:33.840> feet<00:00:34.340> then<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.489> active<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.270> move<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.630> lot

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
my feet then I'm active I can move a lot

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.500 
my feet then I'm active I can move a lot
quicker<00:00:36.840> from<00:00:37.290> under<00:00:37.590> heels<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.010> my<00:00:38.040> foot<00:00:38.510> that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
quicker from under heels of my foot that

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.080 
quicker from under heels of my foot that
means<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.649> ball<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.309> my

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
means I have to get to the ball of my

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.330 
means I have to get to the ball of my
feet<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> then<00:00:43.079> react<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> offensive

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
feet and then react to the offensive

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.400 
feet and then react to the offensive
player<00:00:44.579> sounds<00:00:45.510> complicated<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:46.260> is

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
player sounds complicated which is

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.650 
player sounds complicated which is
probably<00:00:46.649> why<00:00:46.920> most<00:00:47.879> people<00:00:48.270> don't<00:00:48.450> want<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
probably why most people don't want to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.139 
probably why most people don't want to
play<00:00:48.809> defense<00:00:49.370> now<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.789> that

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
play defense now if I know that

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.229 
play defense now if I know that
offensive<00:00:51.600> player<00:00:51.930> cannot<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.620> right<00:00:53.239> then

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
offensive player cannot go right then

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.700 
offensive player cannot go right then
I'm<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> try<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> force<00:00:55.020> him<00:00:55.170> right<00:00:55.350> so

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
I'm going to try to force him right so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.549 
I'm going to try to force him right so
I'm<00:00:55.860> putting<00:00:56.160> my<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:56.610> foot<00:00:56.969> forward<00:00:57.559> giving

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
I'm putting my right foot forward giving

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.770 
I'm putting my right foot forward giving
him<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.609> direction<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.210> terms<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.539> where<00:01:00.690> I'm

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
him the direction in terms of where I'm

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.869 
him the direction in terms of where I'm
trying<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> force<00:01:01.350> him<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.730> forbidding<00:01:02.730> him

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
trying to force him and forbidding him

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.280 
trying to force him and forbidding him
from<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.510> way<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.719> he<00:01:04.019> probably

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
from going the way that he probably

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.160 
from going the way that he probably
wants<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.799> go<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.400> left<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:06.170> my

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
wants to go which is left now my

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.880 
wants to go which is left now my
offensive<00:01:07.979> player<00:01:08.280> wants<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.729> left<00:01:09.710> then<00:01:10.710> I

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
offensive player wants to go left then I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.649 
offensive player wants to go left then I

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.080 
am going to try to force him totally
opposite<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> where<00:01:13.290> he<00:01:13.380> wants<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.650> go<00:01:13.939> so<00:01:14.939> I'm

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
opposite of where he wants to go so I'm

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.580 
opposite of where he wants to go so I'm
a<00:01:15.150> foursome<00:01:15.630> right<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.020> want<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.409> right

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
means I have to put my left foot forward

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.280 
means I have to put my left foot forward
and<00:01:20.270> influence<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> offensive<00:01:21.750> player<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.170> go
