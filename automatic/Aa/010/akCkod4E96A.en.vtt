cost<00:01:59.549> down<00:01:59.670> below<00:01:59.939> that's<00:02:00.210> gonna<00:02:00.360> be<00:02:00.540> used<00:02:00.810> one

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
cost down below that's gonna be used one

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.660 
cost down below that's gonna be used one
thing<00:02:01.170> i<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.770> they'd<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.310> nice<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.610> have

that extra you know level of

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.780 
that extra you know level of
personalization<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:05.100> something<00:02:05.670> i'm<00:02:05.759> really

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
personalization is something i'm really

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.880 
personalization is something i'm really
looking<00:02:06.060> forward<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.750> 2014<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.469> fingers

looking forward to in 2014 and fingers
crossed<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.459> will<00:02:08.640> happen<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.270> also<00:02:10.129> you

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
crossed it it will happen and also you

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.559 
crossed it it will happen and also you
know<00:02:11.220> not<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.550> many<00:02:11.730> people<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:12.450> much

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
know not as many people have as much

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.730 
know not as many people have as much
time<00:02:12.900> as<00:02:13.200> you

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
time as you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.920

for<00:02:14.070> example<00:02:14.400> i<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.580> cuz<00:02:15.090> obviously<00:02:15.210> i<00:02:15.450> record

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
for example i do cuz obviously i record

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.780 
for example i do cuz obviously i record
videos<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> hobby<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.190> know<00:02:17.310> you're

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
videos a hobby so you know you're

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.350 
videos a hobby so you know you're
calling<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.270> 25-minute<00:02:18.870> race<00:02:19.460> 24<00:02:20.460> 25<00:02:20.940> minute

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
calling a 25-minute race 24 25 minute

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.970 
calling a 25-minute race 24 25 minute
race<00:02:21.510> 25%<00:02:22.230> race<00:02:22.320> whatever<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.680> wanna<00:02:22.800> say

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
race 25% race whatever you wanna say

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.300 
race 25% race whatever you wanna say
it's<00:02:23.430> not<00:02:23.700> too<00:02:24.090> hard<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:25.440> maybe<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:26.280> know

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
it's not too hard and but maybe you know

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.520 
it's not too hard and but maybe you know
i<00:02:26.430> think<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.760> can<00:02:26.910> do<00:02:27.000> five<00:02:27.240> lat<00:02:27.510> races<00:02:27.960> but

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
i think you can do five lat races but

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.350 
i think you can do five lat races but
also<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.980> could<00:02:29.160> possibly<00:02:29.610> have<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> fifteen

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
also you could possibly have the fifteen

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.270 
also you could possibly have the fifteen
percent<00:02:30.690> race<00:02:30.930> distance<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.620> there<00:02:31.830> because

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
percent race distance in there because

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.340 
percent race distance in there because
you<00:02:32.850> know<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.570> know<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.840> could<00:02:34.020> include

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
you know it's you know you could include

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.530 
you know it's you know you could include
one<00:02:34.590> pit<00:02:34.830> stop<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:36.330> know<00:02:36.480> i

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
one pit stop in that and you know i

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.080 
one pit stop in that and you know i
think<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.810> about<00:02:37.140> ten<00:02:38.010> laps<00:02:38.250> or<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.670> think<00:02:38.940> 15

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
think it about ten laps or so I think 15

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.710 
think it about ten laps or so I think 15
laps<00:02:39.540> sorry<00:02:40.410> 10<00:02:40.680> 10<00:02:41.670> laps<00:02:41.850> fifteen<00:02:42.540> percent

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
laps sorry 10 10 laps fifteen percent

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.690 
laps sorry 10 10 laps fifteen percent
race<00:02:42.930> distance<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.340> know<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.490> could<00:02:44.670> have

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
race distance so you know you could have

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.790 
race distance so you know you could have
pit<00:02:45.000> stop<00:02:45.210> in<00:02:45.390> there<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.350> get<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.620> all

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
pit stop in there so you get that all

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.760 
pit stop in there so you get that all
the<00:02:47.340> f1<00:02:47.640> feel<00:02:47.940> but<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.720> actual<00:02:48.870> race<00:02:49.260> distance

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
the f1 feel but in actual race distance

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.530 
the f1 feel but in actual race distance
I<00:02:49.920> don't<00:02:50.280> know<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.400> think<00:02:50.790> for<00:02:51.090> people<00:02:51.300> that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
I don't know I think for people that

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.540 
I don't know I think for people that
have<00:02:51.570> less<00:02:51.900> time<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.410> 15-percent<00:02:53.400> race

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
have less time a 15-percent race

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.970 
have less time a 15-percent race
distance<00:02:54.000> would<00:02:54.150> be<00:02:54.180> great<00:02:54.540> now<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.140> think<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
distance would be great now I think the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.770 
distance would be great now I think the
fifteen<00:02:56.490> percent<00:02:56.640> race<00:02:56.850> distance<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.390> what<00:02:57.630> is

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
fifteen percent race distance is what is

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.480 
fifteen percent race distance is what is
in<00:02:57.990> or<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.290> attempting<00:02:58.800> race<00:02:58.950> distance<00:02:59.370> is

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
in or is attempting race distance is

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.640 
in or is attempting race distance is
what<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.820> in<00:02:59.940> a<00:03:00.120> championship<00:03:00.900> edition<00:03:01.260> and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
what it's in a championship edition and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.440 
what it's in a championship edition and
that<00:03:01.680> works<00:03:02.280> out<00:03:02.430> really<00:03:02.490> well<00:03:02.760> about<00:03:03.030> six<00:03:03.090> or

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
that works out really well about six or

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.210 
that works out really well about six or
seven<00:03:03.660> laps<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.650> haven't<00:03:04.890> pitched<00:03:04.980> up

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
seven laps you know haven't pitched up

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.030 
seven laps you know haven't pitched up
in<00:03:05.340> there<00:03:05.550> it's<00:03:06.510> really<00:03:06.780> good<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:06.960> know<00:03:07.110> 55

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
in there it's really good you know 55

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.290 
in there it's really good you know 55
that<00:03:08.160> races<00:03:08.490> all<00:03:08.640> right<00:03:08.820> but<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.150> don't

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
that races all right but you don't

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.670 
that races all right but you don't
really<00:03:09.390> get<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.660> full<00:03:09.810> emotions<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.470> whole

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
really get the full emotions of a whole

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.910 
really get the full emotions of a whole
sort<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.760> race<00:03:11.970> weekend<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.720> fifteen<00:03:13.710> percent

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
sort of race weekend so fifteen percent

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.500 
sort of race weekend so fifteen percent
or<00:03:14.160> ten<00:03:14.400> percent<00:03:14.670> races<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.060> think<00:03:15.330> would<00:03:15.390> be

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
or ten percent races I think would be

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.840 
or ten percent races I think would be
great<00:03:15.920> blasters<00:03:16.920> personal<00:03:17.280> opinion<00:03:17.640> i'm<00:03:17.730> not

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
great blasters personal opinion i'm not

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.550 
great blasters personal opinion i'm not
sure<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.210> guys<00:03:18.390> think<00:03:18.630> about<00:03:18.720> there<00:03:19.020> but<00:03:19.500> you

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
sure you guys think about there but you

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.080 
sure you guys think about there but you
know<00:03:19.680> as<00:03:19.830> many<00:03:20.040> race<00:03:20.280> distance<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.940> it

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
know as many race distance is it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.510 
know as many race distance is it
possible<00:03:21.510> regrade<00:03:21.900> just<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:22.980> exactly

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
possible regrade just so you can exactly

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.730 
possible regrade just so you can exactly
race<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.030> distance<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:24.600> want<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.080> if

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
race the distance that you want to if

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.180 
race the distance that you want to if
that<00:03:26.010> makes<00:03:26.160> any<00:03:26.310> sense<00:03:26.460> whatsoever<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:29.040> last

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
that makes any sense whatsoever the last

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.410 
that makes any sense whatsoever the last
thing<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.400> obviously<00:03:29.610> want<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:29.940> talk<00:03:30.060> about<00:03:30.180> was

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
thing I obviously want to talk about was

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.440 
thing I obviously want to talk about was
the<00:03:30.600> safety<00:03:31.050> car<00:03:31.200> because<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.920> f1<00:03:32.400> 20<00:03:32.760> well<00:03:33.270> in

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
the safety car because in f1 20 well in

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.500 
the safety car because in f1 20 well in
f1<00:03:33.690> 2013<00:03:33.960> 12<00:03:34.650> 11<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.580> other<00:03:36.000> than<00:03:36.210> it<00:03:36.330> was<00:03:36.480> in

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
f1 2013 12 11 and other than it was in

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.860 
f1 2013 12 11 and other than it was in
10<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.900> don't<00:03:37.140> even<00:03:37.230> remember<00:03:37.350> now<00:03:37.740> and<00:03:38.330> but<00:03:39.330> you

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
10 I don't even remember now and but you

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.600 
10 I don't even remember now and but you
know<00:03:39.960> you<00:03:40.020> never<00:03:40.110> really<00:03:40.380> saw<00:03:40.890> the<00:03:40.920> safety<00:03:41.460> car

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
know you never really saw the safety car

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.850 
know you never really saw the safety car
unless<00:03:41.910> there's<00:03:42.210> a<00:03:42.270> massive<00:03:42.540> pileup<00:03:43.290> then

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
unless there's a massive pileup then

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.260 
unless there's a massive pileup then
half<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.160> time<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.490> goes<00:03:44.610> through<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> red<00:03:45.000> flag

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
half the time it goes through a red flag

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.170 
half the time it goes through a red flag
not<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.570> safety<00:03:45.990> car<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.490> in<00:03:47.490> my<00:03:47.820> opinion<00:03:47.880> I

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
not a safety car and in my opinion I

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.640 
not a safety car and in my opinion I
think<00:03:48.210> we<00:03:48.450> should<00:03:48.480> see<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> safety<00:03:49.170> car<00:03:49.350> out

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
think we should see the safety car out

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.320 
think we should see the safety car out
for<00:03:49.950> all<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.520> for<00:03:50.550> example<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:51.180> their

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
for all you know for example of their

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.510 
for all you know for example of their
loads<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.990> carbon<00:03:52.380> fiber<00:03:52.590> shell<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.220> all<00:03:53.280> over

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
loads of carbon fiber shell to all over

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.220 
loads of carbon fiber shell to all over
the<00:03:53.610> track<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:54.390> know<00:03:54.420> for<00:03:54.660> somebody<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.140> know

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
the track you know for somebody you know

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.780 
the track you know for somebody you know
lost<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.560> front<00:03:55.800> wing<00:03:55.980> or<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.670> know

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
lost the front wing or you know

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.310 
lost the front wing or you know
somebody's<00:03:57.330> driven<00:03:57.660> over<00:03:57.750> their<00:03:57.960> front<00:03:58.170> wing

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
somebody's driven over their front wing

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.460 
somebody's driven over their front wing
or<00:03:58.440> something<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:59.150> think<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.290> need

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
or something I think that you you need

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.750 
or something I think that you you need
to<00:04:01.590> have<00:04:01.650> safety<00:04:02.040> cars<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.370> stuff<00:04:02.550> like<00:04:02.730> that

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
to have safety cars of stuff like that

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.490 
to have safety cars of stuff like that
or<00:04:03.000> maybe<00:04:03.180> have<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.510> option<00:04:03.900> for<00:04:04.050> a<00:04:04.080> realistic

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
or maybe have the option for a realistic

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.680 
or maybe have the option for a realistic
safety<00:04:05.040> car<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.430> then<00:04:05.820> just<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.120> normal<00:04:06.330> safety

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
safety car and then just a normal safety

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.870 
safety car and then just a normal safety
car<00:04:07.020> I<00:04:07.230> think<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:07.860> would<00:04:08.040> be<00:04:08.130> really<00:04:08.160> good<00:04:08.610> so

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
car I think that would be really good so

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.460 
car I think that would be really good so
we<00:04:09.000> could<00:04:09.150> have<00:04:09.300> you<00:04:09.720> know<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> bit<00:04:10.110> more<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.320> a

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
we could have you know a bit more of a

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.890 
we could have you know a bit more of a
realistic<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.430> sort<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.180> situation<00:04:12.720> in<00:04:12.840> the

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
realistic and sort of situation in the

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.300 
realistic and sort of situation in the
race<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.170> know<00:04:13.200> if<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.470> dive<00:04:13.800> bombing<00:04:14.070> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
race you know if you dive bombing to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.710 
race you know if you dive bombing to
turn<00:04:14.490> one<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:14.730> take<00:04:15.000> off<00:04:15.150> your<00:04:15.180> front<00:04:15.510> wing

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
turn one and take off your front wing

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.420 
turn one and take off your front wing
there<00:04:16.230> should<00:04:16.440> be<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.560> safety<00:04:16.859> car<00:04:17.160> for<00:04:17.310> that

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
there should be a safety car for that

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.220 
there should be a safety car for that
because<00:04:17.549> this<00:04:17.760> carbon<00:04:18.150> fiber<00:04:18.359> all<00:04:18.720> over<00:04:19.109> the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
because this carbon fiber all over the

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.840 
because this carbon fiber all over the
track<00:04:19.470> people<00:04:20.190> are<00:04:20.280> gonna<00:04:20.370> get<00:04:20.580> you<00:04:20.790> know

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
track people are gonna get you know

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.979 
track people are gonna get you know
punctures<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.420> all<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.690> sort<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:21.930> stuff

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
punctures and all that sort of stuff

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.350 
punctures and all that sort of stuff
from<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.860> know<00:04:22.950> huge<00:04:23.160> rock<00:04:23.400> on<00:04:23.640> five<00:04:23.940> all<00:04:24.150> over

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
from you know huge rock on five all over

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.750 
from you know huge rock on five all over
the<00:04:24.450> place<00:04:24.660> so<00:04:24.900> in<00:04:25.200> my<00:04:25.620> opinion<00:04:25.710> safety<00:04:26.460> car<00:04:26.640> at

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
the place so in my opinion safety car at

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.160 
the place so in my opinion safety car at
least

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
least

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.870 
least
be<00:04:27.290> some<00:04:27.470> sort<00:04:27.560> of<00:04:27.680> realistic<00:04:28.040> option<00:04:28.640> in<00:04:28.730> that

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
be some sort of realistic option in that

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.460 
be some sort of realistic option in that
now<00:04:29.060> it's<00:04:29.600> been<00:04:29.780> alright<00:04:29.930> for<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.350> last

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
now it's been alright for the last

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.960 
now it's been alright for the last
couple<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.830> years<00:04:30.890> but<00:04:31.310> I<00:04:31.370> want<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.730> see<00:04:31.880> it

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
couple of years but I want to see it

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.240 
couple of years but I want to see it
more<00:04:32.150> especially<00:04:32.600> in<00:04:32.870> career<00:04:33.170> mode<00:04:33.230> and<00:04:33.620> you

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
more especially in career mode and you

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.230 
more especially in career mode and you
know<00:04:34.340> especially<00:04:34.550> one<00:04:34.940> hundred<00:04:35.210> percent

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
know especially one hundred percent

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.640 
know especially one hundred percent
races<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.840> think<00:04:36.020> I've<00:04:36.140> done<00:04:36.230> a<00:04:36.290> couple<00:04:36.350> of

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
races I think I've done a couple of

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.350 
races I think I've done a couple of
hundred<00:04:36.890> percent<00:04:37.100> races<00:04:37.400> where<00:04:37.610> people<00:04:38.240> have

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
hundred percent races where people have

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.120 
hundred percent races where people have
crashed<00:04:38.660> but<00:04:38.930> there's<00:04:39.050> been<00:04:39.170> no<00:04:39.230> safety<00:04:39.920> car

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
crashed but there's been no safety car
