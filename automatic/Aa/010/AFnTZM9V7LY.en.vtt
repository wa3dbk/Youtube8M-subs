00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.270
 and nobody has to comply that in the 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:10.030
 video and it's that mexicas I'm going to london 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.130
 in summer with my boyfriend and how we do in 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.080
 the frikis of harry potter is mime 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.810
 free how good I am the fairies but 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.610
 come to harry potter fives all your 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.869
 books of my two thousand times of the movies 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.880
 up and not whole 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.640
 I have taken these two necklaces by ebay 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.560
 since if it went there our paper and less 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.660
 easy to buy and they really would not be 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.309
 cheap so I came up by ebay and 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.890
 well this is the necklace of the seeds 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:34.719
 in Mr. Six's death are three 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.480
 outside although I will not like harry potter 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.190
 the necklace itself is cool and then I fucked 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.150
 a tour time if this you have to know 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.930
 which is although we like to satisfy 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:50.060
 because it is very nice and good cognac to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:55.010
 see if everyone is like that 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.620
 you see and inside it has a big sand lot 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.940
 It's worth English in the movie because it was used 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.040
 to travel in time and according to 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.840
 fruits that you want of hours and days 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.480
 because it travels more clearly than with this the 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.340
 time travel hopefully but good 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.460
 I really like lara is that it is very nice 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.290
 and that's me too and these two things for not 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.810
 have them and choose there and it will be very 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.370
 mineral because it knows me good has been 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.680
 the medieval market in my city and I 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.410
 I always go and in this year I have taken this 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.920
 wallet is nothing princess on a moon 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:30.229
 and I love superfinas and rosita and 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.580
 good on the inside is blue from the dni and I do not 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.070
 they like a lot they also have to put 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.630
 coins right now is empty due to 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.130
 all this that I have bought more is 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.530
 super practice opinion led bags are 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.940
 very small, relatively small 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.940
 sharing people 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:58.340
 very much I have a lot of butterflies 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:03.020
 flowers that give a very much touch but 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.020
 I have picked two forks of fries 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.350
 but well this cost me two euros but 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.380
 it cost three companies two and the portfolio 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.340
 I liked it with serums 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.200
 possibly they take me to your city 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.740
 is the same 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.380
 things are there a part below 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.320
 bikini since you can not find it from 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.710
 vermilion that I have and this was super 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.610
 cheap on several of the 299 casualties and it's 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.130
 castilla that is stuck and good is like this 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.160
 but it's not the same shade of red happens is 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.650
 a sub tone lower than the tone of milk 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.180
 and so it does not look good and our 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.950
 task did not find the damn tone of 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.690
 milk and nor anywhere do I have a 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.400
 part of the hand and another red and have not 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.500
 been eaten neither of the two because 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.300
 it's not exactly in tone then I'm 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.550
 desperate looking in all areas 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.770
 and there is no part in me in search 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.570
 of the big and micro trusts that celis that not 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.570
 they were average Peronist 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.660
 I like a bear eating heap 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.660
 they were on offer and controls 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.730
 but with euro allies pretty much 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.270
 then I liked them very much they are very 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.610
 cheap that yes they are dark because only 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.590
 there were two shades and a uppercase comunera 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.360
 but good if you travel and you put a little 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.280
 more than the expose mine line follows 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.069
 cool or you have the skin one more tone 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.450
 dark that I then use eating 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.950
 very cheap and the truth is that of 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.930
 quality are pretty good 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.090
 there have also been new books this month 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.099
 it is requested of dolphins that have 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.769
 gifted with the purchase of books 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.090
 has the design of Madame Butterfly is 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.920
 a new book that has taken from techniques 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.000
 illustrations that I do not want to buy this 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.040
 is the previous book they have taken to 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.380
 animated in butterfly and the Andean Serbian 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.660
 is a nymph of the forests and is a 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.330
 lovely book we teach a little bit 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.790
 because that knows a lot when they say something 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.470
 Copita and we are leaving is gorgeous 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.690
 As you can see, everything is full of 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.670
 illustrations and pretty letter retina 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.549
 those of illustrations we in being common 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.770
 that has a lot of lyrics but this is 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.760
 latina so it's 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.769
 and look at the leaves of the sea 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.769
 and bankruptcy 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.880
 I like very much I love these 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.340
 books are my favorite books apart 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.440
 of the normal novels but those of 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.990
 illustrations I have a weakness for 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.470
 them amazing this is a channel this 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.810
 costs costs 17 euros yes exactly 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.889
 I think so 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.800
 yes 17 euros needed low but good 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.139
 those are the ones who deserve it the transas 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.639
 useful are great I also come this 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.200

 a recipe book and good are recipes 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.460
 of fairy tales because for example 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.370

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.740
