I<00:00:16.580> can<00:00:21.470> all<00:00:22.470> right<00:00:22.529> there<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:24.619> and<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> nice

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
I can all right there we go and the nice

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.890 
I can all right there we go and the nice
thing<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> jessup<00:00:27.300> grip<00:00:27.480> tape<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
thing this is a jessup grip tape the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.240 
thing this is a jessup grip tape the
nice<00:00:28.050> thing<00:00:28.199> about<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.890> actually<00:00:29.010> has

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
nice thing about this is it actually has

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.910 
nice thing about this is it actually has
little<00:00:29.490> perforated<00:00:30.300> holes<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.710> that

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
little perforated holes in it so that

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.319 
little perforated holes in it so that
you<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.250> kind<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.489> press<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> air<00:00:33.000> bubbles

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
you can kind of press the air bubbles

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.780 
you can kind of press the air bubbles
out<00:00:33.420> instead<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.809> cutting<00:00:34.050> them<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.790> razor

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
out instead of cutting them with a razor

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.069 
out instead of cutting them with a razor
but<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:38.100> we're<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.540> line<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
but so what we're going to do is line it

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.100 
but so what we're going to do is line it
up<00:00:41.030> try<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> keep<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.540> symmetrical<00:00:43.050> as

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
up try to keep it as symmetrical as

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.590 
up try to keep it as symmetrical as
possible<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.280> either<00:00:44.489> side<00:00:48.530> is<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.800> hard<00:00:50.039> part

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
possible on either side is the hard part

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.350 
possible on either side is the hard part
there<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.719> go<00:00:54.559> alright<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> just

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
there we go alright so and then you just

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
there we go alright so and then you just
drop<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> board<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.920> says

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
drop it on and on a board like this says

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.229 
drop it on and on a board like this says
the<00:00:59.609> W<00:01:00.090> concave<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:00.989> bit

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
the W concave so it's a little bit

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
the W concave so it's a little bit
harder<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> get<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.660> pressed<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.650> without<00:01:05.010> any

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
harder to get it pressed out without any

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.340 
harder to get it pressed out without any
bubbles<00:01:05.610> usually<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> weird<00:01:07.170> but

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
bubbles usually and this is weird but

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.870 
bubbles usually and this is weird but
what<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.920> actually<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.280> Pat<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
what I do is I actually just Pat it and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:27.100 
what I do is I actually just Pat it and
that<00:01:09.119> kind<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.390> forces<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.110> air<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.160 

so<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.229> we've<00:01:28.439> got<00:01:28.590> most<00:01:29.479> all<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.840> vocals

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
so now we've got most all of the vocals

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.059 
so now we've got most all of the vocals
out<00:01:31.700> what<00:01:32.700> uh<00:01:32.729> what<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.719> tend<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.890> make

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
out what uh what I tend to do just make

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.249 
out what uh what I tend to do just make
it<00:01:35.219> easier<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.209> actually<00:01:36.479> cut<00:01:36.840> some<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it easier is I actually cut some of the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.990 
it easier is I actually cut some of the
points<00:01:37.439> where<00:01:37.679> the<00:01:37.740> grip<00:01:38.009> tape<00:01:38.219> finds<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:39.860> and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
points where the grip tape finds up and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:55.429 
points where the grip tape finds up and
this<00:01:42.000> will<00:01:42.149> make<00:01:42.240> sense<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.719> second<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:55.380> I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
this will make sense in a second but I

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.839 
this will make sense in a second but I
should<00:01:55.709> know<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.130> isn't<00:01:56.429> completely

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
should know this isn't completely

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.800 
should know this isn't completely
necessary<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:58.280> then<00:01:59.299> you<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.420> take<00:02:00.599> like<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
necessary and then you just take like a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.300 
necessary and then you just take like a
screwdriver<00:02:01.289> in<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.770> case<00:02:01.950> we've<00:02:02.130> got<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
screwdriver in this case we've got a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.089 
screwdriver in this case we've got a
little<00:02:02.489> bolt<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:04.560> kind<00:02:04.739> of<00:02:04.829> go<00:02:04.979> along

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
little bolt and just kind of go along

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:06.949 
little bolt and just kind of go along
the<00:02:05.340> edge<00:02:05.429> of<00:02:05.459> the<00:02:05.640> board<00:02:05.789> rough<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.509> out<00:02:06.599> and

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
the edge of the board rough it out and

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.759 
the edge of the board rough it out and
that<00:02:07.229> gives<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.560> good<00:02:07.709> line<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.099> cut<00:02:08.280> off

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
that gives you a good line to cut off

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.140 
that gives you a good line to cut off
and<00:02:10.769> that's<00:02:11.069> why<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> cut<00:02:11.519> this<00:02:11.670> here<00:02:11.970> because

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and that's why I cut this here because

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.720 
and that's why I cut this here because
normally<00:02:12.540> when<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:12.750> go<00:02:12.870> around<00:02:13.019> it<00:02:13.560> would

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
normally when you go around it would

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.850 
normally when you go around it would
make<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.970> grip<00:02:15.510> pop<00:02:15.780> up<00:02:16.049> but<00:02:16.290> with<00:02:16.440> these<00:02:16.560> cuts

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
make the grip pop up but with these cuts

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:38.979 
make the grip pop up but with these cuts
it<00:02:17.129> just<00:02:17.310> stays<00:02:17.700> down<00:02:17.970> nice<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.239> flat

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.229 

alrighty<00:02:40.069> so<00:02:41.069> now<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.250> got<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.639> done<00:02:41.910> you

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
alrighty so now you got that done you

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.210 
alrighty so now you got that done you
should<00:02:42.600> have<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.989> nice<00:02:43.139> outline<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.709> your<00:02:43.889> board

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
should have a nice outline of your board

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.030 
should have a nice outline of your board
under<00:02:44.579> the<00:02:44.700> grip<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:46.079> I<00:02:46.139> just<00:02:46.349> like<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.859> pull

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
under the grip so I just like to pull

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.900 
under the grip so I just like to pull
everything<00:02:47.250> up<00:02:47.489> get<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.880> ready<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.859> then<00:02:49.910> just

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
start going around the edge so there's

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.390 
start going around the edge so there's
really<00:02:58.019> no<00:02:58.230> good<00:02:58.560> place<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:59.130> start<00:03:01.400> let's

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
really no good place to start let's

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
really no good place to start let's
start<00:03:02.489> right<00:03:02.819> here<00:03:02.880> hello<00:03:03.239> that

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.630 

look

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:22.980 

should<00:03:12.330> pick<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.690> fresh<00:03:12.960> razor

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.970 

when<00:03:23.990> you're<00:03:24.110> doing<00:03:24.350> this<00:03:24.470> make<00:03:24.680> sure<00:03:24.890> you

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
when you're doing this make sure you

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.580 
when you're doing this make sure you
don't<00:03:25.270> edge<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.660> razor<00:03:26.840> in<00:03:27.110> towards<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
don't edge the razor in towards the

don't edge the razor in towards the
board<00:03:27.860> like<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.070> because<00:03:28.460> then<00:03:28.640> you'll<00:03:28.790> end

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
board like this because then you'll end

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.370 
board like this because then you'll end
up<00:03:29.030> actually<00:03:29.270> pulling<00:03:29.690> off<00:03:29.930> some<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.230> the
