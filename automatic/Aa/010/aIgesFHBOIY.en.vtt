00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
paying attention you realize that that

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.420 
paying attention you realize that that
is<00:00:21.330> highly<00:00:21.990> unusual<00:00:22.140> because<00:00:22.859> these<00:00:23.189> aren't

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
prototypes and it's really rare that we

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.939 
prototypes and it's really rare that we
get<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> drive<00:00:27.480> something<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.410> for

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
get to drive something like this but for

get to drive something like this but for
just<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.250> little<00:00:29.429> while<00:00:29.550> we're<00:00:29.910> turning<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
just a little while we're turning a

to<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> sense<00:00:32.399> for<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> v6<00:00:32.880> car<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.510> right

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
to get a sense for the v6 car and right

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.410 
to get a sense for the v6 car and right
now<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:33.930> driving<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.440> six-speed<00:00:34.950> manual

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
now I'm driving the six-speed manual

Chevrolet says that the new Camaro is
significantly<00:00:38.730> stiffer<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.629> gotta<00:00:39.960> say<00:00:40.230> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
significantly stiffer and I gotta say I

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.619 
significantly stiffer and I gotta say I
really<00:00:40.680> really<00:00:41.670> feel<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.910> while<00:00:42.420> we're

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
really really feel that while we're

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.880 
really really feel that while we're
cornering<00:00:43.050> another<00:00:43.290> thing<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890

point<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.820> steering<00:00:45.270> feels

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
point out is that the steering feels

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.740 
point out is that the steering feels
much<00:00:45.989> much<00:00:46.440> better<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.550> new<00:00:47.670> 2016<00:00:48.360> model

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
much much better in the new 2016 model

much much better in the new 2016 model
now<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.320> car<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.559> gonna<00:00:49.649> go<00:00:49.739> through<00:00:50.070> quite<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
now this car is gonna go through quite a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.580 
now this car is gonna go through quite a
bit<00:00:50.489> before<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.850> reaches<00:00:51.090> showrooms<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.960> it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
bit before it reaches showrooms but it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.700 
bit before it reaches showrooms but it
feels<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.550> very<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.360> finished<00:00:55.020> product

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
pretty good and it's an easy

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.350 
pretty good and it's an easy
transmission<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> deal<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:08.970> the

transmission to deal with if not the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.850 
transmission to deal with if not the
most<00:01:09.570> sophisticated<00:01:09.750> thing<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.710> could

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
most sophisticated thing you could

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.820 
most sophisticated thing you could
possibly<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> v6<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.350> new<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
possibly have so the v6 is all new it

thing<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.330> that's<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:21.869> terribly<00:01:22.229> far

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
thing is that's really not terribly far

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.469 
thing is that's really not terribly far
off<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:22.979> v8<00:01:23.310> power<00:01:23.549> was<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.299> the
