don't have that fan base first of all

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.350 
don't have that fan base first of all
for<00:01:16.920> now<00:01:17.100> which<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.670> think<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.180> now

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
for now which I don't think and now

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.090 
for now which I don't think and now
we're<00:01:18.600> kind<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.020> weird<00:01:19.229> spot<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
we're kind of in this weird spot that I

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.730 
we're kind of in this weird spot that I
think<00:01:20.790> podcasts<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.869> general<00:01:22.259> people<00:01:22.409> listen

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
think podcasts in general people listen

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.070 
think podcasts in general people listen
to<00:01:22.770> podcasts<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.759> should<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.420> mp3s

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
to podcasts the way you should with mp3s

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.320 
to podcasts the way you should with mp3s
on<00:01:25.710> iTunes<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.430> skews<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> little<00:01:26.909> bit<00:01:27.000> older

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
on iTunes it's skews a little bit older

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
on iTunes it's skews a little bit older
YouTube<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> younger<00:01:28.259> audience<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.340> what

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
YouTube is a younger audience so what

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700 
YouTube is a younger audience so what
can<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.240> sort<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.509> satisfy<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.380> guess

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
can we do to sort of satisfy I guess

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.370 
can we do to sort of satisfy I guess
that<00:01:32.280> audience<00:01:32.790> versus<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> older<00:01:34.110> or<00:01:34.229> maybe

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that audience versus the older or maybe
