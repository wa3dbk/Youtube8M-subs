00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
everywhere but I did a video on rosehips

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.539 
everywhere but I did a video on rosehips
recently<00:02:45.579> a<00:02:45.790> couple<00:02:46.299> videos<00:02:46.540> back<00:02:47.019> and

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
recently a couple videos back and

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.160 
recently a couple videos back and
actually<00:02:48.549> put<00:02:48.879> rose<00:02:49.060> hips<00:02:49.359> inside<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:49.959> to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
actually put rose hips inside this to

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.830 
actually put rose hips inside this to
see<00:02:50.319> how<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.560> would<00:02:50.680> do<00:02:50.829> filled<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.849> full<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
see how it would do filled it full and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.569 
see how it would do filled it full and
just<00:02:53.079> come<00:02:53.230> took<00:02:53.409> my<00:02:53.530> finger<00:02:53.829> and<00:02:53.920> smash<00:02:54.310> them

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579

just come took my finger and smash them
a<00:02:54.670> little<00:02:54.909> bit<00:02:55.060> inside<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.780> ball<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.950> put<00:02:57.730> it

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
a little bit inside the ball and put it

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.660 
a little bit inside the ball and put it
together<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.239> put<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:58.629> my<00:02:58.659> mic<00:02:59.530> up<00:02:59.859> let<00:03:00.190> it

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670

for if you're interested it's a
multi-functional<00:03:12.730> item<00:03:13.090> you'd<00:03:13.629> actually<00:03:13.780> use

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
multi-functional item you'd actually use

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.250 
multi-functional item you'd actually use
it<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.230> strain<00:03:14.709> with<00:03:15.040> if<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.430> needed<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:16.260> use

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
it to strain with if you needed to use

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.089 
it to strain with if you needed to use
it<00:03:17.409> as<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.530> strainer<00:03:17.889> you<00:03:19.709> can<00:03:20.709> see<00:03:20.859> it's<00:03:20.980> got

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
it as a strainer you can see it's got

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.770 
it as a strainer you can see it's got
holes<00:03:21.280> perforated<00:03:22.000> on<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.269> bottom<00:03:22.629> and<00:03:22.720> the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
holes perforated on the bottom and the

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.339 
holes perforated on the bottom and the
top<00:03:24.180> also<00:03:25.180> thought<00:03:25.329> about<00:03:25.540> using<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:26.139> for<00:03:26.319> a

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
top also thought about using it for a

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.110 
top also thought about using it for a
cold<00:03:27.269> put<00:03:28.269> some<00:03:28.480> like<00:03:29.019> a<00:03:29.049> coal<00:03:29.349> in<00:03:29.620> there<00:03:30.120> with

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
cold put some like a coal in there with

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.390 
cold put some like a coal in there with
some<00:03:31.329> punky<00:03:31.720> wood<00:03:31.900> or<00:03:32.139> something<00:03:32.410> hang<00:03:33.220> this

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
some punky wood or something hang this

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.939 
some punky wood or something hang this
off<00:03:33.639> a<00:03:34.150> stick<00:03:34.750> or<00:03:35.049> something<00:03:35.230> like<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.680> or

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
off a stick or something like that or

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.819 
off a stick or something like that or
off<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.209> side<00:03:37.449> and<00:03:37.720> may<00:03:38.079> be<00:03:38.139> able<00:03:38.319> to<00:03:38.500> carry<00:03:38.709> an

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
off the side and may be able to carry an

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.770 
off the side and may be able to carry an
ember<00:03:39.099> in<00:03:39.129> it<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.489> haven't<00:03:39.760> tried<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.030> yet<00:03:40.269> so

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
ember in it I haven't tried that yet so

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.809 
ember in it I haven't tried that yet so
I'm<00:03:40.930> not<00:03:40.959> exactly<00:03:41.590> sure<00:03:42.010> if<00:03:42.340> it'll<00:03:42.489> work<00:03:42.669> or

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
I'm not exactly sure if it'll work or

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.830 
I'm not exactly sure if it'll work or
not<00:03:43.000> this<00:03:43.599> came<00:03:43.870> from<00:03:43.989> Walmart<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:46.150> think<00:03:46.750> it

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
not this came from Walmart I think it

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.400 
not this came from Walmart I think it
was<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:46.989> dollar<00:03:47.290> 25<00:03:48.190> it's<00:03:48.519> stainless<00:03:48.790> steel

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
was a dollar 25 it's stainless steel

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.439 
was a dollar 25 it's stainless steel
which<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.530> like<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.949> fact<00:03:51.310> they<00:03:51.940> make<00:03:52.120> another

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
which I like that fact they make another

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.990 
which I like that fact they make another
one<00:03:52.720> that's<00:03:52.840> like<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.190> basket<00:03:54.190> a<00:03:54.220> little<00:03:54.310> basket

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
one that's like a basket a little basket

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.119 
one that's like a basket a little basket
about<00:03:55.180> this<00:03:55.389> size<00:03:55.599> that<00:03:55.930> would<00:03:56.379> work<00:03:56.560> just<00:03:56.620> as

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
about this size that would work just as

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.610 
about this size that would work just as
well<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:57.699> just<00:03:58.060> like<00:03:58.419> this<00:03:58.629> heavier-duty<00:03:59.049> thing

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
well I just like this heavier-duty thing

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.409 
well I just like this heavier-duty thing
