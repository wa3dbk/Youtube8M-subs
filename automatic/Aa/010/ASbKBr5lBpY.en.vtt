00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.379 
the movies inspired a little bit drama
the<00:00:10.740> book<00:00:10.889> Chetan<00:00:11.250> Bhagat<00:00:11.370> spoke<00:00:11.730> up<00:00:11.940> but

the book Chetan Bhagat spoke up but

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.419 
the book Chetan Bhagat spoke up but
three<00:00:12.690> points<00:00:12.929> someone<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.380> true<00:00:13.590> yes<00:00:14.219> I

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
three points someone is that true yes I

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.310 
three points someone is that true yes I
suppose<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.969> was<00:00:15.179> like<00:00:15.389> 100<00:00:15.719> points<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.170> yeah

suppose I was like 100 points on yeah

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.800 
suppose I was like 100 points on yeah
yeah<00:00:16.680> actually<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.220> think<00:00:17.340> it<00:00:17.850> started<00:00:18.510> from

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
yeah actually I think it started from

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.050 
yeah actually I think it started from
that<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.320> think<00:00:20.010> Jathan<00:00:20.310> came<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> book<00:00:20.910> to

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
that I think Jathan came to the book to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.570 
that I think Jathan came to the book to
raju<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.800> suggested<00:00:22.800> that<00:00:22.920> he<00:00:23.039> make<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.369> film

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
raju and suggested that he make the film

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.710 
raju and suggested that he make the film
and<00:00:24.590> then<00:00:25.590> Raju<00:00:25.980> set<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.609> adapted<00:00:27.449> into<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and then Raju set out to adapted into a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.160 
and then Raju set out to adapted into a
film<00:00:28.519> but<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:29.730> he<00:00:29.910> began<00:00:30.359> working<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.019> with

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
film but as he began working on it with

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.740 
film but as he began working on it with
a<00:00:31.199> B<00:00:31.349> chart<00:00:32.030> they<00:00:33.030> realized<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.480> they're

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
a B chart they realized that they're

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.840 
a B chart they realized that they're
actually<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> process<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.399> writing<00:00:35.579> it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
actually in the process of writing it

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.819 
actually in the process of writing it
they're<00:00:36.030> moving<00:00:36.300> away<00:00:36.390> from<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> book<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.200> lot

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
they're moving away from the book a lot

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.000 
they're moving away from the book a lot
so<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> original<00:00:38.879> thought<00:00:39.059> was<00:00:39.890> from<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so the original thought was from the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.190 
so the original thought was from the
book<00:00:41.129> okay<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.780> eventually

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
book okay but I think if eventually

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.630 
book okay but I think if eventually
turned<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.800> quite<00:00:43.890> different<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.460> have

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
turned out quite different I have

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.830 
turned out quite different I have
another<00:00:44.940> book<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.360> can't<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.629> sure

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
another book so I can't be sure

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.799 
another book so I can't be sure
okay<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.800> what<00:00:46.950> both<00:00:47.129> Raju<00:00:47.550> and

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
okay but this is what both Raju and

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.299

one and when I first joined the
television<00:03:40.660> industry<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:42.250> assume<00:03:42.549> that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
television industry so to assume that

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.009 
television industry so to assume that
this<00:03:42.850> will<00:03:43.000> become<00:03:43.239> my<00:03:43.359> career<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.780> drop

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
this will become my career and drop

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.360 
this will become my career and drop
everything<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.560> carry<00:03:44.799> on<00:03:44.980> with<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.220> will

everything and carry on with it will

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.340 
everything and carry on with it will
probably<00:03:45.609> be<00:03:45.850> by<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.060> most<00:03:46.299> idiotic<00:03:46.870> decision

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
probably be by the most idiotic decision

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.099 
probably be by the most idiotic decision
and<00:03:47.829> not<00:03:48.820> get<00:03:49.030> pressurised<00:03:49.510> by<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.720> fact<00:03:50.019> that
