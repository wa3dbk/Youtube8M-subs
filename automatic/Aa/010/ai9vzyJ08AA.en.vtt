00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello and welcome to a new 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.370
 video of tom van phuc 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.990
 today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.080
 how to make a shark like this 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.860
 for that you need a sheet 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.860
 started to make a similar 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:43.960
 see stamps said to have turned around 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:53.690
 the next exit 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:56.360
 then the gianni bugno side makes a 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.809
 foot and actually exactly major on the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.809
 case hoods 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:23.380
 then the conflicts now I have the 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:30.630
 rabattre did well on the line 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:41.800
 scratch now favorable like that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:45.070
 ask there and when things and then 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:53.080
 you have down this side on the country 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:55.360
 which he is the target 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:02.350
 and there he did not do the same thing 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:05.260
 went well like that then recalled his 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.030
 arguments are mischievous mathieu small 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:13.450
 side by us cost 7 points here in 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.100
 the league 1 lineup turned the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.330
 leaf is not a thing to me anymore 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:21.870
 big not totally half but 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.870
 almost half 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.940
 then you will see 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:43.270
 scratch that side on the limit here by 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.270
 right here 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.080
 this is how it is 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.360
 then you will make imaginary 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.360
 beam here and there to loot 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:11.030
 I know I'm going to attack 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:16.969
 then you go slightly like that 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:23.269
 get your mouth wet this side finally 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:23.269
 this little this little bit there like that 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:33.530
 something on their side and to finish it you 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.629
 have more than a queue you reopen 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.670
 you put like that so that 's going to do 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:44.160
 all right unfortunately seldom you 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:51.110
 charge the environment at 85 degrees to 45 degrees 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:53.879
 2 Here it will offer our sharks 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.140
 now if you want to subscribe to 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.840
 my chain will put you green thumbs 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.049
 could do it because otherwise and at 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.049
 meet again
