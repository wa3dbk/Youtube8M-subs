look<00:01:05.510> at<00:01:05.630> ajasa<00:01:05.930> if<00:01:06.560> you're<00:01:06.800> not<00:01:07.010> familiar

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
look at ajasa if you're not familiar

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.440 
look at ajasa if you're not familiar
with<00:01:07.640> Cocozza<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:09.520> suppose<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:11.000> could<00:01:11.180> think

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
with Cocozza I suppose you could think

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.200 
with Cocozza I suppose you could think
of<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:11.750> kind<00:01:12.050> of<00:01:12.229> like<00:01:12.500> just<00:01:12.890> a<00:01:13.010> white<00:01:13.310> rum<00:01:13.909> but

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
of it kind of like just a white rum but

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.999 
of it kind of like just a white rum but
yeah<00:01:14.510> that's<00:01:14.960> still<00:01:15.200> not<00:01:15.380> quite<00:01:15.530> right

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
yeah that's still not quite right

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.469 
yeah that's still not quite right
rum<00:01:16.610> is<00:01:16.970> made<00:01:17.030> from<00:01:17.690> molasses<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:19.180> Cocozza

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
rum is made from molasses and Cocozza

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.870 
rum is made from molasses and Cocozza
is<00:01:20.690> made<00:01:21.080> from<00:01:21.440> sugarcane<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:22.610> take<00:01:22.790> the

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
is made from sugarcane you take the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.540 
is made from sugarcane you take the
sugarcane<00:01:23.180> juice<00:01:23.470> you<00:01:24.470> for<00:01:24.680> a<00:01:24.710> minute<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.490> you

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
sugarcane juice you for a minute and you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.880 
sugarcane juice you for a minute and you
turn<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.000> into<00:01:26.060> ketosis<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.350> it's<00:01:27.500> not<00:01:27.650> quite

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
turn that into ketosis so it's not quite

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.350 
turn that into ketosis so it's not quite
the<00:01:28.009> same<00:01:28.190> thing<00:01:28.400> as<00:01:28.520> rum<00:01:28.700> but<00:01:28.880> they<00:01:28.970> kind<00:01:29.240> of

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
the same thing as rum but they kind of

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.270 
the same thing as rum but they kind of
had<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.050> same<00:01:30.259> parentage<00:01:30.710> does<00:01:31.009> that<00:01:31.130> make

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
had the same parentage does that make

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.700 
had the same parentage does that make
sense<00:01:31.520> well<00:01:31.970> so<00:01:32.810> let's<00:01:32.960> get<00:01:33.080> on<00:01:33.200> with<00:01:33.229> this
