differences<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.750> depth<00:00:37.130> this<00:00:38.130> produces<00:00:38.610> a

differences as depth this produces a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.480

or<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.990> stereoscopic<00:00:46.980> vision<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.550> very

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
or a stereoscopic vision is very

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.290 
or a stereoscopic vision is very
important<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.840> our<00:00:48.930> lives<00:00:49.280> with<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:51.060> see

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
important in our lives with it we see

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.120 
important in our lives with it we see
exactly<00:00:51.660> where<00:00:51.960> things<00:00:52.230> are<00:00:52.470> placed<00:00:52.650> around

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
exactly where things are placed around

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.510 
exactly where things are placed around
us

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
us

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.260 
us
usually<00:00:54.270> with<00:00:54.570> considerable<00:00:55.230> accuracy<00:00:56.270> we

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
usually with considerable accuracy we

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.300 
usually with considerable accuracy we
are<00:00:57.420> particularly<00:00:57.930> good<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.740> observing

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
are particularly good at observing

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.460 
are particularly good at observing
objects<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.360> moving<00:01:00.600> towards<00:01:01.200> or<00:01:01.410> away

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
objects that are moving towards or away

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
objects that are moving towards or away
from<00:01:01.860> us

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
from us

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.960 
from us
therefore<00:01:03.710> stereoscopic<00:01:04.710> vision<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.369> very

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
therefore stereoscopic vision is a very

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.960 
therefore stereoscopic vision is a very
important<00:01:06.600> survival<00:01:06.930> mechanism<00:01:07.970> certainly

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
important survival mechanism certainly

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
important survival mechanism certainly
still<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> scopic<00:01:09.780> vision<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.350> vital<00:01:10.830> for

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
still the scopic vision is vital for

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.580 
still the scopic vision is vital for
simple<00:01:11.460> tivities<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.210> throwing<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.080> ball<00:01:13.290> or

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
simple tivities like throwing a ball or

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.090 
simple tivities like throwing a ball or
driving<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.490> car<00:01:15.050> this<00:01:16.050> test<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.680> also<00:01:16.860> be

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
driving a car this test can also be

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.370 
driving a car this test can also be
accomplished<00:01:17.580> without<00:01:17.760> 3d<00:01:18.390> vision<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
accomplished without 3d vision but the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.500 
accomplished without 3d vision but the
lack<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.620> this<00:01:19.920> perception<00:01:20.340> makes<00:01:20.820> everyday

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
lack of this perception makes everyday

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.560 
lack of this perception makes everyday
activities<00:01:22.140> much<00:01:22.530> more<00:01:22.830> complex<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
activities much more complex so the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.630 
activities much more complex so the
first<00:01:24.990> step<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.320> reproduce<00:01:25.980> the<00:01:26.159> stereoscopic

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
first step to reproduce the stereoscopic

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.180 
first step to reproduce the stereoscopic
images<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.960> capture<00:01:28.200> two<00:01:28.590> images<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
images is to capture two images of the

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.250 
images is to capture two images of the
same<00:01:29.370> subject<00:01:30.150> from<00:01:30.600> slightly<00:01:31.050> different

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
same subject from slightly different

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.220 
same subject from slightly different
points<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.040> view<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:33.090> same<00:01:33.390> way<00:01:33.659> our<00:01:33.900> eyes

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
points of view the same way our eyes

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.160 
points of view the same way our eyes
work<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.580> second<00:01:36.030> step<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.510> display<00:01:36.990> these

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
work the second step is to display these

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.860 
work the second step is to display these
images<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:38.670> when<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.060> must<00:01:39.240> ensure<00:01:39.450> that

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
images that's when we must ensure that

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.520 
images that's when we must ensure that
each<00:01:40.380> eye<00:01:40.710> see<00:01:41.159> only<00:01:41.340> its<00:01:41.729> image<00:01:42.409> there<00:01:43.409> are

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
each eye see only its image there are

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.230 
each eye see only its image there are
several<00:01:43.830> techniques<00:01:44.370> to<00:01:44.610> accomplish<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
several techniques to accomplish that

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.920 
several techniques to accomplish that
and<00:01:45.479> we'll<00:01:45.990> explain<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.800> them<00:01:47.900> some<00:01:48.900> are

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and we'll explain some of them some are

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.110 
and we'll explain some of them some are
very<00:01:49.229> simple<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.310> possible<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:51.000> it

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
very simple and it's possible to do it

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.899 
very simple and it's possible to do it

work<00:01:57.330> on<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:57.659> same<00:01:57.840> principle<00:01:58.580> how<00:01:59.580> to<00:01:59.640> feed

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
work on the same principle how to feed

each eye with different images
to<00:02:03.390> better<00:02:03.600> understand<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.680> must<00:02:04.860> first

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
to better understand we must first

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.609 
to better understand we must first
understand<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:05.760> our<00:02:06.060> vision<00:02:06.390> works<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.930> it

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
understand how our vision works and it

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.949 
understand how our vision works and it
all<00:02:07.799> starts<00:02:08.250> with<00:02:08.310> light<00:02:08.670> because<00:02:09.300> without<00:02:09.720> it

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
all starts with light because without it

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.809 
all starts with light because without it
there<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.590> no<00:02:10.860> vision<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:12.540> visible<00:02:13.020> light<00:02:13.819> we

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
there is no vision the visible light we

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.059 
there is no vision the visible light we
know<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.209> light<00:02:15.420> consists<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.110> rays<00:02:16.410> coming

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
know that light consists of rays coming

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.970 
know that light consists of rays coming
from<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.340> source<00:02:17.580> like<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.390> Sun<00:02:18.680> these<00:02:19.680> rays
