00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.830
 let's start by dissolving two 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.290
 packages of coconut gelatin in two 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.710
 liters of hot milk if you do not 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.900
 they will arrive find the coconut jelly 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.650
 You can search among my videos how 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.630
 prepare a coconut jelly 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.689
 once we have already diluted 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.180
 perfectly coconut gelatin let's go 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.180
 to separate the milk into four containers 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.739
 then we are going to add a few drops of 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.020
 neon coloring and this is the brand that I 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.730
 I'm using but there are different 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.610
 brands you can use the one 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.790
 you meet if you decide 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.790
 how hard they want the color of their 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.790
 Colorant 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.460
 from here we had to refrigerate for 12 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.090
 hours or until the gelatin settles 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.280
 full 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.309
 let's start by preparing our 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.200
 transparent gelatin for this we are going to 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.510
 heat two and a half glasses of water and 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.729
 here I have approximately 500 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.680
 milliliters 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.750
 let's start by dissolving half a cup 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.390
 of sugar 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.330
 I am going to add 2 tablespoons of 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.300
 essence of flavoring you can 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.520
 add more or less 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.100
 we are going to add a pinch of acid 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.480
 citric 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.850
 and we are going to dissolve it perfectly 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.090
 we are also going to occupy two tablespoons of 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.840
 Grenetina each spoonful equals 10 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.280
 grams and we're going to dilute the grenetin with 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 one ounce of cold water 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.710
 and we're going to let it rest for about 3 a 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.020
 4 minutes 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.890
 once the grenadine has hydrated 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.330
 we're going to dilute it with water 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.820
 hot that we have here 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.600
 let's see it go perfectly until 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.600
 do not leave us lumps 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.799
 we're going to put some oil together 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.010
 napkin and we're going to enter our 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.810
 mold so that in this way the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.510
 gelatine is not going to stick to the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.790
 time to unmold after we're going to 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.579
 add half the water we have 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.099
 over here already prepared and we're going to 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.549
 take to refrigerate for about 10 to 15 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.480
 minutes until the gelatin is me 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.340
 set 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.189
 we do not want it to set completely but 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.190
 that is more or less like sticky my 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:46.260
 gelatine already curdled so now 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.030
 we are going to accommodate the fruit you 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.239
 you can add in the way that you 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.239
 like 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.580
 once they have the fruit accommodated 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.030
 let's move on to add the water that we 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.030
 subtraction 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.879
 and again we will move it to 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.120
 until the gelatin is semi-curd 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.790
 or sticky 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.330
 then we are going to liquefy a can 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.330
 of evaporated milk 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.599
 a can of coconut milk 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.060
 a glass of pineapple juice you can 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.560
 use any brand of your preference 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.560
 a can of condensed milk 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.219
 then half a cup of cold water 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.469
 to dilute a total of 28 grams of 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:45.639
 gelatin or equal to 4 on the equivalent 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.609
 let's put aside 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:51.629
 acn hydrate and let's leave it for about 3 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.629
 4 minutes 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.600
 once the grenetina has already been 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.700
 of this consistency we will pass it on to 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.920
 microwave for 45 seconds 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.430
 once it is already liquid and so 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.700
 hot let's move it to the blender 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.970
 and we're going to liquefy it for approximately 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.970
 one minute 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.370
 for this time they must have their 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:23.620
 pieces of coconut jelly and they go to 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.620
 accommodate them all around 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.479
 maybe they do not occupy all the amount that 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.060
 we prepare only half but that 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:35.310
 it depends on you this we are going to empty 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.310
 our pina colada mix 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.350
 and now if we pass it to 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.750
 refrigerate for about three to four hours 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.350
 or until the gelatin settles 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.350
 full 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.830
 and that's it, that's how I get my jelly 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.920
 I hope that this recipe has 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.540
 liked if it's a little laborious but 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.350
 I recommend you have a lot 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.330
 patience and for that gelatin 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.790
 Transparent is not going to take off 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.930
 of milk gelatin I recommend them 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.520
 make sure that the gelatin 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.160
 transparent is semi curdled that does not 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.710
 is very curdled so that in this way 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.580
 join and stick completely to the 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.580
 time to unmold 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.660
 if you want to avoid the process of 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.300
 transparent gelatin then you can 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:35.449
 do in this other way only with 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.300
 pina colada gelatin and the pieces of 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:40.310
 coconut these many thanks for watching my 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.910
 videos and see you until next time 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.910
 goodbye
