 hi friends from youtube i am spartan 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.840
 2275 and I'll come with this new video 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.420
 tutorial this time we will teach you 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.430
 how to make a door with pistons in 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.010
 minecraft let's start that I'm with 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.400
 my friend rubÃ©n hello you and he is going to us 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.620
 help with the video ok 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.700
 they need to have a space yes 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.590
 as well as they see two three four blocks are 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.720
 well you can be whatever you want 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.360
 I did it 4 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.940
 plus the wall that we are going to occupy and 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.800
 we occupy two sticky pistons and 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.310
 put them as my friend does 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.310
 continuation 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.860
 they have two spaces of separation between 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.940
 the pistons and the wall 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.940
 and put back 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.299
 a cube and reddish stone and the earth 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.640
 left and right put some material 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.640
 where we will put the levers 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.220
 As you can see, it works like this, Carlos 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.500
 lever 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.810
 moves that's what we occupy that is 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.760
 move the two if they do not move the two 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.930
 it's not going to work and then we put the 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.330
 material that they want to be the 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.030
 door we took glass and what 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.030
 only missing is to fill the sides 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.229
 and then it was ok because they see 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.570
 it works also I want to tell you that 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.909
 next videos I will upload some videos 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.880
 of mega constructions constructions 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.739
 very large and also observing your 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.450
 map and knowing your brush strokes for 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.400
 Do not miss them 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.100
 and please comment and subscribe follow 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.200
 so they do not comment that's what we 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.920
 matter how they see the door ok 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.240
 It works well 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.240
 it opens and closes 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.650
 after 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.550
 this can be used many times to 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.550
 many things 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.920
 ok friends from youtube that has been all 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.920
