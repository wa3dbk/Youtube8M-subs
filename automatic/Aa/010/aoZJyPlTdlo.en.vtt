 During a routine eye exam, tests are performed to determine the 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.029

 efe 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.220
 the ophthalmologist also detect refractive errors 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.679
 there are four types of oberman myopia errors from far away when objects 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.629
 nearby are clear but distant fuzzy and but pinilla 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.170
 oberman up close when distant objects look clear but the arcane 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.440
 blurred astigmatism when distance vision and near vision appear 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.640
 3 biophilia 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.110
 when the eyes gradually lose the ability to see things closely this 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.300
 makes reading difficult 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.430
 many people have one or a combination of these errors 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.740
 to correct them to the ophthalmologist can recommend glasses and contact lenses 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.130
 refractive surgery 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.840
 with additional tests of the hostel mola or examine the health and functioning 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.869
 of the eyelid the coordination of the eye muscles the response of the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.610

 the retina of the cornea when there are no particular problems is recommended 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.800
 examinations every so often the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.510
 next the infants should have an eye examination within the

 The eye routine examination for children can also be done by
