00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello everyone is the team yale 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.810
 at the link looks tired today 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.849
 me it's not serious link because of courage 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.059
 for a little speed run or that you're 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.130
 all forces for this occasion 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.389
 what are we doing there she a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.379
 roulade is a blow of sword in the nose 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.029
 already aim because he is mean 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.390
 what did he have you he ate 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.619
 ruto no sorry i do not care in fact he 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.730
 ate the ancient stones 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.590
 that's better than I think 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.150
 of this dungeon there she I think there is 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.050
 of the two inside so I was afraid 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.380
 when I was little 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.820
 for the aspect in the middle of the middle of 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.890
 doctorates that they do not appear so 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.350
 it's pretty good against a little drawn 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.579
 in the thing I imagine for any 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.469
 security is a platform that has been 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.090
 programmed just to appear at 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.410
 when we arrive it's beautiful 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.020
 hope nothing for speed run hours 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.910
 you will receive a green monster all 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.590
 green dressed but no it's palin 15 to 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.500
 she well if bolt it's normal ojito 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.590
 what are you good at is the beginning of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.189
 this speed run from ja goal and is very 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.450
 looking like a normal re of what you 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.659
 do you normally go talk to the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.869
 road to you do as if you were doing 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:24.780
 the dungeon normally yes apple goes away 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.689
 he looks shocked is the end too cool 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.060
 I want to do the same as him he did 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.119
 better he did a roll of in this 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.579
 that you're still here and keep ruto a 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.920
 a big head is a small blow 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.270
 finally a sudden end it's not 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.720
 possible you're impressive we are either 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.680
 possible to lift a similar head 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.130
 finally good poor princess 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.110
 disproportionately 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.789
 the trick is painful with ruto in the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.899
 speed run even if it is during the 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.189
 speed run by the way the trick that is 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.170
 painful and kruth high is that already his 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.520
 dialogues are not possible to pass 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.450
 yes and she speaks for a long time 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.789
 then I wanted by both times to 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.530
 that she sits miss but it's 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:10.810
 not serious because ruto still 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:13.519
 a particularity it raises ruto finally 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.810
 particularity will tell you after yes 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.910
 she does not know how to swim like all 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.170
 others do not know how to swim so she 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.510
 dies when she is in contact with water 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.920
 it's normal 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.930
 the star to her if you were an aura 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.900
 do you go out and swim at least bah 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.670
 no you know the firepower that's it 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.040
 it's a pretty important job 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.420
 to use brito as objects for 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.910
 open switch that makes you 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.950
 save a few more seconds 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.790
 that was the particularity of return 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.989
 which wanted to talk to bach which dr roque 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.190
 boys trucks was completely diverted 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.810
 I do not know why it happened 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.380
 but normally it should have put it 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.260
 in front of 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.730
 yes but good talk about the cost of 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.290
 platforms that was well programmed 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.819
 for speed roller I do not know if 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.049
 it is so well programmed that it yes I 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.130
 think it would be better for her to arrive 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.130
 at the bottom rather than in water 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.160
 So here it is the small passage 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.940
 we wait and suddenly we look at the carpet 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.730
 mouse the content 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.260
 yeah he walks me everywhere in the 22 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.760
 january he'll always stay with me 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.079
 we're getting married that she's going for a walk 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.190
 romantic ruto I had a big shot of 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.579
 luck but really a big shot of 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.549
 chance not to fall even road will have 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.660
 a little fright but see them ruto 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.069
 I will not give up everything 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.100
 now I still need you 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:31.700
 and yes in gentleman lille does very 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.370
 attention to rothau that's why the 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.840
 text of life that tells us but you 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.489
 can not lift it all you can not the 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.030
 hurry alone knowing that I'm not 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.609
 not alone 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.370
 thank you navy but you can and ships 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.690
 you know are not forbidden there is a 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.950
 another particularity is important 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.890
 to use the button because she 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.300
 allows to 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.400
 you're a con a single blow really to 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.959
 money orders then it's good because 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.870
 households be the facts all out 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.130
 finally yes if you see them finally 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.470
 take them out from the moment that 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.510
 is still in their stuff in 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.560
 their area there we retrieve the object the most 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:11.930
 important of the game which is the grapple but 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.520
 not for child link she boomerang 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.180
 with a baby goron on it because the 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.880
 french rugby 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.350
 it's cool good finally guines who has 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.700
 decided to stop being a dangerous 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.800
 valves so suddenly he said to himself 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.390
 it's not worthy of a speed runner to be 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.970
 a gentleman he can not be speed run 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.230
 shelter leumann at a time or so 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.480
 she dropped time like this 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.040
 huge and worry no more blow there 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.140
 it's the moment of link rage 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.570
 who realizes that he is more 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.740
 bad speed runner that refutes everything 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.320
 that you are already talking about our 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.660
 side there is not against there there is a small 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.770
 thing I could say is we 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.180
 could have very well used the wind of 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.350
 gold headlights here there are a lot of people who 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.790
 the fact that they use the wind of 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.730
 gold headlights here to go directly here 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.720
 they must have recovered the boomerang 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.790
 only to aim for thirty or so 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.410
 seconds before there is the bug knows 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.780
 of this video it's even the most 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.510
 difficult too so here it really takes 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.979
 have a super precise angle so stop 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.810
 this angle there is no there is not 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.460
 others others other choices 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.760
 other possibilities this is it 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.500
 or nothing else that does not work place du 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.360
 suddenly we see pixels on the ground because 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.010
 that people are killing themselves at bussy that I know 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.490
 not why did it do that on the catch 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.990
 sorry the blow there we do we do the 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.340
 famous ocarina goal 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.020
 the claw on the switch it's 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.600
 possible also by doing the post 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.340
 buffering to open the door open 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.480
 I've never been successful so I 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.610
 did not show then there is also a 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.020
 other stuff our thing pretty accurate so 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.840
 there must be a kind of mark 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.120
 on the floor on the floor of floor paint 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.830
 may have been able to see the lgp am not 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.560
 look at the floor I looked at the ceiling 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.720
 it is necessary to play thrown on this 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.430
 mark up and immediately 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.830
 that we launched the lan the not the 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.330
 slingshot the boomerang get it done 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.740
 full of jump on the side so that the 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.900
 boomerang touches the switches and 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.680
 so open the door which I thought 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.180
 you throw the world totally al azhar 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.340
 which we can also activate the trick with 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.540
 a dingy missile but I believe it 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.730
 must be the times and if the hairy 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:08.010
 otherwise they expose marinade date of 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.200
 my point of view this boss and the worst to 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.680
 speed run dmc the worst boss of the young 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.940
 andré life 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.070
 same time he makes moments so much 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.380
 random already he has three phases this 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.639
 phase it is simple and not two steps 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.590
 specific advice to give 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.230
 change target 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.670
 the canvas December so here I have 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.020
 found a trick actually this is my 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.370
 year that's where I actually did that 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.660
 I have not touched directly to 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.530
 very close times of him so I 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.480
 could make a roll and throw 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.770
 directly a command of the blow the 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.090
 town we go to each race I know 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.230
 not if it's really lucky that 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.360
 offers to you then that to each young person 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.920
 more the group to his channel then there 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.450
 I also noticed something is a 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.070
 small antenna and it was blue it takes 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.180
 wait until these antennas are 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.710
 more blue to be able to touch it with 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.690
 so here you go if not for the second 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.790
 phase one can also throw boomerang 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.430
 slightly above a kind of thing 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:00.910
 ugly there with the blue the white the yellow 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.860
 above the big red stuff for the 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.390
 to paralyze to be of course and then after 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.160
 you also told me it was good 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.380
 electrocute by the head of 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.780
 marinade like that left directly 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.130
 to assault yeah rather than to make 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.890
 complain until she touches 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.200
 here is the boss I am rather satisfied 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.060
 of this boss I do not have too bad on 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.410
 this shot my dear I was lucky 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.540
 also because it was my first 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.630
 attempt I made the May 20th trick there 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:28.030
 with the tip of the sword and then early street 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.130
 what are you doing here what are you doing with it
