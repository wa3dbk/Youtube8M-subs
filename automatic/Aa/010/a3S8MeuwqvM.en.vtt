 Smell of fruit and a little mood 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.510
 The potential may go up, but it is premised that you don't have a bad smell, though 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:13.030
 So I 'm eating gum 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:15.750

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.520
 Tick ​​tack 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:26.680
 I thought it was a dollar for this, but only about 100 yen 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:31.409
 As for evaluation, the genre of the delusion mint system is funny that I am already hungry 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:36.019
 It 's a little hard to say it's raining, and it's a bit too expensive to evaluate 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.019
 Well about 7 out of 10 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:41.399
 I need your help by the tick tack evaluation
