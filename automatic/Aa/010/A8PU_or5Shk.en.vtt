00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
crate room as you guys saw I actually

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.709 
crate room as you guys saw I actually
extended<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> little<00:00:54.270> bit<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.600> can

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
extended that out a little bit so it can

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.150 
extended that out a little bit so it can
actually<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:55.020> some<00:00:55.199> zombies<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.010> guys

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
actually get some zombies you guys

actually get some zombies you guys
numbers<00:00:56.520> kind<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:57.989> two

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
numbers kind of think there was like two

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.389 
numbers kind of think there was like two
blocks<00:00:58.350> staying<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.070> front<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
blocks staying out of the front of the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.189 
blocks staying out of the front of the
bumper<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.850> do<00:00:59.969> zombies<00:01:00.239> don't<00:01:00.329> really<00:01:00.600> come

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
bumper so do zombies don't really come

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.479 
bumper so do zombies don't really come
here<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.160> you're<00:01:02.280> doing<00:01:02.460> right

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
here and do this like you're doing right

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.820 
here and do this like you're doing right
now<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.420> i<00:01:03.449> guess<00:01:04.019> those<00:01:04.110> guys<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.350> gave<00:01:04.680> up

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
now so i guess those guys just gave up

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.130

and got tired whatever I'll take it I'll
take<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.979> I'm<00:01:08.250> feeling<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.790> today<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.090> bumped

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
take it so I'm feeling it today I bumped

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
take it so I'm feeling it today I bumped
it<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.990> normal<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:10.710> right<00:01:10.920> i<00:01:10.950> had<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.400> on

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
easy in the beginning i think there was

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
easy in the beginning i think there was
a<00:01:13.439> time<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.740> i<00:01:13.890> recorded<00:01:14.040> i<00:01:14.369> actually<00:01:14.670> had<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
a time that i recorded i actually had it

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.170 
a time that i recorded i actually had it
on<00:01:15.030> normal<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.630> well<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:17.460> wanted<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
on normal as well but I I wanted to

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
on normal as well but I I wanted to
start<00:01:18.450> out<00:01:18.570> without<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.229> dying<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
start out without like dying all the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.330 
start out without like dying all the
time<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.360> uh<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.990> put<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.740> easy<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
time so uh I put it on easy in the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
time so uh I put it on easy in the
beginning<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:23.880> back<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.390> normal<00:01:24.509> that's

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
beginning but now back on normal that's

and things like that then do in a week

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.440 
and things like that then do in a week
so<00:03:51.980> I'm<00:03:52.980> probably<00:03:53.609> going<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.000> be<00:03:54.090> switching<00:03:54.359> up

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
so I'm probably going to be switching up

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
so I'm probably going to be switching up
to<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.690> mean<00:03:54.930> there<00:03:55.049> will<00:03:55.109> probably<00:03:55.320> be

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
to that I mean there will probably be

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.890 
to that I mean there will probably be
days<00:03:56.130> where<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.400> might<00:03:56.609> do<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:56.940> on<00:03:57.150> monday

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900

wednesday and friday which is the
typical<00:03:59.879> thing<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:01.050> it's<00:04:01.200> probably<00:04:01.349> going<00:04:01.530> to

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
typical thing so it's probably going to

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.320
