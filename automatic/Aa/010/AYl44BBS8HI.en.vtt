a<00:00:53.220> very<00:00:54.220> much<00:00:54.489> unlike<00:00:54.760> the<00:00:55.210> new<00:00:55.420> macbook

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840

a very much unlike the new macbook
design<00:00:56.710> this<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.309> still<00:00:57.640> reminiscent<00:00:58.270> of<00:00:58.360> the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
design this is still reminiscent of the

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
design this is still reminiscent of the
older<00:00:59.370> macbook<00:01:00.370> pro<00:01:00.610> design<00:01:00.970> which<00:01:01.239> i<00:01:01.450> have<00:01:01.780> a

one<00:01:03.520> right<00:01:03.700> here<00:01:03.910> that<00:01:04.059> we're<00:01:04.210> going<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.390> use

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
one right here that we're going to use

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.060 
one right here that we're going to use
for<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.839> comparison<00:01:05.259> a<00:01:05.440> little<00:01:05.649> later<00:01:05.800> on<00:01:05.860> in

civilization five on it and I can say
that<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.710> ran<00:03:00.220> pretty<00:03:01.000> well<00:03:01.330> if<00:03:01.600> you<00:03:01.870> turn<00:03:02.110> the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
that it ran pretty well if you turn the

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.140 
that it ran pretty well if you turn the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.420

it's<00:03:04.570> going<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.110> be<00:03:05.230> very<00:03:05.260> laggy<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:06.040> fact<00:03:06.280> it

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
it's going to be very laggy in fact it

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.570 
it's going to be very laggy in fact it
would<00:03:06.520> be<00:03:06.610> laggy<00:03:06.850> even<00:03:07.270> on<00:03:07.360> an<00:03:07.480> imac<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:09.160> I

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
would be laggy even on an imac so I

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.160 
would be laggy even on an imac so I
wouldn't<00:03:10.240> get<00:03:10.300> too<00:03:10.510> discouraged<00:03:10.750> by<00:03:11.140> that

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
wouldn't get too discouraged by that

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.830 
wouldn't get too discouraged by that

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
well in the device but I will say it did

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.180 
well in the device but I will say it did

get about 10 hours of battery life I

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.580 
get about 10 hours of battery life I
found<00:03:25.180> with<00:03:25.300> heavy<00:03:25.510> usage<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:26.170> usually<00:03:26.500> get

about eight to nine hours out of it
which<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.660> pretty<00:03:28.810> good<00:03:29.050> considering<00:03:29.440> that

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
which is pretty good considering that

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.990 
which is pretty good considering that
the<00:03:29.800> retina<00:03:30.010> display<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.610> going<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.790> draw<00:03:30.970> a

the retina display it's going to draw a

the retina display it's going to draw a

predecessors<00:03:33.100> now<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.210> I've<00:03:34.330> kind<00:03:34.540> of

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
predecessors now that I've kind of

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.030 
predecessors now that I've kind of
covered<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.990> gist<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.530> computer<00:03:35.890> guys

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
covered the gist of the computer guys

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.650 
covered the gist of the computer guys
and<00:03:36.370> like<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.730> said<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:37.060> isn't<00:03:37.330> going<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.570> be

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
and like I said this isn't going to be

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.940 
and like I said this isn't going to be
too<00:03:37.720> in-depth<00:03:38.320> i'm<00:03:38.530> just<00:03:38.650> going<00:03:38.770> to<00:03:38.800> go

too in-depth i'm just going to go

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.070 
too in-depth i'm just going to go

neutral<00:04:06.000> it's<00:04:07.000> pretty<00:04:07.360> good<00:04:07.630> but<00:04:07.960> there's

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
neutral it's pretty good but there's

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.750 
neutral it's pretty good but there's
better<00:04:08.590> out<00:04:08.680> there<00:04:09.040> but<00:04:09.280> it's<00:04:09.370> not<00:04:09.430> bad

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
better out there but it's not bad

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.090 
better out there but it's not bad
another<00:04:10.630> plus<00:04:10.900> for<00:04:10.960> this<00:04:11.200> is<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.650> does<00:04:11.830> have<00:04:12.070> a

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
another plus for this is it does have a

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.030 
another plus for this is it does have a
variety<00:04:12.610> of<00:04:12.790> ports<00:04:13.300> that<00:04:13.570> work<00:04:13.840> flawlessly<00:04:14.170> SD

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
variety of ports that work flawlessly SD

card slot thunderbolt USB they're all
very<00:04:18.460> useful<00:04:18.910> ports<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.480> they<00:04:19.840> give<00:04:20.049> you

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
very useful ports and they give you

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.990 
very useful ports and they give you
plenty<00:04:20.470> of<00:04:20.680> them<00:04:20.830> and<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.370> final<00:04:21.700> pro<00:04:21.910> i'm

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
plenty of them and the final pro i'm

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.820 
plenty of them and the final pro i'm
going<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.210> give<00:04:22.360> is<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.810> thinness<00:04:23.110> of<00:04:23.500> this

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
going to give is the thinness of this

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.320 
going to give is the thinness of this
new<00:04:24.010> device<00:04:24.280> which<00:04:24.520> i<00:04:24.640> will<00:04:24.700> compare<00:04:25.150> in<00:04:25.240> a

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
new device which i will compare in a

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.020 
new device which i will compare in a
second<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:26.650> is<00:04:26.680> definitely<00:04:27.100> thin<00:04:27.760> and

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
second and it is definitely thin and

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.150 
second and it is definitely thin and
much<00:04:28.450> lighter<00:04:28.930> than<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.380> predecessor<00:04:29.980> the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
much lighter than the predecessor the

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.390 
much lighter than the predecessor the
only<00:04:30.880> cons<00:04:31.120> i<00:04:31.330> can<00:04:31.480> think<00:04:31.630> about<00:04:31.810> are<00:04:32.400> in

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400
