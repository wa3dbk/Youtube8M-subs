00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.650
 I'll serve you in a sauce the sauce 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.170
 green tomatillo usually the 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.780
 we cook means we put it to 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.779
 cook we put some kind of chili today 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.779
 not today we are going to chop the tomato 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.340
 and let's make a minced sauce this 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.350
 it's going to be like that 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.820
 is going to give this different consistency 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.980
 will make us every bit of what 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.470
 what is the tomato we can enjoy and 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.080
 the chipotle chile mix with the 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.730
 tomatillo and it 's exceptional even though you 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.379
 I will chop it and fresh is going to have 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.949
 you that is false I am going to be 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.770
 preparing very well I will continue with 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:54.440
 but I have enough tomatillo 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.750
 to make my sauce 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.300
 let's remove our table and the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.580
 we leave here I'm going to heat oil 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:08.070
 the necessary because here I'm going to fry 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.590
 just the tomatillo and garlic clove 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.200
 this time he knows that the chile 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.950
 chipotle that we will be using no 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.900
 I'm going to liquefy it because I need bits 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.020
 of chipotle chili so I'm going to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.700
 leave there completely whole what can 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.890
 put whole in the end what can 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.730
 crumble it can sting like you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:34.080
 I want to start quickly by garlic 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:38.310
 without letting it get too brown I'll be 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.310
 incorporating there the tomatillo 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.630
 and we are going to form a sauce 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.920
 very well if you notice the tomato already 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.320
 it starts to look different because 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.960
 has a cooking 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.650
 this is a rich sauce that I will be 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.570
 putting me 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:09.290
 just on the patch 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.290
 here is going to finish cooking my sauce 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.040
 A) Yes 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.860
 well and this is going to give you excellent flavor 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.980
 we let this be cooked 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.800
 approximately 20 minutes of time 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.940
 so that this broth that has is reduced 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.950
 a little more and we are delicious this 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.660
 that this tomatillo that I just integrated 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.300
 you already know it has an acidity 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.490
 amazing when you need a 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.390
 balance that the plate has been left 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.370
 completely sweet or salty or that you 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.830
 these dishes that says he's missing that 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.620
 it lacks if it lacks some acid 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.050
 think of the green tomatillo the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.600
 green tomatillo besides not being 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.430
 adding additive dish you will 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.410
 is going to be adding this to that acidity 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.709
 What you are missing is acidity 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.500
 natural nothing of conservatives what I'm going 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.600
 to do because this is pure acid that 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.780
 I'm going to do a little bit of 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.050
 bicarbonate this is going to be foaming like that 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.570
 I'm going to put a pinch of baking 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.570
 to balance that acidity
