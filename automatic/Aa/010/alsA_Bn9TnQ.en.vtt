so<00:03:23.280> now<00:03:23.459> all<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> rest<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.269> just<00:03:24.330> folding<00:03:25.170> so

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
so now all the rest is just folding so

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.380 
so now all the rest is just folding so
we're<00:03:26.160> gonna<00:03:26.250> reinforce<00:03:26.580> our<00:03:26.970> score<00:03:27.360> lines

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
we're gonna reinforce our score lines

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.660 
we're gonna reinforce our score lines
that<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:27.930> made<00:03:28.170> earlier<00:03:28.590> faults<00:03:29.250> of<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.459> large
