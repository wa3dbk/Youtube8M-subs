I<00:03:05.470> continues<00:03:06.470> why<00:03:06.739> we're<00:03:07.010> in<00:03:07.459> flats<00:03:07.819> or

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
I continues why we're in flats or

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.059 
I continues why we're in flats or
perform<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:09.080> if<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.319> can<00:03:09.470> hear<00:03:09.650> from<00:03:09.860> the

perform and if you can hear from the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.759 
perform and if you can hear from the
south<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.910> audio<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.269> also<00:03:11.660> much<00:03:11.870> louder<00:03:12.290> and

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769

with<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.069> higher<00:03:13.340> clarity<00:03:13.879> than<00:03:14.360> a<00:03:14.420> platform

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.280 

so<00:03:17.459> this<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.760> what<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.060> call<00:03:18.300> dynamic<00:03:18.599> display

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
so this is what we call dynamic display

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.610 
so this is what we call dynamic display
even<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:19.890> seamless<00:03:20.250> connection<00:03:21.290> between<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
even the seamless connection between the

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
be stores will be stalled on the pathway

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.309 
be stores will be stalled on the pathway
ok<00:04:00.519> so<00:04:00.579> this<00:04:00.909> is<00:04:01.060> what<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.389> well<00:04:01.840> being<00:04:02.019> while
