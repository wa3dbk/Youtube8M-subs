took<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.030> while<00:02:44.360> for<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.870> Ross<00:02:45.110> magic<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.920> work

I<00:02:46.930> think<00:02:47.930> we<00:02:48.050> had<00:02:48.200> some<00:02:48.440> problems<00:02:48.980> internally

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
I think we had some problems internally

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.580 
I think we had some problems internally
within<00:02:49.820> our<00:02:50.030> program<00:02:50.270> number<00:02:50.930> one<00:02:51.140> we<00:02:51.350> had<00:02:51.500> to

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
within our program number one we had to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.490 
within our program number one we had to
get<00:02:51.740> that<00:02:51.920> straightened<00:02:52.370> out<00:02:52.610> and<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:54.410> I

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
get that straightened out and and and I

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.370 
get that straightened out and and and I
took<00:02:54.560> us<00:02:54.950> awhile<00:02:55.420> as<00:02:56.420> much<00:02:56.660> as<00:02:56.840> anything<00:02:57.080> there

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
took us awhile as much as anything there

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.759 
took us awhile as much as anything there
was<00:02:57.470> an<00:02:57.620> attitude<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:59.230> you<00:03:00.230> know<00:03:00.350> was<00:03:00.590> it

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
was an attitude that you know was it
