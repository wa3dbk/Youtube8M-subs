00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 friends, hello to you, total and games 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.200
 today i want to show you one place 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.219
 where is 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.420
 I should machine the monster and I know it 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:19.619
 big jeep on huge wheels 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:23.340
 here it is one place but i check it on 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.590
 pc version so i don't know if he 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.990
 generally choke on because 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.500
 consoles yes he is exactly there stands but 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:38.180
 now basically apex and check and 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:41.450
 I hope that we can find it and 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.760
 I hope that he is there to find him 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.840
 probably at any time of the day I do not think 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.899
 that you somehow affect him 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.620
 location but everything may be because 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.920
 that some cars appear exactly 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:04.670
 there 10 o'clock in the morning for about well and so 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:10.490
 Further then from essentially I hope for the best 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:14.270
 so so so so so so at least this 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.930
 the place here it is 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.930
 these are machines 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.600
 here is direct if it is at this site 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.850
 such a 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.850
 plus essentially i hope he is there 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.179
 but unfortunately it here and have no regrets 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:42.959
 Generally yes, here are some cars available 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:46.200
 let's say the names are available to exactly those people 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.569
 who switched from consoles to n to such 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.060
 way they can stand by the car and 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.119
 some can not but place me you 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.020
 showed and you can check it yourself 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:02.159
 This place is next to the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:06.750
 airport of alarm is worth it cars 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.000
 on here on this place and in principle 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.840
 I think that on consoles anyway 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.959
 is there 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.530
 but as for I do not know yet 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.500
 principle 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.519
 friends see for yourself who switched from 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.299
 consoles on the PC 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.310
 but move your character and the 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.760
 look please maybe you 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.670
 indeed he will if you have him 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.590
 will be in any case I will already know 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.040
 what really is all because of 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.609
 drops of scams during torture 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.959
 but it's a shame of course that we did not find him but 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:45.959
 principle you should not be upset because 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:50.239
 it's just a trifle well friends for 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:53.130
 all this I think that soon a 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:57.630
 people will sign off yes about if 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:01.140
 this car is here and in principle i think that 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.990
 on this my myth is destroyed by us although I 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.820
 not destructive on this all friends 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.820
 thanks for watching everyone bye
