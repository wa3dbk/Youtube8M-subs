00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
when I was a kid and I saw a random

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920 
when I was a kid and I saw a random
person<00:00:47.039> parked<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.399> car<00:00:47.430> my<00:00:47.789> last<00:00:48.180> instinct

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
was to walk up and think that person

was to walk up and think that person
could<00:00:50.730> help<00:00:50.969> me<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.719> maybe<00:00:51.809> that's<00:00:52.079> why

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
could help me and maybe that's why

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.479 
could help me and maybe that's why
they're<00:00:52.469> homeless<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:53.100> they're<00:00:53.250> stupid

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
they're homeless because they're stupid

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.490 
they're homeless because they're stupid
not<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.539> those<00:00:54.780> people<00:00:54.989> are<00:00:55.050> stupid<00:00:55.260> though

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
not all those people are stupid though

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.900 
not all those people are stupid though
by<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> way<00:00:55.890> I've<00:00:56.039> known<00:00:56.280> some<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.760> are

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
by the way I've known some that are

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.430 
by the way I've known some that are
quite<00:00:57.210> intelligent<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.020> choose<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> be

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
quite intelligent they just choose to be

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.229 
quite intelligent they just choose to be
that<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.160> guess<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.579> majority<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.059> them

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239

that way but I guess a majority of them
are<00:01:00.359> stupid<00:01:00.600> that's<00:01:00.930> what<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.199> comes<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.440> to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.020 
the entire thing instead of just a
little<00:01:38.250> bit<00:01:38.400> at<00:01:38.549> least<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> little

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
little bit at least is a little

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.749 
little bit at least is a little
different<00:01:39.390> because<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.259> other<00:01:40.590> places<00:01:40.890> they

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
different because with other places they

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.249 
different because with other places they
don't<00:01:41.939> usually<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:42.960> gonna<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
don't usually do that I'm gonna get a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.350 
don't usually do that I'm gonna get a
bite<00:01:43.409> by<00:01:44.130> itself<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:44.759> I'm<00:01:44.850> gonna<00:01:44.970> dip<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360

yeah<00:02:09.979> one<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.130> reasons<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.430> was<00:02:11.520> kind<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
yeah one of the reasons I was kind of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.980 
yeah one of the reasons I was kind of
confused<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.240> they<00:02:12.390> were<00:02:12.450> coming<00:02:12.870> out<00:02:12.930> with

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
confused that they were coming out with

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.020 
confused that they were coming out with
this<00:02:13.110> concept<00:02:13.500> was<00:02:13.860> Kentucky<00:02:14.790> Fried<00:02:14.910> Chicken

this concept was Kentucky Fried Chicken
is<00:02:15.360> probably<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.110> best<00:02:16.350> in<00:02:16.590> terms<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.980> quick

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
is probably the best in terms of quick

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.630 
is probably the best in terms of quick
fast<00:02:17.730> food<00:02:18.090> chicken<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.890> don't<00:02:20.340> really<00:02:20.430> know
