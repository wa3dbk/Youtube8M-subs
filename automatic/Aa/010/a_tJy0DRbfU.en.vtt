back to my head you're gonna see me
switch<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.730> another<00:01:41.910> side<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.420> my<00:01:42.510> hair<00:01:42.840> so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530

kind<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:44.070> same<00:01:44.220> concept<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.760> using<00:01:45.030> bigger

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
kind of the same concept of using bigger

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.780 
kind of the same concept of using bigger
colors<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> back<00:01:46.230> I<00:01:46.530> use<00:01:47.010> smaller<00:01:47.370> rollers

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
colors in the back I use smaller rollers

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.280 
colors in the back I use smaller rollers
towards<00:01:48.120> the<00:01:48.240> front<00:01:48.480> of<00:01:48.510> my<00:01:48.660> hair<00:01:48.900> because<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
towards the front of my hair because it

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.870 
towards the front of my hair because it
gives<00:01:49.410> a<00:01:49.500> tighter<00:01:49.680> curl<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.400> just<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.760> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
gives a tighter curl and I just like the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.360 
gives a tighter curl and I just like the
effect<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.330> looks<00:01:51.650> when<00:01:52.650> I<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.920> smaller<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
effect it looks when I have smaller and

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.370 
effect it looks when I have smaller and
tighter<00:01:53.580> curls<00:01:53.970> towards<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.390> front<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:55.229> also

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
tighter curls towards the front you also

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.930 
tighter curls towards the front you also
kind<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.890> me<00:01:55.950> use<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.280> fingers<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.910> make

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
kind of see me use my fingers to make

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.730 
kind of see me use my fingers to make
sure<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.510> smooth<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.080> hair<00:01:58.260> down<00:01:58.470> on<00:01:58.650> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
sure that I smooth the hair down on the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.320 
sure that I smooth the hair down on the
roller<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.250> make<00:01:59.400> sure<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.670> all<00:01:59.820> evenly

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
roller and make sure it's all evenly

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.630 
roller and make sure it's all evenly
dispersed<00:02:00.900> amongst<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.680> roller<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.520> you

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
dispersed amongst the roller so you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.490 
dispersed amongst the roller so you
don't<00:02:02.790> get<00:02:02.910> kind<00:02:03.150> of<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.300> wonky<00:02:03.510> curl<00:02:03.930> cuz<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.320> can

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
don't get kind of a wonky curl cuz I can

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.109 
don't get kind of a wonky curl cuz I can
kind<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.830> happen<00:02:05.130> sometimes<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.640> using<00:02:05.940> hot

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
kind of happen sometimes and using hot

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.530 
kind of happen sometimes and using hot
