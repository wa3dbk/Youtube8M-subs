00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
little the little sewing gauge that I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.109 
little the little sewing gauge that I
use<00:01:45.299> or<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.619> sit<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.369> play<00:01:47.579> with<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.909> well<00:01:48.090> I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
think that if it's 16 gauge I think that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.200 
think that if it's 16 gauge I think that
twenty<00:01:51.780> let's<00:01:51.899> try<00:01:52.079> 24<00:01:52.619> look<00:01:52.860> deep<00:01:53.130> water<00:01:53.430> yeah

pressing this button over here so now I

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.770 
pressing this button over here so now I
made<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.040> pattern<00:02:06.469> 26<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.799> may<00:02:08.340> 2<00:02:08.399> 2016

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
made the pattern 26 I may 2 2016

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.510 
made the pattern 26 I may 2 2016
so<00:02:11.780> let's<00:02:12.020> see<00:02:12.230> if<00:02:12.560> that's<00:02:12.860> big<00:02:13.220> enough<00:02:13.250> for

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
so let's see if that's big enough for

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.970 
so let's see if that's big enough for
one<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.880> my<00:02:13.970> buttons<00:02:14.260> okay<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.560> I'm<00:02:15.680> putting
