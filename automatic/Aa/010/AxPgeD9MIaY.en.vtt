00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.170 
buildings in Tokyo and and and damage it
in<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.039> way<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.370> would<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:47.940> sort<00:00:48.120> of

in a way that would be sort of
immediately<00:00:48.750> recognizable<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.559> Tokyo<00:00:49.980> being

immediately recognizable as Tokyo being
hit<00:00:50.370> by<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.550> huge<00:00:50.850> tsunami<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.780> Tokyo<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.099 
hit by a huge tsunami but Tokyo is a
vast<00:00:53.600> agglomeration<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.980> of<00:00:56.329> urban<00:00:57.329> scape<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.990 
vast agglomeration of of urban scape and
it<00:00:58.829> certainly<00:00:59.039> stretches<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.760> way<00:00:59.879> out

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it certainly stretches all the way out

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.869 
it certainly stretches all the way out
to<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.230> east<00:01:01.440> coast<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.219> as
