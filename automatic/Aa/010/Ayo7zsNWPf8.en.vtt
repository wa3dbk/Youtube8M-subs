00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.780
 It looks good on us, then. For example. 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.040
 There are other things that are super cool. 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.379

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.409
 tip people stipulate a value that you 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.930

 Do you know your husband and mother? 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.519
 everything is going to be very bad because you 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.190
 will put debt on top of debt in 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.650
 debt and this is not legal having 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.510

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.680

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.430
 I have to control myself not to 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.280
 spend more than that so I always 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.470
 Thank God they arrive on this one. 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.810
 stipulated amount paid for the dog 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.829
 although I understand for example 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.989
 got one more bag on the back that 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.799
 I fell in love with her I fell in love with myself 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.480
 I fell in love 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:36.599
 but my share of j is not 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.489
 that I could in the budget for fashion already 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.099

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:44.699
 I left it there beautiful still for a price 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.290
 wonderful but I did not bring it because I 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.959
 I know that in the future I will find a 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.229
 cheaper and so not that it is 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.430

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.819
 I'll buy it just because I do have a list 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.400

 difference in the life of every woman in force 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.789

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.990
 go crazy in the store 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:30.900
 I do not know and everything is beautiful to pay 100 thousand reais 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.759
 in a purchase we can not happen 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.460
