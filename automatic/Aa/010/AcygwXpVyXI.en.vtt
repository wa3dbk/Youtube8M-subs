 we show how to tile stickers 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:15.120
 Bubble free gets to the tiles as 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.810
 First you should correct the many 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.060
 make the tiles acidic afterwards 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.180
 wet thoroughly so that the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 Drop down really nice run 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:35.880
 we take water with it a bit 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:38.399
 Dishwashing liquid is now the sticker of the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.579
 peel off the carrier film and the nasty 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.690
 clarify as long as the sticker is wet 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:49.590
 you can still here at the place 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.989
 push to whom you want to have him now 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.050
 with a squeegee or something like that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.550
 push water out under the sticker 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.420
 and hold him to one side 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.420
 so he does not slip 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.110
 I am 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:36.960
 Carefully dry everything 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:42.830
 wipe and you're done again out water 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.130
 Settle and tropical so that's it 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.780

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.480
 Here you can see how the printing tiles 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:44.260
 sometimes in combination with monochrome 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:45.220
 flow stickers look the whole thing 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.260
 again in green 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.700
 you can see that is quite different 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.620
 Look carefully now 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.010

 must be explained in detail then 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.500
 one puts up a suspicion destructively high 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.060
 example of a holiday motivating decides 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.060
 also how many tiles that printed 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.610
 should be directed then again 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.069
 out a bit 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.299

00:03:48.129 --> 00:04:01.480
 Wand again a bit wobbly 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:03.819
