00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
that I created using whisper white

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.180 
that I created using whisper white
cardstock<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:15.389> big<00:00:15.570> shot<00:00:15.870> I've<00:00:16.139> used<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
cardstock and the big shot I've used the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.920 
cardstock and the big shot I've used the
two<00:00:17.550> tags<00:00:17.940> dye<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.720> cut<00:00:19.220> these<00:00:20.480> previously<00:00:21.480> I

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
two tags dye and cut these previously I

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.920 
two tags dye and cut these previously I
was<00:00:22.560> able<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:23.039> cut<00:00:23.310> two<00:00:23.640> at<00:00:24.000> one<00:00:24.240> time<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
was able to cut two at one time and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.259 
was able to cut two at one time and
probably<00:00:25.619> could<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.189> done<00:00:26.279> three<00:00:26.760> or<00:00:26.910> four

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
probably could have done three or four

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.210 
probably could have done three or four
but<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.900> sake<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.349> video<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.769> just

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
together see I had a little bit of

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.490

trouble<00:01:03.510> getting<00:01:03.780> those<00:01:04.229> apart<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:06.500> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
trouble getting those apart and that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.250 
trouble getting those apart and that
impressions<00:01:08.490> are<00:01:08.670> very<00:01:09.080> pronounced<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.109 
impressions are very pronounced and
really<00:01:10.530> pretty<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.850> make<00:01:12.060> a

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
really pretty so it's going to make a

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.249 
really pretty so it's going to make a
really<00:01:12.510> pretty<00:01:12.780> wedding<00:01:13.049> favor<00:01:14.960> all<00:01:15.960> right

really pretty wedding favor all right
now<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.560> next<00:01:16.830> thing<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.159> need<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.820> find

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
now the next thing I need to do is find

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.870 
now the next thing I need to do is find
the<00:01:18.450> score<00:01:19.200> lines<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.549> look<00:01:20.729> closely

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
the score lines you have to look closely

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.160 
the score lines you have to look closely
because<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.869> impression<00:01:22.710> has<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:24.030> kind<00:01:24.990> of

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
because the impression has a kind of

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.920 
because the impression has a kind of
lightened<00:01:25.710> or<00:01:26.009> made<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.970> little<00:01:27.240> foaling<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
lightened or made the little foaling a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
lightened or made the little foaling a
little<00:01:28.200> harder<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.680> see<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> still

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
little harder to see but it is still

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.330 
little harder to see but it is still
there<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.900> fold<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.829> crease<00:01:32.130> on

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
there so just fold it up and crease on

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.190 
there so just fold it up and crease on
those<00:01:32.549> lines<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:35.210> then<00:01:36.210> I'm<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.079> take

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
those lines and then I'm going to take

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.490 
those lines and then I'm going to take
some<00:01:37.740> snail<00:01:38.280> adhesive<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.439> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
some snail adhesive and I'm going to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.649 
some snail adhesive and I'm going to
adhere<00:01:40.950> them<00:01:41.130> together<00:01:41.579> those<00:01:41.939> two<00:01:42.240> bottom

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
adhere them together those two bottom

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.230 
adhere them together those two bottom
tabs<00:01:43.170> together<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:44.399> one<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.759> top<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
tabs together just one on top of the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.499 
tabs together just one on top of the
other<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:50.040> snail<00:01:50.340> seems<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.939> hold<00:01:51.119> pretty

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
other and the snail seems to hold pretty

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.350 
other and the snail seems to hold pretty
well<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:52.049> these<00:01:52.790> sometimes<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
well on these sometimes if it was a

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.539 
well on these sometimes if it was a
heavier<00:01:54.840> cardstock<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.500> may<00:01:55.829> use<00:01:56.070> sticky<00:01:56.520> strip

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
heavier cardstock I may use sticky strip

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.450 
heavier cardstock I may use sticky strip
but<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.450> working<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:57.899> fine<00:01:58.250> all<00:01:59.250> right

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
but this is working just fine all right

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.149 
but this is working just fine all right
so<00:01:59.670> there<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.060> have<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.299> base<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.110> i'm<00:02:01.829> going

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
so there we have the base and i'm going

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.249 
so there we have the base and i'm going
to<00:02:02.310> use<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.030> looks<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.659> last<00:02:03.960> little

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
to use and it looks like the last little

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.520 
to use and it looks like the last little
piece<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.950> my<00:02:05.659> whisper<00:02:06.659> white<00:02:06.810> taffeta<00:02:07.229> ribbon

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
piece of my whisper white taffeta ribbon

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.720 
piece of my whisper white taffeta ribbon
and<00:02:08.390> i'm<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.929> trim<00:02:10.770> off<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.129> edge<00:02:11.280> there

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
and i'm going to trim off the edge there

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.370 
and i'm going to trim off the edge there
because<00:02:12.180> it's<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.569> end

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
because it's the end

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.350 
because it's the end
and<00:02:13.550> I'm<00:02:14.550> going<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.890> match<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.190> top<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:18.330> that
