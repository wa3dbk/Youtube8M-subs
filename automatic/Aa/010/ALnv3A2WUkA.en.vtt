 sweden we have say let's start 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.809
 in a tense 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:15.239
 3 quotes beliefs in summer 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.609
 Miguel Barnet are very harmful 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.859
 they are easy to make 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.859
 stylist while consumption very quickly 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.329
 how they spoke to us of alzira knows how to root to go yes no then no 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.329
 ethics a little bit sideways 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:57.979
 once we have it like that 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.929
 we are going to kill the hopes but that they see 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.220
 let's take it crowned by eta is that the small ticas 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.709
 the 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.889
 according to a mx palette 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:18.989
 quique 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.239
 in your optics and you do not have to do 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.239
 the rest so that we look good 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.169
 very good with him we have this 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.359

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:40.399
 as signs 

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:41.899
 if we 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.909
 we will see being tail 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.839
 then I took mons 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:50.229
 I do not really know where they leave me 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.229
 aberastain oils 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:59.249
 we take it 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.419
 Tehran 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.709
 Not only 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.169
 vonn 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.169
 a tuft quoted from the who 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.539
 so what are we going to do vance 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:14.939
 catching little by little 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.939
 I hope it is well sting 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.639
 we would take 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.569
 Stockholm ap to the state 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.569
 low and year of agreement 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.419
 continuation 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.479
 with the same time as being operated 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:43.949
 we paint them 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.949
 and let's go to rosario 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.930
 in damask in concrete 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.120
 is going to form killer 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.680
 we did not put it like that 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.069
 and this address 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.069
 will be the fifth is let's say the entity 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.900
 and here we had the palette 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.900
 next says 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.550
 I do not understand 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.550
 behind 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.139
 further back is not our case because the number of endorsements 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.620
 but unless we are 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.199
 with a pigtail 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.520
 invisible
