few things 55 year old guy writing
probably<00:00:26.359> actively<00:00:27.359> since<00:00:27.660> 1993<00:00:29.119> just<00:00:30.119> got

probably actively since 1993 just got
this<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.990> replace<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.369> 2001<00:00:33.020> XT<00:00:34.040> full

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
this to replace a 2001 XT full

suspension<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.360> thing<00:00:36.630> makes<00:00:37.620> writing

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
suspension so this thing makes writing

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.540 
suspension so this thing makes writing
fun<00:00:38.489> again<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> first<00:00:41.040> things<00:00:41.309> I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
fun again so one of the first things I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.950 
fun again so one of the first things I
noticed<00:00:42.000> was<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:43.770> geometry<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.870> just<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
noticed was the the geometry and just a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.010 
noticed was the the geometry and just a
position<00:00:46.469> much<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.520> upright<00:00:48.120> position<00:00:48.750> much

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
position much more upright position much

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.010 
position much more upright position much
easier<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.680> take<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> breath<00:00:50.480> generally<00:00:51.480> easier

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
easier to take a breath generally easier

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.049 
easier to take a breath generally easier
to<00:00:52.170> keep<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:52.949> those<00:00:53.070> long<00:00:53.340> long<00:00:53.520> runs

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
to keep going for those long long runs

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.279 
to keep going for those long long runs
first<00:00:54.329> time<00:00:54.539> at<00:00:54.660> around<00:00:55.070> 19<00:00:56.070> miles<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.289> 5000

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
first time at around 19 miles and 5000

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.060 
first time at around 19 miles and 5000
feet<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.739> vertical<00:00:59.010> ascent<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.090> descent<00:01:00.120> so

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
feet of vertical ascent and descent so

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.390 
feet of vertical ascent and descent so
really<00:01:02.070> good<00:01:02.250> nice<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.120> do<00:01:03.559> 29<00:01:04.559> wheels<00:01:04.860> these

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
really good nice to do 29 wheels these

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.740 
really good nice to do 29 wheels these
are<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:05.760> at<00:01:05.939> 28<00:01:06.799> psi<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.820> they<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.330> really

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
are now at 28 psi and they just really

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.460 
are now at 28 psi and they just really
do<00:01:09.960> smooth<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.560> ride<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.220> beautifully

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
do smooth the ride out so beautifully

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.630 
do smooth the ride out so beautifully
suspension<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.680> don't<00:01:14.040> think<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.250> using<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
suspension I don't think I'm using the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.850 
suspension I don't think I'm using the
full<00:01:14.960> 130<00:01:15.960> millimeters<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.650> front

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
full 130 millimeters of the front

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.410 
full 130 millimeters of the front
suspension<00:01:16.950> yet<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.880> ever<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:19.200> this

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
suspension yet if I ever do but this

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.469 
suspension yet if I ever do but this
climb<00:01:21.420> trail<00:01:21.990> descent<00:01:22.590> setting<00:01:23.270> really<00:01:24.270> does

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
climb trail descent setting really does

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.770 
climb trail descent setting really does
help<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.710> make<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.880> write<00:01:27.180> down<00:01:27.479> so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
help and make the the write down so

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.410 
help and make the the write down so
incredibly<00:01:28.229> smooth<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.950> totally<00:01:29.909> recommend

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
incredibly smooth so totally recommend

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.870 
incredibly smooth so totally recommend
and<00:01:30.900> again<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.979> friend<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.310> mine<00:01:32.430> referred<00:01:32.549> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and again in friend of mine referred to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.539 
and again in friend of mine referred to
this<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.210> sled<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.990> guess<00:01:34.710> that's<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.280> it

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
this as a sled I guess that's what it

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.600 
this as a sled I guess that's what it
feels<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.090> sometimes<00:01:36.950> another<00:01:37.950> big<00:01:38.369> deal

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
feels like sometimes another big deal

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
feels like sometimes another big deal
for<00:01:38.670> me<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.810> can't<00:01:40.020> quite<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.500> here

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
for me and you can't quite see it here

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.330 
for me and you can't quite see it here
is<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> two<00:01:41.670> front<00:01:42.229> chainrings<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:44.130> just

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is just the two front chainrings so just

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.789 
is just the two front chainrings so just
moving<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.670> bike<00:01:44.820> over<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.409> see

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
moving the bike over you can just see

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.740 
moving the bike over you can just see
they're<00:01:47.070> very<00:01:47.280> light<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:47.909> not<00:01:48.030> very<00:01:48.210> good<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
they're very light it's not very good to

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.460 
they're very light it's not very good to
front<00:01:49.619> chainrings<00:01:50.130> ten<00:01:50.670> at<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.600> back<00:01:51.930> for

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
front chainrings ten at the back for

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.969 
front chainrings ten at the back for
each<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.890> those<00:01:53.040> 15<00:01:53.939> 20<00:01:54.240> years<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.710> terms

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
each of those 15 20 years and in terms

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.850 
each of those 15 20 years and in terms
of<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.399> ease<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.820> writing<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.860> lower

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
of just ease of writing it's like lower

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.450 
of just ease of writing it's like lower
front<00:01:59.219> cog<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.939> climbing<00:02:00.590> out<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.890> front<00:02:02.130> cog

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
front cog for climbing out of front cog

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.310 
front cog for climbing out of front cog
for<00:02:02.790> descending<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:03.780> all<00:02:04.049> i've

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
for descending and that's all i've

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.469 
for descending and that's all i've
seemed<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.740> need<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.219> far<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:06.210> really

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
seemed to need so far just really really

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.800 
seemed to need so far just really really
smooth<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> easy<00:02:07.140> brakes<00:02:08.099> are<00:02:08.310> awesome<00:02:08.819> ride

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
smooth and easy brakes are awesome ride

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.350 
smooth and easy brakes are awesome ride
is<00:02:10.020> amazing<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.979> incredibly<00:02:11.640> dexterous

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
is amazing and incredibly dexterous

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.940 
is amazing and incredibly dexterous
balance<00:02:12.930> points<00:02:13.410> really<00:02:13.620> be

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
balance points really be

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.240 
balance points really be
for<00:02:14.129> first<00:02:15.060> time<00:02:15.120> for<00:02:15.480> me<00:02:15.569> on<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> 29<00:02:16.260> and

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
for first time for me on a 29 and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.430 
for first time for me on a 29 and
realizing<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.269> sort<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.660> delicate<00:02:18.870> sort<00:02:19.319> of

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
realizing that sort of delicate sort of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.009 
realizing that sort of delicate sort of
forward<00:02:20.000> backward<00:02:21.000> movement<00:02:21.239> on<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.720> seat

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
forward backward movement on the seat

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.470 
forward backward movement on the seat
really<00:02:22.950> isn't<00:02:23.069> anywhere<00:02:23.489> near<00:02:23.760> as<00:02:23.910> necessary

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
really isn't anywhere near as necessary

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.300 
really isn't anywhere near as necessary
