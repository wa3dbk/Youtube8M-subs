00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:03.339
 It's a net, it's strong 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.900
 Nanjing street 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.699
 I was motivated but successful 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.699
 It is because the mission is successful 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:16.829
 Settlement money 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.659
 In the video 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:20.869
 It seemed to be selfish 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.939
 It is over 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.630
 I usually go around 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.630
 Go to the next room and make it successful 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.860
 Buddha Danon biscuit also 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.760
 Because it was too long 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.830
 Mass delete 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.400
 Please 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.400
 Well that's pretty much always 1 hour 2 hours 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.150
 A total of about 2 hours 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.260
 Because it was that normal time 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.720
 I thought it wasn't really interesting 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.740
 Royalty 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740
 Until entering 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.420
 Even after entering 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.540
 When will you think of a cover 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.310
 Below anchor 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.440
 Smith would be nice 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.890
 There were quite a few opposition parties, though 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.520
 But it seems the first time 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.980
 I've got a lot of concerns for reconstruction 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.410
 Exhaust all 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.860
 It is over 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.400
 may be visit 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.430
 It is quite low though 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.430
 I think I lost a mistake at once 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.640
 You may be tall 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.630
 About 2 hours of growth 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.450
 I want my husband to tell me 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.460
 Because I hated things 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.580
 While specifying 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.740
 From the middle 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.890
 Addition 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.890
 I succeeded in the theme used after Yankee success 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.430
 When I think from the mainland that I first struck my heart I succeeded 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.320
 Body 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.630
 There is not much but one day Saitama basically continues 1 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.130
 I'm thinking about doing that 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.420
 I do not know whether it is true to set up too long 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.150
 But it becomes like this 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.570
 The prelude was a bit cold 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 I'm going to get hurt 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.030
 Just mentioned 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.030
 Cathedral of the museum 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.869
 I also got blood circulation 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.869
 Next chapter 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.979
 But to release 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:17.979
 The Nikkei continued to fall 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.149
 I have Kanagawa 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.809
 Usually half past 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:32.369
 I only have to enter 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.369
 * 20 down 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:45.959
 Something but 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.319
 Distribute 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.319
 Will continue 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.459
 Both go and only neighboring country group nsg itself 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.139
 It is platformed here 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.439
 Kitajima is unusual 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.659
 Games for India 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.989
 Can this be this band too 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.989
 Kitamoto Takeya small was good but bitter 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:20.609
 Telework 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.329
 The country is in full swing 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.769
 There is no way 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.080
 I do not know what 560 is 550 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.609
 Top of topic it 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.180
 if it is ko 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.199
 A little bit 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.569
 A dangerous bell 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.209
 Takatsu made honrou 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.819
 Ichigaya place 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.819
 I understand if the military can 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.539
 Each signature check 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.249
 special event 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:57.829
 Two people Zura 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.409
 I was a sticker 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.409
 Keiji's next line 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:25.159
 It's not a stone 

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.289
 Still did 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.360
 I have a miss 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.779
 I made it with the sticker of the contestant 

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:34.490
 have not decided 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.669
 Certainly it has become easier to come out 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.870
 Lifetime youth 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.870
 On the other hand, each store was in succession 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.210
 5 more items were given 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.869
 I wonder if it will be for the accumulation of Tsurugi plateau 

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:57.069
 I think 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.159
 International Potato Memorabilia 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.159
 cafp 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.309
 More open 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:10.959
 From now on private life will be done on the 20th more than 2 round trips a day 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.099
 Pass through 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.740
 Nearly 1300 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.740
 US House of Representatives 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.599
 Certainly marked the young dialect automatically 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.599
 Wonderful environmental win 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.659
 Start around 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.659

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.789
 Among members of the preservation society 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:55.129
 Another 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.129
