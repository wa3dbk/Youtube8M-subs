00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.580 
going to show you how to do that I first
attempted<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:24.030> access<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.900> tensioner<00:02:25.410> which

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
attempted to access the tensioner which

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.550 
attempted to access the tensioner which
is<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:27.150> don't<00:02:27.780> nothing's<00:02:28.140> here<00:02:28.230> knob<00:02:28.410> it's

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
is I don't nothing's here knob it's

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.140 
is I don't nothing's here knob it's
right<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:31.489> through<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.579> top<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.910> car

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
right here through the top of the car

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.699 
right here through the top of the car
but<00:02:33.450> as<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:33.989> see<00:02:34.079> there's<00:02:34.350> all<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.500> jazz

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
but as you can see there's all this jazz

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.130 
but as you can see there's all this jazz
in<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.010> way<00:02:35.130> here<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.609> I<00:02:35.850> tend<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.810> go<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
in the way here so I tend to go to the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.050 
in the way here so I tend to go to the
bottom<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:38.579> also<00:02:38.790> failed<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:41.060> see

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
bottom and that also failed so I see

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.930 
bottom and that also failed so I see
that<00:02:42.299> in<00:02:42.480> my<00:02:42.630> instructions<00:02:42.989> here<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:44.370> has<00:02:44.579> a

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
that in my instructions here it has a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.080 
that in my instructions here it has a
special<00:02:45.660> tool<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:47.400> number<00:02:47.670> here<00:02:47.850> which<00:02:48.000> is

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
special tool this number here which is

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.630 
special tool this number here which is
basically<00:02:48.329> just<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.660> flat<00:02:49.019> bar<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:50.220> you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
basically just like a flat bar and you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.430 
basically just like a flat bar and you
got<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.850> have<00:02:50.940> some<00:02:51.209> small<00:02:51.600> hands<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.109> get<00:02:52.230> that

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
got to have some small hands to get that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.150 
got to have some small hands to get that
get<00:02:53.130> at<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.370> nut<00:02:53.720> so<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.750> call<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.769> rollies

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
get at that nut so I call the rollies

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.009 
get at that nut so I call the rollies
and<00:02:56.400> lucky<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.790> luckily<00:02:57.359> enough<00:02:57.630> they<00:02:57.870> have

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
and lucky and luckily enough they have

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.900 
and lucky and luckily enough they have
this<00:02:59.480> V<00:03:00.480> belt<00:03:00.750> removal<00:03:01.709> tool<00:03:01.920> it's<00:03:02.640> basically

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
this V belt removal tool it's basically

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.840 
this V belt removal tool it's basically
like<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.120> skinny<00:03:04.070> breaker<00:03:05.070> bar<00:03:07.430> so<00:03:08.430> gave<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.790> a

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
like a skinny breaker bar so gave this a

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.650 
like a skinny breaker bar so gave this a
shot<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:10.250> unfortunately<00:03:11.359> this<00:03:12.359> doesn't

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
shot and unfortunately this doesn't

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.699 
shot and unfortunately this doesn't
really<00:03:12.750> work<00:03:12.840> because<00:03:13.319> there's<00:03:13.440> not<00:03:13.590> enough

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
really work because there's not enough

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.690 
really work because there's not enough
room<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.280> bad<00:03:14.459> boy

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
room for this bad boy

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.640 
room for this bad boy
so<00:03:15.140> what<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.170> went<00:03:16.319> ahead<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.709> did<00:03:16.890> is

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.089 

fired<00:03:21.190> up<00:03:21.340> my<00:03:21.520> 14<00:03:22.140> millimeter<00:03:23.340> wrench<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.980> as

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
fired up my 14 millimeter wrench and as

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.220 
fired up my 14 millimeter wrench and as
you<00:03:27.220> can<00:03:27.340> see<00:03:27.400> it's<00:03:27.730> on<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.120> tensioner<00:03:28.569> and

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
you can see it's on the tensioner and

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.780 
you can see it's on the tensioner and
what<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:29.830> want<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.040> do<00:03:30.130> is<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.370> want<00:03:30.520> to<00:03:30.580> turn

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
what you want to do is you want to turn

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.050 
what you want to do is you want to turn
this<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.330> slide<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.020> hex<00:03:32.349> key<00:03:32.940> through<00:03:33.940> this

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
this and slide a hex key through this

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.530 
this and slide a hex key through this
hole<00:03:34.270> into<00:03:34.540> this<00:03:35.099> void<00:03:36.099> right<00:03:36.340> here<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.390> what

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
hole into this void right here so what

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.490 
hole into this void right here so what
we're<00:03:37.630> going<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.780> do<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:38.050> when<00:03:38.170> I<00:03:38.200> go<00:03:38.290> ahead<00:03:38.410> and

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
we're going to do is when I go ahead and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.270 
we're going to do is when I go ahead and
do<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:40.590> I'm<00:03:41.590> going<00:03:41.709> to<00:03:41.800> try<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:41.980> find<00:03:42.160> a

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
do that and I'm going to try to find a

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.640 
do that and I'm going to try to find a
hex<00:03:42.430> key<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.760> fits<00:03:42.790> in<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.180> hole

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
hex key that fits in that hole

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.750 
hex key that fits in that hole
hopefully<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:44.920> will<00:03:45.010> be<00:03:45.160> a<00:03:45.190> simple<00:03:45.459> enough

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
hopefully this will be a simple enough

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.380 
hopefully this will be a simple enough
process<00:03:46.209> so<00:03:46.510> far<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:50.200> hasn't<00:03:50.410> been<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.769> easy

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
process so far it hasn't been that easy

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.090 
process so far it hasn't been that easy
but<00:03:52.390> Oh<00:03:53.160> see<00:03:54.160> okay<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:56.709> looks<00:03:56.860> like<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:57.040> I

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
but Oh see okay it looks like that I

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.380 
but Oh see okay it looks like that I
want<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.310> work<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:57.700> what<00:03:57.880> I'm<00:03:57.940> going<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.090> do<00:03:58.180> is

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
want to work so what I'm going to do is

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.289 
want to work so what I'm going to do is
give<00:03:58.600> this<00:03:58.690> a<00:03:58.840> shot<00:03:59.019> here<00:03:59.319> and<00:03:59.739> see<00:04:00.299> what

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
give this a shot here and see what

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.500 
give this a shot here and see what
happens<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:03.310> might<00:04:03.910> have<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.060> put<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.239> camera

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
happens I might have to put the camera

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.690 
happens I might have to put the camera
down<00:04:04.540> because<00:04:04.959> I<00:04:04.989> can't<00:04:05.319> hold<00:04:06.130> it<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.519> do<00:04:06.610> at

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
down because I can't hold it and do at

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.280 
down because I can't hold it and do at
the<00:04:06.730> same<00:04:06.819> time<00:04:07.120> but<00:04:07.360> anyways<00:04:07.959> I'm<00:04:08.110> going<00:04:08.200> to

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
the same time but anyways I'm going to

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:36.600 
the same time but anyways I'm going to
go<00:04:08.349> and<00:04:08.440> give<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.590> shot

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.580 

okay<00:04:38.380> finally<00:04:39.380> success<00:04:40.780> what<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:41.810> did<00:04:42.020> was<00:04:42.230> I

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
okay finally success what I did was I

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.140 
okay finally success what I did was I
turned<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.820> bolt

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
turned the bolt

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.040 
turned the bolt
counterclockwise<00:04:44.890> which<00:04:45.890> is<00:04:46.100> a<00:04:46.660> what<00:04:47.660> is<00:04:47.780> key

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
counterclockwise which is a what is key

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.450 
counterclockwise which is a what is key
here<00:04:48.320> because<00:04:48.620> if<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:48.770> turn<00:04:48.920> it<00:04:49.100> clockwise

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
here because if you turn it clockwise

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.950 
here because if you turn it clockwise
you<00:04:49.940> just<00:04:50.060> going<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.240> loosen<00:04:50.480> that<00:04:50.570> bolt<00:04:50.780> up

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
you just going to loosen that bolt up

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.090 
you just going to loosen that bolt up
there<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.200> don't<00:04:51.230> want<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.500> do<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:51.740> I

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
there you don't want to do that I

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.420 
there you don't want to do that I
learned<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:54.530> hard<00:04:54.680> way<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:55.040> it's<00:04:55.160> kind<00:04:55.370> of

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
learned the hard way that it's kind of

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.980 
learned the hard way that it's kind of
clockwise<00:04:55.640> but<00:04:56.360> anyways<00:04:56.630> we're<00:04:56.780> just<00:04:56.900> gonna

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
clockwise but anyways we're just gonna

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.950
