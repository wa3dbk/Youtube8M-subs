00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
put on stereo mix but it meant that Luke

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:05.719 
put on stereo mix but it meant that Luke

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
Sully's moves are a bit more better for

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.220 
Sully's moves are a bit more better for
fighting<00:04:05.640> they<00:04:05.910> usually<00:04:06.090> work<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.600> lot<00:04:06.870> better

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230
