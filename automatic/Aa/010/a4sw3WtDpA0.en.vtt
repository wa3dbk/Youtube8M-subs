I've tried it's a little syrupy but not
too<00:02:30.450> syrupy<00:02:30.780> where<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.200> going<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.380> be<00:02:31.500> you

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
too syrupy where it's going to be you

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.620 
too syrupy where it's going to be you
know<00:02:32.130> too<00:02:32.190> much<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.520> handle<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:33.090> definitely<00:02:33.450> say

the<00:02:34.320> shots<00:02:34.620> chill<00:02:35.130> are<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.550> best<00:02:35.760> way<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.940> have

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180

straight<00:02:38.880> up<00:02:38.910> not<00:02:39.480> chilled<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.990> might<00:02:40.200> be<00:02:40.320> a

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
straight up not chilled it might be a

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.140 
straight up not chilled it might be a
little<00:02:40.500> too<00:02:40.860> sweet<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.190> might<00:02:41.490> take<00:02:42.000> away

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
little too sweet you might take away

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
that honey factor a little bit more that

of the other honey whiskey's I've tried
not<00:03:24.989> as<00:03:25.530> overly<00:03:26.100> syrupy<00:03:26.580> or<00:03:26.730> sweet<00:03:27.120> in

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
not as overly syrupy or sweet in

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.449 
not as overly syrupy or sweet in
comparison<00:03:27.959> definitely<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.470> sweet<00:03:28.800> though<00:03:28.980> you

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
comparison definitely a sweet though you

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.940 
comparison definitely a sweet though you
take<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.820> away<00:03:29.940> right<00:03:30.060> away<00:03:30.650> but<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.680> think

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
take that away right away but I think

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.500 
take that away right away but I think
this<00:03:32.010> will<00:03:32.160> definitely<00:03:32.250> appeal<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.910> people

this will definitely appeal to people
that<00:03:33.600> are<00:03:33.720> just<00:03:33.900> getting<00:03:33.959> into<00:03:34.260> whiskey<00:03:34.560> or

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860

Tennessee<00:04:27.220> whiskey<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:27.850> now<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.810> silly

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
Tennessee whiskey and now the silly

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.290

proof<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:30.520> doesn't<00:04:30.820> really<00:04:30.940> taste<00:04:31.150> that

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.300 
proof it doesn't really taste that
strong<00:04:31.660> to<00:04:31.780> be<00:04:31.870> honest<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.229> alcohol<00:04:33.070> is<00:04:33.280> a

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
strong to be honest it alcohol is a

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.590 
strong to be honest it alcohol is a
little<00:04:33.550> bit<00:04:33.639> more<00:04:33.820> subdued<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.360> think<00:04:34.540> the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
little bit more subdued I think the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.450 
little bit more subdued I think the
honey<00:04:34.780> flavor<00:04:35.139> kind<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:35.830> covers<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.250> up<00:04:36.370> a

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
honey flavor kind of covers it up a

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.040 
honey flavor kind of covers it up a
little<00:04:36.639> bit<00:04:36.850> so<00:04:37.210> like<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.389> said<00:04:37.540> if<00:04:37.630> you're<00:04:37.780> a

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
little bit so like I said if you're a

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.870 
little bit so like I said if you're a
beginner<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.770> whiskey<00:04:39.100> this<00:04:39.639> could<00:04:39.790> be

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
beginner to whiskey this could be

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.159 
beginner to whiskey this could be
something<00:04:40.060> you'll<00:04:40.270> really<00:04:40.479> enjoy<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:40.960> think

something you'll really enjoy I think

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.260 
something you'll really enjoy I think
but<00:04:41.889> I<00:04:41.919> do<00:04:42.040> think<00:04:42.190> whiskey<00:04:42.490> aficionados<00:04:43.000> can't

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
but I do think whiskey aficionados can't

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.270 
but I do think whiskey aficionados can't
appreciate<00:04:43.510> as<00:04:43.870> well<00:04:43.900> some<00:04:44.740> people<00:04:44.860> might<00:04:45.070> be

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
a little bit hesitant like I said but
