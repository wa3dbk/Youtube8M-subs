00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.460
 good ah3n2 not yet lived news that the 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:07.140
 truth is not being anything 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.600
 relevant not in the world of 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 video games so it seems 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.290
 quite pity you already know always 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 I ask for support and in this video more than ever 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.240
 I do not think it 's pretty cool 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.279
 emotional news in a certain sense and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.619
 pretty impressive at least for 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.590
 me and for all the people that you 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.119
 like the asad batman arkham basically 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.460
 well, it seems that recently 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.279
 few days will rock stay from 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.770
 developers of the batman arkham saga 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.890
 both both the first and the second 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.199
 arkham city and arkham asylum then 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.199
 they said that in arkham city 'well then 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.510
 there was a secret to discover you already know 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.730
 that soon they will launch the game 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.519
 the last one in the saga and well it seems 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.079
 be a group of youtube one about 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.820
 youtube batman arkham videos well then 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.859
 He went to work to discover 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.300
 this secret is not basically 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.579
 speaking to a few few clues 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.640
 quite difficult to discover and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.640
 basically putting the web console pc to 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.040
 the date of December 13 , 2004 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.370
 when 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.470
 when the rocksteady studios was created and 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.330
 if we visit also it is at that moment 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.730
 with that date on both the console 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.380
 like in pc if we go to man 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.150
 Calendar basically within the game 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.760
 Well, he says he does not have some things 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.920
 different in the last this stereo that 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.260
 we can find this because it is revealed 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.940
 three years later the game came out in 2011 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.530
 and age as I say enough 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.820
 awesome is not a pretty message 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.310
 emotive not that as I say it marks the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.900
 beginning and end of this saga no me 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.479
 I am the one who is going to finish 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.410
 there are many ballots that possibly 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.000
 maybe batman die in that in this 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.410
 last game I do not know I 'm a 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.330
 I guess I have no fucking 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.790
 idea is not that I have read anything or anything 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.080
 rumor or anything but I get the feeling or 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.490
 it gives me that feeling hopefully not 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.440
 spend none of that and when they are followed 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.570
 making games and others although it restricts 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.100
 do not make them the message is the following and 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.800
 good you have it in the description itself 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.110
 you want to go look at it and other good is 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.460
 as I say in English the message but 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.470
 well we have already translated it in Ã¡re 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.510
 gamers and basically because it says what 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.130
 next go go go and just today 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.220
 between every day remember my 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.680
 earlier work 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.330
 He had his faults but it was very promising 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.650
 just like you at the same time that your 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.870
 skills have improved I've 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.220
 perfected mine starting with the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.170
 seasons and following through 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.330
 weeks I have become stronger my 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.740
 more elaborate work the days were the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.110
 secret bands at the end of the days 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.940
 was approaching I was there in your beginnings and 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.220
 I'll be there in your final obviously 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.920
 that refers a little to the trajectory 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.810
 what the developer and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.270
 so and so good that soon 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.200
 as I say when it becomes arcane 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:49.080
 light it will end the saga and good 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.240
 that will basically be there and I do not know if 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.570
 I'll be there in your final, I do not know, it sounds 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.160
 a little bit bad not also like 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.930
 saying that maybe you can 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.430
 They dwelled evils but I hope not but 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.560
 good if I enrich that I hope it's another 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.209
 another thing I do not know that comes out again 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.640
 calendar man or something like that 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.320
 but good month to month a little more I do not know 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.270
 I interpreted so as not to be a 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.340
 little the path of rocksteady what 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.020
 you can interpret from another of another 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.970
 way logically everyone has their 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.070
 interpretations and it can be something that 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.480
 be in the game or something that is going to 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.280
 spend in arkham light or something by 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.170
 style how impressive is this 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.090
 game 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.730
 secrets that the developers in 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.340
 able to put esther ex-hidden despite 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.290
 it's better they will not discover or 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.330
 time neither in time nor in time I believe 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.860
 that encourages people who are looking for 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.290
 this lesson the games not that you can that 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.319
 there are hidden things that still 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.110
 have not even found it not so 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.880
 good to start looking for things like 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.459
 let's say they are always pretty showy 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.200
 and good is the acid so nothing else 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.950
 kids this if we do not take the next 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.950
 video until next time
