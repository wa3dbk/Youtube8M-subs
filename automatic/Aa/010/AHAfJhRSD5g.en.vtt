00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.260 
the back there's a three megapixel
camera<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.160> don't<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.730> you'll<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.940> taking

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
camera I don't think you'll be taking

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.750 
camera I don't think you'll be taking
too<00:01:03.600> many<00:01:03.840> photos<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.619> too<00:01:04.890> many<00:01:05.010> snapshots<00:01:05.339> or

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
too many photos to too many snapshots or

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.630 
too many photos to too many snapshots or
photos<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.860> tablet<00:01:08.220> so

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
photos with this with this tablet so

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.080 
photos with this with this tablet so
through<00:01:09.510> megapixel<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> fine<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:12.060> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
through megapixel I think is fine for a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.050 
through megapixel I think is fine for a
tablet<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.380> display<00:01:13.860> actually<00:01:14.460> isn't<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
tablet the display actually isn't that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.270 
tablet the display actually isn't that
amazing<00:01:15.330> it's<00:01:15.720> not<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> Super<00:01:16.380> AMOLED<00:01:16.770> panel

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
amazing it's not a Super AMOLED panel

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.120 
amazing it's not a Super AMOLED panel
it's<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.420> WS<00:01:18.900> VGA<00:01:19.409> which<00:01:19.710> means<00:01:19.920> its

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it's just a WS VGA which means its

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.320 
it's just a WS VGA which means its
original<00:01:20.610> resolution<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:22.009> 1024<00:01:23.009> by<00:01:23.250> 600<00:01:23.610> so

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
original resolution of 1024 by 600 so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
original resolution of 1024 by 600 so
it's<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.900> best<00:01:25.170> resolution<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.979> the

it's not the best resolution in the

variant anyways and I want to just talk

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.199 
variant anyways and I want to just talk
about<00:02:34.200> why<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.709> naming<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.670> these<00:02:35.879> tablets

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
about why the naming of these tablets

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.300 
about why the naming of these tablets
might<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:36.689> confusing<00:02:37.079> cuz<00:02:37.349> Samson<00:02:37.769> does<00:02:38.069> have

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
might be confusing cuz Samson does have

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.910 
might be confusing cuz Samson does have
their<00:02:38.489> own<00:02:38.639> Galaxy<00:02:39.209> Note<00:02:39.450> line<00:02:39.480> which<00:02:40.409> started

their own Galaxy Note line which started

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.160 
their own Galaxy Note line which started

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
off as a mostly like a smart phone as a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.460 
off as a mostly like a smart phone as a
like<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.030> phone<00:02:45.030> basically<00:02:45.389> they<00:02:46.139> had<00:02:46.319> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
like a phone basically they had the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.429 
like a phone basically they had the
Galaxy<00:02:47.040> Note<00:02:47.159> one<00:02:47.549> which<00:02:48.209> was<00:02:48.419> a<00:02:48.450> large<00:02:48.870> phone

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
Galaxy Note one which was a large phone

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.009 
Galaxy Note one which was a large phone
so<00:02:49.859> it<00:02:50.010> was<00:02:50.159> near<00:02:50.909> it<00:02:51.150> was<00:02:51.299> like<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.569> phablet

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
so it was near it was like the phablet

so it was near it was like the phablet
territory<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:52.889> then<00:02:53.310> they<00:02:53.459> have<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:53.760> Galaxy

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
territory and then they have the Galaxy

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.690 
territory and then they have the Galaxy
Note<00:02:54.329> 2<00:02:54.389> and<00:02:54.959> now<00:02:55.379> they<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.919> Galaxy<00:02:56.430> Note

Note 2 and now they have the Galaxy Note
8<00:02:56.939> and<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.389> is<00:02:57.599> official<00:02:58.109> name<00:02:58.319> for<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.769> the

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
8 and that is official name for and the

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.000 
8 and that is official name for and the
weird<00:02:59.099> part<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.639> that<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.780> Galaxy<00:03:01.290> Note<00:03:01.469> 8<00:03:01.769> is

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
weird part is that the Galaxy Note 8 is

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.550 
weird part is that the Galaxy Note 8 is
called<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:03.090> Galaxy<00:03:03.450> Note<00:03:03.599> 8<00:03:03.780> because<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.409> its

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
called the Galaxy Note 8 because of its

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.940 
called the Galaxy Note 8 because of its
screen<00:03:04.950> size<00:03:05.540> whereas<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:07.139> Galaxy<00:03:07.530> Note<00:03:07.709> 2

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
screen size whereas the Galaxy Note 2

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.789 
screen size whereas the Galaxy Note 2
the<00:03:08.280> Galaxy<00:03:08.579> Note<00:03:08.700> one<00:03:08.939> is<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.419> called<00:03:09.799> by

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
the Galaxy Note one is just called by

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.830 
the Galaxy Note one is just called by
it's<00:03:11.159> just<00:03:11.400> iterations<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.389> it<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:12.689> the<00:03:12.810> next

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
it's just iterations of it so the next

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.959 
it's just iterations of it so the next
one<00:03:13.200> will<00:03:13.439> be<00:03:13.469> called<00:03:13.739> Galaxy<00:03:14.219> Note<00:03:14.400> 3<00:03:14.760> but

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:14.969 
one will be called Galaxy Note 3 but

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.780 
one will be called Galaxy Note 3 but
it's<00:03:15.930> weird<00:03:16.260> how<00:03:16.469> Samsung's<00:03:16.950> also<00:03:17.489> doing<00:03:17.699> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
it's weird how Samsung's also doing the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.550 
it's weird how Samsung's also doing the
same<00:03:17.819> thing<00:03:18.180> for<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.479> Galaxy<00:03:18.959> Tab<00:03:19.229> series

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
same thing for the Galaxy Tab series

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.830 
same thing for the Galaxy Tab series
they're<00:03:20.220> calling<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.639> one<00:03:20.879> two<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.419> three

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
they're calling it one two and three

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.289 
they're calling it one two and three
whereas<00:03:22.709> for<00:03:23.159> their<00:03:23.310> other<00:03:23.489> tablets<00:03:24.060> they're

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
whereas for their other tablets they're

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.050 
whereas for their other tablets they're
naming<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:24.810> by<00:03:24.989> screen<00:03:25.620> size<00:03:25.979> so<00:03:26.010> there's<00:03:26.879> some

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
naming it by screen size so there's some

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.939 
naming it by screen size so there's some
confusion<00:03:27.269> there<00:03:27.629> it's<00:03:28.109> I<00:03:28.409> don't<00:03:28.560> understand

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
confusion there it's I don't understand

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.379 
confusion there it's I don't understand
why<00:03:29.220> Samsung<00:03:29.609> is<00:03:29.790> doing<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.090> they<00:03:30.209> should

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
why Samsung is doing that they should

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.879 
why Samsung is doing that they should
pretty<00:03:30.599> much<00:03:30.780> just<00:03:30.930> standardize<00:03:31.470> it

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
pretty much just standardize it

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.189 
pretty much just standardize it
I<00:03:31.919> think<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.519> variant<00:03:33.030> thing<00:03:33.329> I<00:03:33.900> mean<00:03:34.109> the

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
I think the variant thing I mean the

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.429 
I think the variant thing I mean the
iteration<00:03:34.859> is<00:03:35.129> a<00:03:35.159> good<00:03:35.459> idea<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.870> keep<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.260> don't

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 
iteration is a good idea to keep I don't

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.399 
iteration is a good idea to keep I don't
think<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.739> screen<00:03:38.099> size<00:03:38.459> thing<00:03:39.239> is<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:40.169> good

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
think the screen size thing is that good

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:41.689 
think the screen size thing is that good
of<00:03:40.530> an<00:03:40.650> idea<00:03:40.739> like<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:41.250> don't<00:03:41.400> think<00:03:41.549> calling

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
of an idea like I don't think calling

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:44.899 
of an idea like I don't think calling
every<00:03:42.209> tablet<00:03:42.599> the<00:03:42.840> Galaxy<00:03:43.319> Note<00:03:43.530> 8<00:03:44.159> 2<00:03:44.579> and

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
every tablet the Galaxy Note 8 2 and

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.960 
every tablet the Galaxy Note 8 2 and
then<00:03:45.329> 8<00:03:45.569> 3<00:03:45.959> 8<00:03:46.229> 4<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:47.040> don't<00:03:47.459> think<00:03:47.609> that'll<00:03:47.819> be<00:03:47.849> a

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
then 8 3 8 4 I don't think that'll be a

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.249 
then 8 3 8 4 I don't think that'll be a
good<00:03:48.120> idea<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.509> should<00:03:48.659> just<00:03:48.900> they<00:03:49.049> should

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
good idea it should just they should

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.920 
good idea it should just they should
stick<00:03:49.530> with<00:03:50.120> iterations<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.299> it<00:03:51.449> or<00:03:51.659> they

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
stick with iterations of it or they

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.809 
stick with iterations of it or they
should<00:03:52.109> just<00:03:52.229> call<00:03:52.439> it<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.590> Galaxy<00:03:53.069> Note<00:03:53.220> the

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
should just call it the Galaxy Note the

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.059 
should just call it the Galaxy Note the
new<00:03:54.030> Galaxy<00:03:54.540> Note<00:03:54.689> tab<00:03:54.930> or<00:03:55.530> something<00:03:55.919> like

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
new Galaxy Note tab or something like

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.270 
new Galaxy Note tab or something like
that

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
that

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.879 
that
