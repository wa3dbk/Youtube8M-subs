00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.069
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.150
 new video to disney us and now the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.559
 have five golden boxes on mars 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.540
 we already brought all the boxes it is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.850
 last now in last planet yes so 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 nice here on the patriotic customer 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.890
 on the patrol and the last one at 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.260
 a strike but what exactly he would be though 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.640
 possible I would also turn would 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.170
 also from different story missions 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.760
 but come in, I think here 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.769
 It is easiest for everyone then 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
 you can also see the exact way from 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.579
 yes, it is not there that I am 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.020
 the problems you have with her 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.090
 any mission areas jack white 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.070
 Do not you have where we save and have 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.960
 noticed then print as it was 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.930
 you already have all the boxes with you 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.649
 I think we did not have one 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.820
 So had a stolen account 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:57.000
 No, I generally think if you look at the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.649
 with loca and all have had a total of 5 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.160
 There is a lot on every planet earth 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.960
 missing 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.579
 it's hard here comes even if there 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.920
 someday my plenter will come future 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.720
 This is definitely going to be here 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.570
 currently and currently at one 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 ten-year plan and the game is still 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.310
 No year outside, it's clear that we 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.909
 the basics also outwardly show 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.830
 must also be 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.360
 Do not say the comments again now 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.159
 still question mark yes so I mean 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.119
 Disney is played and if you have it 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.890
 believe or not 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.380
 there will still be destiny titles 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.880
 bought there are also newcomers every day 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.460
 in german-speaking countries and want 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.170
 Know where the boxes are because he too 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.729
 just partially for the good cut 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.159
 this is just for the newcomers 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.140
 because you're happy about everything if he is 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.180
 For example, it's in there or something 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.890
 a gram or coins or theses 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.270
 heavy moni are they have 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.820
 usually holds or instead 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.890
 for example here shortly from 9 september 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.810
 where he then this exclusive banner that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.600
 last year where you can get it 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.700
 and then the people start 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.229
 These days somehow and then missing 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.040
 her still somehow the box or so me 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.689
 Do not know 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.970
 then you are happy if you have this 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.190
 Of course, you 're looking for a rome quickly 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.080
 I can only say it will turn off 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.790
 we are here an info channel demo 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.850
 we started our first video 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.789
 cry for the analysis we wanted the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.560
 Newcomers help to understand why it is 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.239
 Maybe this is important now 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.370
 week to buy an item 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.660
 you know every man was then even 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.340
 Do not sell anymore then you are right 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.050
 but something then, and that's why we 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.640
 this channel does not start the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.930
 We had it before but we did 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.709
 then with which they started exactly 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.300
 therefore 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.769
 and it is very clear that we 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.790
 as soon as we have time then the 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.680
 golden throne 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.920
 then show where he should also everything 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.200
 helps everything in vain counts as I said 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.880
 on the fakuma there are the little guests 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.900
 but I did not cover them 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.090
 found by accident 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.799
 that is blatant I believe even as me 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.340
 I was looking for your spirit because I was over 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.340
 searched everything 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.580
 So if someone again at the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.160
 strange minster needs then you know 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.680
 where is that yes yes otherwise for the or 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.930
 quite honestly back then as 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.299
 newbie you can strike your twilight strike 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.370
 did 9 or the president still 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.250
 times in weekly strike 19 coins 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.090
 because it means me too 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.769
 missing coins 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.870
 you can buy the exotic one-handed 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.500
 At that time, they were not the same horn 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.000
 to buy 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.739
 By the way, where her rating shot 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.870
 then would be synonymous one the arminia 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.260
 but also because we were there 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.180
 have just sought the funny spirit 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.230
 Visitors to spirits feel themselves 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.510
 furl 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.190
 they are sometimes close to each other 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.019
 considering the things are 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.450
 actually better or harder too 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.910
 find because there are about 70 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.730
 spirits distributed everywhere but there are 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.820
 only 20 boxes 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.260
 that's true less so this less 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.880
 or not I have them 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.959
 now I brought or at least I have to 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.850
 get me now 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.709
 Here he joined himself still in october 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.780
 I'm watching my videos 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.080
 I also thought I have 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.390
 thought it could help 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.410
 I search the box daily on zero tv 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.980
 Let's look at the things 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.830

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.810
