this question what could we possibly do
to<00:00:18.300> help<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.750> an<00:00:18.869> impact<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.680> need<00:00:20.060> well

in<00:01:13.590> theory<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.490> hard<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.150> imagine<00:01:15.240> feeding

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890

18,000 kids a meal each and every single

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.469 
18,000 kids a meal each and every single
day<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.159> broke<00:01:20.369> out<00:01:20.549> our<00:01:20.700> calculators<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
day but we broke out our calculators and

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.320 
day but we broke out our calculators and
we<00:01:21.960> did<00:01:22.140> some<00:01:22.170> math<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.610> realized<00:01:24.000> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
we did some math and we realized it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.899 
we did some math and we realized it's
not<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.049> hard<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.920> only<00:01:26.100> takes<00:01:26.430> 72

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
not that hard it only takes 72
