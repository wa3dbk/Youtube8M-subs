button let's find out in this
head-to-head<00:00:36.660> spec<00:00:36.989> comparison<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.679> it's<00:00:37.769> not

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
head-to-head spec comparison so it's not

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:39.200 
head-to-head spec comparison so it's not
enough<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> size<00:00:38.429> there's<00:00:38.940> not<00:00:39.089> actually
