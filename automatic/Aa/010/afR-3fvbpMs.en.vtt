steel<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:24.830> but<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.100> very<00:01:26.430> good<00:01:26.640> steel

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
steel it is but it's not very good steel

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.730 
steel it is but it's not very good steel
it<00:01:27.210> won't<00:01:27.450> keep<00:01:27.689> an<00:01:27.869> edge<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.290> long<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it won't keep an edge for that long and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
it won't keep an edge for that long and
the<00:01:29.189> edge<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.579> comes<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.509> really

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the edge it comes with is just really

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.980 
the edge it comes with is just really
really<00:01:31.320> dull<00:01:31.729> like<00:01:32.729> most<00:01:33.450> knives<00:01:33.689> when<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
really dull like most knives when you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.539 
really dull like most knives when you
get<00:01:34.110> them<00:01:34.200> first<00:01:34.439> off<00:01:34.619> they're<00:01:34.890> usually<00:01:35.040> sharp

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
get them first off they're usually sharp

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.010 
get them first off they're usually sharp

stiff<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.599> that's<00:02:20.599> maybe<00:02:21.500> that's<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:21.890> my

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
stiff and that's maybe that's just my

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.479 
stiff and that's maybe that's just my
knife

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
people having problems with stiffness in

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.180 
people having problems with stiffness in
their<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:27.829> their<00:02:29.019> stilettos<00:02:30.019> not<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.620> locking

carbon fiber scales it has a texture

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.990 
carbon fiber scales it has a texture
it's<00:02:37.519> not<00:02:37.959> actually<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:40.400> like<00:02:40.549> painted

here with a hole in it
you<00:02:59.569> can<00:02:59.720> see<00:02:59.870> right<00:03:00.019> there<00:03:00.079> and<00:03:01.930> on<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.680> knife

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
you can see right there and on the knife

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.360 
you can see right there and on the knife
itself<00:03:04.519> there's<00:03:05.389> on<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.019> blade<00:03:06.280> there's<00:03:07.280> a

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
itself there's on the blade there's a

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.660 
itself there's on the blade there's a
little<00:03:07.670> pin<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:09.049> pin<00:03:09.319> goes<00:03:09.859> into<00:03:10.220> the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
little pin and that pin goes into the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.140 
little pin and that pin goes into the
hole<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.769> causes<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:13.130> lock<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:13.790> if

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
hole and causes it to lock so that if

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.550 
hole and causes it to lock so that if
something's<00:03:14.660> pressing<00:03:15.049> on<00:03:15.139> the<00:03:15.200> back<00:03:15.319> it

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
something's pressing on the back it

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.759 
something's pressing on the back it
won't<00:03:15.650> close<00:03:16.209> until<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.329> push<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:17.810> which

won't close until you push this which

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.199 
won't close until you push this which
makes<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.930> hold<00:03:20.930> metal<00:03:21.440> push<00:03:22.370> back<00:03:22.639> and<00:03:22.940> it

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
makes the hold metal push back and it

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.920 
makes the hold metal push back and it
unlocks<00:03:23.599> the<00:03:23.690> knife<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.849> then<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.150> lock<00:03:26.359> when

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
unlocks the knife and then the lock when

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.729 
unlocks the knife and then the lock when
you<00:03:27.049> slide<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.650> up<00:03:28.569> it<00:03:29.569> pushes<00:03:30.139> a<00:03:30.349> piece<00:03:30.620> of

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
you slide it up it pushes a piece of

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.009 
you slide it up it pushes a piece of
metal<00:03:30.950> underneath<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:32.090> button<00:03:32.389> so<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:32.930> you

on<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.110> one<00:04:38.289> by<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.500> way<00:04:38.590> it's<00:04:38.770> four<00:04:39.039> inches

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
on this one by the way it's four inches

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.960 
on this one by the way it's four inches
as<00:04:39.490> well<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:40.710> here's<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:41.740> comparison<00:04:42.010> my<00:04:42.610> iPhone

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
as well so here's a comparison my iPhone

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.950 
as well so here's a comparison my iPhone
is<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:44.260> same<00:04:44.470> exact<00:04:44.830> width<00:04:45.160> as<00:04:45.400> Oh<00:04:45.880> length<00:04:46.510> no

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
is the same exact width as Oh length no

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.170 
is the same exact width as Oh length no
weight<00:04:47.169> of<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.680> blade<00:04:47.889> comes<00:04:48.729> a<00:04:48.789> lot<00:04:48.940> sharper

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
weight of the blade comes a lot sharper

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.909 
weight of the blade comes a lot sharper
than<00:04:49.539> the<00:04:49.750> stiletto<00:04:51.240> comes<00:04:52.240> razor<00:04:52.720> sharp<00:04:53.080> just

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
than the stiletto comes razor sharp just

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.370 
than the stiletto comes razor sharp just
cuts<00:04:54.160> right<00:04:54.340> through<00:04:54.400> it<00:04:54.729> can't<00:04:55.690> really<00:04:55.900> show

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
cuts right through it can't really show

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.719 
cuts right through it can't really show
you<00:04:56.410> that<00:04:56.680> because<00:04:56.860> it's<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.250> little<00:04:57.370> piece<00:04:57.580> of

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
you that because it's a little piece of

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.590 
you that because it's a little piece of
paper<00:04:58.919> has<00:04:59.919> a<00:05:00.010> spring<00:05:00.340> latch<00:05:00.490> that<00:05:00.520> locks<00:05:01.150> both

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
paper has a spring latch that locks both

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.860 
paper has a spring latch that locks both
when<00:05:01.840> it's<00:05:01.990> open<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.530> closed<00:05:03.190> so<00:05:03.760> that<00:05:04.750> way

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
when it's open and closed so that way

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.029 
when it's open and closed so that way
you<00:05:04.930> lock<00:05:05.289> it<00:05:05.500> well<00:05:06.039> it's<00:05:06.220> open<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:08.889> it

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
you lock it well it's open so that it

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.190 
you lock it well it's open so that it
won't<00:05:09.160> magically<00:05:09.940> close<00:05:10.599> and<00:05:10.840> cut<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:11.169> don't

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
won't magically close and cut I don't

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.680 
won't magically close and cut I don't
know<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.910> don't<00:05:12.910> know<00:05:13.090> why<00:05:13.240> there's<00:05:13.419> a<00:05:13.479> lock

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
know I don't know why there's a lock

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.930 
know I don't know why there's a lock
therefore<00:05:14.110> when<00:05:14.200> it's<00:05:14.349> open<00:05:14.590> just<00:05:14.910> close<00:05:15.910> that

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
therefore when it's open just close that

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.219 
therefore when it's open just close that
I<00:05:16.300> just<00:05:16.539> cut<00:05:16.840> myself<00:05:17.020> possibly<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:19.020> has<00:05:20.020> the

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:20.229 
I just cut myself possibly and has the

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.029 
I just cut myself possibly and has the
blue<00:05:20.440> and<00:05:20.700> a<00:05:21.700> dies<00:05:21.940> titanium<00:05:22.870> in<00:05:23.050> it<00:05:23.139> trying<00:05:23.950> to

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
blue and a dies titanium in it trying to

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.940 
blue and a dies titanium in it trying to
get<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.669> light<00:05:24.849> so<00:05:25.060> you<00:05:25.150> can<00:05:25.210> see<00:05:25.330> it's<00:05:25.539> blue

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
get the light so you can see it's blue

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.570 
get the light so you can see it's blue
the<00:05:26.950> g10<00:05:27.820> handle<00:05:27.849> scales<00:05:28.270> it's<00:05:28.870> like<00:05:29.080> a<00:05:29.580> strong

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
the g10 handle scales it's like a strong

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.719 
the g10 handle scales it's like a strong
plastic<00:05:31.090> I<00:05:31.180> guess<00:05:31.389> you<00:05:31.660> could<00:05:31.810> say<00:05:32.400> it<00:05:33.400> really

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
plastic I guess you could say it really

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.580 
plastic I guess you could say it really
looks<00:05:34.000> nice<00:05:34.210> and<00:05:34.570> it<00:05:34.840> sounds<00:05:35.169> good<00:05:35.289> when<00:05:35.470> it's

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
looks nice and it sounds good when it's

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.500 
looks nice and it sounds good when it's
flipping<00:05:35.919> I<00:05:36.039> like<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.340> noise<00:05:36.849> it<00:05:37.090> makes

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
flipping I like the noise it makes

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.270 
flipping I like the noise it makes
and<00:05:39.330> has<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:40.539> pocket<00:05:40.900> clip<00:05:41.050> that's<00:05:41.380> anodized

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
and has the pocket clip that's anodized

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.060 
and has the pocket clip that's anodized
blue<00:05:42.550> has<00:05:43.000> benchmade<00:05:43.570> on<00:05:43.750> it<00:05:46.169> and<00:05:47.169> yeah<00:05:47.440> that

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
blue has benchmade on it and yeah that

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.310 
blue has benchmade on it and yeah that
is<00:05:48.099> that<00:05:48.639> it<00:05:48.940> has<00:05:49.360> pin<00:05:49.660> construction<00:05:50.349> so<00:05:52.320> has

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
is that it has pin construction so has

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.000 
is that it has pin construction so has
pins

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
pins

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.270 
pins
well<00:05:54.250> not<00:05:54.460> pins<00:05:54.760> oh<00:05:55.199> that's<00:05:56.199> a<00:05:56.289> fail<00:05:56.500> Torx

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
well not pins oh that's a fail Torx

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.939 
well not pins oh that's a fail Torx
screws<00:05:57.580> there<00:05:58.030> its<00:05:58.539> screws<00:05:58.990> and<00:05:59.320> then<00:06:00.280> it<00:06:01.000> has

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
screws there its screws and then it has

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.820 
screws there its screws and then it has
two<00:06:02.949> pins<00:06:03.250> inside<00:06:03.970> of<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:04.389> handles<00:06:04.750> that<00:06:04.990> hit

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
two pins inside of the handles that hit

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.950 
two pins inside of the handles that hit
against<00:06:06.190> this<00:06:06.310> little<00:06:07.060> piece<00:06:07.690> right<00:06:07.810> here

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
against this little piece right here

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.050 
against this little piece right here
that<00:06:08.169> goes<00:06:08.620> up<00:06:09.240> so

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
that goes up so

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.400 
that goes up so
instead<00:06:11.300> of<00:06:11.419> the<00:06:11.510> handles<00:06:11.870> hitting<00:06:12.110> together

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
instead of the handles hitting together

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.580 
instead of the handles hitting together
the<00:06:13.070> pin<00:06:13.840> right<00:06:14.840> there<00:06:15.020> where<00:06:15.169> my<00:06:15.200> middle

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
the pin right there where my middle

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.150 
the pin right there where my middle
finger<00:06:15.889> is<00:06:16.150> hits<00:06:17.150> the<00:06:17.540> top<00:06:18.290> of<00:06:18.320> that<00:06:18.560> and<00:06:18.830> stops

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
finger is hits the top of that and stops

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.460 
finger is hits the top of that and stops
it<00:06:19.370> from<00:06:19.400> hitting<00:06:20.090> so<00:06:20.389> the<00:06:20.630> blades<00:06:20.840> the

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
it from hitting so the blades the

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.650 
it from hitting so the blades the
handles<00:06:21.830> can't<00:06:22.010> hit<00:06:22.160> together<00:06:22.280> and<00:06:22.669> just<00:06:23.480> and

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
handles can't hit together and just and

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.440 
handles can't hit together and just and
each<00:06:23.810> other<00:06:24.020> up<00:06:24.230> and<00:06:24.350> not<00:06:24.590> look<00:06:24.770> good<00:06:25.300> so<00:06:26.300> now

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
each other up and not look good so now

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.650 
each other up and not look good so now
that's<00:06:26.750> that<00:06:27.080> I<00:06:27.880> think<00:06:28.880> I<00:06:28.940> covered<00:06:29.150> everything

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.260 

the<00:06:32.660> grip<00:06:32.900> on<00:06:33.050> the<00:06:33.169> side<00:06:33.820> this<00:06:34.820> has<00:06:35.000> a<00:06:35.060> little

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
the grip on the side this has a little

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.750 
the grip on the side this has a little
bit<00:06:35.450> of<00:06:35.570> grip<00:06:35.810> on<00:06:35.960> it<00:06:36.139> I<00:06:37.780> don't<00:06:38.780> know<00:06:39.020> it's

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760 
bit of grip on it I don't know it's

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.990 
bit of grip on it I don't know it's
easier<00:06:40.760> to<00:06:41.060> open<00:06:41.450> one-handed<00:06:42.260> that<00:06:42.650> way<00:06:43.000> maybe

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
easier to open one-handed that way maybe

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.650 
easier to open one-handed that way maybe
even<00:06:44.300> close<00:06:44.540> I<00:06:44.720> don't<00:06:44.960> not<00:06:45.710> sure<00:06:46.360> what<00:06:47.360> the<00:06:47.510> use

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
even close I don't not sure what the use

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.320 
even close I don't not sure what the use
is<00:06:47.690> but<00:06:48.080> maybe<00:06:48.200> that's<00:06:48.440> just<00:06:48.620> a<00:06:49.090> grip<00:06:50.090> better

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
is but maybe that's just a grip better

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.790 
is but maybe that's just a grip better
oh<00:06:50.630> yeah

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 
oh yeah

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.600
