you see him crying in the facebook group

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.340 
you see him crying in the facebook group
saying<00:00:18.390> they<00:00:18.510> lost<00:00:18.720> all<00:00:18.869> their<00:00:18.930> edits<00:00:19.289> that

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
saying they lost all their edits that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.599 
saying they lost all their edits that
they've<00:00:19.560> been<00:00:19.650> working<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.039> for<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.310> few<00:00:20.460> days

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
they've been working on for a few days

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.640 
they've been working on for a few days
and<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.480> basically<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.020> video<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
and so basically this video is just a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.200 
and so basically this video is just a
short<00:00:22.890> video<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.220> show<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.490> how<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.880> can

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
short video to show you how you can

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.000 
short video to show you how you can
basically<00:00:24.420> have<00:00:24.720> Lightroom<00:00:25.230> automatically

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
basically have Lightroom automatically

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.830 
basically have Lightroom automatically
save<00:00:26.250> those<00:00:26.490> edits<00:00:26.880> as<00:00:27.000> you're<00:00:27.180> doing<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.599> so

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
save those edits as you're doing it so

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
save those edits as you're doing it so
that<00:00:28.380> even<00:00:29.039> if<00:00:29.279> your<00:00:29.400> Lightroom<00:00:29.730> catalog<00:00:30.060> goes

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that even if your Lightroom catalog goes

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.170 
that even if your Lightroom catalog goes
corrupt<00:00:30.630> or<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.170> lose<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.859> whatever<00:00:32.219> all

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
corrupt or you lose it or whatever all

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.420 
corrupt or you lose it or whatever all
those<00:00:33.480> edits<00:00:33.870> even<00:00:34.200> spending<00:00:34.500> your<00:00:34.680> your<00:00:35.070> time

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
those edits even spending your your time

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.280 
those edits even spending your your time
on<00:00:35.730> are<00:00:36.329> still<00:00:36.480> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.170> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
on are still going to be there for you

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920 
on are still going to be there for you
so<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.550> really<00:00:38.879> easy<00:00:38.910> setting<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.629> turn<00:00:39.660> on

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
so it's a really easy setting to turn on

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.020 
so it's a really easy setting to turn on
in<00:00:40.110> Lightroom<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.100> sadly<00:00:41.340> Lightroom<00:00:41.760> has<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
in Lightroom but sadly Lightroom has it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.150 
in Lightroom but sadly Lightroom has it
off<00:00:42.120> by<00:00:42.300> default<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.960> basically<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.129> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
off by default and basically what it is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
off by default and basically what it is
is<00:00:44.550> on<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> Mac<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.600> up<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:45.750> on

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
is on the Mac it's just up here on

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.680 
is on the Mac it's just up here on
Lightroom<00:00:46.579> catalog<00:00:47.579> settings<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.510> come

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
Lightroom catalog settings you come

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.369 
Lightroom catalog settings you come
right<00:00:48.840> over<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.140> where<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.350> says

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
right over here where it says

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.639 
right over here where it says
automatically<00:00:50.100> write<00:00:50.430> changes<00:00:50.940> into<00:00:51.390> XMP<00:00:51.960> now

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
automatically write changes into XMP now

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.860 
automatically write changes into XMP now
this<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.640> said<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.910> typically<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.420> default

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
this like I said is typically on default

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.959 
this like I said is typically on default
as<00:00:55.020> off<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> go<00:00:56.460> there<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:56.789> probably

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
as off so if you go there it's probably

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.819 
as off so if you go there it's probably
like<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.230> haven't<00:00:58.379> already<00:00:58.530> turned

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
like that if you haven't already turned

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.340 
like that if you haven't already turned
it<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.940> reason<00:01:00.449> they<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.020> off<00:01:01.140> by

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it on the reason they have it off by

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.660 
it on the reason they have it off by
default<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.920> because<00:01:03.500> usually<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.920> basically

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
default is because usually if basically

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.770 
default is because usually if basically
this<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.880> automatically<00:01:06.360> saving<00:01:06.659> your

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
this is automatically saving your

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.510 
this is automatically saving your
changes<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.310> kind

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
changes so what it can do is it can kind

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
changes so what it can do is it can kind
of<00:01:08.549> slow<00:01:08.790> down<00:01:08.939> your<00:01:09.090> computer<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.840> little

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
of slow down your computer just a little

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.399 
of slow down your computer just a little
bit

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
bit

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
bit
however<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.490> came<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.939> believe<00:01:12.030> in

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
however this came out I believe in

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
however this came out I believe in
Lightroom<00:01:12.689> 3<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.229> computers<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.830> just

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
Lightroom 3 and computers have just

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.350 
Lightroom 3 and computers have just
gotten<00:01:14.250> better<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.640> better<00:01:14.700> over<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.119> years

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
gotten better and better over the years

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.170 
gotten better and better over the years
and<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:16.320> don't<00:01:16.470> notice<00:01:16.979> any<00:01:17.310> difference<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:18.150> I

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and I don't notice any difference when I

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.090 
and I don't notice any difference when I
have<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.750> off<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.740> mean<00:01:20.009> I'm

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
have it on or off and so I mean I'm

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.780 
have it on or off and so I mean I'm
using<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.430> MacBook<00:01:20.610> Pro<00:01:21.619> laptop<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.670> even

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
using a MacBook Pro laptop but but even

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.190 
using a MacBook Pro laptop but but even

so I mean as long as your computer's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.960 
so I mean as long as your computer's
up-to-date<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.799> everything's<00:01:26.400> finite<00:01:26.759> you

to<00:03:11.730> do<00:03:11.879> save<00:03:12.629> those<00:03:12.900> changes<00:03:13.409> into<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
to do save those changes into the

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.240 
to do save those changes into the
metadata<00:03:14.220> or<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.700> XMP<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.419> file

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
metadata or the XMP of that file

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.719 
metadata or the XMP of that file
hopefully<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.340> makes<00:03:17.519> sense<00:03:17.699> now<00:03:19.099> the<00:03:20.099> some

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
hopefully that makes sense now the some

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:21.830 
hopefully that makes sense now the some
people<00:03:20.849> might<00:03:21.090> say<00:03:21.269> well<00:03:21.299> then<00:03:21.510> why<00:03:21.599> do<00:03:21.659> I<00:03:21.780> even

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
people might say well then why do I even

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.039 
people might say well then why do I even
hold<00:03:22.349> on<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.620> library<00:03:22.949> catalog<00:03:23.629> and<00:03:24.629> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
hold on to a library catalog and the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.479 
hold on to a library catalog and the
advantage<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.590> keeping<00:03:26.129> your<00:03:26.310> Lightroom

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
advantage to keeping your Lightroom

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.159 
advantage to keeping your Lightroom
catalog<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.419> have<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.690> history

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
catalog is that you have the history

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.379 
catalog is that you have the history
sets<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.919> steps<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.699> aren't<00:03:29.909> saved<00:03:30.209> at<00:03:30.359> the

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
sets the steps that aren't saved at the

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.180 
sets the steps that aren't saved at the
X<00:03:30.629> and<00:03:30.810> P<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.500> could<00:03:31.620> always<00:03:31.739> go<00:03:31.889> back<00:03:31.919> in

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
X and P so you could always go back in

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.819 
X and P so you could always go back in
the<00:03:32.250> history<00:03:32.400> if<00:03:32.639> you<00:03:32.729> needed<00:03:32.909> to<00:03:33.139> but<00:03:34.139> for<00:03:34.709> me

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
the history if you needed to but for me

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.469 
the history if you needed to but for me
I<00:03:35.159> know<00:03:35.459> after<00:03:35.819> a<00:03:35.849> time<00:03:36.090> being<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.419> will

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:36.479 
I know after a time being I will

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.599 
I know after a time being I will
actually<00:03:36.930> delete<00:03:37.260> folders<00:03:38.040> out<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.430> Lightroom

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
actually delete folders out of Lightroom

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.009

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
catalogs just to kind of keep the speed

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.259
