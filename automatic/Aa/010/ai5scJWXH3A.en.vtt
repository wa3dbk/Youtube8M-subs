that have fallen clearing up all that
stuff<00:02:07.049> that's<00:02:07.200> leftovers<00:02:07.859> is<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.670> job<00:02:08.880> of<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
stuff that's leftovers is the job of the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.720 
stuff that's leftovers is the job of the
rake<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.959> raking<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.739> as<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> clearing<00:02:11.459> job

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730

rake so raking just as a clearing job
really<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:13.110> also<00:02:13.260> use<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.099> rake<00:02:14.310> for

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
really you also use the rake for

sold to that fine tilth in which you got

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.160 
sold to that fine tilth in which you got
to<00:02:17.990> plant<00:02:18.230> other<00:02:18.560> plants<00:02:19.190> or<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.430> seeds<00:02:20.170> once

you've planted plants you need to keep
the<00:02:23.930> area<00:02:24.230> clean<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:24.890> need<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.400> hoe<00:02:25.910> this<00:02:26.360> is

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
the area clean so you need a hoe this is

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.390 
the area clean so you need a hoe this is
a<00:02:26.570> long-handled<00:02:27.140> hoe<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.070> hoe<00:02:28.220> is

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
a long-handled hoe and a hoe is

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.370 
a long-handled hoe and a hoe is
basically<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.910> weeding<00:02:29.360> tool<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:30.110> when<00:02:30.290> you

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
basically a weeding tool this when you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.070 
basically a weeding tool this when you
pull<00:02:30.650> towards<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:32.420> break<00:02:32.720> off<00:02:32.930> the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
pull towards you and you break off the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.840 
pull towards you and you break off the
roots<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.650> plants<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.550> can<00:02:34.700> then

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
roots and the plants that you can then

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.570 
roots and the plants that you can then
rake<00:02:35.060> them<00:02:35.270> up<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:36.380> those<00:02:36.560> are<00:02:36.740> the<00:02:36.800> big<00:02:37.040> tools

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
rake them up so those are the big tools

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.660 
rake them up so those are the big tools

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
petunia so that's it one two three four

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.250 
petunia so that's it one two three four
five<00:03:22.940> six<00:03:23.239> seven<00:03:23.510> eight

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
five six seven eight

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.390 
five six seven eight
tools<00:03:25.160> that<00:03:25.720> if<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:27.620> have<00:03:27.800> those<00:03:28.040> as<00:03:28.340> a
