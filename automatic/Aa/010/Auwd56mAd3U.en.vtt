00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
as well I'll really like the way the

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.460 
as well I'll really like the way the
wood<00:03:34.639> feels<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.239> mean<00:03:35.660> you<00:03:35.750> can<00:03:35.840> go<00:03:35.900> over<00:03:36.109> every

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
wood feels I mean you can go over every

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.349 
wood feels I mean you can go over every
puzzle<00:03:36.709> piece<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.700> can<00:03:37.850> feel<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
puzzle piece and you can feel the

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.420 
puzzle piece and you can feel the
different<00:03:38.690> wood<00:03:38.870> grains<00:03:39.170> from<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.100> different

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
different wood grains from the different

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.520 
different wood grains from the different
wood<00:03:40.609> which<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.540> really<00:03:41.750> cool<00:03:41.989> it<00:03:42.230> reacts

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
wood which is really cool it reacts

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.020 
wood which is really cool it reacts
differently<00:03:42.799> to<00:03:43.130> all<00:03:43.400> kinds<00:03:43.579> of<00:03:43.730> different

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
differently to all kinds of different

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.400 
differently to all kinds of different
lighting<00:03:44.239> so<00:03:44.900> it's<00:03:45.049> going<00:03:45.139> to<00:03:45.200> look<00:03:45.290> different

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
lighting so it's going to look different

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.430 
lighting so it's going to look different
and<00:03:46.299> in<00:03:47.299> some<00:03:47.600> lighting<00:03:47.810> that<00:03:48.049> would<00:03:48.319> the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
and in some lighting that would the

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.319 
and in some lighting that would the
others<00:03:48.709> but<00:03:49.519> it's<00:03:49.670> got<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.819> little<00:03:49.970> bit<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.209> a

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
others but it's got a little bit of a

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.539 
others but it's got a little bit of a
gloss<00:03:50.569> to<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:50.900> that's<00:03:51.829> just<00:03:52.069> a<00:03:52.220> finish<00:03:52.519> that

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
gloss to it that's just a finish that

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.120 
gloss to it that's just a finish that
