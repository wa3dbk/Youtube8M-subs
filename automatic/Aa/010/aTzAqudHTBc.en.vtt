actually<00:02:15.630> had<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.840> really<00:02:16.230> big<00:02:16.500> lunch<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.370> I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
actually had a really big lunch so I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.130 
actually had a really big lunch so I
thought<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.790> would<00:02:17.940> be<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.360> perfect<00:02:18.900> dinner

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
thought this would be a perfect dinner

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.310 
thought this would be a perfect dinner
so<00:02:19.920> all<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.250> really<00:02:20.370> did<00:02:20.760> was<00:02:20.820> cut<00:02:21.480> some<00:02:21.750> romaine

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
so all I really did was cut some romaine

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.880 
so all I really did was cut some romaine
lettuce<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.980> shredded<00:02:24.140> Parmesan<00:02:25.140> cheese<00:02:25.470> and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
lettuce I shredded Parmesan cheese and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.770 
lettuce I shredded Parmesan cheese and
then<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.100> used<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.640> these<00:02:27.030> are<00:02:27.180> dressing

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
then I used this these are dressing

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.699 
then I used this these are dressing
which<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.890> really<00:02:29.850> really<00:02:30.300> good<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.680> is

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
which is really really good and it is

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.530 
which is really really good and it is
natural<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.850> doesn't<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.390> any

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540

natural and it doesn't have any
preservatives<00:02:34.200> or<00:02:34.290> anything<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:34.860> know<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.400> can

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
preservatives or anything I know you can

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.430 
preservatives or anything I know you can
make<00:02:36.060> your<00:02:36.270> own<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.930> I've<00:02:37.020> mentioned<00:02:37.230> this

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
make your own and I've mentioned this

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.100 
make your own and I've mentioned this
before<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.910> all<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> ingredients

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
before but for all of the ingredients

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.070 
before but for all of the ingredients
including<00:02:40.530> anchovies<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.400> everything<00:02:41.790> I

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
including anchovies and everything I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.330 
including anchovies and everything I
figured<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.230> would<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.410> be<00:02:43.680> easier<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.040> buy

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
figured it would just be easier to buy

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.300 
figured it would just be easier to buy
it<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.880> then<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:46.170> marinated<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.280> chicken

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.150 
it and then I just marinated the chicken
in<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.030> dressing<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.050> John<00:02:49.530> grilled<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:49.950> for

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
in the dressing and John grilled it for

in the dressing and John grilled it for
me<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.550> then<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.300> made<00:02:51.570> some<00:02:51.600> homemade
