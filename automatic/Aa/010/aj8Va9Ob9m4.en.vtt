00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.850
 With baby chair 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 Do 10 in 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.960
 It's not like a gym 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:31.720

 How to use baby ta 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.640
 Set on the turning table as you would not put it on the baby doll baby chair 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.100

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:08.670
 The pattern on the table looks like this, but the upper endure 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.670

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:47.180
 Yes , it makes me feel like I'm sitting on the mainstay family 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:50.900
 I was able to make the red turn even better later 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:56.740
