00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.730
 we return to your program inside you and 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:18.550
 well we have today the visit of 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.369
 laura martinez who is talking to us 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.369
 about these tools 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.290
 socialization for teenagers would be 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.360
 handling some assertiveness in the 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.370
 workshop if when they speak as is puig 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.110
 as I listen and I put myself in place of 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.600
 another one we're really talking about the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.770
 assertive communication in what way I 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.770
 I can communicate better 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.350
 we have the question of adriana orozco me 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.300
 says my 13-year-old son says his 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.570
 colleagues who do not want the 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.060
 school and they give him expensive cell phones 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.550
 and I tell him that they are doing a 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.190
 I feel bad that it is exposing it of what 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.230
 way I can continue to stimulate since 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.780
 He is a very good student and I tell him that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.090
 Your duty is to study how to reward them without 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.970
 badly educate them is only child like 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.280
 reward them without badly educate them is son 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.130
 only is that it has no commas or point if 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.710
 would you have at home not then 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.710
 we are like rewarding them 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.850
 spoil them without badly educating him 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.580
 If this right now I mentioned many 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.670
 dads talking about the qualifications 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.860
 They give their children money for the 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.920
 good grades talking about if 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.990
 this and it really is not a strategy 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.820
 very appropriate because there comes a point that 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.910
 until you give them a car to give them 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.740
 will you give a home and no longer do 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.430
 qualifications is part of their 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.140
 obligations then how to reward them or 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.810
 be things that are a baby that 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.390
 like them and that is, if it's done 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.000
 a benefit at the moment they comply with 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.580
 your obligations here we talk in 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.640
 obligations so if the study is 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.979
 keep your room clean neat 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.959
 and be respectful to the rules that you 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.000
 put at home 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.150
 that's what we talk about as your 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.520
 obligations then when when 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.500
 we started giving material things like 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.640
 awards if a point arrives that the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.459
 never ending chain 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.560
 clear, notice that there is a workshop that 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.060
 us that I give there in the institute 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.440
 but this is for dads I work 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.610
 with the dads of Laura works with the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.620
 children but this course is called 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.900
 regulation for a teenager there are three 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.630
 types of rules queen is the rules 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.230
 family the educational rules and 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.230
 security rules 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.230
 and what the security rules are not 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.140
 Negotiable are not negotiable 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.570
 those put on the belt communicate 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.890
 with me when you leave the square that I 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.380
 You said I was going to continue because you're going to 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.900
 to move to another is to have the phone 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.020
 on answer those are rules of 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.740
 security that those are neither negotiable nor 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.760
 they are going to reward themselves or they are going to give 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.950
 cellular because they did 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.660
 that is, there are things that if they are rewarded and there 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.780
 things that are not rewarded with rewards 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.750
 for example money cell toys 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.280
 however there are other types of rewards 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.860
 what we call factors 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.130
 hygienic where for that it means 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:33.070
 much and we do not cost anything 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:36.500
 the rewards in educational rules 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.540
 and family rules we're talking about 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.590
 things like 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.560
 and more time on the computer is something 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.719
 that they appreciate a lot of side and that 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.200
 we do not cost if he 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:54.890

 they are not material rewards or for 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:21.859
