role attack for twice as long so with

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.980 
role attack for twice as long so with
bass<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:24.210> Bob<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.439> did<00:01:25.650> try<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.820> Bop<00:01:27.750> on

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
bass or Bob and I did try with Bop on

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450 
bass or Bob and I did try with Bop on
this<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.710> thought<00:01:28.950> these

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
this back because I thought these

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.010 
this back because I thought these
smaller<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.329> faster<00:01:30.689> than<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
smaller is going to be faster than the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.859 
smaller is going to be faster than the
moves<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> thought<00:01:32.790> maybe<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:36.210> doing<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
moves so I thought maybe I doing the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.600 
moves so I thought maybe I doing the
mace<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.049> destruction<00:01:37.740> would<00:01:37.920> help<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.369> but

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
mace of destruction would help out but

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.780 
mace of destruction would help out but
he's<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.750> tiny<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.770> enemies<00:01:41.430> kind<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
he's so tiny and the enemies kind of

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.399 
he's so tiny and the enemies kind of
crushed<00:01:42.030> him<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.509> fast<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.110> he<00:01:43.200> gets

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
crushed him really fast and he gets

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.340 
crushed him really fast and he gets
damaged<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.189> lot<00:01:44.880> while<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.869> tail<00:01:46.049> soy

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
damaged a lot while you do the tail soy

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.270 
damaged a lot while you do the tail soy
so<00:01:48.079> Pulver<00:01:49.079> roll<00:01:49.290> roll<00:01:49.619> attacks<00:01:49.979> does

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
so Pulver roll roll attacks does

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.480 
so Pulver roll roll attacks does
increase<00:01:50.610> damage<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.530> earth<00:01:52.530> enforce<00:01:53.159> roll

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
increase damage and earth enforce roll

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060 
increase damage and earth enforce roll
roll<00:01:53.909> does<00:01:54.240> more<00:01:54.540> damage<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.470> roll<00:01:55.710> right

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
roll does more damage and can roll right

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.810 
roll does more damage and can roll right
through<00:01:56.130> enemies<00:01:56.969> attack<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.189> roll<00:01:59.460> all

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
through enemies attack so the roll all

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the way with bob continental boulder

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.840 
the way with bob continental boulder
