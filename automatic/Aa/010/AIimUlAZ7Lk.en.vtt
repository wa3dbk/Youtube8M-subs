experience is unprecedented when you

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.500 
experience is unprecedented when you
take<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.620> product<00:05:35.860> out<00:05:36.190> of<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.520> box<00:05:36.729> and<00:05:37.120> hit

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
take the product out of the box and hit

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.200 
take the product out of the box and hit
the<00:05:37.690> followed<00:05:38.080> by<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:39.280> display<00:05:39.669> immediately

and<00:05:41.440> I<00:05:41.530> think<00:05:41.590> our<00:05:42.009> customers<00:05:42.490> experience

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
and I think our customers experience

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.360 
and I think our customers experience
with<00:05:43.300> that<00:05:43.330> would<00:05:43.720> be<00:05:43.870> wow<00:05:44.229> this<00:05:44.620> is<00:05:44.830> a<00:05:44.860> really
