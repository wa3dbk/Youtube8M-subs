you'll<00:00:20.759> be<00:00:20.849> able<00:00:20.909> to<00:00:21.089> get<00:00:21.239> out<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.659> bank

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
you'll be able to get out on the bank

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.069 
you'll be able to get out on the bank
and<00:00:22.199> put<00:00:22.679> some<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> rigs<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.429> the<00:00:23.550> test<00:00:24.079> one

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
and put some of the rigs to the test one

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.540 
and put some of the rigs to the test one
of<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.259> rig's<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.619> mentioned<00:00:26.039> was<00:00:26.159> the<00:00:26.279> pole

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
of the rig's I mentioned was the pole

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.939 
of the rig's I mentioned was the pole
feed<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.480> very<00:00:27.869> very<00:00:28.109> interesting<00:00:28.349> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
feed and it's very very interesting and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.609 
feed and it's very very interesting and
I've<00:00:29.099> caught<00:00:29.310> quite<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> fish<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.329> on<00:00:30.619> places

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
I've caught quite a fish on it on places

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.420 
I've caught quite a fish on it on places
like<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.979> Warwick's<00:00:32.309> Raven<00:00:32.970> this<00:00:33.270> year<00:00:34.430> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
like the Warwick's Raven this year the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.910 
like the Warwick's Raven this year the
only<00:00:35.580> problem<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> rig<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.650> when<00:00:37.650> a<00:00:37.680> fish

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
only problem with the rig is when a fish

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.390 
only problem with the rig is when a fish
takes<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.400> bay<00:00:38.870> it's<00:00:39.870> very<00:00:40.320> tied<00:00:40.740> to<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.130> pole

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
takes the bay it's very tied to the pole

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.910 
takes the bay it's very tied to the pole
tip<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.240> there's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.810> lot<00:00:42.990> of<00:00:43.020> resistance<00:00:43.350> there

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
tip so there's a lot of resistance there

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.360 
tip so there's a lot of resistance there
and<00:00:44.130> especially<00:00:44.250> small<00:00:44.610> fish<00:00:45.210> skimmers<00:00:45.900> row

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
and especially small fish skimmers row

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.890 
and especially small fish skimmers row
hybrids<00:00:47.370> things<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.240> that<00:00:48.450> they'll<00:00:48.630> feel

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
hybrids things like that they'll feel

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.870 
hybrids things like that they'll feel
this<00:00:49.110> resistance<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.040> spit<00:00:50.340> your<00:00:50.460> bait<00:00:50.640> out

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
this resistance and spit your bait out

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.760 
this resistance and spit your bait out
without<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.840> actually<00:00:51.930> knowing<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.620> better

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
without you actually knowing you better

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.180 
without you actually knowing you better
buy<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.720> around<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.350> I'll<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.010> make

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
buy to get around this I'll have to make

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.730 
buy to get around this I'll have to make
a<00:00:56.220> little<00:00:56.490> buy<00:00:56.790> indicator<00:00:57.480> which<00:00:58.050> offers<00:00:58.560> a

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
a little buy indicator which offers a

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.800 
a little buy indicator which offers a
lot<00:00:59.070> less<00:00:59.340> resistance<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.239> gives<00:01:00.450> the<00:01:00.630> fish<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
lot less resistance and gives the fish a

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.440 
lot less resistance and gives the fish a
few<00:01:01.110> seconds<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.310> take<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> bait<00:01:02.850> droplet

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
few seconds to take the bait droplet

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.870 
few seconds to take the bait droplet
allowing<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> buy<00:01:05.009> on<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> short

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
allowing you to see a buy on a short

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480 
allowing you to see a buy on a short
