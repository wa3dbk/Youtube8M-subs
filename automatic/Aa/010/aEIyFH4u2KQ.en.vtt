00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:09.160
 intermittent braking 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.650
 It is recommended to produce when driving 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.410
 at any speed for short and 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:17.439
 and decrease or service braking on 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.560
 dry road it is wet with a small 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.560
 speeds 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.890
 vehicle braking with 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.120
 using the hand brake applied in 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.160
 emergency situations 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.350
 use in these cases manual 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.540
 brake must be especially careful and 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.770
 neat as at the slightest turn 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.380
 steering wheel 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.710
 there will be an instant skid of the rear axle 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.930
 the car on a slippery road in the ice 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.970
 when driving on descents at any 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.880
 speed effective is 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.190
 engine braking or combination 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.140
 engine braking and 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.140
 main brake system 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.320
 when braking the engine driver 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.580
 moves with a higher gear will inflict 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.620
 shift gears need 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.750
 consistently as the device 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.060
 gear boxes may not allow 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.360
 switch immediately with top gear 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 after a few steps to the lower and this 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.840
 will take some time but significantly 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.710
 reduce the speed of your car while 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.810
 kinetic energy cars 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.600
 spent on friction in the transmission and in 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.350
 engine and press gas in cylinders 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.170
 in this case, the braking force is created 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.150
 acting on the drive wheels at the moment 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.430
 vehicle braking between 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.180
 its wheels coated the road arises 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.520
 friction force during braking necessary 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.800
 consider coupling factors as well 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.110
 between the wheels of the car and the coating 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.590
 road vary depending on 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.180
 first quality and coating materials 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.240
 roads 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.840
 the second state of the road is dry and wet 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.840
 rolled snow and ice third speed 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.019
 vehicle movement and 4 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.769
 vehicle mass in winter on 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.560
 slippery potassium is often formed on the road 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:25.230
 the place where the wheels drove hundreds of cars in 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.580
 such a situation is a bias towards everything 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.860
 by 20 centimeters 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.170
 allow you to put the car wheels 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.930
 in the area of loose snow fine 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.000
 pebbles and things like that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.370
 adhesion wheels with the road on the order 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.950
 above, respectively, you can extinguish 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.440
 speed is more effective braking at 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.040
 help still facing obstacles to 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.160
 the road 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.260
 this method is used in case of emergency 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.830
 braking in case of failure of the main brake 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.350
 systems 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.810
 when time does not allow to use 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.220
 in other ways of braking 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.189
 the obstacle must be chosen wisely 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.280
 so that you and the surrounding 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.260
 received as little damage as possible is 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.599
 there may be drifts or heaps of snow 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.390
 large cargo wheels 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.760
 car outside the city can be used 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.060
 quad but should be driven into it 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.180
 shallow trajectory and in no case 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.310
 perpendicular 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.500
 while trying not to drive into the forest 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.299
 an array where dangerous can happen 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.299
 facing trees
