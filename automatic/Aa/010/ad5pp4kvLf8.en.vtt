I'll just pull this over so I can keep
my<00:02:15.719> hands<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.530> there<00:02:16.739> too<00:02:17.069> sometimes<00:02:17.640> because

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
my hands in there too sometimes because

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.619 
my hands in there too sometimes because
that<00:02:18.030> gets<00:02:18.239> really<00:02:18.420> cool<00:02:18.950> tip<00:02:19.950> 3<00:02:20.549> pick<00:02:21.359> your

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
that gets really cool tip 3 pick your

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.920 
that gets really cool tip 3 pick your
route<00:02:21.980> wisely<00:02:22.980> what<00:02:23.579> I<00:02:23.609> mean<00:02:23.909> by<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.569> try

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
route wisely what I mean by that is try

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.479 
route wisely what I mean by that is try
and<00:02:24.989> find<00:02:25.290> somewhere<00:02:25.859> where<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.189> gonna<00:02:26.340> run

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
and find somewhere where you gonna run

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.670 
and find somewhere where you gonna run
where<00:02:27.030> it's<00:02:27.150> not<00:02:27.359> too<00:02:27.689> slippery

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
where it's not too slippery

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.910 
where it's not too slippery
also<00:02:29.519> sometimes<00:02:30.439> sidewalks<00:02:31.439> are<00:02:31.709> covered

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
also sometimes sidewalks are covered

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.420 
also sometimes sidewalks are covered
with<00:02:32.400> snow<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:33.299> you<00:02:33.689> can<00:02:33.870> find<00:02:34.170> roads<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:35.280> are

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
with snow if you can find roads that are

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.300 
with snow if you can find roads that are
not<00:02:35.760> as<00:02:36.120> busy<00:02:36.719> or<00:02:36.959> if<00:02:37.109> you<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.469> run<00:02:37.739> at<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.010> time

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
not as busy or if you can run at a time

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.429 
not as busy or if you can run at a time
when<00:02:38.549> there's<00:02:38.730> not<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:38.939> lot<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.180> traffic<00:02:39.569> it's

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
when there's not a lot of traffic it's

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.459 
when there's not a lot of traffic it's
kind<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.159> easier<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.700> run<00:02:41.909> on<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> road

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469 
kind of easier to run on the road

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.440 
kind of easier to run on the road
sidewalks<00:02:43.469> tend<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.859> get<00:02:43.980> icy<00:02:44.430> ER<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:45.030> they

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
sidewalks tend to get icy ER and they

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.330 
sidewalks tend to get icy ER and they
get<00:02:45.599> bumpy<00:02:46.169> because<00:02:46.379> if<00:02:46.739> someone<00:02:47.040> doesn't

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
get bumpy because if someone doesn't

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.979 
get bumpy because if someone doesn't
shovel<00:02:47.669> them<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.120> walk<00:02:48.359> on<00:02:48.689> them<00:02:48.810> they

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
shovel them and you walk on them they

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.509 
shovel them and you walk on them they
get<00:02:49.169> all<00:02:49.379> bad

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
get all bad

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.490 
get all bad
so<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.909> actually<00:02:51.180> tend<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> run<00:02:51.989> more<00:02:52.230> on<00:02:52.379> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
so I actually tend to run more on the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.789 
so I actually tend to run more on the
roads<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.220> winter<00:02:53.810> another<00:02:54.810> tip<00:02:55.169> is<00:02:55.409> let's

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
roads in the winter another tip is let's

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.830 
roads in the winter another tip is let's
say<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.040> really<00:02:56.250> windy<00:02:56.669> but<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.299> still<00:02:57.629> want

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
say it's really windy but you still want

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.080 
say it's really windy but you still want
to<00:02:57.900> get<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.109> run<00:02:58.409> in<00:02:58.590> outside<00:02:59.219> if<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.700> can<00:02:59.909> have

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
to get a run in outside if you can have

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.360 
to get a run in outside if you can have
someone<00:03:00.599> Drive<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:00.930> out<00:03:01.409> like<00:03:01.859> three<00:03:02.189> or<00:03:02.340> four

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
someone Drive you out like three or four

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.819 
someone Drive you out like three or four
miles<00:03:02.879> from<00:03:03.060> your<00:03:03.299> house<00:03:03.419> and<00:03:03.719> then<00:03:04.200> run<00:03:04.500> with

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
miles from your house and then run with

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.550 
miles from your house and then run with
the<00:03:05.219> wind<00:03:05.459> back<00:03:06.299> home<00:03:06.629> so<00:03:06.989> at<00:03:07.139> least<00:03:07.290> you're

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the wind back home so at least you're

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.640 
the wind back home so at least you're
outside<00:03:07.889> but<00:03:08.819> one<00:03:09.629> of<00:03:09.719> the<00:03:09.780> worst<00:03:09.989> things<00:03:10.349> is

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
outside but one of the worst things is

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.770 
outside but one of the worst things is
running<00:03:11.099> with<00:03:11.639> the<00:03:11.879> wind<00:03:12.090> on<00:03:12.419> your<00:03:12.599> way<00:03:12.750> out

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
running with the wind on your way out

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.770 
running with the wind on your way out
and<00:03:13.290> you<00:03:13.620> get<00:03:13.739> all<00:03:13.919> sweaty<00:03:14.189> then<00:03:14.639> you<00:03:14.969> turn<00:03:15.450> and

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
and you get all sweaty then you turn and

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.719 
and you get all sweaty then you turn and
you<00:03:16.019> run<00:03:16.200> into<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.709> wind<00:03:16.919> on<00:03:17.159> your<00:03:17.190> way<00:03:17.430> back

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:17.729 
you run into the wind on your way back

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:20.539 
you run into the wind on your way back
and<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.209> wind<00:03:18.540> cuts<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.229> you<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.919> that<00:03:20.129> sweat

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
and that wind cuts to you and that sweat

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.750 
and that wind cuts to you and that sweat
dries<00:03:20.909> up<00:03:21.209> and<00:03:21.389> makes<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.690> real<00:03:21.930> cold<00:03:22.409> so<00:03:22.949> pick

four<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.030> forgot<00:03:27.510> about<00:03:27.659> this<00:03:27.959> it's<00:03:28.229> slippery

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680

pavement around the snow so just

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.050 
pavement around the snow so just
remember<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.199> shorter<00:03:49.859> strides<00:03:50.310> take<00:03:50.879> it
