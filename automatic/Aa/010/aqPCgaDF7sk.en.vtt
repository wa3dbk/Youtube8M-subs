00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
mushy if they're too mushy it's just

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.830 
mushy if they're too mushy it's just
gonna<00:01:49.350> make<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.860> messy<00:01:50.310> salad<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.689> while

ingredients and we'll start with our

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.370 
ingredients and we'll start with our
tomato<00:01:56.909> we'll<00:01:57.149> chop<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.540> our<00:01:57.659> tomato<00:01:58.049> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
we'll use a serrated blade and this is

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.899 
we'll use a serrated blade and this is
the<00:02:01.079> easiest<00:02:01.439> way<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.740> chop<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.310> tomato<00:02:02.610> you

can dice it you can quarter it you can

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.889 
can dice it you can quarter it you can
actually<00:02:05.250> put<00:02:05.729> your<00:02:05.759> tomato<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.420> any<00:02:06.570> shape

the supermarket so I just cleaned up my
surface<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.430> little<00:02:59.640> bit<00:02:59.760> here<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.269> next<00:03:00.480> I'm

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
surface a little bit here and next I'm

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.420 
surface a little bit here and next I'm
going<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.840> peel<00:03:01.080> my<00:03:01.709> egg<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
going to peel my egg now this is a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
going to peel my egg now this is a
hard-boiled<00:03:02.790> egg

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
hard-boiled egg

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.780 
hard-boiled egg
I<00:03:03.480> hit<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.720> pretty<00:03:03.810> hard<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.410> your<00:03:05.070> surface<00:03:05.610> and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
I hit it pretty hard on your surface and

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.030 
I hit it pretty hard on your surface and
then<00:03:06.120> roll<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.570> out<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.989> then<00:03:07.739> you're<00:03:07.860> all

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
then roll it out and then you're all

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.759 
then roll it out and then you're all
ready<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.550> go<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.120> peel<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:10.140> shell<00:03:10.350> off<00:03:10.560> your

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
ready to go to peel the shell off your

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.410 
ready to go to peel the shell off your
egg<00:03:10.920> I'm<00:03:11.370> gonna<00:03:11.610> do<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.850> off<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.209> side<00:03:12.390> here

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
egg I'm gonna do it off to the side here

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.520 
egg I'm gonna do it off to the side here
just<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.650> don't<00:03:13.739> get<00:03:14.130> shell<00:03:14.700> on<00:03:15.000> my

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
just so that I don't get shell on my

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.319 
just so that I don't get shell on my
cutting<00:03:16.530> board<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:17.850> certainly<00:03:18.000> do<00:03:18.269> this

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
cutting board you can certainly do this

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.090 
cutting board you can certainly do this
over<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.720> garbage<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.410> would<00:03:19.500> probably<00:03:19.620> be<00:03:19.890> a

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
over the garbage it would probably be a

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.800 
over the garbage it would probably be a
nicer<00:03:20.610> spot<00:03:20.940> so<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:21.450> can<00:03:21.600> throw<00:03:21.750> it

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
nicer spot so that you can throw it

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.600 
nicer spot so that you can throw it
directly<00:03:22.110> in<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.260> garbage<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.920> now<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.430> have

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
directly in the garbage and now you have

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.430 
directly in the garbage and now you have
all<00:03:23.730> these<00:03:23.880> bits<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.110> take<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.290> nice

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
all these bits so I just take a nice

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.970 
all these bits so I just take a nice
