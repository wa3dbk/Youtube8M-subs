this<00:02:32.350> one<00:02:32.500> they<00:02:32.620> might<00:02:32.800> all<00:02:32.920> fit<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
this one they might all fit it in the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.670 
this one they might all fit it in the
case<00:02:33.760> probably<00:02:34.239> not<00:02:34.360> but<00:02:34.840> since<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:35.530> was<00:02:35.620> a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
case probably not but since it was a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.050 
case probably not but since it was a
cheaper<00:02:35.980> case<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.370> rebel<00:02:36.700> they<00:02:36.790> gave<00:02:36.970> you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
cheaper case in the rebel they gave you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.710 
cheaper case in the rebel they gave you
the<00:02:37.180> bottom<00:02:37.480> part<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.239> movie

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
the bottom part that with the movie

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.900 
the bottom part that with the movie
stand<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.350> everything<00:02:41.560> else<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.069> that<00:02:42.700> right

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
stand and everything else and that right

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.699 
stand and everything else and that right
now<00:02:43.090> I'm<00:02:43.420> going<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.660> tell<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.959> before<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.500> pull

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
now I'm going to tell you before I pull

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.850 
now I'm going to tell you before I pull
this<00:02:44.769> out<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.100> is<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.310> very<00:02:45.550> rubbery<00:02:45.910> silicon

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
this out this is a very rubbery silicon

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.090 
this out this is a very rubbery silicon
but<00:02:47.860> I<00:02:48.790> do<00:02:49.120> use<00:02:49.569> Carlos's<00:02:50.170> test<00:02:50.440> because<00:02:50.950> it

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
but I do use Carlos's test because it

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.640 
but I do use Carlos's test because it
works<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:52.330> true<00:02:52.569> he<00:02:52.870> says<00:02:53.080> if<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.350> stretches

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
works it's true he says if it stretches

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.860 
works it's true he says if it stretches
really<00:02:54.160> easily<00:02:54.489> it's<00:02:55.090> going<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.480> be<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.600> lint

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
really easily it's going to be a lint

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.380 
really easily it's going to be a lint
grabber<00:02:56.140> this<00:02:56.950> doesn't<00:02:57.250> switch<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:58.180> doesn't

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
grabber this doesn't switch this doesn't

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.809 
grabber this doesn't switch this doesn't
stretch<00:02:58.780> very<00:02:59.049> easily<00:02:59.319> I<00:02:59.590> mean<00:02:59.769> let's<00:03:00.640> see

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
stretch very easily I mean let's see

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.880 
stretch very easily I mean let's see
that's<00:03:01.000> hard<00:03:01.450> as<00:03:01.569> i'm<00:03:01.690> polling<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:02.860> a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
that's hard as i'm polling that is a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.560 
that's hard as i'm polling that is a
little<00:03:03.130> bit<00:03:03.280> but<00:03:03.640> not<00:03:03.820> bad<00:03:04.030> at<00:03:04.180> all<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:04.299> mean

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
little bit but not bad at all I mean

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.600 
little bit but not bad at all I mean
this<00:03:04.690> is<00:03:04.750> total<00:03:05.440> felt<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:06.130> can<00:03:06.280> rub<00:03:06.459> that

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
this is total felt you can rub that

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.890 
this is total felt you can rub that
against<00:03:06.940> this<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.209> there's<00:03:07.360> nothing<00:03:07.660> at<00:03:07.780> all

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
against this and there's nothing at all

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.620 
against this and there's nothing at all
the<00:03:08.769> feel<00:03:09.040> is<00:03:09.489> a<00:03:09.549> little<00:03:09.880> bit<00:03:10.000> different<00:03:10.480> it's

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
the feel is a little bit different it's

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
the feel is a little bit different it's
a<00:03:10.660> little<00:03:10.870> bit<00:03:10.959> weird<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.320> mean<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.590> is

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
a little bit weird I mean this is

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.289 
a little bit weird I mean this is
silicon<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:13.269> is<00:03:13.720> totally<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:16.269> a

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
silicon it is totally this is like a

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.289 
silicon it is totally this is like a
rollup<00:03:16.660> case<00:03:17.109> you<00:03:17.290> could<00:03:17.850> throw<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:18.940> in<00:03:19.120> a

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
rollup case you could throw it in a

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.000 
rollup case you could throw it in a
ziploc<00:03:19.720> bag<00:03:20.019> but<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:22.350> if<00:03:23.350> you'll<00:03:23.950> look<00:03:24.190> here

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
ziploc bag but I if you'll look here

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.580 
ziploc bag but I if you'll look here
there's<00:03:27.010> no<00:03:27.280> residue<00:03:28.090> from<00:03:28.299> molding<00:03:28.780> there's

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
there's no residue from molding there's

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.770 
there's no residue from molding there's
that's<00:03:29.950> perfect<00:03:30.579> edge<00:03:30.790> let's<00:03:31.420> turn<00:03:31.690> this

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
that's perfect edge let's turn this

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.289 
that's perfect edge let's turn this
light<00:03:32.049> off<00:03:32.160> it's<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.250> perfect<00:03:33.760> edge<00:03:33.940> that's<00:03:34.209> a

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
light off it's a perfect edge that's a

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.270 
light off it's a perfect edge that's a
perfect<00:03:34.810> edge<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.260> my<00:03:35.650> camera<00:03:35.980> doesn't

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
perfect edge and my camera doesn't

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.370 
perfect edge and my camera doesn't
really<00:03:36.609> suit<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.150> perfectly<00:03:37.690> this<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.170> more

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
really suit this perfectly this is more

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.949 
really suit this perfectly this is more
of<00:03:38.410> an<00:03:38.650> orange-ish<00:03:39.579> yellow<00:03:39.660> you're<00:03:40.660> seeing<00:03:40.900> a

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
bright yellow in yours this is kind of

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.180 
bright yellow in yours this is kind of
orange<00:03:42.850> yellow<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:45.959> don't<00:03:46.959> know<00:03:47.079> it<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:47.920> like<00:03:48.160> it

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
orange yellow I don't know it I like it

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.810 
orange yellow I don't know it I like it
this<00:03:49.000> button<00:03:49.299> is<00:03:49.829> what<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:50.859> lounge<00:03:51.190> raved<00:03:51.640> about

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
this button is what I lounge raved about

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.259 
this button is what I lounge raved about
now<00:03:52.150> if<00:03:52.239> you<00:03:52.329> look<00:03:52.540> at<00:03:52.660> that<00:03:52.810> we<00:03:53.230> flip<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.650> up

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
now if you look at that we flip this up

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.059 
now if you look at that we flip this up
that's<00:03:55.269> just<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.630> little<00:03:55.870> circular<00:03:56.230> pad<00:03:56.799> so

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
that's just a little circular pad so

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.530 
that's just a little circular pad so
when<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.250> push<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.640> down<00:03:57.819> i'm<00:03:58.000> assuming<00:03:58.269> the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
when you push that down i'm assuming the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.170 
when you push that down i'm assuming the
circle<00:03:58.959> pushes<00:03:59.350> down<00:03:59.530> in<00:03:59.769> and<00:04:00.459> gets<00:04:01.000> that

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
circle pushes down in and gets that

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.370 
circle pushes down in and gets that
button<00:04:01.510> for<00:04:01.720> you<00:04:03.359> I'm<00:04:04.359> liking<00:04:04.870> this<00:04:04.989> so<00:04:05.200> far
