00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
strengths and potential your weaknesses

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:29.370 
strengths and potential your weaknesses
are

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380

are
and<00:04:30.380> those<00:04:30.650> are<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.950> five<00:04:31.370> key<00:04:32.060> aspects<00:04:32.870> when

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
and those are the five key aspects when

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.280 
and those are the five key aspects when
it<00:04:33.680> comes<00:04:33.920> to<00:04:34.130> qualifying<00:04:34.640> your<00:04:34.880> leads<00:04:35.290> that

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
you need to to be asking before even

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.480 
you need to to be asking before even
really<00:04:42.110> you<00:04:42.440> know<00:04:42.590> if<00:04:42.710> you're<00:04:43.070> meeting<00:04:43.460> with

really front from the start of the

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.420 
really front from the start of the
engagement

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
engagement

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.700 
engagement
now<00:04:49.730> you<00:04:50.030> don't<00:04:50.390> or<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.690> communication<00:04:51.500> you

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
don't have to be getting all of that

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.290 
don't have to be getting all of that
information<00:04:54.470> in<00:04:54.590> one<00:04:54.620> go<00:04:55.040> if<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.850> do<00:04:56.090> then

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
information in one go if you do then

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.390 
information in one go if you do then
that's<00:04:56.480> great<00:04:56.630> but<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:57.680> don't<00:04:57.710> have<00:04:58.100> to<00:04:58.340> you

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
that's great but you don't have to you

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.210 
that's great but you don't have to you
can<00:04:58.490> you<00:04:58.880> can<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.630> know<00:04:59.750> drip<00:05:00.020> that<00:05:00.290> that

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
can you can you know drip that that

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.909 
can you can you know drip that that
questioning<00:05:01.820> sequence<00:05:02.270> out<00:05:02.480> as<00:05:02.870> you<00:05:03.140> go<00:05:03.380> but

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
questioning sequence out as you go but

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.440 
questioning sequence out as you go but
you<00:05:03.950> do<00:05:04.310> need<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.550> capture<00:05:05.000> all<00:05:05.150> of<00:05:05.300> that

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
you do need to capture all of that

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.840 
you do need to capture all of that
information<00:05:05.720> because<00:05:06.470> it<00:05:06.950> then<00:05:07.280> becomes<00:05:07.700> the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
information because it then becomes the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.580 
information because it then becomes the
basis<00:05:08.440> of<00:05:09.440> whether<00:05:10.010> or<00:05:10.130> not<00:05:10.280> that<00:05:11.590> potential

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
basis of whether or not that potential

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.490 
basis of whether or not that potential
client<00:05:13.280> or<00:05:13.520> customer<00:05:13.790> is<00:05:14.330> actually<00:05:14.720> right<00:05:15.169> for

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
client or customer is actually right for

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.620 
client or customer is actually right for
your<00:05:15.620> business<00:05:16.070> now<00:05:16.970> I'm<00:05:17.120> gonna<00:05:17.300> leave<00:05:17.510> you

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
and he says successful people ask better

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.400 
and he says successful people ask better
questions<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:23.180> as<00:05:23.360> a<00:05:23.390> result<00:05:23.900> they<00:05:24.169> get
