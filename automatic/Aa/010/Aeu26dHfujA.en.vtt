80 foot pounds and they don't need to be
rechecked<00:00:27.240> after<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.140> tighten<00:00:28.439> them<00:00:28.529> down<00:00:28.560> if

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
rechecked after you tighten them down if

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.589 
rechecked after you tighten them down if
it<00:00:29.519> happened<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.060> like<00:00:30.269> an<00:00:30.390> Eddie<00:00:30.539> Bauer

come with aluminum rims the spec for

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.299 
come with aluminum rims the spec for
those<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.329> 800<00:00:36.870> foot-pounds<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.129> as

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
those is 800 foot-pounds just about as

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.709

after<00:00:42.719> 25<00:00:43.260> miles<00:00:43.559> you're<00:00:43.739> going<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.920> want<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
after 25 miles you're going to want to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.190 
after 25 miles you're going to want to
recheck<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> lug<00:00:44.789> nuts<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.930> said<00:00:46.079> we

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
recheck the lug nuts like I said we

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.660 
recheck the lug nuts like I said we
don't<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.129> one's<00:00:47.370> we're<00:00:47.550> just

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
don't have to on this one's we're just

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.310 
don't have to on this one's we're just
going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> tighten<00:00:48.120> them<00:00:48.210> down<00:00:48.239> using<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
going to tighten them down using the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
going to tighten them down using the
star<00:00:49.680> procedure<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.789> same<00:00:50.969> procedure<00:00:51.270> you

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
star procedure the same procedure you

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.510 
star procedure the same procedure you
use<00:00:51.660> force<00:00:51.989> snugging<00:00:52.559> them<00:00:52.590> down<00:00:52.829> we're<00:00:53.399> going

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
use force snugging them down we're going

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.930 
use force snugging them down we're going
to<00:00:53.579> start<00:00:53.789> from<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.570> move<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.620> hear<00:00:55.940> from

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to start from here and move to hear from

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.900 
to start from here and move to hear from
there<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.270> there<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.350> from<00:00:58.739> here<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.579> there

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
there to there and from here to there

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.750 
there to there and from here to there
and<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.260> there<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.309> reason<00:01:02.579> why<00:01:02.699> you

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
and here to there the reason why you

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.060 
and here to there the reason why you
can't<00:01:03.120> torque<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:03.629> lug<00:01:03.989> nuts<00:01:04.260> with<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
can't torque your lug nuts with the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.039 
can't torque your lug nuts with the
wheel<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> air<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.240> there's<00:01:06.810> no

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
wheel in the air is there's no

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.080 
wheel in the air is there's no
resistance<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.400> were<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.580> take<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.939> put

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
resistance if you were to take and put

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.969 
resistance if you were to take and put
your<00:01:09.330> 4-way<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.380> try<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.560> tighten<00:01:10.799> it

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
your 4-way on it and try and tighten it

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.380 
your 4-way on it and try and tighten it
down<00:01:11.010> you're<00:01:11.369> not<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:11.970> them<00:01:12.090> tight

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
down you're not going to get them tight

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.390 
down you're not going to get them tight
enough<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.960> hold<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.619> wheel<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.250> any

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
enough to hold the wheel on for any

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.149 
enough to hold the wheel on for any
decent<00:01:15.240> amount<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.540> time<00:01:15.920> that's<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.040> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
decent amount of time that's all you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.560 
decent amount of time that's all you
look<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.400> vehicle<00:01:17.700> down<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.540> let

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
look at your vehicle down and you let

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.270 
look at your vehicle down and you let
the<00:01:18.869> weight<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> friction<00:01:19.619> between<00:01:19.920> the

ground and the tire hold it still for
you<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.100> tighten<00:01:23.369> them<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:29.329> right

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
you and you tighten them down right

00:01:30.329 --> 00:02:01.209 
you and you tighten them down right
there<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:37.400> here

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.779 

and<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.299> proper<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.789> torque

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
and that is the proper way to torque

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.200 
and that is the proper way to torque
your<00:02:06.030> vehicle's<00:02:06.780> lug<00:02:06.959> nuts
