so<00:03:52.750> they're<00:03:53.349> kind<00:03:53.530> of<00:03:53.590> interesting<00:03:54.069> but

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
nonetheless a bit of work the stuff is

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.659 
nonetheless a bit of work the stuff is
coming<00:03:58.359> up<00:03:58.629> what<00:03:58.780> we<00:03:58.900> would<00:03:59.019> have<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.260> do<00:03:59.409> is

coming up what we would have to do is

veneering this for us who really won't

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.879

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.730 
Riva near it after this is all cleaned
up<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.490> have<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:44.790> have<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.570> jig<00:04:46.140> that's<00:04:46.440> going

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
up you have to have a jig that's going

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.370

pressure while the glue cures that's a

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.640 
pressure while the glue cures that's a
more<00:04:54.120> complicated<00:04:54.300> thing<00:04:54.930> than<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.470> might

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
more complicated thing than you might

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.090 
more complicated thing than you might
think

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
think

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.000 
think
the<00:04:56.370> outside<00:04:56.820> also<00:04:57.330> is<00:04:58.200> is<00:04:58.680> time-consuming

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
the outside also is is time-consuming

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.250 
the outside also is is time-consuming
and<00:04:59.550> then<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.060> very<00:05:00.270> top<00:05:00.510> edge<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:01.050> this

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
and then the very top edge that this

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.460 
and then the very top edge that this
angle<00:05:01.580> bevel<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:02.790> also<00:05:03.390> veneered<00:05:03.780> so<00:05:04.080> this

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
angle bevel is also veneered so this

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.560 
angle bevel is also veneered so this
this<00:05:04.710> piece<00:05:04.950> is<00:05:05.220> time-consuming<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:06.270> bottom

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
this piece is time-consuming the bottom

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.830 
this piece is time-consuming the bottom
frequently<00:05:07.310> plywood<00:05:08.310> frequently<00:05:08.790> has<00:05:08.970> a<00:05:09.000> bit

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
frequently plywood frequently has a bit

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.300 
frequently plywood frequently has a bit
of<00:05:09.870> carpet<00:05:10.290> and<00:05:10.350> glued<00:05:10.590> in<00:05:10.710> it<00:05:10.860> or<00:05:10.980> something

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
of carpet and glued in it or something

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.800 
of carpet and glued in it or something
like<00:05:11.400> that<00:05:11.460> so<00:05:11.850> I<00:05:11.880> think<00:05:12.240> that's<00:05:12.540> what<00:05:12.720> the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
like that so I think that's what the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.050 
like that so I think that's what the
residual<00:05:13.200> is<00:05:13.350> there<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:15.360> speaker<00:05:15.750> grille<00:05:16.110> is

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
residual is there the speaker grille is

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.390 
residual is there the speaker grille is
made<00:05:18.060> typically<00:05:18.810> by<00:05:19.020> Mercedes<00:05:19.500> this<00:05:19.710> piece<00:05:20.010> is

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
made typically by Mercedes this piece is

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.570 
made typically by Mercedes this piece is
sub<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:21.450> base<00:05:21.630> is<00:05:21.930> plywood<00:05:22.410> it's<00:05:22.950> veneered

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
sub the base is plywood it's veneered

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.930 
sub the base is plywood it's veneered
and<00:05:23.820> then<00:05:24.450> the<00:05:24.840> latticework<00:05:25.440> is<00:05:25.940> european

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
and then the latticework is european

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.960 
and then the latticework is european
beach<00:05:27.120> again<00:05:27.920> so<00:05:28.920> this<00:05:29.100> is<00:05:29.310> factory<00:05:29.730> original

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
beach again so this is factory original

this<00:05:30.450> is<00:05:30.510> factory<00:05:31.050> original<00:05:31.230> but<00:05:32.010> this

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
this is factory original but this

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.530 
this is factory original but this

something like that it's all in one
sheet<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:47.520> you<00:05:47.610> just<00:05:47.790> cut<00:05:47.970> it<00:05:48.090> up<00:05:48.240> and<00:05:48.420> and

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
good-sized piece of walnut burl so you

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.000 
good-sized piece of walnut burl so you
have<00:05:57.630> to<00:05:57.840> work<00:05:58.050> with<00:05:58.260> it<00:05:58.350> but<00:05:58.500> one<00:05:58.650> thing<00:05:58.680> it

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
have to work with it but one thing it

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.030 
have to work with it but one thing it
