00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.740
 My name is Evgeny Green This video 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.650
 caste is devoted to photographing 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.480
 auras of man instruments 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.770
 I did an experiment I found it in Moscow 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.180
 these devices which often 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.310
 photo distribution 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.450
 Auras paid and decided to see what 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.550
 will be what results 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.280
 will provide what will tell that will show 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.020
 about me that the gadget can reveal 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.970
 very simple that is there lbook 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.420
 webcams then take your picture 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.030
 and another little thing where you put your hand there 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.920
 there are such metal points and 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.710
 they clearly measure your electromagnetic 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.320
 field that is kauri is not an attitude 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.840
 has no after you gave 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.640
 picture I saw that there is an aura on 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.950
 as ovoid as his books 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.899
 naturally it is wrong that is it 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.550
 Immediately says that it is configured 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.489
 magnetic field according to some 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.199
 mathematical calculation and it was 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.330
 made a special check it's two 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.250
 people and this field here this one 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.530
 formochka anime size were here 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.210
 equally the only thing that were zones from 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.460
 in different places tinted different 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.350
 flowers that makes all the difference that is 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.110
 talks about what's being done 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.580
 some kind of mathematical calculation and how 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.909
 the result is something based on this 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.770
 nonsense is issued further that I do not 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.530
 I liked what elements this is what 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.259
 all the graphics all the results they are very 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.360
 abstract i am a physicist myself 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.210
 theorists know perfectly well if you want 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.400
 give any result and do to 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.930
 he looked right to do 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.610
 relatively scale is not clear 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.159
 relatively something that is roughly speaking 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.799
 you draw from one to a hundred and always 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.540
 show it here from 1 to 100 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.890
 what are the results then you are not 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.930
 say what units 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.460
 what is this one hundred and so on 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.380
 that is , you will have some graphics 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.210
 it seems like accounting is know how with 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.170
 the usual point of view is beautifully impressive 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.240
 but it is not clear that you issue that is of 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.880
 this relativity she allows 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.519
 hide anything and all the charts 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.790
 they were built on this principle there 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.500
 it is not clear what they show absolutely 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.110
 explain it naturally operator too 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.209
 cannot as result that is it 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.690
 any such aura photography i am 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.610
 rivers 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.310
 you perceive more precisely as 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.810
 entertainment than well 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.810
 truthful information
