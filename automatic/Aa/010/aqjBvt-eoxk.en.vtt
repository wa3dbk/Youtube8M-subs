00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
of an undercut because it's shorter

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.739 
of an undercut because it's shorter
around<00:01:45.319> my<00:01:45.469> ear<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.099> I<00:01:46.789> have<00:01:47.029> this<00:01:47.270> hair

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
around my ear and I have this hair

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.979 
around my ear and I have this hair
coming<00:01:48.229> down<00:01:48.499> it's<00:01:48.739> long<00:01:49.119> but<00:01:50.119> it's<00:01:50.840> pretty

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:50.989 
coming down it's long but it's pretty

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:54.370 
coming down it's long but it's pretty
short<00:01:51.349> in<00:01:51.499> the<00:01:51.560> back<00:01:51.880> and<00:01:52.880> on<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.049> side<00:01:54.349> I

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
short in the back and on this side I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.309 
short in the back and on this side I
think<00:01:54.770> it's<00:01:54.859> a<00:01:54.979> little<00:01:55.310> shorter<00:01:55.909> than<00:01:56.209> it<00:01:57.079> is

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
think it's a little shorter than it is

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.629 
think it's a little shorter than it is
on<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:58.159> right<00:01:58.399> side<00:01:59.049> but<00:02:00.049> I<00:02:00.380> like<00:02:01.099> it<00:02:01.279> tried<00:02:01.609> to
