00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
sure what the end result would be so I'm

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.519

want<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> explain<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.220> couple<00:00:20.460> techniques<00:00:21.000> that

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
want to explain a couple techniques that

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.670 
want to explain a couple techniques that
I<00:00:21.240> use<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.750> again<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.470> how<00:00:22.650> I

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
I use and again this is just how I

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.320 
I use and again this is just how I
personally<00:00:23.010> approach<00:00:23.640> hair<00:00:23.880> trimming<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
personally approach hair trimming the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.150 
personally approach hair trimming the
first<00:00:24.539> one<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.930> I'll<00:00:25.050> take<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.439> small<00:00:25.590> strand<00:00:26.010> of

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
first one is I'll take a small strand of

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160 
first one is I'll take a small strand of
hair<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.640> I'll<00:00:26.789> make<00:00:27.000> small<00:00:27.449> snips<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
hair and I'll make small snips with the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.019 
hair and I'll make small snips with the
scissors<00:00:28.470> pointing<00:00:28.859> downwards<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.789> think

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
scissors pointing downwards and I think

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.240 
scissors pointing downwards and I think
this<00:00:30.179> helps<00:00:30.449> with<00:00:30.599> layering<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.349> next<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.980> if

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
this helps with layering the next is if

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
this helps with layering the next is if
I<00:00:32.369> feel<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.790> strand<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.270> hair<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.920> too

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
I feel that a strand of hair is too

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.950 
I feel that a strand of hair is too
thick<00:00:35.219> or<00:00:35.489> has<00:00:35.790> been<00:00:35.940> cut<00:00:36.120> too<00:00:36.270> bluntly<00:00:36.570> across

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
thick or has been cut too bluntly across

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.580 
thick or has been cut too bluntly across
or<00:00:37.260> looks<00:00:37.469> choppy<00:00:37.770> I'll<00:00:38.550> take<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> scissors

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
or looks choppy I'll take the scissors

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.220 
or looks choppy I'll take the scissors
facing<00:00:40.590> towards<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> end<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.000> hair

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
facing towards the end of the hair

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.389 
facing towards the end of the hair
vertically<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.530> I'll<00:00:43.860> cut<00:00:44.070> out<00:00:44.100> small

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
vertically and I'll cut out small

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.520 
vertically and I'll cut out small
sections<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.809> kind<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.110> thins<00:00:46.350> it

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
sections and this just kind of thins it

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.709 
sections and this just kind of thins it
out<00:00:46.620> my<00:00:47.010> last<00:00:47.250> bit<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> advice<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> work<00:00:48.539> in

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
out my last bit of advice is to work in

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.569 
out my last bit of advice is to work in
small<00:00:48.960> sections<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.739> work<00:00:49.950> really<00:00:50.190> slowly

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
small sections and work really slowly

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.580 
small sections and work really slowly
and<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.149> will<00:00:51.300> help<00:00:51.390> prevent<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.559> from

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and that will help prevent you from

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.680 
and that will help prevent you from
cutting<00:00:53.039> off<00:00:53.250> too<00:00:53.430> much<00:00:53.579> hair<00:00:53.879> okay<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.420> what

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.800 
so far and now I'm just going to
continue<00:01:23.070> cutting<00:01:23.670> along<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.299> back<00:01:24.540> section

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
to continue cutting the top portion here

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.680 
to continue cutting the top portion here
as<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:51.410> can<00:01:51.440> see<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:52.010> top<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:52.520> all<00:01:52.730> pretty

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
as you can see the top is all pretty

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.320 
as you can see the top is all pretty
much<00:01:53.840> one<00:01:54.260> length<00:01:55.220> shred<00:01:55.730> across<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.240> I'm

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
much one length shred across and I'm

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.120 
much one length shred across and I'm
going<00:01:56.480> to<00:01:56.510> make<00:01:56.690> it<00:01:56.870> so<00:01:57.050> it's<00:01:57.230> shorter<00:01:57.680> on<00:01:57.890> this

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
going to make it so it's shorter on this

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.820 
going to make it so it's shorter on this
side<00:01:58.400> and<00:01:58.640> then<00:01:59.150> it'll<00:01:59.540> gradually<00:02:00.110> get<00:02:00.620> longer

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
side and then it'll gradually get longer

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:20.560 
side and then it'll gradually get longer
on<00:02:01.160> this<00:02:01.340> side<00:02:17.170> as<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:19.460> get<00:02:19.790> around<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.240> cutting

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
on this side as I get around to cutting

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.080 
on this side as I get around to cutting
this<00:02:20.960> side<00:02:21.260> of<00:02:21.620> my<00:02:21.770> hair<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.250> will<00:02:22.550> be<00:02:22.820> cutting

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
this side of my hair I will be cutting
