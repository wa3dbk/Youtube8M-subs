come with any tech at all as you can
tell<00:04:38.600> so<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:39.630> had<00:04:39.810> to<00:04:39.840> pull<00:04:40.080> one<00:04:40.200> down

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
tell so I had to pull one down

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.390 
tell so I had to pull one down
and<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:43.000> also<00:04:43.300> use<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:44.730> water<00:04:45.730> temperature<00:04:46.150> gauge

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
and I also use a water temperature gauge

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.070 
and I also use a water temperature gauge
because<00:04:48.400> i<00:04:48.520> could<00:04:48.730> not<00:04:48.760> tap<00:04:49.180> into<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.780> Hyundai

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
because i could not tap into the Hyundai

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.370 
because i could not tap into the Hyundai
which<00:04:50.260> I<00:04:50.380> probably<00:04:50.560> could<00:04:50.890> but<00:04:51.930> some<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:53.050> little

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
which I probably could but some a little

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.810 
which I probably could but some a little
more<00:04:53.530> worth<00:04:53.680> than<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:54.010> really<00:04:54.220> wanted<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.580> so<00:04:54.790> I

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
more worth than I really wanted to so I

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.520 
more worth than I really wanted to so I
just<00:04:55.000> used<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.270> mechanical<00:04:55.690> gauge<00:04:55.870> which<00:04:56.200> was

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
just used the mechanical gauge which was

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.760 
just used the mechanical gauge which was
beautiful<00:04:57.220> so<00:04:58.210> we<00:04:58.360> have<00:04:58.480> C<00:04:58.690> gauges<00:04:59.590> which

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
beautiful so we have C gauges which

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.550 
beautiful so we have C gauges which
