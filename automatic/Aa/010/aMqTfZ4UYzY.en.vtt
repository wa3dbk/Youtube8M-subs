want to two strings of hair of course

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.790 
want to two strings of hair of course
you<00:00:57.059> do<00:00:57.210> because<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.879> be<00:00:59.879> thicker

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
you do because it's going to be thicker

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.579 
you do because it's going to be thicker
for<00:01:01.800> example<00:01:02.359> this<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> different

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
for example this is from a different

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.690 
for example this is from a different
pack<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> same<00:01:05.339> type<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
pack but it's the same type of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.350 
pack but it's the same type of
extensions<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.600> they're<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.960> old<00:01:07.140> um<00:01:08.360> this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
extensions that they're just old um this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.390 
extensions that they're just old um this
is<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> double<00:01:09.930> weft<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.650> I've<00:01:10.890> taken<00:01:11.100> two

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
is a double weft so I've taken two

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880 
is a double weft so I've taken two
layers<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.299> sewed<00:01:12.570> them<00:01:12.689> together<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.350> then

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
layers and sewed them together and then

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.679 
layers and sewed them together and then
I<00:01:13.920> sewed<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.250> clips<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.760> myself<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.540> if

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
I sewed the clips on myself because if

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.649 
I sewed the clips on myself because if
you<00:01:15.810> sew<00:01:16.140> them<00:01:16.320> yourself<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.729> cheaper<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
you sew them yourself it's cheaper to

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.390 
you sew them yourself it's cheaper to
buy<00:01:18.780> extensions<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.560> way<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.979> are<00:01:20.100> already

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
buy extensions that way that are already

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.859 
buy extensions that way that are already
just<00:01:21.299> by<00:01:21.570> themselves<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:23.630> selling<00:01:24.630> them<00:01:24.750> on

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
just by themselves and selling them on

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.340 
just by themselves and selling them on
is<00:01:25.020> better<00:01:25.229> when<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:27.320> you<00:01:28.320> can

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
is better when you do it because you can

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.950 
is better when you do it because you can
get<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.700> clips<00:01:29.970> where<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> want<00:01:30.479> them<00:01:30.630> at<00:01:30.780> in

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
get the clips where you want them at in

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.080 
get the clips where you want them at in
your<00:01:31.079> hair<00:01:31.229> first<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.650> all<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.909> can

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
your hair first of all and then you can

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.120 
your hair first of all and then you can
sew<00:01:33.360> them<00:01:33.509> super<00:01:34.049> tight<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.009> they

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
sew them super tight on there so they

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.249 
sew them super tight on there so they
won't<00:01:35.280> be<00:01:35.460> breaking<00:01:35.729> off<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.390> other<00:01:36.750> crappy

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
won't be breaking off like other crappy

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.420 
won't be breaking off like other crappy
exemptions<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:39.119> um<00:01:39.900> these<00:01:40.439> are<00:01:40.890> human

hair<00:01:41.610> blends<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.659> curl<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.590 
hair blends so you can curl them and you
can<00:01:43.619> straighten<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.729> recommend<00:01:45.570> not

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
can straighten them but I recommend not

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.490 
can straighten them but I recommend not
doing<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.829> mean<00:01:47.100> there's<00:01:47.790> no<00:01:47.909> reason<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> you

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
doing so I mean there's no reason to you

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.929 
doing so I mean there's no reason to you
will<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:50.040> would<00:01:50.250> say<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
will do this I would say if you want to

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.639 
will do this I would say if you want to
straighten<00:01:51.210> them<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:51.960> another<00:01:52.200> set

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
straighten them to just get another set

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.100 
straighten them to just get another set
to<00:01:53.040> keep<00:01:53.220> straight<00:01:53.689> because<00:01:54.689> there<00:01:54.930> are<00:01:54.990> only

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to keep straight because there are only

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.420

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
you're looking at so it's about the same

want with it the same guy that I use on
my<00:03:23.530> hair<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:24.040> do<00:03:24.370> my<00:03:24.520> hair<00:03:24.730> this<00:03:25.000> light<00:03:25.990> of<00:03:26.260> a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
my hair to do my hair this light of a

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.630 
my hair to do my hair this light of a
blonde<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:28.180> I<00:03:28.720> get<00:03:29.680> mine<00:03:29.830> this<00:03:30.070> color<00:03:30.280> really

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.270 
blonde so I get mine this color really
easily<00:03:31.020> but<00:03:32.020> I<00:03:32.350> don't<00:03:32.620> think<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:32.950> can<00:03:33.100> get

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
easily but I don't think you can get

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.980 
easily but I don't think you can get
blonde<00:03:33.580> ones<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.000> dye<00:03:34.150> them<00:03:34.390> your<00:03:34.780> color

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
blonde ones and dye them your color

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.020 
blonde ones and dye them your color
because<00:03:35.470> I<00:03:35.740> think<00:03:36.040> it'll<00:03:36.340> completely<00:03:36.850> mess

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
because I think it'll completely mess

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.750 
because I think it'll completely mess
them<00:03:37.240> up<00:03:37.380> but<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.530> can<00:03:38.800> it'll<00:03:39.310> be<00:03:39.370> easy<00:03:39.640> if<00:03:39.700> you

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
them up but you can it'll be easy if you

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.550 
them up but you can it'll be easy if you
have<00:03:39.790> black<00:03:40.090> hair<00:03:40.360> or<00:03:40.600> just<00:03:40.660> like<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.140> regular

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
have black hair or just like a regular

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.890 
have black hair or just like a regular
chocolatey<00:03:42.310> color<00:03:42.550> because<00:03:43.540> then<00:03:43.690> you'll<00:03:43.810> be

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
chocolatey color because then you'll be

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.840 
chocolatey color because then you'll be
able<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.110> find<00:03:44.350> them<00:03:44.530> but<00:03:45.959> um<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.700> keep<00:03:48.700> these

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750
