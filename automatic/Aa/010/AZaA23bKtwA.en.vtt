00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
jack-in-the-box too good I think it's

jack-in-the-box too good I think it's
actually<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.770> positive<00:02:20.130> addition<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.880> menu

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
actually a positive addition to the menu

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.440 
actually a positive addition to the menu
and<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.290> good<00:02:22.470> item<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.060> think<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.390> is

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
and a good item and I think this is

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.500 
and a good item and I think this is
probably<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.930> first<00:02:24.990> time<00:02:25.320> that<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:26.880> fast-food

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
probably the first time that a fast-food

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.170 
probably the first time that a fast-food
operation<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.530> recent<00:02:29.370> memory<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.850> actually

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
operation in recent memory is actually

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.560 
operation in recent memory is actually
offering<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.660> donut<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.290> their<00:02:32.250> menu<00:02:32.580> even

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
offering a donut on their menu even

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.820 
offering a donut on their menu even
though<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.870> breakfast<00:02:34.230> d<00:02:34.380> item<00:02:34.709> it's

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
though it's a breakfast d item it's

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.250 
though it's a breakfast d item it's
available<00:02:35.070> all<00:02:35.310> day<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.840> actually<00:02:36.840> got<00:02:37.110> this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
available all day I actually got this

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.830 
available all day I actually got this
like<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.530> two<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.980> afternoon<00:02:38.600> it's<00:02:39.600> fresh

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
like a two in the afternoon it's fresh

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.540 
like a two in the afternoon it's fresh
it's<00:02:40.080> hot<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:41.100> think<00:02:41.220> they're<00:02:41.459> actually

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
it's hot so I think they're actually

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.940 
it's hot so I think they're actually
making<00:02:41.850> them<00:02:42.060> all<00:02:42.180> day<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.660> mean<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.620> guess<00:02:43.650> that

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
making them all day I mean I guess that

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.620 
making them all day I mean I guess that
solves<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.310> plus<00:02:44.519> side<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:44.940> being<00:02:45.209> at<00:02:45.570> a

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
solves the plus side to it being at a

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.960 
solves the plus side to it being at a
fast<00:02:45.930> food<00:02:46.080> joint<00:02:46.700> they're<00:02:47.700> pretty<00:02:47.910> much

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
fast food joint they're pretty much

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.210 
fast food joint they're pretty much
making<00:02:48.269> them<00:02:48.480> all<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.690> time<00:02:48.900> because<00:02:49.680> at<00:02:50.010> some

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
making them all the time because at some

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.979 
making them all the time because at some
point<00:02:50.280> they<00:02:50.640> do<00:02:50.700> have<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.390> know<00:02:51.510> provide<00:02:51.810> a

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
point they do have to you know provide a

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.930 
point they do have to you know provide a
decent<00:02:52.230> product<00:02:52.590> unlike<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.100> donut<00:02:53.489> shop<00:02:53.700> where

they didn't even call him cronuts me and

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.270 
they didn't even call him cronuts me and
a<00:03:58.140> whole<00:03:58.320> bunch<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:58.560> other<00:03:58.650> people<00:03:59.010> are<00:03:59.100> just

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
a whole bunch of other people are just

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.760 
a whole bunch of other people are just
you<00:03:59.490> know<00:04:00.140> referring<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.170> them<00:04:01.350> as<00:04:01.440> currents

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
you know referring to them as currents

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.730 
you know referring to them as currents
where<00:04:01.830> they're<00:04:01.950> not<00:04:02.070> Cronin's<00:04:02.490> I<00:04:03.650> think<00:04:04.650> if

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
where they're not Cronin's I think if

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.990 
where they're not Cronin's I think if
they<00:04:04.830> didn't<00:04:05.040> come<00:04:05.190> croissant-doughnut<00:04:05.820> I

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
they didn't come croissant-doughnut I

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.450 
they didn't come croissant-doughnut I
just<00:04:06.210> call<00:04:06.390> them<00:04:06.570> doughnuts<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.470> think<00:04:08.340> they're

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
just call them doughnuts I think they're

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.650 
just call them doughnuts I think they're
probably<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.820> lot<00:04:09.030> less<00:04:09.210> like<00:04:09.600> trash<00:04:10.530> talking<00:04:11.040> I

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
probably a lot less like trash talking I

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.700 
probably a lot less like trash talking I
mean<00:04:12.660> this<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:12.870> pretty<00:04:12.990> much<00:04:13.230> like<00:04:13.410> a<00:04:13.470> donut

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
mean this is pretty much like a donut

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.430 
mean this is pretty much like a donut
shop<00:04:13.890> donut<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.370> me<00:04:14.750> like<00:04:15.750> honestly<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.260> think

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
shop donut to me like honestly I think

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.750 
shop donut to me like honestly I think
it<00:04:16.799> would<00:04:16.950> be<00:04:17.070> great<00:04:17.190> if<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.520> was<00:04:17.610> made<00:04:17.730> a

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
it would be great if it was made a

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.750 
it would be great if it was made a
little<00:04:18.030> bit<00:04:18.120> bigger<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:19.080> then<00:04:19.230> again<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.760> mean

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
little bit bigger but then again I mean

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.650 
little bit bigger but then again I mean
dollar<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.810> piece<00:04:22.020> that's<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.440> bit<00:04:22.650> steep<00:04:23.040> for

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
dollar a piece that's a bit steep for

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.660 
dollar a piece that's a bit steep for
what's<00:04:24.660> essentially<00:04:25.290> a<00:04:25.350> 2-byte<00:04:25.830> donut<00:04:26.280> like

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
what's essentially a 2-byte donut like

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.920 
what's essentially a 2-byte donut like
but<00:04:29.670> you<00:04:29.820> know<00:04:29.910> it's<00:04:30.060> fast<00:04:30.210> food<00:04:30.450> here<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:32.930> guess

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
but you know it's fast food here I guess
