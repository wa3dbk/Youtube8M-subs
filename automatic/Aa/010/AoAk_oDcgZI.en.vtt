00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.690 
where you're doing these without moving
around<00:01:40.560> you'll<00:01:40.799> find<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.159> as<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.400> get<00:01:41.549> more

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
around you'll find that as you get more

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.910 
around you'll find that as you get more
tired<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.869> start<00:01:43.140> increasing<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
tired and as you start increasing the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.620 
tired and as you start increasing the
the<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:45.750> tempo<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.850> getting<00:01:47.850> deeper<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.540> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the the tempo and getting deeper in the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.359 
the the tempo and getting deeper in the
frets<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.500> it'll<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:50.159> difficult

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
frets and that it'll be more difficult

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.819 
frets and that it'll be more difficult
so<00:01:50.850> we're<00:01:51.390> going<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.570> first<00:01:51.720> start<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.140> this

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
so now let's do a different combination

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.890 
so now let's do a different combination
we<00:02:42.620> just<00:02:42.799> did<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.010> middle<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.579> now<00:02:44.360> let's<00:02:44.599> try

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
we just did the middle to now let's try

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.979 
we just did the middle to now let's try
to<00:02:44.989> do<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:47.060> second<00:02:47.420> finger<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.750> fourth

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
to do the second finger and fourth

00:02:47.989 --> 00:03:06.789 
to do the second finger and fourth
finger<00:03:04.299> okay<00:03:05.299> now<00:03:05.750> let's<00:03:05.780> try<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.260> first<00:03:06.590> and

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
finger okay now let's try the first and

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:19.210 
finger okay now let's try the first and
third<00:03:06.950> finger<00:03:17.650> notice<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.799> fingers

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
third finger notice that the fingers

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.159 
third finger notice that the fingers
that<00:03:19.370> i'm<00:03:19.459> not<00:03:19.700> using<00:03:20.090> i'm<00:03:20.389> making<00:03:20.720> sure<00:03:20.750> that

three and four without trying to move

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.190 
three and four without trying to move
around<00:03:49.730> it's<00:03:50.120> really<00:03:50.359> difficult<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.810> do<00:03:51.019> so

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
around it's really difficult to do so

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.099 
around it's really difficult to do so
we'll<00:03:52.190> try<00:03:52.370> that<00:03:52.579> one<00:03:52.790> start<00:03:53.389> off<00:03:53.540> with<00:03:54.099> here

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:11.140 

up<00:04:00.109> another<00:04:00.410> fret<00:04:04.239> up<00:04:05.239> again<00:04:09.819> then<00:04:10.819> all<00:04:11.000> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:30.630 

Brad<00:04:20.380> gradually<00:04:20.980> bring<00:04:21.160> it<00:04:21.250> back<00:04:29.430> you'll<00:04:30.430> find
