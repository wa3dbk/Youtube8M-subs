and<00:00:57.020> then<00:00:57.320> you're<00:00:57.470> on<00:00:57.560> to<00:00:57.590> turn<00:00:58.250> 7<00:00:58.640> which<00:00:59.210> again

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
and then you're on to turn 7 which again

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.870 
and then you're on to turn 7 which again
is<00:00:59.900> very<00:01:00.050> slippery<00:01:00.560> so<00:01:00.800> you're<00:01:00.950> gonna<00:01:01.160> try<00:01:01.820> to

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
is very slippery so you're gonna try to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.200 
is very slippery so you're gonna try to
use<00:01:02.150> so<00:01:02.270> much<00:01:02.360> curved<00:01:02.720> as<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:02.960> can<00:01:04.210> breaking

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
use so much curved as you can breaking

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.340 
use so much curved as you can breaking
in<00:01:05.300> to<00:01:05.390> turn<00:01:05.570> eight<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.200> an

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
in to turn eight and this is an

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.610 
in to turn eight and this is an
important<00:01:06.680> one<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:06.920> have<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.070> get<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.310> exit

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
important one you have to get the exit

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.530 

this<00:01:10.130> is<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.400> most<00:01:10.580> mentally<00:01:11.330> demanding

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
this is the most mentally demanding

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.510 
this is the most mentally demanding
circuit<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.500> h<00:01:12.590> street<00:01:12.770> circuit<00:01:13.220> there's<00:01:13.400> no

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
circuit the h street circuit there's no

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.390 
circuit the h street circuit there's no
room<00:01:13.730> for<00:01:13.880> error<00:01:14.000> it's<00:01:14.720> just<00:01:14.900> barriers<00:01:15.400> it's

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
room for error it's just barriers it's

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.100 
room for error it's just barriers it's
so<00:01:16.670> fast<00:01:16.970> by<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:17.270> time<00:01:17.450> you've<00:01:17.570> gone<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.960> full

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
so fast by the time you've gone to full

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.350 
so fast by the time you've gone to full
throttle<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:18.470> at<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.740> next<00:01:18.770> corner<00:01:19.210> we<00:01:20.210> have
