actually<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.910> believe<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> book<00:00:28.699> and<00:00:29.699> one

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
actually I believe in the book and one

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.849 
actually I believe in the book and one
tip<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.689> saw<00:00:30.929> online<00:00:31.109> was<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.500> remove<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
tip I saw online was to remove the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.060 
tip I saw online was to remove the
battery<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:33.170> think<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> other<00:00:34.440> option<00:00:34.920> because

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
battery I think the other option because

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.889 
battery I think the other option because
I<00:00:35.309> maybe<00:00:35.640> prefer<00:00:36.030> not<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.239> disconnect<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
I maybe prefer not to disconnect the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.690 
I maybe prefer not to disconnect the
battery<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.320> today's<00:00:37.680> electronics<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
battery with today's electronics just a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.069 
battery with today's electronics just a
personal<00:00:38.969> opinion<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.510> might<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.930> take

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
personal opinion as I might just take

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.619 
personal opinion as I might just take
out<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:41.790> air<00:00:41.969> cleaner<00:00:42.390> assembly<00:00:44.270> just<00:00:45.270> unplug

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
out the air cleaner assembly just unplug

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.410 
out the air cleaner assembly just unplug
this<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.770> push<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.420> button<00:00:50.300> pull<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
this here push on that button pull it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.299 
this here push on that button pull it
off<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:52.250> that<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:55.320> they<00:00:55.680> got<00:00:55.829> eight

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
off like that and they got eight

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.119 
off like that and they got eight

Philips<00:01:00.949> take<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.160> off<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.110> barely

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
Philips take that off and you can barely

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:14.140 
Philips take that off and you can barely
see<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.210> right<00:01:06.210> down<00:01:06.390> there<00:01:11.000> right<00:01:12.000> there

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
see it right down there right there

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.490 
see it right down there right there
and<00:01:15.150> honestly<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.750> read<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.080> my<00:01:16.229> hand

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and honestly I can read you with my hand

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.230 
and honestly I can read you with my hand
and<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.430> will<00:01:17.490> probably<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:18.060> reach<00:01:18.210> down

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and I will probably just reach down

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.170 
and I will probably just reach down
there<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.900> unplug<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.850> then<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.000> just

side

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.760 
side
actually<00:02:01.540> looks<00:02:01.750> like<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.140> passenger<00:02:02.590> side

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
actually looks like the passenger side

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:17.690 
actually looks like the passenger side
it's<00:02:02.920> pretty<00:02:03.100> easy<00:02:12.660> right<00:02:13.660> down<00:02:13.900> there<00:02:15.390> so

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
it's pretty easy right down there so

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.690 
it's pretty easy right down there so
lots<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.850> space<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.390> passenger<00:02:19.870> side

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
lots of space on the passenger side

remove the battery and or the air

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.280 
remove the battery and or the air
cleaner<00:02:23.170> assembly<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.360> then<00:02:25.480> there's<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.750> ten

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
cleaner assembly and then there's a ten

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.210 
cleaner assembly and then there's a ten
millimeter<00:02:26.470> bolts<00:02:26.800> as<00:02:27.040> well<00:02:28.980> right<00:02:29.980> down

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
millimeter bolts as well right down

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.530 
millimeter bolts as well right down
there<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.750> there's<00:02:34.990> probably<00:02:35.560> up<00:02:36.540> another

there and there's probably up another
one<00:02:37.750> right<00:02:37.900> there

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
one right there

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.520 
one right there
ten<00:02:38.500> millimeter<00:02:38.920> bolt<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.630> maybe<00:02:40.900> one<00:02:41.140> inside

ten millimeter bolt and maybe one inside

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.300 
ten millimeter bolt and maybe one inside
the<00:02:41.680> case<00:02:41.890> as<00:02:42.100> well<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:44.470> if<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.770> helps<00:02:45.250> you

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
the case as well so if this helps you
