00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.820
 magnificent and welcome to a year or 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.619
 review on these I bring the part of so 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.510
 droid for our samsung galaxy note 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.180
 well you know it's available for 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.840
 other devices such as for example 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.910
 galaxy nexus nexus 4 or nexus 7 and 10 I think 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.520
 that also in two ways in the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.930
 description I leave a list a link 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.140
 where the list of all the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.300
 compatible devices and good as 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.280
 I have commented on others in other videos 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.500
 but well I will continue commenting on it 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.629
 first the first feature of 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.760
 this rom are that you can change the mode 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.530
 of the system interface is to say what 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.649
 you can put in fablet mode which is 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.989
 also mix between tablet and mobile in 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.269
 phone mode which is the normal mobile and in 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.710
 tablet mode now I will be able to teach you 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:07.460
 how to do it good in settings 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.080
 if we go to customization we have the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.600
 hybrid properties and this is where 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.610
 we can change the way in which 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.280
 Our samsung galaxy does not donate our 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.280
 device as it shows the version of 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.860
 android for example that would be the normal 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.240
 explains good a change of wing of 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.149
 locarno and android 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.579
 where previous versions to this is that 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.799
 has gone from having to restart to 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.270
 make these changes so you do not have to 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.979
 do what 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 and then well here you see the bar has 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.180
 been equal and the notification bar is 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.950
 normal 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.630
 then there is the fable mode that is the one 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.390
 you have seen before I had and the way 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.020
 tablet that is small medium large that 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.600
 always only have in the medium that is 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.690
 simplifications above and with the bar 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.690
 of applications and the status bar 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.690
 here 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:05.230
 apart from another novelty are the colors 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.230
 is to customize it this status bar 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.580
 if the bar has been in all 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.530
 suites can be remarkable but also 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.930
 mobile and tablet and this you can 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.250
 customize your love 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.490
 as not apart 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.340
 here you see the interface to change the 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.440
 Weak system 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.510
 I recommend you look at something because 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.000
 it's very complex to explain in a video 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.370
 it's like the resolution our 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.099
 mobile the weaker the bigger the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.720
 will see as it were the letter look at me 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.720
 for example 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.580
 in whatsapp I have changed the resolution 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.350
 so that instead of looking big 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.540
 almost nothing is small and I have also 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.790
 customized the colors that I said 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.730
 before in beige the bar state of change 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.360
 of colors is green and red and normal 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:58.030
 excess is good black on the screen 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.740
 transparent start and white also at 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.420
 google play come by default that 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.670
 also change 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.110
 you see now it's orange and this red and 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.530
 well then we can select from a 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.530
 application list 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.410
 which we want and edit the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.750
 colors for example I'm going to put 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.850
 phone message and we're going to download them from 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.530
 beige we apply 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.530
 and we are to see how it would look 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.780
 or the one that gives 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.150
 the application can not be started 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.000
 selected please do it 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.050
 manually 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.050
 we go to phone 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.230
 it looks like a truck 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.090
 has wanted to leave me bothers me once 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.560
 we will alternate the application as 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.340
 as the phone is an application of the 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.140
 system and so on so let's try for 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.140
 example on twitter we go to applications 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.140
 and to see 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.010
 recipe 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.010
 where is the tweet 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.940
 I had already modified the list of 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.250
 modified well then that would be like 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.250
 it would default to 320 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:29.860
 and you see that it looks pretty big because if 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.860
 I lowered it to 220 and applied it clear 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.870
 You see that it looks smaller and 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.630
 take more advantage of the screen than this 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.760
 it's positive me in my galaxy I do not notice it 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.450
 quite then you can also change the 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.450
 colors as I said 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.169
 and to force it to look 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.169
 you have it here below 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.460
 and good bread configurations 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.900
 walking and basically are these other 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.540
 feature that we can find in 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.700
 this rom is in the expanded model 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.490
 that there are some you will know what it is that you 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.020
 hidden bar notifications and 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.080
 status buttons hundreds of 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.470
 devices or have and have the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.409
 one hundred percent of the screen 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.619
 for your use and enjoyment so to speak 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:22.319
 that is for example if you have buttons 

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:24.869
 that here added as Annex 7 the 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:28.679
 hide and then how can you enjoy 

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:31.649
 two phones that happens clear if not 

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:33.330
 you have buttons those buttons where are they 

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:36.809
 well, dragging from the part of 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.899
 below we display the android the foot that 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:42.659
 so they have decided to call what is good now 

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:44.610
 It explains a bit how it works before 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.289
 nothing to tell you that you can have in 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.889
 any mobile phone 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:52.679
 I leave here the link annan my video 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.659
 where he explained how to install it and how it 

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:57.059
 use more or less and well now I'm going to 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.380
 bring the camera a little closer to teach 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:01.220
 the best 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.220
 How is it 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.110
 dragging from below 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.460
 we see that the buttons come out back home 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.180
 to see the tightening open is to look 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:17.849
 and - here is a summary 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.039
 you see that you have some letters here 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.849
 these letters are summary to smooth the 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.789
 battery the date 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:29.809
 the events that you have that I do not know very 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:33.800
 well where to get out if he's connected 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:35.569
 to wifi mobile internet or the battery 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.099
 battery also tells you here you see this 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:41.869
 bar has 14 percent and 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:45.619
 presented in low and good if you do not have 

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:47.240
 the finger here is 66 say up to 

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:49.490
 you drag to this area of acne 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.259
 continue that you see that the 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.729
 multiplications good if you release just 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.729
 there are the notifications 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.310
 and if it's against results in the other 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.760
 side you leave the status bar as 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.760
 you can see here 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:13.300
 good and basically that's more adjustments 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.860
 are those of the blocking screen in that 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.980
 for example see through and me when 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.260
 block the mobile 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.500
 it is seen through the lock screen 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:23.700
 does not show the wallpaper but the 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.860
 star and the toolbar 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.770
 well then I deploy it fast yes 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.800
 unfold the notification bar by 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.070
 there in mode a normal way the bar comes out 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.900
 state 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.450
 and good watch shows that the battery 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.340
 will be circular and know percentage and 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.680
 count notifications for example 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:45.210
 like in the mail now that you tell me 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.210
 the emails that I have in signal 

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.510
 I know very little but I hope you see it 

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.470
 good 

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.470
 and good
