you know cars back to stock the way they
were<00:00:29.919> so<00:00:30.919> when<00:00:31.789> I<00:00:31.820> got<00:00:32.090> it<00:00:32.270> I<00:00:32.419> mean<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:32.809> looked

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
were so when I got it I mean it looked

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.660 
were so when I got it I mean it looked
really<00:00:33.140> good<00:00:33.260> but<00:00:33.739> if<00:00:34.070> you<00:00:34.219> got<00:00:34.309> up<00:00:34.489> like

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
really good but if you got up like

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.310 
really good but if you got up like
really<00:00:35.000> close<00:00:35.210> you<00:00:35.539> can<00:00:35.690> kind<00:00:35.899> of<00:00:35.930> see<00:00:36.110> a

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
really close you can kind of see a

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.930 
really close you can kind of see a
little<00:00:36.590> bit<00:00:36.739> of<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:36.980> texture<00:00:37.309> here<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:37.760> there

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
little bit of the texture here and there

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.479 
little bit of the texture here and there
so<00:00:38.870> I<00:00:38.899> wasn't<00:00:39.230> ever<00:00:39.500> really<00:00:39.800> a<00:00:40.039> hundred

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
so I wasn't ever really a hundred

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.360 
so I wasn't ever really a hundred
percent<00:00:40.609> happy<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.829> after<00:00:42.829> about<00:00:42.980> a<00:00:43.039> year<00:00:43.129> or

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
percent happy so after about a year or

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.729 
percent happy so after about a year or
so<00:00:43.609> I<00:00:43.879> started<00:00:44.510> doing<00:00:44.870> some<00:00:45.019> research<00:00:45.170> online

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
so I started doing some research online

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.779 
so I started doing some research online
on<00:00:46.129> how<00:00:46.399> to<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:47.090> know<00:00:47.120> properly<00:00:47.629> prep<00:00:47.960> plastic

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
by hand after that I bumped it up to a

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.340 
by hand after that I bumped it up to a
220<00:01:16.030> to<00:01:17.030> try<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:17.270> get<00:01:17.450> all<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.690> texture<00:01:18.050> out<00:01:18.110> of

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
220 to try to get all the texture out of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.240 
220 to try to get all the texture out of
here<00:01:19.120> so<00:01:20.120> I<00:01:20.450> did<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:20.990> with<00:01:21.200> 220<00:01:21.800> sandpaper

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
and I got a majority of the texture out

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.140 
and I got a majority of the texture out
of<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.220> know<00:01:25.310> try<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.550> make<00:01:25.730> it<00:01:25.820> as<00:01:25.910> smooth

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
as possible but not perfect but when I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.280 
as possible but not perfect but when I
started<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.510> know<00:01:29.570> since<00:01:29.840> this<00:01:29.990> thing<00:01:30.140> was

when i standed all this this thing
turned<00:01:34.850> all<00:01:35.000> white<00:01:35.210> because<00:01:35.360> of<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.570> clear

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
turned all white because of the clear

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.790 
turned all white because of the clear
color<00:01:36.080> you<00:01:36.230> know<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:36.700> it<00:01:37.700> wasn't<00:01:38.000> too<00:01:38.150> bad<00:01:38.800> so

600 grit sandpaper wet wet sanding
that's<00:03:47.389> a<00:03:47.510> final<00:03:47.959> step<00:03:48.169> before<00:03:48.349> you<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:49.130> know

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
that's a final step before you you know

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.690 
that's a final step before you you know
you<00:03:49.310> paint<00:03:49.639> it<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:51.099> this<00:03:52.099> is<00:03:52.250> what<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.519> looks

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
you paint it so this is what it looks

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.250 
you paint it so this is what it looks
like<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.000> know<00:03:53.090> once<00:03:53.510> every<00:03:53.660> time<00:03:53.900> you<00:03:54.019> wet

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
like you know once every time you wet

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.819 
like you know once every time you wet
sand<00:03:55.269> now<00:03:56.269> you<00:03:56.329> can<00:03:56.510> see<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.690> lot<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:56.930> these<00:03:57.139> dark

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
sand now you can see a lot of these dark

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.890 
sand now you can see a lot of these dark
areas<00:03:58.069> where<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.489> haven't<00:03:58.849> got<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.269> but<00:03:59.629> it's

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
areas where I haven't got to it but it's

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.659 
areas where I haven't got to it but it's
okay<00:04:00.639> it's<00:04:01.639> not<00:04:01.700> going<00:04:01.879> to<00:04:01.970> affect<00:04:02.209> anything

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
that's what that high build primer is

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.890 
that's what that high build primer is
for<00:04:16.130> for<00:04:16.370> plastic<00:04:18.010> but<00:04:19.010> I<00:04:19.220> forgot<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.669> mention

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
for for plastic but I forgot to mention

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.480 
for for plastic but I forgot to mention
before<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:21.169> even<00:04:21.349> sprayed<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:22.010> after<00:04:22.280> I<00:04:22.310> got

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
before I even sprayed it after I got

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.540 
before I even sprayed it after I got
done<00:04:22.700> sanding<00:04:23.120> it<00:04:23.240> with<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.630> 200<00:04:24.080> grit<00:04:24.460> once<00:04:25.460> I

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
done sanding it with the 200 grit once I

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.730 
done sanding it with the 200 grit once I
cleaned<00:04:25.849> it<00:04:25.909> off<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:26.450> sprayed<00:04:27.050> up

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
cleaned it off I sprayed up

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.290 
cleaned it off I sprayed up
piece<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:27.889> promoter<00:04:28.370> dosage<00:04:28.849> you<00:04:28.970> need<00:04:29.120> for

piece of promoter dosage you need for

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.600 
piece of promoter dosage you need for
plastics<00:04:29.720> so<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.229> primer<00:04:30.710> can<00:04:30.919> bite<00:04:31.130> into<00:04:31.310> the

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610

first wet sand with the six with the 600
sandpaper<00:05:14.470> I'm<00:05:15.470> just<00:05:15.770> going<00:05:15.889> to<00:05:15.919> reshoot<00:05:16.310> it

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
sandpaper I'm just going to reshoot it

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.180 
sandpaper I'm just going to reshoot it
one<00:05:16.610> more<00:05:16.789> time<00:05:17.650> with<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.740> high<00:05:18.889> build<00:05:19.130> primer

going to wet sand it one more time with

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.540 
going to wet sand it one more time with
the<00:05:22.849> 600<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:23.530> that's<00:05:24.530> it<00:05:24.710> I'm<00:05:24.830> done<00:05:25.039> I'm<00:05:25.280> going

after this he's going to shoot it with a

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.409 
after this he's going to shoot it with a
sealer<00:05:33.580> you<00:05:34.580> know<00:05:34.669> it's<00:05:34.820> like<00:05:34.969> it's<00:05:35.180> almost

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
sealer you know it's like it's almost

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.589 
sealer you know it's like it's almost
like<00:05:35.570> a<00:05:36.009> sealer<00:05:37.009> creates<00:05:37.460> like<00:05:37.639> a<00:05:37.669> what<00:05:38.419> pretty

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
like a sealer creates like a what pretty

much seals a the surface you know so

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.560 
much seals a the surface you know so
that<00:05:43.039> you<00:05:43.190> could<00:05:43.520> get<00:05:44.150> any<00:05:44.330> little

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
that you could get any little

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.379 
that you could get any little
imperfection<00:05:45.169> out<00:05:45.289> of<00:05:45.409> here<00:05:46.060> so<00:05:47.060> once<00:05:47.270> he

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
imperfection out of here so once he

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.719 
imperfection out of here so once he
seals<00:05:47.719> it<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:48.110> lets<00:05:48.289> that<00:05:48.469> dry<00:05:48.770> he's<00:05:49.460> going<00:05:49.669> to

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
seals it and lets that dry he's going to

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.670 
seals it and lets that dry he's going to
shoot<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.060> with<00:05:50.180> you<00:05:50.270> know<00:05:50.419> gloss<00:05:51.020> black<00:05:51.259> paint

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.520 
shoot it with you know gloss black paint
and<00:05:51.800> then<00:05:52.840> afterwards<00:05:53.840> you<00:05:53.990> could<00:05:54.080> he<00:05:54.409> could

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
out and I did the same things I did the

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.600 
out and I did the same things I did the
same<00:06:28.430> steps<00:06:28.789> from<00:06:29.120> AIRAID<00:06:30.110> cold<00:06:30.740> air<00:06:31.550> intake

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
same steps from AIRAID cold air intake

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.149 
same steps from AIRAID cold air intake
that<00:06:31.969> I<00:06:32.120> had<00:06:32.389> he<00:06:33.259> had<00:06:33.380> painted<00:06:33.590> that<00:06:33.770> for<00:06:34.009> me
