00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
something I have no idea

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.880 
something I have no idea
power<00:02:01.860> plant<00:02:02.219> south<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:03.090> rock<00:02:03.990> tunnel<00:02:04.350> okay<00:02:04.649> I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
power plant south of rock tunnel okay I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.289 
power plant south of rock tunnel okay I
think<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.280> couldn't<00:02:05.759> get<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:05.969> previously

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
think we couldn't get here previously

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.180 
think we couldn't get here previously
and<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.229> regular<00:02:07.560> game<00:02:07.770> because<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.069> don't

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and the regular game because we don't

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.320 
and the regular game because we don't
have<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.369> serve<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:08.729> now<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:08.940> we<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.119> surf

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
have to serve but now that we have surf

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.540 
have to serve but now that we have surf
in<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.619> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.920> game<00:02:11.099> now<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.430> go

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
in this this kind of game now we can go

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.920 
in this this kind of game now we can go
back

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
back

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.369 
back
I<00:02:11.959> guess<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:13.040> what<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.930> see<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.049> should<00:02:15.260> be

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
I guess is what it is see it should be

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.630 
I guess is what it is see it should be
around<00:02:15.590> here<00:02:15.799> somewhere

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
around here somewhere

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.449 
around here somewhere
got<00:02:17.329> a<00:02:17.359> cool<00:02:17.629> little<00:02:17.810> wacky<00:02:18.290> animation<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.310> we

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
got a cool little wacky animation and we

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.449 
got a cool little wacky animation and we
find<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.909> power<00:02:20.150> plants<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.890> power<00:02:22.099> plants

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
find the power plants the power plants

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.610 
find the power plants the power plants

well<00:02:35.420> let's<00:02:35.659> go<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:36.049> there's<00:02:36.620> thirty<00:02:36.950> waves<00:02:37.189> to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
well let's go in there's thirty waves to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.479 
well let's go in there's thirty waves to
this<00:02:37.549> thing<00:02:37.939> which<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.510> nice<00:02:39.099> nice<00:02:40.099> chunk<00:02:40.430> of

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
this thing which is a nice nice chunk of

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.869 
this thing which is a nice nice chunk of
waves<00:02:41.500> I'm<00:02:42.500> not<00:02:42.709> sure<00:02:42.920> how<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.159> works<00:02:43.459> I

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
waves I'm not sure how this works I

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.640 
waves I'm not sure how this works I
don't<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.480> think<00:02:44.689> there's<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:44.930> Pokemon<00:02:45.409> I<00:02:45.500> go

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
don't I think there's just Pokemon I go

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.530 
don't I think there's just Pokemon I go
by<00:02:45.889> like<00:02:46.549> normal<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.030> don't<00:02:47.060> think<00:02:47.329> they<00:02:47.419> have

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
by like normal I don't think they have

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.089 
by like normal I don't think they have
to<00:02:47.629> get<00:02:47.720> any<00:02:47.900> rare<00:02:48.049> candies<00:02:48.439> or<00:02:48.560> anything<00:02:48.739> but

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
to get any rare candies or anything but

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.059 
to get any rare candies or anything but
well<00:02:49.220> I<00:02:49.519> guess<00:02:49.760> we'll<00:02:49.909> soon<00:02:50.090> find<00:02:50.120> out<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.590> I'm

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
well I guess we'll soon find out and I'm

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.580 
well I guess we'll soon find out and I'm
gonna<00:02:52.189> put<00:02:52.489> everyone<00:02:53.120> down

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
gonna put everyone down

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.119 
gonna put everyone down
looks<00:02:54.859> like<00:02:54.980> they're<00:02:55.129> coming<00:02:55.250> from<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.519> way

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
looks like they're coming from that way

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.860 
looks like they're coming from that way
let's<00:02:58.129> figure<00:02:58.579> out<00:02:58.700> what<00:02:58.939> moves<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.450> use<00:02:59.629> I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
let's figure out what moves to use I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.780 
let's figure out what moves to use I
think<00:02:59.900> I'm<00:03:00.139> gonna<00:03:00.230> use<00:03:00.439> Swords<00:03:01.340> Dance<00:03:01.400> really

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
think I'm gonna use Swords Dance really

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.240 
think I'm gonna use Swords Dance really
quickly<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.439> then<00:03:03.439> I'm<00:03:03.530> gonna<00:03:03.650> use<00:03:03.829> my<00:03:03.950> brick

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
quickly and then I'm gonna use my brick

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.559 
quickly and then I'm gonna use my brick
break<00:03:04.519> because<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.819> makes<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.180> most<00:03:05.209> sense

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
break because that makes the most sense

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.369 
break because that makes the most sense
and<00:03:06.049> then<00:03:06.739> we'll<00:03:06.859> put<00:03:07.040> Mewtwo<00:03:07.519> over<00:03:08.030> here<00:03:08.569> I

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
and then we'll put Mewtwo over here I

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:14.140 
and then we'll put Mewtwo over here I
think<00:03:09.889> we're<00:03:10.489> gonna<00:03:10.639> be<00:03:10.849> using<00:03:12.280> yeah<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.310> don't

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
think we're gonna be using yeah I don't

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.860 
think we're gonna be using yeah I don't
know<00:03:14.629> I<00:03:14.659> guess<00:03:14.900> meteor<00:03:15.260> mash<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:16.870> Blastoise

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
know I guess meteor mash and Blastoise

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.219 
know I guess meteor mash and Blastoise
use<00:03:18.909> ice<00:03:19.909> wasn't<00:03:20.239> gonna<00:03:20.329> be<00:03:20.479> too<00:03:20.780> useful<00:03:21.139> in

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:21.229 
use ice wasn't gonna be too useful in

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:22.659 
use ice wasn't gonna be too useful in
this<00:03:21.319> so<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.470> guess<00:03:21.620> we'll<00:03:21.739> use<00:03:21.859> ice<00:03:22.099> beam<00:03:22.370> and

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
this so I guess we'll use ice beam and

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.610 
this so I guess we'll use ice beam and
then<00:03:23.329> our<00:03:23.479> charge<00:03:23.750> zone<00:03:23.989> will<00:03:24.139> be<00:03:24.169> the<00:03:24.379> lead

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
then our charge zone will be the lead

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.390 
then our charge zone will be the lead
and<00:03:25.299> Charizard<00:03:26.299> can<00:03:26.540> use<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:29.260> yes<00:03:30.260> Rock<00:03:30.680> Slide<00:03:31.040> I

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
and Charizard can use I yes Rock Slide I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.129 
and Charizard can use I yes Rock Slide I
guess<00:03:31.819> maybe<00:03:32.000> Fire<00:03:32.329> Blast<00:03:32.479> is<00:03:32.720> probably<00:03:32.930> best

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
guess maybe Fire Blast is probably best

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.580 
guess maybe Fire Blast is probably best
cuz<00:03:33.439> it's<00:03:33.590> tab<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.250> then<00:03:35.139> thunders<00:03:36.139> pointless

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
cuz it's tab and then thunders pointless

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.969 
cuz it's tab and then thunders pointless
so<00:03:36.859> let's<00:03:37.010> use<00:03:38.139> size<00:03:39.139> strike<00:03:39.530> which<00:03:39.709> we<00:03:39.829> got

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:39.979 
so let's use size strike which we got

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.460 
so let's use size strike which we got
for<00:03:40.220> hitting<00:03:40.400> level<00:03:40.669> 100<00:03:41.090> off-camera<00:03:41.689> and

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
for hitting level 100 off-camera and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.170 
for hitting level 100 off-camera and
then<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.769> don't<00:03:42.949> think<00:03:43.009> I<00:03:43.159> gave<00:03:43.370> vial<00:03:43.729> to<00:03:43.819> move

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
then I don't think I gave vial to move

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.149 
then I don't think I gave vial to move
either<00:03:44.419> sludge<00:03:45.079> bomb<00:03:45.259> is<00:03:45.500> fine<00:03:45.739> all<00:03:46.099> right

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
either sludge bomb is fine all right

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.599 
either sludge bomb is fine all right
cool<00:03:46.609> so<00:03:47.599> that<00:03:47.840> should<00:03:48.169> be<00:03:48.199> good<00:03:48.519> there's<00:03:49.519> an

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
cool so that should be good there's an

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.309 
cool so that should be good there's an
electric<00:03:50.000> buzz<00:03:50.180> which<00:03:50.389> is<00:03:50.479> pretty<00:03:51.049> darn<00:03:51.169> cool

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
electric buzz which is pretty darn cool

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.210 
electric buzz which is pretty darn cool
some<00:03:51.680> Pikachu's<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:53.470> all<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:54.889> fun<00:03:55.159> stuff

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
some Pikachu's and all this fun stuff

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.800 
some Pikachu's and all this fun stuff
I'm<00:03:55.579> really<00:03:55.729> hoping<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.209> we<00:03:56.389> don't<00:03:56.540> have<00:03:56.689> to

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
I'm really hoping that we don't have to

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.439 
I'm really hoping that we don't have to
play

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:58.449 
play

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.449 
play
Zapdos<00:03:59.449> again<00:03:59.810> because<00:04:00.259> Aptos<00:04:00.859> is<00:04:01.040> really

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
Zapdos again because Aptos is really

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.640 
Zapdos again because Aptos is really
tough<00:04:01.729> and<00:04:01.970> i<00:04:02.449> probably<00:04:03.790> would<00:04:04.790> not<00:04:05.650> finish

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
tough and i probably would not finish

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.409 
tough and i probably would not finish
the<00:04:06.949> level<00:04:07.129> but<00:04:07.430> we're<00:04:07.579> gonna<00:04:07.669> go<00:04:07.849> times<00:04:08.120> two

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
the level but we're gonna go times two

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.749 
the level but we're gonna go times two
because<00:04:08.629> this<00:04:09.319> seems<00:04:09.620> easy<00:04:09.889> enough<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:10.459> be<00:04:10.579> on

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:10.759 
because this seems easy enough to be on

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.429 
because this seems easy enough to be on
times<00:04:11.030> two<00:04:11.329> and<00:04:11.359> still<00:04:11.720> kind<00:04:11.989> of<00:04:12.079> be<00:04:12.229> able<00:04:12.319> to

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
times two and still kind of be able to

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.640 
times two and still kind of be able to
pay<00:04:12.650> attention<00:04:12.919> at<00:04:13.370> least<00:04:13.699> until<00:04:14.569> we<00:04:14.629> find<00:04:15.290> out

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
pay attention at least until we find out

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.810 
pay attention at least until we find out
that<00:04:15.859> some<00:04:16.849> other<00:04:17.209> Pokemon<00:04:18.400> comes<00:04:19.400> into<00:04:19.789> our

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
that some other Pokemon comes into our

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.779 
that some other Pokemon comes into our
grasps<00:04:20.779> and<00:04:21.019> tries<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:21.799> face<00:04:22.279> us<00:04:22.490> but<00:04:22.639> right

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
grasps and tries to face us but right

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.129 
grasps and tries to face us but right
now<00:04:22.909> it<00:04:23.029> looks<00:04:23.180> like<00:04:23.240> it's<00:04:23.450> just<00:04:23.539> Magnemite<00:04:24.110> -

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
now it looks like it's just Magnemite -

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.450 
now it looks like it's just Magnemite -

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.030 
episode I guess these are just these are

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.700 
episode I guess these are just these are
two<00:07:18.270> optional<00:07:18.840> ones<00:07:19.050> and<00:07:19.230> I<00:07:19.320> guess<00:07:19.500> you<00:07:19.620> have

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:19.710 
two optional ones and I guess you have

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.950 
two optional ones and I guess you have
to<00:07:19.800> do<00:07:20.190> the<00:07:20.340> elite<00:07:20.670> the<00:07:21.060> victory<00:07:21.390> road<00:07:21.690> in

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
to do the elite the victory road in

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.380 
to do the elite the victory road in
order<00:07:22.470> to<00:07:22.590> get<00:07:22.740> to<00:07:22.830> the<00:07:22.890> Elite<00:07:23.100> Four<00:07:23.400> and<00:07:23.760> so<00:07:24.210> on

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:24.390 
order to get to the Elite Four and so on

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.020 
order to get to the Elite Four and so on
and<00:07:24.540> so<00:07:24.750> forth<00:07:25.110> these<00:07:25.920> looked<00:07:26.190> like<00:07:26.430> this

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.030 
and so forth these looked like this

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.220 
and so forth these looked like this
looks<00:07:27.270> like<00:07:27.360> they're<00:07:27.510> gonna<00:07:27.600> be<00:07:27.690> pretty<00:07:27.990> darn

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.230 
looks like they're gonna be pretty darn

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.150 
looks like they're gonna be pretty darn
difficult<00:07:28.410> so<00:07:28.740> I<00:07:28.800> don't<00:07:28.920> know<00:07:28.980> if<00:07:29.070> they're

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
difficult so I don't know if they're

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.240
