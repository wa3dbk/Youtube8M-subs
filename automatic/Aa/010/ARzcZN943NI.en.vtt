00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:29.490
 And here 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.940
 I imagine that if not many many truths 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.610
 that these games are the advances 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.800
 also because good in the moments more 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.770
 important of the season but that 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.829
 where do you want to play here favorite because 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.329
 a priori real madrid and I know they are a 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.530
 little bit above all the real 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.809
 Madrid for the issue of injuries of the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
 barça or I'm not trusting you in your ex 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.039
 partners in the paper can always 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.559
 have a favorite but when you jump to 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.930
 the court is difficult not many factors 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.789
 include and for example that was shown the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.160
 last year for example the physical end 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.739
 he was favorite and he won olympiacos because 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.260
 good is a game lasts 40 minutes or what 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.450
 same this year 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.490
 the cup of the king with madrid that 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.590
 it became a favorite not only for the 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.930
 party I think to win the cup of the 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.690
 king the barcelona made a great glass of 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.250
 king of madrid not so you can talk 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.870
 of favorites but that will be seen in a 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:26.330
 party on paper sometimes but that 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.030
 has changed from when you pick up the trophy 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.730
 in that legendary strong final of Paris 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.130
 have matured if the truth of sea ​​and 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.120
 matured and grown as a player but still 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.680
 I think a lot still good 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.290
 improve many steps forward and this 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.150
 summer decreasing step to give the year 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.040
 that came then we talk about 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.510
 that maybe he was a bit sad ricky 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.370
 blond you wanted that in such a short time 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.320
 and you will be able to be the ricky again 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.790
 spectacular blonde cheerful when 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.050
 you came to mining because it's maybe what 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.760
 more surprising not the impact so 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.890
 fast you've had in the best league 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.600
 The truth is that it's a first moment 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.430
 I felt very comfortable playing with the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.130
 coach with the system and with the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.320
 companions 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.210
 He was very happy because he's good 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.759
 one season 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.250
 personally not very satisfactory with 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.620
 the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.170
 without joy and retrieves it and quickly the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.170
 well the injury I cut it but but 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.880
 again enjoyed this season and 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.040
 I hope to take a jump you have been surprised 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.050
 weight of weaken the highest defender 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.970
 you are sad been watching how are you 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.560
 so good he had a lot of confidence 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.170
 I do not have when a person has so much 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.310
 trust 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.989
 and it goes wrong but I think flex before 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.200
 talk to him 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.489
 the emperor will be greater now that he has 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.140
 a lot of experience that knows a lot about 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.050
 basketball and so he talks I like 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.950
 very much because you think they have cut 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.959
 levitating good results and they are based 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.459
 by results and the truth is that this 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.890
 year we had in goals that we have not 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.970
 fulfilled and is that someone has to 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.130
 pay but yes they are things that look and 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.510
 that have to be done too and the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.800
 last one explains from the point of view 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.850
 what happens with demolitions because 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.890
 everybody wonders why not 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.970
 again you have suffered the same injury 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.100
 feel increase I do not know if you could 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.950
 talk to him now you also want the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.390
 adidas companion who could not 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.340
 talk lately with him I do not know if 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.010
 when he was in chicago break and still 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.280
 was missing a lot I think it's a system 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.590
 of distrust I believe that every lesson 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.810
 it's different every decision is a world 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.280
 and he has to jump on the court with the 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.069
 real progress whenever it is 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.290
 prepared sometimes costs because the 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.390
 first month what 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.189
 what gives you different players but 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.930
 for example for me the first month and 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.209
 medium 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.189
 I felt that it was not me but they are good 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.140
 things are phases that you have to go through and 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:48.689
 When you 're ready, you have to 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.689
 jump on the court and play the last
