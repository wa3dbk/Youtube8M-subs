00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
least that's what I thought after making

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
one of my allies could jump into it I

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.389 
one of my allies could jump into it I
suddenly<00:00:57.719> realized<00:00:58.260> things<00:00:58.590> did<00:00:58.800> not<00:00:58.829> go<00:00:59.160> well

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.539 
finally start looking up for my team now
that<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.290> advantage<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> spare

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that we have the advantage but I spare

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.370 
that we have the advantage but I spare
no<00:01:47.820> time<00:01:48.119> going<00:01:48.420> back<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> enemy<00:01:48.990> turf<00:01:49.229> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
no time going back to the enemy turf to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.190 
no time going back to the enemy turf to
keep<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.619> pressure<00:01:49.829> on

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
keep the pressure on

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.880 
keep the pressure on
unfortunately<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.290> turned<00:01:52.530> out<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.860> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
unfortunately this turned out to be a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.950 
unfortunately this turned out to be a
bad<00:01:53.100> move<00:01:53.369> not<00:01:53.759> only<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.180> fail<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.689> keep<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
bad move not only do I fail to keep the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.380 
bad move not only do I fail to keep the
enemy<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.320> bay<00:01:55.350> so<00:01:56.130> does<00:01:56.310> my<00:01:56.490> team<00:01:56.549> leaving<00:01:57.270> us

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
enemy at bay so does my team leaving us

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.660 
enemy at bay so does my team leaving us
yet<00:01:57.659> again<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> disadvantage

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.429 

I<00:02:00.729> managed<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.479> counter<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.990> attempted

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.560 
I managed to counter the attempted
ambush<00:02:02.890> here<00:02:03.189> but<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:03.729> does<00:02:03.939> little<00:02:04.299> to<00:02:04.330> help

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
ambush here but is does little to help

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.660 
ambush here but is does little to help
in<00:02:04.689> a<00:02:04.750> predicament<00:02:05.049> my<00:02:05.350> team<00:02:05.590> finds<00:02:06.009> itself<00:02:06.340> in

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.050

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
here

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.210

I<00:02:13.090> accidentally<00:02:13.870> call<00:02:14.080> upon<00:02:14.290> my<00:02:14.470> teammates<00:02:15.010> I

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
I accidentally call upon my teammates I

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.860 
I accidentally call upon my teammates I
believe<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.670> was<00:02:15.880> just<00:02:16.060> trying<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.360> encourage

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
believe I was just trying to encourage

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.050 
believe I was just trying to encourage
them<00:02:17.230> not<00:02:17.500> call<00:02:17.890> them<00:02:18.069> all<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.370> my<00:02:18.459> location

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
them not call them all to my location

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.090 
them not call them all to my location
still<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.930> make<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.380> best<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.680> it<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:20.950> make<00:02:21.069> a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
still I make the best of it and make a

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.880 
still I make the best of it and make a
direct<00:02:21.250> assault<00:02:21.550> on<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:21.910> enemy<00:02:22.030> turf<00:02:22.890> but

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
direct assault on the enemy turf but

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.530 
direct assault on the enemy turf but
things<00:02:24.190> simply<00:02:24.640> don't<00:02:24.850> turn<00:02:25.030> out<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.300> way<00:02:25.420> I'd

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
things simply don't turn out the way I'd

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.150 
things simply don't turn out the way I'd
hoped<00:02:25.630> they<00:02:25.959> would<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.440> feel<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:26.860> might<00:02:27.069> have

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.350 
hoped they would I feel I might have
done<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.340> better<00:02:27.519> difference<00:02:27.940> if<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.120> actually

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
done a better difference if I actually

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.479 
done a better difference if I actually
remember<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.080> use<00:02:29.200> my<00:02:29.350> special<00:02:29.680> where<00:02:30.340> there's

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489
