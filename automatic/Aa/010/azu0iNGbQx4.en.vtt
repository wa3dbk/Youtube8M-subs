00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.680
 I got to know at the stops in 2005 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.189
 not as a photographer but as a buyer in 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.380
 actually I am a designer lent to 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.710
 photography at that time in the 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.830
 2005 many of us many designers between the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.280
 2002 2005 touched heaven with a 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.980
 finger when he saw that he entered on 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.199
 market because before it was a lot 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.960
 difficult to find good photographs ad 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.070
 a competitive price 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.290
 then it happened as it happened 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.629
 practically 90 percent of the 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.600
 people who took mine in 2005 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.449
 first digital SLR and I tried to 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.559
 make proclamations made in so many to load 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.869
 a couple of photos of his from the stroke and from 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.199
 there everything was born especially from the point of 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:07.409
 human sight because getting in at the stop me 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.229
 made a lot of people known 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.770
 really nice and really open to 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.840
 help those who took their first steps in 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.530
 photo a little more serious 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.600
 probably the most exciting thing about 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.060
 ice stop by photographer is the freedom that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.260
 grants from the creative point of view that 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.780
 after a mythical istockalypse in 2006 a 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.020
 ljubljana I had this great 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.020
 honor to be called to be part of 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.680
 inspector team become inspector 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.979
 it means having a technical knowledge 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.159
 very wide to recognize what they are 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.110
 also the problems of an image al 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.880
 time of printing 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.549
 clearly for those like me who come from 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.979
 design world some things are more 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.979
 easy to absorb but it makes you 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.030
 I really count those that are 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.490
 sometimes technical limitations of 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.630
 grainy image or with 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:15.160
 strong limbs I think I can say that 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.430
 from 2009 to today it is three years 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.220
 best of my life because 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.870
 methods of production and creation 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.610
 of images released from any 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.190
 limit any obligation whatsoever 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.709
 customer there are no briefs except those 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.819
 that a photographer does to himself 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:41.160
 personally I prefer still life 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:43.870
 I love spending a lot of time looking for 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.660
 compositions that can help i 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.900
 designers in their daily work for 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.910
 the choice of subjects follow us a little 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.209
 on the one hand the seasons the more needs 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.930
 commercial and on the other you create that 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.780
 which is believed to be in some way 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.030
 still lack behind each image 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.849
 I've created there is always a bit of 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.299
 a designer who lives in me is true 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.519
 also that there are productions based 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.130
 on instinct I was among the first to 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.290
 think of photographing my parents 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.040
 no one would ever have thought of seeing i 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:26.859
 mine in a billboard 12 meters by 8 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.359
 advertise in front of a supermarket 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:34.920
 products for the third age the question 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:40.080
 of personal taste is something 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:43.260
 very important to stop what 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.460
 I think I did is bring the style 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.290
 of the esselunga advertising 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.110
 looking for a little bit of mediation 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.590
 the block on white with the use also 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:59.820
 of photoshop and the addition of others 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.500
 elements of a non-funny episode 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.410
 nothing happens by chance that one of the photos 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.540
 best seller of my two parents 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.960
 ends up on a flyer of the british 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.380
 national party which is a party of 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.980
 far right and I knew nothing about it 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.500
 and it was really helpful to have to stop to 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.440
 shoulders the funny thing was that then 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.540
 received calls from the day to 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.750
 guardian and other newspapers up here 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.690
 London asking for information and thanks 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.150
 precisely with the help of the office 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.540
 legal of ice cap date date given 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.660
 too many details to avoid that 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.340
 the story could be somehow 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.730
 instrumentalized and a skill that second 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.410
 I need it today to have success is 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:54.540
 having your own style a style 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:58.230
 personal ability to make 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.510
 the unique image I believe the thing 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.650
 minimum that you must have so much 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:07.980
 curiosity as equipment then for 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:10.620
 manage a photographer activity instead 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.280
 micro stock for sure serves a big one 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.950
 ability to use the computer 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.730
 beyond the object it captures 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.190
 pictures 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.470
 the most important thing as it turned out 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.729
 they manage and process and that 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.729
 could make the difference
