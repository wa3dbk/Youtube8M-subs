now Patrick's gonna bet it 45 Grand like

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.920 
now Patrick's gonna bet it 45 Grand like
he's<00:01:37.110> got<00:01:37.320> ace<00:01:37.500> king<00:01:41.150> Jamey<00:01:42.150> knows<00:01:42.299> that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
he's got ace king Jamey knows that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.010 
he's got ace king Jamey knows that
Patrick<00:01:43.409> doesn't<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.890> Jack<00:01:44.159> nine<00:01:44.750> but<00:01:45.750> Jamie

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
Patrick doesn't have Jack nine but Jamie

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.069 
Patrick doesn't have Jack nine but Jamie
should<00:01:46.259> also<00:01:46.409> realize<00:01:46.799> he<00:01:47.549> only<00:01:47.759> bet<00:01:48.079> 15,000

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
should also realize he only bet 15,000

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.109 
should also realize he only bet 15,000
on<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> flop<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.340> possible<00:01:50.670> that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
on the flop so it's possible that

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.679 
on the flop so it's possible that
patrick<00:01:52.049> has<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.439> stack<00:01:53.240> but<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.270> don't<00:01:54.540> think

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
patrick has a stack but I don't think

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.290 
patrick has a stack but I don't think
Jamie<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.200> stop<00:01:55.470> himself
