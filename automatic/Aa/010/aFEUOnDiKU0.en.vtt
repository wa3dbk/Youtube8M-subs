00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:10.860 

yep<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:01.520> pens<00:03:04.630> this<00:03:05.630> is<00:03:05.810> what<00:03:05.960> I<00:03:05.990> found<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.380> day

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.260 

1987<00:03:13.900> carry<00:03:14.900> on<00:03:15.550> alright<00:03:16.550> just<00:03:16.850> had<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.000> lovely

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
1987 carry on alright just had a lovely

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.890 
1987 carry on alright just had a lovely
signal<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.200> it's<00:03:18.380> on<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.650> surface<00:03:19.270> is<00:03:20.270> it<00:03:20.810> a

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
signal and it's on the surface is it a

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:30.340 
signal and it's on the surface is it a
hammered<00:03:22.300> can<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:23.390> see<00:03:23.600> that<00:03:29.050> looks<00:03:30.050> thin

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
hammered can you see that looks thin

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:46.290 
hammered can you see that looks thin
enough<00:03:43.480> is<00:03:44.480> hammered<00:03:44.900> but<00:03:45.050> it's<00:03:45.380> not<00:03:45.530> silver<00:03:45.980> I

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
enough is hammered but it's not silver I

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.640 
enough is hammered but it's not silver I
think<00:03:47.300> it<00:03:47.450> could<00:03:47.630> be<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> token<00:03:51.640> hmm<00:03:53.650> gently

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
think it could be a token hmm gently

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:03.940 
think it could be a token hmm gently
clean<00:03:54.860> that<00:03:55.220> one<00:03:55.340> another<00:03:55.670> little<00:03:55.970> again

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.820 

no<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:04.980> don't<00:04:05.340> think<00:04:05.520> it<00:04:05.610> is<00:04:05.640> silver<00:04:06.150> oh<00:04:06.800> well

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830

keep going
I<00:04:09.830> find<00:04:10.830> it<00:04:11.760> looks<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.390> be<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:18.739> bit<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.889> one

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070
