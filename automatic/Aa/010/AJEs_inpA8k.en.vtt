00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.940
 Do you really like to be Asian? 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.210
 we are here today about sophie and 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.820
 lisa has some important sushi-masters 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.820
 Facts on the subject elicited a lot of fun 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.449
 Sushi is a Japanese dish and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.750
 comes from the adjective sushi 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.520
 that means sour and sour 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.380
 also the rice and that of the special one 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.410
 sushi it in the salt and sugar 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.059
 it was invented in java 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.400
 and to conserve fish 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.040
 he was wrapped in vinegar rice and 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.629
 stayed fresh longer when you sushi 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.190
 you also do not want to make 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.829
 take some rice but the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.079
 special sushi rice and that is with 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.719
 very little water boiled and swells 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.120
 then on and for how long does he cook exactly 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.879
 about 40 with 50 minutes 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 i like to eat i but thats 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.859
 yes, not the only one so nicely explained 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.480
 what else is there 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.000
 second is mark ii operation 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.220
 training team is fourth but can now 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.320
 again from scratch we want maki 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.320
 make and seemed to cut 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.940
 first the tuna in small pieces 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.100
 a piece of algae cuts it up 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.659
 the bamboo mat spread on the mat 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.659
 he rice and then the whole thing becomes whole 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:29.610
 rolled in emotional and in how many 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:32.340
 pieces cut normal ries from the 10th 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.070
 In the hand but nice is also sushi 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.240
 master and how many years does it take 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.800
 until you can do it all 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.610
 seven years ago 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:46.080
 seven years inside out so kirol makes 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.390
 one with fresh foil delicious if I 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.520
 so shoot then I put the ginger 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.980
 always on the sushi then the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.470
 Wasabi paste and then I do the whole thing 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.780
 say it is in the soy sauce 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:06.240
 wrong because the ginger is one 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:08.460
 in between and in the soy sauce 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.710
 only the fish dipped not the rice 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:16.620
 Is it actually by hand or 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.930
 with chopsticks team says because it is yes 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.420
 finger food but quite expensive 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.160
 fingerfood a tuna was added the other day 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.850
 an auction in a japan 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.270
 record price of 56 4 9 million yen 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.820
 that is 500 68.000 euro 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.290
 and then sushi is still very important 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.450
 will not be demolished or small 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.290
 cut but in a whole 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.360
 eaten 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.190
 and what do you actually wear to sushi 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.100
 gen drinking tea I drink quite like 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.660
 because that is probably synonymous look how 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.230
 nice that looks almost like a 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:57.170
 artwork as many sushi roll and here 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.170
