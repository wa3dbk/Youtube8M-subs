00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
also as with normal mode you have an

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.210 
also as with normal mode you have an
interrupt<00:04:29.610> on<00:04:29.819> the<00:04:29.940> bottle<00:04:30.360> all<00:04:30.690> times<00:04:31.110> one<00:04:32.069> of

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
interrupt on the bottle all times one of

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.360 
interrupt on the bottle all times one of
those<00:04:32.400> single<00:04:33.300> target<00:04:33.720> frost<00:04:34.199> blasts<00:04:34.860> get

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
those single target frost blasts get

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.990 
those single target frost blasts get
through<00:04:35.750> onto<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.870> tank<00:04:37.139> then<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:38.460> could

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
through onto the tank then it could

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.100 
through onto the tank then it could
easily<00:04:39.389> kill<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.199> tank<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:41.240> think<00:04:42.240> one<00:04:42.720> or<00:04:42.900> two

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
easily kill the tank I think one or two

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.200 
easily kill the tank I think one or two
did<00:04:43.530> get<00:04:43.830> through<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.340> we<00:04:44.520> were<00:04:44.699> lucky<00:04:44.940> and

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
did get through and we were lucky and

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:53.110 
did get through and we were lucky and
survived<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:48.949> anyway<00:04:49.949> I<00:04:50.569> think<00:04:51.569> that's<00:04:51.930> all

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
survived it anyway I think that's all

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.629 
survived it anyway I think that's all
