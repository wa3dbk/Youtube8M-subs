 area it descends from truck to truck 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.730
 wheel alone 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.860
 this is the extreme madness of the largest and 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.860
 best furniture fair not the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.680
 people did a report that the fair did not 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.420
 it is only this internal presentation without 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.360
 many accessories for those who like 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.459
 modify the car so we will only see the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:53.099
 full article now 160 companies 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.560
 gathered in one place to improve the 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.090
 art of modifying a car 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.040
 we estimate that the Brazilian market 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.140
 is around 8 billion reais per 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.170
 year in the United States have an association 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.970
 of this market and generate 31 billion 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.290
 of dollars per year in the market is large 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.440
 worldwide is in Brazil 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.110
 growing and if there is a tendency it 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.000
 calls the enveloping technique 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.150
 coat the car with a sticker 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.600
 usually frosted the novelty is a sticker 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.670
 that does not bubble is the material is cute 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.769
 technology developed here in the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.959
 Brazil made it much easier to apply 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.230
 first professional today he can 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.989
 apply the adhesive in almost 50% - of 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.790
 time or if not anyone can want 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.380
 the weekend pick up the material 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.660
 and make your own vehicle 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.440
 here is a self-adhesive textured car 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.040
 crocodile and other tattooed is a technique 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.410
 clipping or wrapping that allows 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.140
 that the original color of the car phase is that 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.940
 you do some kind of drawing and that 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.070
 do all the customization of your car 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.340
 sound also mandatory equipment 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.980
 for this group and the trend is adult 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.970
 All at the same time now 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.800
 bluetooth gps 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.680
 fm cd and dvd a tip for beginners nor 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.780
 everything that changes is tunin requires the car 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.630
 custom is usually an old car 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.150
 with modification to this custom speech 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.070
 there is commercial noise 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.440
 the person who is audi of does not like sound 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.720
 invests enough in sound to a little 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.460
 visual chaos is an organized 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.650
 motor enthusiasts have the 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.120
 prepared cars that the investment 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.610
 higher in the engine to have more 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.220
 performances more performance batistinha

 is one of the best known names in the 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.040
 I do not like to mix things up 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.500
 that do not match 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.050
 I think it's nice of you to understand what the 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.850
 car design and you put things 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.370
 that match the car there are a lot of people 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.530
 which modifies the car there people look 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.080
 with this in mind that this is here next 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.180
 team besides knowing the vehicles 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.940
