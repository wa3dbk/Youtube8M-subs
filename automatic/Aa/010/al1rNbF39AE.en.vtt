gen<00:00:48.540> consoles<00:00:49.080> so<00:00:49.290> it<00:00:50.250> seems<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> common

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270

trend<00:00:51.630> now<00:00:51.900> which<00:00:52.170> i<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.220> a<00:00:53.280> good<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
trend now which i think is a good and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.270 
trend now which i think is a good and
bad<00:00:54.000> thing<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:54.810> I<00:00:55.140> mean<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.770> gives<00:00:56.160> us

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
bad thing but I mean it gives us

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.920 
bad thing but I mean it gives us
something<00:00:56.310> to<00:00:56.640> play<00:00:56.850> our<00:00:57.000> new<00:00:57.210> consoles<00:00:57.750> so
