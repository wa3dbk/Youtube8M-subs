00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Gorgeous friends today I will be you 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.520
 show times as you yourselves one to 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.200
 the herringbone can make soft looks 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.290
 actually quite complicated 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.000
 But it is not and will not be 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.980
 Certainly many people will appeal to it 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.139
 because it just looks pretty cool 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.970
 and if you do, I would 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.949
 Huge huge pictures he looks forward to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.560
 instagram linked me most 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.730
 the pictures on gags and or in facebook 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.429
 or twitter or whatever and go 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.759
 So let's go first of all 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.219
 first my hair would come through so well 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.110
 many hairs and next me 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.469
 Now first on a page vertex 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.469
 this page 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.670
 so now we can finally too 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.100
 I start directly and I do it 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.860
 Now all hair on this page 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.600
 my left your right I believe and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.309
 Now I have my whole first 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.559
 hair 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:02.609
 in two parts and pi times thumb the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.379
 half about 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.320
 and now I take the index finger of 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.390
 my left hand this is this her 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.610
 index finger and go from behind into this 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.500
 pure and share a whole 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.350
 little strand victim she really is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.090
 not big and not fat and take 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.840
 I now and lay down on the other 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.409
 page 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.560
 here the first hardest after him 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.939
 has mastered the beginning then it works like that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.659
 and now I take my right hand 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.970
 and give the forefinger again 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.369
 here in this strand purely in this whole 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.189
 great and we divide again on small 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.409
 whether these I now lead back to the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.970
 tighten the other side and always nice 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.680
 You see, there is a small one here 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.540
 braiding now and now I hold 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.369
 my hair, if necessary, by hand 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.649
 here only me that I hold 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.299
 do not mix and take mine again 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.490
 forefinger and go from behind this 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.570
 pure and share a small 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.790
 and put her on the other side 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.620
 you go in here with your right hand 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.300
 you can also from here below the 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.429
 hair looks that looks also very nice 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.250
 and above that would be the whole fish 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.870
 Peter hopes it really only completely 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.530
 small strands always on the side 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.530
 switch 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.470
 the smaller the strands the more 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.700
 finer then yes s.schlueuss from ever 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.970
 after how much time the case 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.230
 need a bit I can go you 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.580
 Now just in and then I can 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.260
 just turn my hand and have already 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.670
 I on the other side and with the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.050
 right hand like me then just this 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.050
 Shake a little bit again 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.200
 [Music] 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.030
 and I like it best when it's 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.590
 behind the ear starts that looks easy 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.209
 a bit nicer than this 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.390
 also hang your murder or still 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.209
 worse at the front assures easy 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.410
 nice behind mooren and I do 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.610
 just always the same 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.500
 you have to have a bit of yours too 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.910
 Find out how to use your own technology 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.390
 want to keep top ten 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.769
 So like your own fingertips until 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.300
 I think I can do that best 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:16.690
 now trained with that 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:18.250
 forefinger so for the soft needs 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.480
 you a little bit so there it needs 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.000
 a few minutes that is now 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.830
 not such a 5 minute deadline if you are 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.060
 late in my opinion after it 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.450
 there are people who can do that pretty much 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.069
 fast 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.989
 So these people just one 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.880
 really great effect and it's worth it 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.560
 sometimes a bit more time 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.560
 to invest in this hairstyle 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:46.450
 [Music] 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.420
 if you think you are 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.990
 that have braided long enough that would be 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.270
 now in my case here then i take 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.760
 me now such a hair gum so one 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.840
 very small transparent hair tie 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.400
 from rossmann the cost around two euros 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.260
 and I like to join them in general 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.370
 all hairstyles and then I make myself 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.840
 just for a moment and if you want that 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.700
 did you do then you can drum because 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.710
 now a bit at will 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.930
 gamble because you see is now 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.900
 not quite as uniform here 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.870
 this slight curve somehow and there 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.970
 I can just do this here with me 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:30.460
 thumb and forefinger and take it like that 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.330
 Plucking a bit was also with us 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.550
 the whole hand 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.860
 depending on if you have stages then 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.500
 I can not recommend it that way but yes 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.580
 if your hair is not that level I am 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.820
 like mine you can do that 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.820
 do 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.600
 you also like to never have one 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:52.110
 a few strands on it makes the whole thing 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.560
 still a bit messy 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.540
 here 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.699
 because udo rolled said yes, the 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.620
 Do not look like the barber until the 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.830
 Okay china then you have us here so 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.020
 A small brush and her hairstyle is 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.400
 as far as finished as always I would 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.919
 me, of course, very much about a rating 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.389
 of you are positive or negative 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.220
 And comments are the best anyway 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.020
 So just clean everything neatly 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.889
 even those who are not 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.600
 always report 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.850
 please write to me and tell me 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.889
 I also like to like that when I find it 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.539
 show how you are doing this and 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.310
 at the same time the speech or if you the 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.630
 would rather have separately so as well 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.010
 made it in my other tutorials 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.380
 I would like to have that from you 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.690
 know and otherwise comes here now 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.539
 my last video that was a 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.250
 elaborate magnolia girls and 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.260
 I subscribe if it's still forgotten 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.350
 did not do and we next 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.350
 times 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:47.439
