of octopus sequencer I've set the rate
to<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.180> eight<00:01:06.390> notes<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.110> I've<00:01:07.770> said<00:01:08.070> set<00:01:08.520> the

length to be eight if you change this

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.109 
length to be eight if you change this
you'll<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.439> purple<00:01:10.890> bar<00:01:11.100> moving<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:12.030> and

you'll see this purple bar moving up and
down<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.439> I've<00:01:14.100> programmed<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:16.070> debt<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> debt

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
down so I've programmed in debt the debt

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.249 
down so I've programmed in debt the debt
the<00:01:18.000> dirt<00:01:18.240> 1<00:01:18.570> &amp;<00:01:18.600> 2<00:01:18.840> 3<00:01:19.290> &amp;<00:01:19.380> 4<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.020> played

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the dirt 1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4 and this is played

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.740 
the dirt 1 &amp; 2 3 &amp; 4 and this is played
on<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.439> hi-hat<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.180> also<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
on the hi-hat and this is also the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.170 
on the hi-hat and this is also the
hi-hat<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.860> little<00:01:26.730> lower<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.150> volume

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
hi-hat but just a little lower in volume

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.450 
hi-hat but just a little lower in volume
so<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.900> play<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.190> going<00:01:29.190> to<00:01:29.250> mute<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
so if I play this going to mute the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.360 
so if I play this going to mute the
other<00:01:29.730> sequences<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> minute<00:01:31.040> if<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.160> play

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
other sequences for a minute if I play

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.580 
other sequences for a minute if I play
this<00:01:32.570> straight-8<00:01:33.570> notes<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.260> sounds<00:01:34.530> like

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this straight-8 notes it sounds like

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.320 
this straight-8 notes it sounds like
this<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:37.310> then<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.430> going<00:01:38.580> to<00:01:38.640> add<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.850> swing

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
this and then I'm going to add a swing

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.760 
this and then I'm going to add a swing
to<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.810> choose<00:01:40.230> triplet<00:01:40.710> swing<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> I

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
to it and choose triplet swing so I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.130 
to it and choose triplet swing so I
think<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.220> pretty<00:01:44.400> much<00:01:44.659> what's<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:46.020> on

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
think that's pretty much what's going on

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.399 
think that's pretty much what's going on
with<00:01:46.500> his<00:01:47.040> right<00:01:47.400> hand<00:01:47.960> the<00:01:48.960> other<00:01:49.080> bit<00:01:49.260> that

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
with his right hand the other bit that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.110 
with his right hand the other bit that
really<00:01:49.620> stands<00:01:50.040> out<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.370> this<00:01:50.400> is<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
really stands out in this is the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.469 
really stands out in this is the
tambourine<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:51.990> snare

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.200 

let<00:01:56.479> that<00:01:56.720> deck<00:01:56.990> cam<00:01:57.259> one<00:01:57.920> dude<00:01:58.189> before<00:01:58.460> and

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
let that deck cam one dude before and

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.950 
let that deck cam one dude before and
wonderful<00:01:59.930> do<00:02:00.200> we<00:02:00.920> could<00:02:01.220> put<00:02:01.460> 4<00:02:01.759> 1<00:02:02.390> triplet<00:02:02.720> 2

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
wonderful do we could put 4 1 triplet 2

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.820 
wonderful do we could put 4 1 triplet 2
3<00:02:03.920> 15<00:02:04.430> foot<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.600> that's<00:02:05.750> not<00:02:05.990> really<00:02:06.380> swung<00:02:06.680> at

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
3 15 foot and that's not really swung at

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.850 
3 15 foot and that's not really swung at
all<00:02:07.040> so<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.549> have<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:08.179> programmed<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.860> I've

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
all so I have this programmed in I've

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.180 
all so I have this programmed in I've
said<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.340> rate<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.700> six<00:02:12.370> which<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.400> basically

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
said a rate of six which is basically

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.440 
said a rate of six which is basically
triplets<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:18.040> I've<00:02:19.040> got<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.430> length<00:02:19.850> of<00:02:20.000> six<00:02:20.270> in

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
triplets and I've got a length of six in

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.910 
triplets and I've got a length of six in
here<00:02:20.690> we've<00:02:20.840> got<00:02:21.459> 123456<00:02:22.989> 123456<00:02:23.989> that<00:02:24.650> sounds

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
here we've got 123456 123456 that sounds

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.620 
here we've got 123456 123456 that sounds
like<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.880> that's<00:02:29.120> basically<00:02:29.300> a

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
like this so that's basically a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.920 
like this so that's basically a

and<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.450> drummer<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:37.040> those<00:02:37.340> two<00:02:37.550> bits

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
and that drummer so those two bits

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.880 
and that drummer so those two bits
together<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:41.209> hi-hat<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.840> playing<00:02:42.650> in

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
together and that hi-hat is playing in

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.140 
together and that hi-hat is playing in
time<00:02:43.190> with<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.459> triplets<00:02:43.670> because<00:02:44.000> we're

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
time with the triplets because we're

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.420 
time with the triplets because we're
swinging<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.720> as<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.840> triplet<00:02:45.319> ray<00:02:45.530> now<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.190> can

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
swinging it as a triplet ray now you can

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.660 
swinging it as a triplet ray now you can
play<00:02:46.700> around<00:02:46.850> with<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.510> swing<00:02:47.870> of<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.739> hi-hat

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.460 

maybe<00:02:52.670> make<00:02:52.910> it<00:02:53.060> not<00:02:53.239> quite<00:02:53.660> as<00:02:53.870> triplet<00:02:54.319> II

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
maybe make it not quite as triplet II

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.289 
maybe make it not quite as triplet II
you<00:02:55.010> could<00:02:55.190> have<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.720> sixteenth<00:02:56.720> note<00:02:56.959> shuffle

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
you could have a sixteenth note shuffle

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.000 
you could have a sixteenth note shuffle
but<00:02:59.299> that<00:02:59.510> doesn't<00:03:00.140> sound<00:03:00.380> right<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.620> me<00:03:00.799> so

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
but that doesn't sound right to me so

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.229 
but that doesn't sound right to me so
I'm<00:03:01.070> going<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.310> back<00:03:01.459> back<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.090> regular

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
I'm going to back back to the regular

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.199 
I'm going to back back to the regular
triplet<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.280> then<00:03:04.280> we've<00:03:04.489> got<00:03:04.519> the<00:03:04.760> bass<00:03:05.000> drum

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
triplet and then we've got the bass drum

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.670 
triplet and then we've got the bass drum
that<00:03:05.420> if<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.600> listen<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.049> beginning<00:03:06.590> of

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
that if you listen to the beginning of

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:14.530 
that if you listen to the beginning of
this<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.320> starts<00:03:12.470> off<00:03:12.709> doing<00:03:13.420> good<00:03:14.420> doing

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
this so it starts off doing good doing

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.310 
this so it starts off doing good doing
good<00:03:15.100> n<00:03:16.100> which<00:03:16.370> i'm<00:03:16.579> gonna<00:03:17.109> i'm<00:03:18.109> going<00:03:18.260> to

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
good n which i'm gonna i'm going to

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.580 
good n which i'm gonna i'm going to
think<00:03:18.470> that's<00:03:18.650> like<00:03:18.799> a<00:03:18.829> sixteenth<00:03:19.400> note<00:03:19.760> and

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
think that's like a sixteenth note and

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.170 
think that's like a sixteenth note and
bass<00:03:21.590> drum<00:03:21.799> part<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.190> again<00:03:22.519> I've<00:03:22.670> got<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:22.880> rate

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
bass drum part so again I've got a rate

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.120 
bass drum part so again I've got a rate
of<00:03:23.209> eighth<00:03:23.600> notes<00:03:23.630> on<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.290> bottom<00:03:24.470> sequencer

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
of eighth notes on this bottom sequencer

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.000 
of eighth notes on this bottom sequencer
and<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:26.630> reason<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:26.989> put<00:03:27.200> eight<00:03:27.350> notes<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:27.890> not

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
and the reason I put eight notes and not

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.650 
and the reason I put eight notes and not
sixteenth<00:03:28.489> notes<00:03:28.730> is<00:03:28.940> that's<00:03:29.180> going<00:03:29.329> to<00:03:29.420> let

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
sixteenth notes is that's going to let

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.039 
sixteenth notes is that's going to let
us<00:03:29.840> move<00:03:30.140> this<00:03:30.470> last<00:03:30.769> note<00:03:31.070> depending<00:03:31.820> on<00:03:32.049> the

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
us move this last note depending on the

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.990 
us move this last note depending on the
degree<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.500> swing<00:03:33.859> that<00:03:34.040> we<00:03:34.100> apply<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:34.670> if<00:03:34.850> I

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
degree of swing that we apply so if I

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.340 
degree of swing that we apply so if I
just<00:03:35.180> play<00:03:35.420> this<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.660> that's<00:03:38.840> playing<00:03:39.079> it<00:03:39.230> as

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
just play this so that's playing it as

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.550 
just play this so that's playing it as
eighth<00:03:39.590> notes<00:03:40.209> wanna<00:03:41.209> Jana<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.900> Rihanna<00:03:42.290> if<00:03:42.410> I

I can swing this a sixteenth notes one
iana<00:03:53.329> Tyrion<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:53.810> three<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.170> boy<00:03:54.319> and<00:03:54.470> i<00:03:54.500> won

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
iana Tyrion of three and a boy and i won

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.900 
iana Tyrion of three and a boy and i won
if<00:03:55.489> I<00:03:55.670> did<00:03:55.790> it<00:03:55.880> as<00:03:55.970> pip<00:03:56.180> 'let's<00:03:57.519> we'd<00:03:58.519> have<00:03:58.670> that

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
if I did it as pip 'let's we'd have that

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.970 
if I did it as pip 'let's we'd have that
so<00:03:59.180> I'm<00:03:59.810> going<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.049> put<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.230> in<00:04:00.470> sixteenth

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
so I'm going to put that in sixteenth

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.599 
so I'm going to put that in sixteenth
notes<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:02.199> I<00:04:03.199> think<00:04:03.470> that's<00:04:03.650> how<00:04:03.829> this<00:04:04.100> patent

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
notes and I think that's how this patent

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.920 
notes and I think that's how this patent
starts

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.960 

something<00:04:08.930> along<00:04:09.050> those<00:04:09.320> lines<00:04:11.860> so<00:04:12.860> we<00:04:13.250> listen

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
something along those lines so we listen

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:23.140 
something along those lines so we listen
again<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:20.390> then<00:04:20.570> we<00:04:20.660> get<00:04:20.810> good<00:04:21.140> good<00:04:22.150> good

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
again and then we get good good good

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.260 
again and then we get good good good
good<00:04:23.660> you're<00:04:24.620> doing<00:04:24.680> good<00:04:25.010> so<00:04:25.790> that<00:04:25.970> good

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
good you're doing good so that good

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.180 
good you're doing good so that good
don't<00:04:26.450> go<00:04:26.720> would<00:04:26.930> be<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.380> dent<00:04:27.830> death

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
don't go would be the dent death

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.860 
don't go would be the dent death
probably<00:04:28.610> there<00:04:30.910> so<00:04:31.910> when<00:04:32.060> we<00:04:32.150> mute<00:04:32.390> these<00:04:32.600> top

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
probably there so when we mute these top

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:41.050 
probably there so when we mute these top
two<00:04:32.900> parts<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.900> we<00:04:36.080> put<00:04:36.290> in<00:04:39.400> so<00:04:40.400> that<00:04:40.430> is<00:04:40.820> what

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
two parts and we put in so that is what

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.340 
two parts and we put in so that is what
I<00:04:41.090> think<00:04:41.360> is<00:04:41.419> going<00:04:41.630> on<00:04:41.690> with<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.960> bass<00:04:42.140> drum

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
I think is going on with the bass drum

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.350 
I think is going on with the bass drum
and<00:04:42.620> then<00:04:43.460> it<00:04:43.580> gets<00:04:43.669> a<00:04:43.820> little<00:04:44.000> bit<00:04:44.210> more

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
and then it gets a little bit more

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.950 
and then it gets a little bit more
interesting<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:49.330> what<00:04:50.330> I<00:04:50.360> think<00:04:50.660> happens

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
interesting and what I think happens

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.170 
interesting and what I think happens
there<00:04:51.230> is<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.470> we<00:04:52.190> miss<00:04:52.490> out<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:52.880> bass<00:04:53.030> drum

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
there is that we miss out the bass drum

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.300 
there is that we miss out the bass drum
on<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:53.360> one<00:04:53.630> and<00:04:53.900> i<00:04:53.930> think<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:54.680> bass<00:04:55.010> drum

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
on the one and i think this bass drum

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:04.180 
on the one and i think this bass drum
goes<00:04:55.640> there<00:05:02.260> so<00:05:03.260> if<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.440> again<00:05:03.650> if<00:05:03.740> i<00:05:03.830> put<00:05:04.040> these

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
goes there so if it again if i put these

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:11.110 
goes there so if it again if i put these
shuffled<00:05:04.610> hi<00:05:04.790> hats<00:05:05.060> in<00:05:09.160> so<00:05:10.160> this<00:05:10.700> should<00:05:11.090> be

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
shuffled hi hats in so this should be

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.270 
shuffled hi hats in so this should be
swung<00:05:11.630> high<00:05:11.870> hat<00:05:12.050> this<00:05:12.200> on<00:05:12.410> the<00:05:12.530> offbeat<00:05:12.890> 16th

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
swung high hat this on the offbeat 16th

clashes<00:05:29.780> a<00:05:29.810> little<00:05:30.169> bit<00:05:30.320> with<00:05:30.470> this<00:05:30.620> swung

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
clashes a little bit with this swung

clashes a little bit with this swung
triplet<00:05:31.520> high<00:05:31.669> hat<00:05:34.750> so<00:05:35.750> it's<00:05:35.900> not<00:05:36.020> quite<00:05:36.410> in

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
triplet high hat so it's not quite in

triplet high hat so it's not quite in
time<00:05:36.860> with<00:05:37.070> that<00:05:37.100> if<00:05:37.370> I<00:05:37.490> made<00:05:37.700> this<00:05:37.850> 16th<00:05:39.460> then

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
time with that if I made this 16th then

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.460 
time with that if I made this 16th then
it<00:05:40.610> lines<00:05:40.820> up<00:05:40.970> perfectly<00:05:41.510> so<00:05:42.140> that's<00:05:42.380> the

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
it lines up perfectly so that's the

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.530 
it lines up perfectly so that's the
tricky<00:05:42.919> bit<00:05:43.070> is<00:05:43.130> having<00:05:43.700> a<00:05:43.790> kind<00:05:43.940> of<00:05:44.060> triplet

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
tricky bit is having a kind of triplet

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.870 
tricky bit is having a kind of triplet
feel<00:05:44.810> swing<00:05:45.680> on<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.950> hi-hat<00:05:46.130> part<00:05:46.580> and<00:05:46.790> a

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
feel swing on the hi-hat part and a

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.690 
feel swing on the hi-hat part and a
sixteenth<00:05:47.500> swing<00:05:48.500> feel<00:05:48.800> on<00:05:49.070> the<00:05:49.310> bass<00:05:49.550> drum

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
sixteenth swing feel on the bass drum

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:58.719 
sixteenth swing feel on the bass drum
part<00:05:52.510> so<00:05:53.510> we<00:05:53.630> put<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:53.960> tambourine<00:05:54.260> snare<00:05:57.729> and

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
part so we put the tambourine snare and

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.610 
part so we put the tambourine snare and
then<00:05:59.030> you<00:05:59.120> can<00:05:59.270> play<00:05:59.510> around<00:05:59.660> with<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.229> degree

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
then you can play around with the degree

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:08.680 
then you can play around with the degree
of<00:06:00.650> swing<00:06:01.070> of<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.580> hi-hat<00:06:01.970> part<00:06:02.210> here<00:06:07.479> to<00:06:08.479> make

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
of swing of the hi-hat part here to make

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.540 
of swing of the hi-hat part here to make
it<00:06:08.870> however<00:06:09.200> you<00:06:09.590> want<00:06:09.710> and<00:06:09.919> this<00:06:10.070> could<00:06:10.250> even

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
it however you want and this could even

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:19.300 
it however you want and this could even
be<00:06:10.900> more<00:06:11.900> than<00:06:12.229> sixteenth<00:06:12.680> notes

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.500 

so<00:06:20.310> you<00:06:20.370> can<00:06:20.639> you<00:06:20.850> know<00:06:20.970> just<00:06:21.210> play<00:06:21.389> around

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
so you can you know just play around

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.100 
so you can you know just play around
with<00:06:21.750> different<00:06:21.780> settings<00:06:23.660> let's<00:06:24.660> try<00:06:24.930> that<00:06:25.050> a

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
with different settings let's try that a

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.830 
with different settings let's try that a
straight<00:06:25.470> triplets<00:06:29.540> so<00:06:30.540> I<00:06:30.570> don't<00:06:30.780> know

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
straight triplets so I don't know

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.650 
straight triplets so I don't know
exactly<00:06:31.200> what<00:06:31.380> it<00:06:31.500> is<00:06:31.530> kind<00:06:31.889> of<00:06:31.980> hard<00:06:32.040> to<00:06:32.280> tell

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
exactly what it is kind of hard to tell

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.000 
exactly what it is kind of hard to tell
and<00:06:33.660> the<00:06:33.930> rest<00:06:34.110> of<00:06:34.230> the<00:06:34.350> instruments<00:06:34.770> make<00:06:34.980> a

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
and the rest of the instruments make a

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.010 
and the rest of the instruments make a
difference<00:06:35.490> to<00:06:35.550> have<00:06:35.760> the<00:06:35.910> groove<00:06:36.120> feels<00:06:36.480> but

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
difference to have the groove feels but

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.230 
difference to have the groove feels but
this<00:06:37.169> just<00:06:37.320> just<00:06:37.590> an<00:06:37.800> example<00:06:38.040> of<00:06:38.520> using

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
this just just an example of using

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.730 
this just just an example of using
octopus<00:06:39.750> sequencer<00:06:40.139> to<00:06:40.260> play<00:06:40.470> about<00:06:40.680> with

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
octopus sequencer to play about with

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:57.430 
octopus sequencer to play about with
swing<00:06:41.460> values

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440
