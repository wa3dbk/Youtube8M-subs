00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
as a server which I very much doubt it

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.030 
as a server which I very much doubt it
when<00:03:29.919> you're<00:03:30.129> using<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.639> in<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.879> vmware<00:03:31.389> player

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
when you're using it in a vmware player

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.659 
when you're using it in a vmware player
so<00:03:33.040> I'm<00:03:33.129> going<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.340> download<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.879> now<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:36.519> have

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
so I'm going to download it now you have

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.300 
so I'm going to download it now you have
to<00:03:36.849> download<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.359> by<00:03:37.480> BitTorrent<00:03:38.169> so<00:03:38.949> it<00:03:39.190> will

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
to download it by BitTorrent so it will

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.009 
to download it by BitTorrent so it will
take<00:03:39.519> a<00:03:39.549> while<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:39.909> it<00:03:39.970> does<00:03:40.120> upload<00:03:40.569> but<00:03:40.900> it

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
take a while and it does upload but it

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.159 
take a while and it does upload but it
stops<00:03:41.290> when<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.530> close<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:42.129> client<00:03:42.609> or

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
stops when you close the client or

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.240 
stops when you close the client or
browse<00:03:44.169> on<00:03:44.379> that<00:03:44.470> you're<00:03:44.590> using<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:45.069> download

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
browse on that you're using to download

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.250 
browse on that you're using to download
it<00:03:45.639> by<00:03:45.729> BitTorrent<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.329> have<00:03:46.449> to<00:03:46.569> open<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:47.109> if

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
it by BitTorrent you have to open it if

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.530 
it by BitTorrent you have to open it if
you<00:03:47.470> save<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:48.069> then<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.609> doesn't<00:03:48.790> only<00:03:49.090> save<00:03:49.419> to

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
you save it then it doesn't only save to

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.839 
you save it then it doesn't only save to
the<00:03:49.599> torrent<00:03:50.019> file<00:03:50.229> not<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.620> actual<00:03:51.010> file<00:03:51.340> the

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
the torrent file not the actual file the

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.780 
the torrent file not the actual file the
file<00:03:52.090> is<00:03:52.239> about<00:03:52.449> 1.1<00:03:53.169> gigabytes<00:03:53.709> so<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.639> will

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
file is about 1.1 gigabytes so it will

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.219 
file is about 1.1 gigabytes so it will
take<00:03:54.849> a<00:03:55.000> while<00:03:55.209> to<00:03:55.359> download<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.870> can<00:03:55.930> see

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
take a while to download you can see

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.640 
take a while to download you can see
minus<00:03:56.709> 40<00:03:57.099> minutes<00:03:57.129> roughly<00:03:58.109> so<00:03:59.109> i'll<00:03:59.379> be<00:03:59.500> back

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
minus 40 minutes roughly so i'll be back

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.979 
minus 40 minutes roughly so i'll be back
then<00:03:59.949> to<00:04:00.819> carry<00:04:01.030> on<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.299> video<00:04:02.940> slots<00:04:03.989> you

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
then to carry on the video slots you

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.750 
then to carry on the video slots you
might<00:04:05.169> need<00:04:05.319> to<00:04:05.470> extract<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:06.010> file<00:04:06.280> because

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
might need to extract the file because

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.219 
might need to extract the file because
it<00:04:07.269> comes<00:04:07.690> as<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:07.930> dot<00:04:08.470> zip<00:04:08.769> or<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.970> dot<00:04:10.720> royal

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:11.229 
it comes as a dot zip or a dot royal

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.500 
it comes as a dot zip or a dot royal
refuse<00:04:11.650> win<00:04:11.919> draw<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.669> I'm<00:04:12.819> just<00:04:13.000> extracting

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
refuse win draw so I'm just extracting

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.449 
refuse win draw so I'm just extracting
that<00:04:13.690> from<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.199> archive<00:04:14.590> so<00:04:15.129> I'll<00:04:15.250> catch<00:04:15.430> up

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
that from the archive so I'll catch up

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.339 
that from the archive so I'll catch up
