00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
super cheap so I'm definitely looking

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.799

forward to hearing more about this and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.930 
forward to hearing more about this and
if<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.140> really<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.530> true<00:00:52.949> rumor<00:00:53.190> Apple<00:00:53.820> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
if this is really a true rumor Apple is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.029 
if this is really a true rumor Apple is
also<00:00:54.300> said<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.539> working<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> processor

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
also said to be working on a processor

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.400 
also said to be working on a processor
that<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.670> support<00:00:57.210> multiple<00:00:57.449> gsm<00:00:58.050> estate<00:00:58.289> in

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that can support multiple gsm estate in

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
that can support multiple gsm estate in
my<00:00:58.500> network<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.160> theoretically<00:01:00.120> you'll<00:01:00.539> be

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
my network so theoretically you'll be

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.260 
my network so theoretically you'll be
able<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:01.739> t-mobile<00:01:02.340> AT&amp;T<00:01:02.789> or

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
able to know use it on t-mobile AT&amp;T or

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.870 
able to know use it on t-mobile AT&amp;T or
Verizon<00:01:03.300> or<00:01:03.930> harm<00:01:04.229> Stephen<00:01:04.860> Sprint<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
Verizon or harm Stephen Sprint on the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.310 
Verizon or harm Stephen Sprint on the
exact<00:01:06.210> same<00:01:06.450> phone<00:01:06.780> which<00:01:06.990> would<00:01:07.080> be<00:01:07.140> pretty

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
exact same phone which would be pretty

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.219 
exact same phone which would be pretty
cool<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.400> would<00:01:08.580> eliminate<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.090> need<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
cool and would eliminate the need to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.300 
cool and would eliminate the need to
make<00:01:10.409> different<00:01:10.680> phones<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.070> different

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
make different phones for different

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.700 
make different phones for different
carriers<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.880> makes<00:01:12.060> sense<00:01:12.299> right<00:01:12.360> there

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
carriers that makes sense right there

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
carriers that makes sense right there
but<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.890> would<00:01:14.180> destroy<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> SIM<00:01:15.509> card<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
but that would destroy the SIM card and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.380 
but that would destroy the SIM card and
I'm<00:01:16.920> from<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> love<00:01:17.610> how<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> SIM<00:01:18.060> cards<00:01:18.330> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
I'm from one I love how the SIM cards of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.140 
I'm from one I love how the SIM cards of
my<00:01:18.479> devices<00:01:19.220> but<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.520> does<00:01:20.790> become

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
my devices but if this does become

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.580 
my devices but if this does become
mainstream<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.780> actually<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.320> is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
mainstream and actually you know is

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
mainstream and actually you know is
pretty<00:01:22.740> popular<00:01:23.060> then<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.210> could<00:01:24.390> become

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
pretty popular then this could become

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.030 
pretty popular then this could become
pretty<00:01:24.869> cool<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.650> would<00:01:25.740> eliminate

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
pretty cool because it would eliminate

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.850 
pretty cool because it would eliminate
that<00:01:26.369> ugly<00:01:26.700> ETF<00:01:27.150> fee<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.869> early<00:01:28.350> termination

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
that ugly ETF fee or early termination

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.050 
that ugly ETF fee or early termination
fee<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.159> want<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> leave<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.610> carrier

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
fee if you want to leave your carrier

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
makes no sense right well apparently the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.550 
makes no sense right well apparently the
iPad<00:02:11.220> 2<00:02:11.520> will<00:02:12.239> be<00:02:12.360> with<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.629> iPhone<00:02:12.959> 3GS<00:02:13.349> was

iPad 2 will be with the iPhone 3GS was

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.970 
iPad 2 will be with the iPhone 3GS was
to<00:02:13.709> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
to the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.400 
to the
on<00:02:14.069> 3G<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> small<00:02:15.989> incremental

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
on 3G that is a small incremental

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.650 
on 3G that is a small incremental
upgrade<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.580> original<00:02:17.910> iPad<00:02:18.060> not<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.420> full

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
overhaul not a full redesign of it so it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.140 
overhaul not a full redesign of it so it
will<00:02:22.050> definitely<00:02:22.200> have<00:02:22.530> better<00:02:22.650> hardware<00:02:23.190> but

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
will definitely have better hardware but

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.790 
will definitely have better hardware but
as<00:02:24.269> far<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.660> overall<00:02:24.780> design<00:02:24.989> of<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:25.620> and

as far as the overall design of it and

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.309 
as far as the overall design of it and
the<00:02:26.010> overall<00:02:26.250> performance<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:27.450> won't<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.959> you

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
the overall performance it won't be you

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.630 
the overall performance it won't be you
know<00:02:28.440> exponentially<00:02:29.069> better<00:02:29.310> than<00:02:29.550> the

original iPad and the latest rumors also

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.280 
original iPad and the latest rumors also
have<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.099> iPad<00:02:32.489> 2<00:02:32.790> will<00:02:33.660> have<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> exact

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
have that the iPad 2 will have the exact

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
same resolution as original iPad which

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.259 
same resolution as original iPad which
is<00:02:36.840> 1024<00:02:37.380> by<00:02:37.500> 768<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.519> makes<00:02:38.760> absolutely

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
is 1024 by 768 so that makes absolutely

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.030 
is 1024 by 768 so that makes absolutely
perfect<00:02:39.630> sense<00:02:39.810> right<00:02:39.870> there<00:02:40.200> but<00:02:40.650> why<00:02:40.830> so

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
perfect sense right there but why so

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.620 
perfect sense right there but why so
soon<00:02:41.190> for<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.430> iPad<00:02:41.760> 3<00:02:42.030> right<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.299> mean<00:02:42.510> the
