00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:37.469 
ahead and just start putting this into

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.030 
ahead and just start putting this into
the<00:03:37.799> cupcake<00:03:38.040> liners<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:40.560> I'm<00:03:40.709> going<00:03:40.889> to<00:03:40.950> be

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040
