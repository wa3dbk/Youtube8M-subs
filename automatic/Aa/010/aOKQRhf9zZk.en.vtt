 Kind and now 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.539
 this little friend next to me 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.449
 In principle, there is no small in Jena aesthetic for the guitarist too 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.480
 home 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.699

 work its the whole Bregenz in itself sands active monitor one can with 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.340
 Just play it on his guitar or with his bass 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.470
 and they choose different patterns that are just fun 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.390
 the beautiful is that he is in contrast 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.499
 to the predecessor 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:49.059
 From this Jung material is used that has the great advantage that you too 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.190
 own songs can invite him into the device 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.060
 these 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.370
 then even in 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.820
 del tempo and change in tone height 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.770
 you can continue this 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.490
 mp3 is the one at home even from whom the Center SIG nal speak free 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.260
 by voice or by the guitar solo and then on my account 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.510
 if it fades to play a rich sound 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.050
 all this and many more features, the small unimpressive device offers something 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.540
 Ariel in Peine of her viewing is really amazingly versatile 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.930
 for the guitar fence itself that stood in Boston i10 godfather that means that 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.090
 if you plug yourself in here with the guitar you actually have one 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.000
 incredible variety and a very good quality of real estate and 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.930
 Has effects available 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.520
 this kaman 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.850
 on top of that, too, to the enclosed or 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.740

 Percent hardcore mp3 is recording 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.780
 that's me there you stood 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.250
 The sounds in BoÃŸeln Szene are divided into different categories 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.020

 Consumption drive are 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.379
 in Porz the bands 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.900
 and I have to say because of the incredible field possibilities in 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.900
 its report, of course, hard to consider everything sufficiently 

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.419
 what to look for 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.060

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.990

 together with the possibilities of the wm team the boss also offers 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.759
 I would say that for the money the 385 euros approximately if I have one
