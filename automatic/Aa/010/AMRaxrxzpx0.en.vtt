00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
today I'm going to show you how to use

the<00:00:11.820> h2d<00:00:12.509> straightening<00:00:12.990> iron<00:00:13.549> at<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.610> moment

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
the h2d straightening iron at the moment

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.630 
the h2d straightening iron at the moment
a<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.690> prepare<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.289> hair<00:00:16.580> with<00:00:17.580> a

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
a is just to prepare the hair with a

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.779 
a is just to prepare the hair with a
little<00:00:17.850> bit<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.029> heat<00:00:18.240> protection<00:00:18.570> spray

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
little bit of heat protection spray

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.599 
little bit of heat protection spray
although<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.359> h2<00:00:21.900> di<00:00:22.100> it's<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:23.310> really

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
although of the h2 di it's not really

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.849 
although of the h2 di it's not really
necessary<00:00:24.090> as<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.960> ions<00:00:25.289> are<00:00:25.470> very<00:00:25.650> low

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
necessary as the ions are very low

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.200 
necessary as the ions are very low
temperature<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:27.080> also<00:00:28.080> they<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:29.210> genomic

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
temperature and also they are genomic

and swollen coded which therefore leaves

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.130
