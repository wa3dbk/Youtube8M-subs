00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.530
 today we will try to catch it 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.910
 manure decided to wear a worm on releases 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:17.670
 The problem in what if our our nozzle in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.660
 this case, the worms will fall on the very bottom 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.710
 lots of white fish 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 same card can quickly possess 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 so you need to lift the nozzle 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.029
 when using the usual underwater 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.030
 the float how we use it on the rivers 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.800
 the bait fish is the danger that 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:41.090
 the current is not there is a leash pops up 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.559
 falls and everything gets confused therefore 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.320
 designed such a small rig 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.190
 that is, these are two little ones completely 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.000
 underwater on the shelves and between them and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.640
 between the crochet swim we have such 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.260
 flexible hoses kid that is what 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.329
 It turns out here we have such a sinker 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.670
 it's all aligned to that line 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.369
 about worms ok here dangle and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.240
 It can not in any way here is very confused 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.280
 does not interfere at all 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.250
 leash I will do in this case and gave 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.940
 not very long since here is fine 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:26.770
 there is literally a stop centimeters 50 our 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:36.580
 worms dangled and attracted such 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:38.380
 simple but efficiency we plant worms i 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.280
 I do here just that is, everyone 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.659
 release pass is like a ring is about 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.039
 because once so that it moves well 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.039
 we hook the hook to the maximum 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:19.310
 Here we have such a good bunch 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:24.220
 sturdy releases and the whole thing I 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.319
 I fix themes with Ruslanchik of cut 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:37.930
 so that the worms are not tied up like this 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:42.250
 begin they just pierces the sting all 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.250
 This is our March 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.050
 like that, she moves beautifully with us and 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.250
 so will about all it looks at 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.120
 water with no sleep will not stand such 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.120
 tidbit
