00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.170 

so<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> standard<00:00:19.020> hydraboost<00:00:19.410> fitting<00:00:19.740> is

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
so the standard hydraboost fitting is

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:28.640 
so the standard hydraboost fitting is
the<00:00:21.180> return

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.280 

so<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> standard<00:00:29.760> height<00:00:29.940> hoe<00:00:30.600> set<00:00:30.960> comes

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
so the standard height hoe set comes

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.390 
so the standard height hoe set comes
with<00:00:31.410> two<00:00:31.500> mando<00:00:32.100> fittings<00:00:32.900> and<00:00:33.900> the<00:00:34.400> rubber

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
with two mando fittings and the rubber

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
with two mando fittings and the rubber
return<00:00:35.790> hoses<00:00:36.240> okay<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.640> those<00:00:44.820> who<00:00:45.150> want

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
return hoses okay so for those who want

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
return hoses okay so for those who want
a<00:00:45.660> full<00:00:45.960> massing<00:00:46.650> hose<00:00:49.160> we<00:00:50.160> designed<00:00:50.580> our<00:00:50.760> own

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
a full massing hose we designed our own

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:00.640 
a full massing hose we designed our own
fitting<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:52.050> replace<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.650> hose<00:00:52.800> barb

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:08.820 

a<00:01:00.680> lot<00:01:01.280> of<00:01:01.370> times<00:01:01.610> people<00:01:02.510> are<00:01:02.750> freezing<00:01:03.350> that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.980 

is<00:01:09.830> why<00:01:10.060> we<00:01:11.060> spent<00:01:11.330> a<00:01:11.390> lot<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:12.050> time<00:01:12.380> come<00:01:12.970> back

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
is why we spent a lot of time come back

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.420 
is why we spent a lot of time come back
because<00:01:14.990> we<00:01:15.080> were<00:01:15.350> taking<00:01:15.740> those<00:01:15.890> hoses<00:01:16.190> and

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
because we were taking those hoses and

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.220 
because we were taking those hoses and
cutting<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.760> ends<00:01:17.000> of<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.390> re<00:01:17.540> doing<00:01:17.750> three

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
cutting the ends of and re doing three

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.740 
cutting the ends of and re doing three
on<00:01:18.410> there<00:01:18.680> for<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.920> while<00:01:19.120> we<00:01:20.120> first<00:01:20.390> started

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
on there for a while we first started

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.870 
on there for a while we first started
doing<00:01:20.870> that<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:21.410> our<00:01:22.040> first<00:01:22.250> house<00:01:22.550> we're

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
doing that so our first house we're

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.610 
doing that so our first house we're
gonna<00:01:23.030> install<00:01:23.300> comes<00:01:24.050> from<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.410> pressure

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
gonna install comes from the pressure

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.670 
gonna install comes from the pressure
port<00:01:25.010> of<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.340> power<00:01:25.490> steering<00:01:25.730> pump<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:27.560> the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
port of the power steering pump to the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.250 
port of the power steering pump to the
inlet<00:01:28.100> side<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.550> hydraboost<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:30.020> inlet

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
inlet side of the hydraboost the inlet

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.990 
inlet side of the hydraboost the inlet
side<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.710> always<00:01:30.890> on<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.250> accumulator<00:01:31.700> side

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
side is always on the accumulator side

00:01:32.000 --> 00:02:06.760 
side is always on the accumulator side
or<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.450> or<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.780> larger<00:01:33.140> port

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.590 

okay<00:02:07.770> our<00:02:07.920> second<00:02:08.429> pressure<00:02:08.610> line<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
okay our second pressure line is the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.440 
okay our second pressure line is the
outlet<00:02:10.050> from<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> hydraboost<00:02:11.450> that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
outlet from the hydraboost that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.240 
outlet from the hydraboost that
continues<00:02:12.960> down<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.140> feed<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.530> pressure<00:02:13.770> into

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
continues down to feed the pressure into

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.340 
continues down to feed the pressure into
the<00:02:14.280> steering<00:02:14.670> box<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.870> we're<00:02:15.960> going<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.140> mark

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
the steering box so we're going to mark

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.490 
the steering box so we're going to mark
that<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.890> cut<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.700> then<00:02:18.120> we'll<00:02:18.500> install

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
that and cut it and then we'll install

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:37.580 
that and cut it and then we'll install
it<00:02:34.459> second<00:02:35.459> way<00:02:35.610> besides<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.840> hacksaw<00:02:37.320> is<00:02:37.380> to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
it second way besides a hacksaw is to

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.840 
it second way besides a hacksaw is to
use<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.830> air<00:02:37.950> cutoff<00:02:38.310> wheel<00:02:38.489> which<00:02:38.700> just

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
use the air cutoff wheel which just

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:50.080 
use the air cutoff wheel which just
leaves<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.209> nice<00:02:39.360> clean<00:02:40.640> straight<00:02:41.640> cut

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.340 

we're<00:02:51.090> going<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.270> separate<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.810> stainless

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
we're going to separate the stainless

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.350 
we're going to separate the stainless
from<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.739> Teflon<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.459> we<00:02:53.520> can<00:02:53.670> push<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.030> olive

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
from the Teflon so we can push the olive

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:19.910 
from the Teflon so we can push the olive
over<00:02:54.570> over<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.020> end<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> Teflon<00:02:56.010> only

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.080 

once<00:03:20.920> you've<00:03:21.010> got<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.250> all<00:03:21.310> they<00:03:21.580> pushed<00:03:21.910> on

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
once you've got that all they pushed on

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.590 
once you've got that all they pushed on
flush<00:03:22.960> to<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.410> end<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.710> the<00:03:23.770> tubing<00:03:24.330> it's<00:03:25.330> best

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
flush to the end of the tubing it's best

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.300 
flush to the end of the tubing it's best
to<00:03:25.720> put<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.930> round<00:03:26.380> punch<00:03:26.740> in<00:03:26.920> there<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.190> make

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
to put a round punch in there and make

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.230 
to put a round punch in there and make
sure<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.640> Teflon<00:03:28.380> is<00:03:29.380> round<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.310> pressed

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
sure the Teflon is round and pressed

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.200 
sure the Teflon is round and pressed
against<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.810> olive<00:03:32.400> before<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.490> before<00:03:34.120> you

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
against the olive before you before you

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:59.470 
against the olive before you before you
push<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.630> your<00:03:34.810> fitting

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.610
