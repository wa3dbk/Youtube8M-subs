maybe about an inch and a half bigger
I'm<00:00:35.280> not<00:00:35.550> sure<00:00:39.079> the<00:00:40.079> thing<00:00:40.559> about<00:00:40.739> this

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I'm not sure the thing about this

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.360 
I'm not sure the thing about this
scooter<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:42.590> basically<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.829> deck<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
scooter is basically the deck in the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
scooter is basically the deck in the
back<00:00:44.579> wheel<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.690> back<00:00:45.899> wheel<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.230> small<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
back wheel the back wheel is small and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.939 
back wheel the back wheel is small and
it<00:00:46.980> turns<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:49.460> see<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:53.930> swivels

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
it turns like this see this it swivels

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.430 
it turns like this see this it swivels
just<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.469> deck<00:00:59.149> is<00:01:00.440> probably

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
just like that and the deck is probably

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:12.830 
just like that and the deck is probably
the<00:01:04.970> deck<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:10.740> bend<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.189> deck<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:12.750> you

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the deck you bend the deck and when you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:28.910 
the deck you bend the deck and when you
bend<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> deck<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.619> makes<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> back<00:01:14.280> wheel<00:01:27.920> so

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
bend the deck it makes the back wheel so

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.400 
bend the deck it makes the back wheel so
let's<00:01:29.909> take<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> first<00:01:30.329> favor

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.010 

now<00:01:35.410> this<00:01:35.650> scooter<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:37.210> takes<00:01:37.690> some<00:01:38.170> time<00:01:38.200> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
now this scooter it takes some time to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.430 
now this scooter it takes some time to
learn<00:01:41.220> how<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.420> start<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.480> drift<00:01:43.840> like<00:01:44.140> if<00:01:44.350> you

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
learn how to start to drift like if you

00:01:44.440 --> 00:02:01.230 
learn how to start to drift like if you
used<00:01:44.620> to<00:01:44.740> turn<00:01:44.830> normally<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.600> really<00:02:00.240> that

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
used to turn normally so I really that

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.580 
used to turn normally so I really that
just<00:02:01.480> comes<00:02:01.690> naturally

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
just comes naturally

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.230 
just comes naturally
so<00:02:03.220> when<00:02:03.400> I<00:02:03.430> just<00:02:03.550> started<00:02:04.030> through<00:02:04.210> the

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
so when I just started through the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.790 
so when I just started through the
handlebars<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.800> back<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:08.500> if<00:02:08.740> I<00:02:08.950> do<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.490> back

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
handlebars the back but if I do the back

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:22.140 
handlebars the back but if I do the back
and<00:02:11.800> I<00:02:12.010> think<00:02:17.010> now<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.920> way<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.070> ride<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
and I think now I the way I ride the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.390 
and I think now I the way I ride the
scooter<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.690> don't<00:02:23.440> actually<00:02:23.620> use<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.220> like<00:02:24.370> a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400
