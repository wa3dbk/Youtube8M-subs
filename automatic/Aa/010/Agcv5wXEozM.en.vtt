00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.189

 at each exhibition a museum 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.619
 you should first ask three 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.790
 answer the question why this 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.640
 exhibition why this topic the question 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.320
 at which place the question of where in 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.680
 which house will find this exhibition 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.960
 instead of 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.870
 and the question when at what time 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.750
 We have ordered these questions here 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.490
 and our audience has a right to it 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.480
 to know how we ask these 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.070
 have answered 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.920
 camille corots an artist of 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.870
 on the one hand a firmly established name in 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.450
 the art story depicts 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.500
 artist of the nineteenth century 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.329
 a great french painter of the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.000
 internationally was very well collected 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.280
 and the one with exquisite exhibitions 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.890
 just in the last 15 years in 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.560
 Europe and was honored in the usa 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.659
 but this artist is a known one 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.880
 unknown the german bunds 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.920
 art audience had so far very little 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.460
 opportunity came to ikoro in the original 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.560
 see 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.390
 That is partly because of the few 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.250
 houses have collected this artist 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.900
 on the other hand, that the big ones 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.690
 exhibitions all in German 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.420
 audiences have passed 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.330
 Camille Corots is an artist for 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.970
 many artists have joined him 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.580
 have trained him for himself and discovered 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.880
 appropriated for him and the special one 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.470
 coro is that he was an artist 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.540
 between the times he stood is 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.400
 on the one hand an artist who cares a lot 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.010
 intense with french painting 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.290
 tradition of the 17th of the eighteenth 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.420
 century and he is 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.670
 on the other hand an artist of just for 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.680
 the contemporaries of impressionism 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.990
 but to set up 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.959
 was very very important so you say 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.720
 it can cause added traditional lines 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.310
 coro and it's from him and 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.400
 the exhibition we in the 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.069
 state art hall show 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.959
 the task has this artist for the first time 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.379
 the local art public 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.510
 to make known why in this place 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.640
 why this exhibition in karlsruhe the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.590
 Staatliche Kunsthalle is one of the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.290
 few houses in Germany the one 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.280
 schÃ¶nberg consisted of cameco in the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.829
 have a collection 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.079
 there are six works in total here 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.939
 of course, here in front 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.569
 this exhibition also in appearance 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.510
 to step 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.680
 But the whole environment is very cheap 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.030
 goes very well with cameco's Kunsthalle 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.849
 has a significant collection 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.459
 French painting and drawing art 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.260
 And so that's an environment in that too 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.540
 the elective affinities the artists 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.739
 very much related to the koro 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.709
 are well represented 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.950
 I think you can tell micro 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.010
 Feels very well in this house and 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.049
 Now the question why at this time 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.720
 why do we do this exhibition today 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.889
 and you can actually do several 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.870
 give answers 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.780
 on the one hand, it is a classic theme 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.940
 for the autumn and winter coro 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.340
 painter of silver poplar coro der 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.290
 melancholic that fits very well in the 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.319
 The season is slowly getting dark 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.209
 but in a great deal 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.780
 more fundamental sense is the present 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.269
 very well prepared for you today 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.459
 creative look at cannes ikoro too 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.819
 throw on an artist of in 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.159
 special way to the emotions of the 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.889
 observer is directed an artist 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.650
 its work very much with mood 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.720
 atmosphere and we are today 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.879
 at a time when yes the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.970
 digital space continues to expand 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:03.599
 very many encounters with pictures of the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.579
 which are completely flammable 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.329
 to that many observers today the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.000
 have desire 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.370
 to perceive sensual picture worlds and 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.069
 those that make you emotionally special 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.370
 Touch wise and there is ikoro 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:21.299
 artist especially on this new 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.250
 Sensitivity to sensually emotional 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.260
 Vibrations meet just those 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.480
 just a resonance in the viewer 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.400
 cause 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.280
 We realize after the first days 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.560
 in this exhibition that this 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.510
 Exhibition of hearts and spirits 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.410
 opens its viewer and does that 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.410
 very happy ourselves here
