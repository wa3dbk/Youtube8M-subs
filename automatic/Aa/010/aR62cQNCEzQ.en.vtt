00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.950 

it's<00:01:52.130> very<00:01:52.310> easy<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.790> size<00:01:53.120> this<00:01:53.330> up<00:01:53.510> actually

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
it's very easy to size this up actually

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.450 
it's very easy to size this up actually
because<00:01:54.110> once<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.470> have<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.620> big<00:01:54.860> pad<00:01:55.130> more

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
because once you have a big pad more

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.120 
because once you have a big pad more
cans<00:01:55.790> of<00:01:55.970> tomatoes<00:01:56.450> get<00:01:57.320> more<00:01:57.500> eggs<00:01:57.710> in<00:01:57.890> but

cans of tomatoes get more eggs in but

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.480 
cans of tomatoes get more eggs in but
this<00:01:58.820> is<00:01:58.880> my<00:01:59.240> selfish<00:01:59.810> Solo<00:02:00.500> treat<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:04.550> goes<00:02:04.820> in

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
this is my selfish Solo treat it goes in

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.630 
this is my selfish Solo treat it goes in
beautiful<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:08.330> now<00:02:08.960> I<00:02:08.990> think<00:02:09.259> some<00:02:10.009> parmesan

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
beautiful and now I think some parmesan

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.630 
beautiful and now I think some parmesan
and<00:02:10.940> really<00:02:11.660> I'm<00:02:11.840> using<00:02:12.080> parmesan<00:02:12.800> in<00:02:13.130> place

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
and really I'm using parmesan in place

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.100 
and really I'm using parmesan in place
of<00:02:13.880> salt<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:14.780> they<00:02:14.900> want<00:02:15.080> too<00:02:15.290> much<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:17.870> could

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
of salt so they want too much you could

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.810 
of salt so they want too much you could
add<00:02:18.290> salt<00:02:18.560> when<00:02:18.680> you're<00:02:18.830> eating<00:02:18.980> but<00:02:19.700> I'd

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
add salt when you're eating but I'd

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.400 
add salt when you're eating but I'd
rather<00:02:19.970> leave<00:02:20.240> it<00:02:20.270> out<00:02:20.450> now<00:02:20.690> because<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.140> one

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
rather leave it out now because the one

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.620 
rather leave it out now because the one
thing<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.860> can't<00:02:22.100> rectify<00:02:22.340> cooking<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.480> over

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
thing you can't rectify cooking is over

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.150 
thing you can't rectify cooking is over
