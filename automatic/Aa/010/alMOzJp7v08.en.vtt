00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.310 

basically<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.299> metal<00:01:24.780> right<00:01:24.929> now<00:01:25.079> I<00:01:25.109> think

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
basically with metal right now I think

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
basically with metal right now I think
that<00:01:25.500> sevens<00:01:26.159> are<00:01:26.340> kind<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.579> like<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.060> average

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that sevens are kind of like the average

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.300 
that sevens are kind of like the average
it's<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> sixth<00:01:28.560> ring<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:28.859> everybody's

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
it's like the sixth ring now everybody's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.459 
it's like the sixth ring now everybody's
pretty<00:01:29.429> much<00:01:29.549> doing<00:01:30.030> sevens<00:01:30.570> eights<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.200> was

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
pretty much doing sevens eights I was

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.719 
pretty much doing sevens eights I was
doing<00:01:31.649> them<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.979> bit<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.369> don't<00:01:32.549> really

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
doing them for a bit I don't really

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.399 
doing them for a bit I don't really
think<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.420> need<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.929> anymore<00:01:34.079> just

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
think I need to do it anymore just

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.529 
think I need to do it anymore just
because<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.829> think<00:01:35.039> sevens<00:01:35.579> perfect<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.509> I

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
because I think sevens perfect but I

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.120 
because I think sevens perfect but I
think<00:01:36.899> it<00:01:37.110> doesn't<00:01:37.319> really<00:01:37.409> matter<00:01:37.710> how<00:01:37.920> low

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
think it doesn't really matter how low

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.859 
think it doesn't really matter how low
you<00:01:38.159> tune<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.939> don't<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.420> tune<00:01:39.600> low<00:01:39.810> to

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
you tune you don't have to tune low to

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
you tune you don't have to tune low to
be<00:01:40.049> heavy<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.469> not<00:01:40.679> you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.069> a<00:01:41.100> necessity

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
be heavy it's not you know a necessity

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.940 
be heavy it's not you know a necessity
anymore<00:01:42.179> but<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:42.719> for<00:01:43.259> us<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.770> we're

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
anymore but just for us for what we're

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.529 
anymore but just for us for what we're
doing<00:01:44.219> I<00:01:44.369> think<00:01:44.429> it<00:01:44.670> gives<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.240> me<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
doing I think it gives the do me the

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:54.060 
doing I think it gives the do me the
sledge<00:01:45.810> II<00:01:45.959> feel<00:01:46.679> of<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.520 

it's<00:01:54.610> all<00:01:54.790> one<00:01:55.120> piece<00:01:55.420> it's<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.990> neck<00:01:56.200> through

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.080 
it's all one piece it's a neck through
with<00:01:56.980> this<00:01:57.160> I<00:01:57.370> know<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:57.640> it's<00:01:57.760> going<00:01:57.880> to<00:01:57.940> have

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
with this I know that it's going to have

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.780 
with this I know that it's going to have
a<00:01:58.120> lot<00:01:58.360> smoother<00:01:58.930> more<00:01:59.350> sustain<00:01:59.920> less<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.700> a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
a lot smoother more sustain less of a

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.310 
a lot smoother more sustain less of a
rugged<00:02:01.060> tone<00:02:01.660> it's<00:02:01.870> going<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.050> be<00:02:02.140> definitely

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
rugged tone it's going to be definitely

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.410 
rugged tone it's going to be definitely
a<00:02:02.560> real<00:02:02.740> smooth<00:02:03.250> sounding<00:02:03.760> guitar<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:04.300> that's

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
a real smooth sounding guitar and that's

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.880 
a real smooth sounding guitar and that's
what<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.600> like<00:02:04.870> since<00:02:05.350> it's<00:02:05.530> got<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.770> two

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
what I like since it's got the two

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.440 
what I like since it's got the two
pneumatic<00:02:06.100> stop<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.730> not<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:06.850> body<00:02:07.120> through

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
pneumatic stop and not a body through

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.080 
pneumatic stop and not a body through
it's<00:02:07.750> just<00:02:07.900> gonna<00:02:08.140> have<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.380> lot<00:02:08.830> more

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
it's just gonna have a lot more

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.070 
it's just gonna have a lot more
vibration<00:02:10.090> throughout<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.479> whole<00:02:10.630> body<00:02:10.869> and
