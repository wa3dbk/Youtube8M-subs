00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
another bright here call me crazy but I

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.339

think<00:03:02.500> this<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.650> honestly<00:03:02.980> too<00:03:03.340> soft<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:05.140> egg

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
think this is honestly too soft the egg

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.649 
think this is honestly too soft the egg
and<00:03:05.620> all<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.859> is<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.010> nice<00:03:06.220> bite<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.879> think<00:03:07.540> if

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
and all that is a nice bite I think if

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.479 
and all that is a nice bite I think if
they<00:03:07.810> would<00:03:08.019> have<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.470> know<00:03:08.500> if<00:03:09.159> they<00:03:09.340> would

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
bits in there like crunchy that would

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.599 
bits in there like crunchy that would
have<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.209> lot<00:03:13.959> nicer<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.560> crunch<00:03:14.829> there<00:03:15.099> yeah
