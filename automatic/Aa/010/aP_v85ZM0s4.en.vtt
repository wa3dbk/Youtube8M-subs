not<00:05:25.450> all<00:05:26.450> right<00:05:26.539> this<00:05:26.930> port<00:05:27.470> right<00:05:27.740> here<00:05:28.220> is

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
not all right this port right here is

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.909 
not all right this port right here is
the<00:05:28.729> power<00:05:29.660> cable<00:05:30.500> that's<00:05:30.620> where<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:30.800> power

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
the power cable that's where the power

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.020 
the power cable that's where the power
cable<00:05:31.310> will<00:05:31.400> go<00:05:31.720> this<00:05:32.720> if<00:05:33.140> I<00:05:33.530> correct<00:05:34.490> is<00:05:34.700> like

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
cable will go this if I correct is like

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.930 
cable will go this if I correct is like
a<00:05:35.919> speaker<00:05:36.919> jack<00:05:37.370> or<00:05:37.669> some<00:05:38.060> sound<00:05:38.389> or<00:05:38.720> Wi-Fi

wide variety of ways to connect things

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.850 
wide variety of ways to connect things
to<00:06:05.849> your<00:06:05.909> monitor<00:06:06.330> so<00:06:07.289> you<00:06:07.379> can<00:06:07.500> connect<00:06:07.740> them

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860

it<00:06:13.590> from<00:06:14.039> the<00:06:14.129> DVI<00:06:14.400> or<00:06:14.759> you<00:06:15.210> can<00:06:15.360> connect<00:06:15.599> it

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:15.659 
it from the DVI or you can connect it

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.640 
it from the DVI or you can connect it
through<00:06:15.720> the<00:06:16.050> BDA<00:06:18.050> alright<00:06:19.050> so<00:06:19.379> there's<00:06:19.560> your

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
through the BDA alright so there's your

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:25.550 
through the BDA alright so there's your
