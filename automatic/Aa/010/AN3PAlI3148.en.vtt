00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:16.360
 greetings guys and welcome back after more than 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.820
 a month on pokÃ©mon red error and time 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.000
 I hear the people who say but no it was 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.180
 over because he came back here because 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.829
 apparently we can continue in the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.540
 game 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:33.719
 in fact if we go there is a picture 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:36.190
 red and pieve psi pci blocks the road 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.499
 we can pass over this step which it is 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.390
 was obviously put we say how 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:45.129
 barrier but apparently it doesn't work 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.429
 as you can see you can pass the game 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.289
 continue what is the prokom and you will hear it 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.530
 plus the tadic music abandons the 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.420
 problem is that the game is over in the 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.570
 meaning that it is completely identical to 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.390
 fire red pokemon 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.250
 and so I don't think I 'll continue to 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.750
 the simple fact that it would make no sense 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.780
 why make a game that everyone knows 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.820
 with the slightly leveled to the Czech this 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.330
 video here to say 30 would not have 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.009
 no sense and therefore nothing had 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.660
 especially this coach for so 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.119
 whim 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.820
 so nothing this curiosity or duty 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.500
 review ok the dictation also the other 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.119
 however I will not continue the game for the 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.490
 simple fact that it doesn't make sense as I have 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:35.110
 already said now let's eliminate this here 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:40.310
 I was wrong to never fold of amelia 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.530
 vaia vaia ok 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.049
 and nothing 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.820
 how you see 35 or disappearing 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.780
 we can go through Mr. 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.080
 galliani no lords this little one 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.450
 video just to show you this 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.310
 curiosity ends here if you liked it 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.800
 vivitar you have it comment 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.909
 to the canal and we get caught in a 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.909
 next video
