they're built and the screens are on the

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.920 
they're built and the screens are on the
big<00:00:40.710> difference<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.870> have

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
big difference is that we do not have

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.049 
big difference is that we do not have
advertisements<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.949> this<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.370> these<00:00:44.489> forts<00:00:45.000> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
advertisements on this and these forts a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.430 
advertisements on this and these forts a
little<00:00:45.269> bit<00:00:45.359> wider<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.840> little<00:00:45.870> bit<00:00:46.199> higher

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
little bit wider and a little bit higher

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.430 
little bit wider and a little bit higher
and<00:00:47.090> we'll<00:00:48.090> also<00:00:48.480> after<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.929> a<00:00:48.960> day<00:00:49.170> games

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and we'll also after the a day games

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.229 
and we'll also after the a day games
we'll<00:00:49.980> come<00:00:50.219> back<00:00:50.429> and<00:00:50.760> we'll<00:00:50.879> take<00:00:51.089> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
we'll come back and we'll take the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
we'll come back and we'll take the
boards<00:00:51.539> down<00:00:51.719> off<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.199> north<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:53.219> make<00:00:53.609> them

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
boards down off the north and make them

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.189 
boards down off the north and make them
look<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.030> tentacle<00:00:54.359> to<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> ones<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.839> the<00:00:54.929> south

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
look a tentacle to the ones on the south

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.319 
look a tentacle to the ones on the south
so<00:00:55.559> there'll<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.769> bigger<00:00:56.399> screens<00:00:56.820> higher

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
so there'll be bigger screens higher

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.049 
so there'll be bigger screens higher
definitions<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> big

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
definitions and it will be a big

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.590 
definitions and it will be a big
improvement

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
improvement

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200 
improvement
