shots<00:01:48.630> he<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.109> took<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:49.740> our<00:01:49.950> heavy<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.999> we

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
shots he just took out our heavy but we

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.129 
shots he just took out our heavy but we
flared<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.409> behind<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.549> HQ<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:54.929> we're

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
flared up in behind the HQ and now we're

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:56.809 
flared up in behind the HQ and now we're
pretty<00:01:55.380> much<00:01:55.560> safe<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.889> think<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.249> sniper<00:01:56.549> is

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
pretty much safe I think the sniper is

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.330 
pretty much safe I think the sniper is
still<00:01:57.149> attacking<00:01:58.139> some<00:01:58.319> of<00:01:58.439> our<00:01:58.590> units<00:01:58.979> but

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
still attacking some of our units but

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.429 
still attacking some of our units but
our<00:01:59.549> zookas<00:02:00.030> are<00:02:00.359> in<00:02:00.539> a<00:02:00.780> pretty<00:02:01.020> good<00:02:01.200> position

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
our zookas are in a pretty good position

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.249 
our zookas are in a pretty good position
now<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.670> mean<00:02:02.939> that's<00:02:03.060> an<00:02:03.240> important<00:02:03.780> concept

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
now I mean that's an important concept

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.349 
now I mean that's an important concept
when<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.499> go<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.219> scout<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.609> base<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.179> want

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
when you go in and scout a base you want

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.749 
when you go in and scout a base you want
to<00:02:06.420> take<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> look<00:02:06.959> at<00:02:07.350> all<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.220> defensive

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
to take a look at all the defensive

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.090 
to take a look at all the defensive
buildings<00:02:09.209> select<00:02:10.110> them<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.590> look<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:10.950> their

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
buildings select them and look at their

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.790 
buildings select them and look at their
range<00:02:11.400> look<00:02:11.850> at<00:02:12.030> where<00:02:12.410> they're<00:02:13.410> going<00:02:13.770> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
range look at where they're going to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.830 
range look at where they're going to
attack<00:02:14.400> your<00:02:14.610> units<00:02:15.060> from

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
attack your units from

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.900 
attack your units from
for<00:02:16.019> bases<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.250> know<00:02:17.430> exactly

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
for bases like this you know exactly

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.940 
for bases like this you know exactly
which<00:02:18.330> defenses<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.110> need<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.379> take<00:02:19.590> out<00:02:19.739> and

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
which defenses you need to take out and

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.670 
which defenses you need to take out and
then<00:02:20.519> where<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.209> place<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.720> troops<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.319> order

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
then where to place your troops in order

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.440 
then where to place your troops in order
to<00:02:22.830> stay<00:02:23.069> out<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.400> range<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.150> remaining

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
to stay out of range of the remaining

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.210 
to stay out of range of the remaining
ones<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.750> don't<00:02:24.840> have<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.140> take<00:02:25.319> out<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:25.739> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
ones you don't have to take out all the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.800 
ones you don't have to take out all the
defenses<00:02:26.700> especially<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.239> ones<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.599> can't

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
defenses especially the ones that can't

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.600 
defenses especially the ones that can't
reach<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.260> when<00:02:28.830> you're<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.160> position<00:02:29.459> like

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
reach you when you're in a position like

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.140 
reach you when you're in a position like
this

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.800 
this
so<00:02:30.599> we're<00:02:30.900> almost<00:02:31.640> complete<00:02:32.640> there<00:02:33.299> we<00:02:33.420> go

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
so we're almost complete there we go

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.830 
so we're almost complete there we go
took<00:02:34.319> out<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.830> HQ<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.790> base<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.209> gone<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.720> got

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
took out the HQ the base is gone we got

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.350 
took out the HQ the base is gone we got
some<00:02:37.019> pretty<00:02:37.200> decent<00:02:37.410> rewards<00:02:38.180> some<00:02:39.180> pretty

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
some pretty decent rewards some pretty

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.960 
some pretty decent rewards some pretty
pretty<00:02:39.660> good<00:02:39.900> gold<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.129> collected<00:02:41.670> from

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
pretty good gold that we collected from

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.420 
pretty good gold that we collected from
this<00:02:42.180> base<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.290> think<00:02:43.650> we<00:02:43.980> got<00:02:44.099> some<00:02:44.280> decent

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
this base and I think we got some decent

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.420 
this base and I think we got some decent
amounts<00:02:44.940> from<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.959> next<00:02:46.230> base<00:02:46.440> yeah<00:02:47.160> we<00:02:47.310> had

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
amounts from the next base yeah we had

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.460 
amounts from the next base yeah we had
quite<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.670> few<00:02:47.730> casualties<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:48.599> said<00:02:48.900> I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
quite a few casualties like I said I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.449 
quite a few casualties like I said I
mean<00:02:50.480> they're<00:02:51.480> not<00:02:51.630> necessarily<00:02:52.170> easy<00:02:52.709> bases

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
mean they're not necessarily easy bases

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.770 
mean they're not necessarily easy bases
to<00:02:53.640> attack

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
to attack

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.069 
to attack
you're<00:02:55.739> gonna<00:02:55.829> lose<00:02:56.130> troops<00:02:56.579> obviously<00:02:57.390> but

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
you're gonna lose troops obviously but

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.440 
you're gonna lose troops obviously but
at<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.590> same<00:02:58.739> time<00:02:59.010> when<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.000> buildings<00:03:00.329> are

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
at the same time when the buildings are

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.089 
at the same time when the buildings are
that<00:03:00.569> close<00:03:00.750> together<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.950> can

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
that close together and and you can

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.089 
that close together and and you can
avoid<00:03:02.400> some<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.780> those<00:03:04.049> defensive<00:03:04.650> structures

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
avoid some of those defensive structures

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.680 
avoid some of those defensive structures
then<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.519> all<00:03:05.670> good<00:03:05.879> and<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.239> same<00:03:06.450> goes<00:03:06.660> for

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
then it's all good and the same goes for

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.210 
then it's all good and the same goes for
here<00:03:06.989> see<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.860> what<00:03:08.010> we're<00:03:08.129> doing

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
here see and this is what we're doing

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.240 
here see and this is what we're doing
we're<00:03:08.459> taking<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.790> look<00:03:09.000> at<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.750> defenses<00:03:10.349> none

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
we're taking a look at the defenses none

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.710 
we're taking a look at the defenses none
of<00:03:11.400> those<00:03:11.489> sniper<00:03:11.819> towers<00:03:12.269> we<00:03:12.390> don't<00:03:12.569> have<00:03:12.660> to

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
of those sniper towers we don't have to

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.589 
of those sniper towers we don't have to
worry<00:03:12.930> about<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.260> sniper<00:03:13.500> towers<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.010> only

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
worry about the sniper towers the only

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.580 
worry about the sniper towers the only
defensive<00:03:15.599> structures<00:03:16.079> we<00:03:16.230> have<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.440> worry

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
defensive structures we have to worry

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.619 
defensive structures we have to worry
about<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:17.160> mortar<00:03:17.879> right<00:03:18.060> there<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.450> the

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
about is that mortar right there and the

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.210 
about is that mortar right there and the
other<00:03:18.660> sniper<00:03:19.019> tower<00:03:19.379> that<00:03:19.530> that's<00:03:19.799> close<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
other sniper tower that that's close to

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.509 
other sniper tower that that's close to
the<00:03:20.639> HQ<00:03:21.510> we<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.200> walk<00:03:22.530> right<00:03:22.560> by<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.370> machine

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
the HQ we can walk right by that machine

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.629 
the HQ we can walk right by that machine
gun<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.540> have<00:03:24.870> shock<00:03:25.200> bombs<00:03:25.470> then<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.280> mean

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
gun if you have shock bombs then I mean

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.059 
gun if you have shock bombs then I mean
you<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.880> use<00:03:27.060> them<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.359> machine<00:03:27.480> guns<00:03:28.069> or

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
you can use them on the machine guns or

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.750 
you can use them on the machine guns or
any<00:03:29.310> other<00:03:29.810> defensive<00:03:30.810> structures<00:03:31.319> that<00:03:31.760> that

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
any other defensive structures that that

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.640 
any other defensive structures that that
might<00:03:32.970> be<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.420> way<00:03:33.569> between<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.319> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
might be in the way between you and

defensive<00:03:59.130> structures<00:03:59.609> okay<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.599> I'm

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
defensive structures okay and I'm

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.930 
defensive structures okay and I'm
actually<00:04:01.079> not<00:04:01.260> even<00:04:01.500> going<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:02.010> flare<00:04:02.700> up<00:04:02.730> I'm

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
actually not even going to flare up I'm

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.580 
actually not even going to flare up I'm
gonna<00:04:03.060> let<00:04:03.239> these<00:04:03.359> guys<00:04:03.599> take<00:04:03.930> out<00:04:04.139> this

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
gonna let these guys take out this

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.830 
gonna let these guys take out this
machine-gun<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:06.000> may<00:04:06.180> as<00:04:06.239> well<00:04:06.329> we'll<00:04:06.630> get<00:04:06.720> an

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
machine-gun you may as well we'll get an

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.720 
machine-gun you may as well we'll get an
additional<00:04:07.079> some<00:04:07.620> additional<00:04:08.040> energy<00:04:08.519> and

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
additional some additional energy and

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.449 
additional some additional energy and
then<00:04:09.239> we're<00:04:09.480> going<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.750> flare<00:04:10.319> on<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:11.160> sniper

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
then we're going to flare on the sniper

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.280 
then we're going to flare on the sniper
tower<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:11.970> then<00:04:12.090> once<00:04:12.329> we're<00:04:12.540> done<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:12.959> I

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
tower and then once we're done that I

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.470 
tower and then once we're done that I
mean<00:04:13.620> we're<00:04:14.340> out<00:04:14.370> of<00:04:14.519> range<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:15.120> everything

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
mean we're out of range of everything

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.599 
mean we're out of range of everything
else<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.410> mean<00:04:16.680> there's<00:04:16.829> not<00:04:16.950> even<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.370> need

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
else so I mean there's not even a need

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.539 
else so I mean there's not even a need
to<00:04:17.880> flare<00:04:18.180> at<00:04:18.419> this<00:04:18.570> point<00:04:18.870> because<00:04:19.549> even

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
to flare at this point because even

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.670 
to flare at this point because even
though<00:04:20.639> I<00:04:20.669> do<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:21.180> think<00:04:21.299> actually<00:04:21.930> maybe<00:04:22.289> I<00:04:22.440> did

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
though I do I think actually maybe I did

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.560 
though I do I think actually maybe I did
because<00:04:22.919> we're<00:04:23.099> still<00:04:23.370> getting<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.849> getting

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
because we're still getting a getting

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.089 
because we're still getting a getting
attacked<00:04:24.840> by<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.050> one<00:04:25.289> sniper<00:04:25.500> tower<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.070> I

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
attacked by the one sniper tower so I

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.409 
attacked by the one sniper tower so I
just<00:04:26.340> flare<00:04:26.610> them<00:04:26.760> up<00:04:26.849> in<00:04:26.969> the<00:04:27.060> back<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.240> the

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
just flare them up in the back of the

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.370 
just flare them up in the back of the
base

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
base

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.520 
base
and<00:04:28.820> there<00:04:29.820> they're<00:04:30.120> just<00:04:30.330> free<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.870> attack

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
and there they're just free to attack

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.920 
and there they're just free to attack
the<00:04:31.680> HQ<00:04:32.100> so<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.910> know<00:04:33.030> some<00:04:33.480> some<00:04:33.750> good

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
the HQ so you know some some good

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.950 
the HQ so you know some some good
examples<00:04:34.440> of<00:04:34.800> what<00:04:34.860> not<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.490> do<00:04:35.910> on<00:04:36.210> your<00:04:36.780> base

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
examples of what not to do on your base

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.960 
examples of what not to do on your base
when<00:04:37.230> you're<00:04:37.350> setting<00:04:37.620> up<00:04:37.770> those<00:04:38.340> defensive

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
when you're setting up those defensive

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.050 
when you're setting up those defensive
structures<00:04:39.840> are<00:04:40.080> way<00:04:40.380> too<00:04:40.440> far<00:04:40.920> away<00:04:41.040> from<00:04:41.880> the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
structures are way too far away from the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.060 
structures are way too far away from the
hit<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.570> headquarters<00:04:43.140> leaving<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:43.860> pretty

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
hit the headquarters leaving it pretty

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.980

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
much defenseless aside from that one

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.230 
much defenseless aside from that one
mortar<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.530> that<00:04:47.190> one<00:04:47.400> sniper<00:04:47.670> tower<00:04:47.970> which
