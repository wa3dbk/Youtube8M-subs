00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.789
 I greet you dear viewer with you 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.740
 as always, I will tell you today 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.869
 you and a hero named poozh in general 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.279
 it would be better to say a patch but not 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.650
 will break our habits 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.719
 continue to call him pooja the way in 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.700
 translated from English fat and not 

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:30.680
 butcher how many may think why 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.960
 they call him a butcher I will tell you 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.850
 further for now let's talk about who we are 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.850
 got used to see today in the game dota 2 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.989
 lord t2 talks about that way 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.480
 doomed to perform by no means 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.670
 pleasant work he collects the bodies of the fallen 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.679
 dismembers them and dumps them into huge 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.870
 heaps for the battlefield not to be 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.120
 completely overwhelmed with the corpses of the puja 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.339
 previously was an ordinary butcher but later he 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.319
 completely mad with his work to him 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.059
 start like what he does in 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.159
 Later, he began to partially 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.809
 devour corpses sometimes he sent from 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.120
 own body particles set 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.010
 fatter and stronger he always complains 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.440
 the fact that carrion is impossible on e100 and 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.370
 an hour later you are hungry again he is sincere 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.170
 happy offal 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.670
 and talks about how they ended up 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.920
 will look like a delicious cake 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.990
 he also thinks that meat is very cute 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.970
 here is the original story of this hero 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.840
 written in character description in dota 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.760
 2 on the fields of eternal battle not far in the south 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.040
 from college obese figure stubbornly 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.050
 working under cover of night cleans a 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.670
 then dismembers and gutts and loads 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.920
 heaps of limbs and internal organs 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.480
 fallen and all this only to 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.610
 the next morning the carnage I could happen again 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.650
 nothing in that damned world 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.360
 decomposed by itself to the dead 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.280
 never destined to go back to 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.110
 earth and no matter how deep 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.760
 grave surrounded by flocks of birds 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.130
 scavengers who need chopped 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.140
 pieces of corpses butcher the way practicing with 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.330
 the blades of the flesh is cut off from the bones 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.490
 ligaments and tendons come off to pieces 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.410
 wet paper and even though the pooja always had 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.060
 addictions to miss child craft with 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.890
 in time the exact big guy loved this 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.900
 what happens when he finishes 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.450
 work on the corpse first piece 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.010
 muscle there is a sip of blood soon the way 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.050
 already bit into the body of the strongest 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.599
 creatures are like gnawing dog bone 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.430
 even those who do not harbor fear 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.050
 prefers death is not associated with 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.370
 butcher 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.850
 agree it sounds very interesting 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.770
 worthy of the new 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.080
 is not the true story of it 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.760
 the character is completely different she begins 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.590
 very far back to the times when 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.510
 Sylvanas windrunner was not 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.240
 patroness renounced and served 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.920
 I fly to the king 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.080
 pooj is a big walking corpse more precisely 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.630
 creature created from pieces of different bodies 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.520
 his creators are undead come alive 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.740
 corpses part 1 and which is now 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.840
 on the side of the horde in the game world of warcraft 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.660
 and henceforth it was part of the lash limp 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.430
 succumbed to going crazy 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.770
 and soundly that's why it has 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.690
 we are accustomed to a large supply of health 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.180
 see pooja vanya than someone thinks that 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.550
 it's the smell of decaying meat but it 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.010
 far from being the main weapon of the undead 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.200
 the scourge was a plague of undead trying to infect 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.090
 its own plague all around and then raised 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.040
 the fallen soldiers replenish come alive 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.900
 dead your countless army you 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:13.739
 thought we forgot 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.910
 you thought we forgave 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.620
 see sh 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.620
 different places Forsaken 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.620
 phone 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.180
 for the sake of 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.719
 the way could carry and why he did not stink 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.609
 and infected his enemies with plague 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.829
 there was a green cloud of smoke around it 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.680
 which in dota became known as road 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.659
 rot and changed its color to yellow 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.760
 pooj is already dead so fearless he 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.379
 forever hungry therefore lives its enemies 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.329
 but due to the fact that it is sewn from parts 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.220
 fallen warriors with every enemy eaten 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.260
 he gets stronger and makes up 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.060
 lost in the battle of health thanks 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.129
 their cruelty fearlessness of love for 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.689
 the meat of the dismemberment every fell him 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.969
 nicknamed buter that translated into 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.859
 Russian means butcher and the way itself 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:02.560
 more often calls himself a butcher than 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.659
 fat man shaman bieber teaches out 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.430
 that the pooj has no past and never 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.769
 was a man he is just a creature 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.750
 whip monsters that same see for 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.780
 to kill the plague 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.120
 chaos and death though who knows he is no longer 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.039
 subservient to the will of the king lich and possibly in 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.810
 his holy head is back 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.789
 scraps of human life memories 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.789
 to whom this head belonged earlier 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:32.370
