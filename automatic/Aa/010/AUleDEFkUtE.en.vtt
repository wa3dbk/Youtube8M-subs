dynamism<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.290> dynamism<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.100> something<00:01:05.400> that

dynamism and dynamism is something that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
Infinity action games because they were

Infinity action games because they were
2d<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.450> very<00:01:09.660> sort<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.620> sprite<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.130> tile

goals<00:01:14.250> um<00:01:14.990> when<00:01:15.990> I'm<00:01:16.080> talking<00:01:16.440> about<00:01:16.470> dynamism

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
goals um when I'm talking about dynamism

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.160 
goals um when I'm talking about dynamism
specifically<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.240> demo<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> things<00:01:19.020> I'm

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
specifically in this demo the things I'm

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.750 
specifically in this demo the things I'm
talking<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.560> our<00:01:19.890> movement<00:01:20.310> within<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
talking about our movement within the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.120 
talking about our movement within the
scene<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.750> things<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.110> trees<00:01:22.500> moving<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
scene so things like trees moving and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
scene so things like trees moving and
grass<00:01:23.340> moving<00:01:23.670> which<00:01:24.300> is<00:01:24.480> subtle<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:24.840> makes

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
grass moving which is subtle but makes

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.080 
grass moving which is subtle but makes
the<00:01:25.410> area<00:01:25.830> feel<00:01:25.980> a<00:01:26.190> little<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:26.520> alive

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the area feel a little more alive

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.930 
the area feel a little more alive
also<00:01:27.870> things<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.140> dynamic<00:01:28.380> water<00:01:28.950> which

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
also things like dynamic water which

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.460 
also things like dynamic water which
also<00:01:30.210> includes<00:01:30.480> the<00:01:30.600> ability<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.870> raise<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
also includes the ability to raise and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.720 
also includes the ability to raise and
lower<00:01:31.500> water<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.190> we'll<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.370> showing<00:01:32.610> you

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
lower water which we'll be showing you

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.240 
lower water which we'll be showing you
in<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> demo<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:33.420> third<00:01:34.170> dynamic<00:01:34.950> lighting

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
in the demo and third dynamic lighting

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.580 
in the demo and third dynamic lighting
this<00:01:35.880> dynamic<00:01:36.330> lighting<00:01:36.570> includes<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
this dynamic lighting includes a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.560 
this dynamic lighting includes a
day/night<00:01:37.890> cycle<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.550> also<00:01:38.760> means<00:01:39.030> actual

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
day/night cycle but it also means actual

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.780 
day/night cycle but it also means actual
dynamic<00:01:40.380> lighting<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.830> the<00:01:41.100> scene<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.550> real

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
dynamic lighting of the scene in real

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.740 
dynamic lighting of the scene in real
time<00:01:42.320> which<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.440> pretty<00:01:43.650> cool<00:01:44.330> so<00:01:45.330> here<00:01:45.510> you<00:01:45.600> go

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
time which is pretty cool so here you go

00:01:45.750 --> 00:02:31.600 
time which is pretty cool so here you go
take<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.230> look
