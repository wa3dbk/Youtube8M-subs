tough<00:02:37.390> stick<00:02:37.900> sometimes<00:02:38.170> if<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.530> put<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.739> warm

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
tough stick sometimes if you put a warm

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.199 
tough stick sometimes if you put a warm
washcloth<00:02:39.610> over<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.330> helps<00:02:40.540> too<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:42.209> see

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
washcloth over it and helps too so I see

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.449 
washcloth over it and helps too so I see
what<00:02:43.420> I'm<00:02:43.510> going<00:02:43.840> for<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.140> I'm<00:02:44.530> ready<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:44.980> go

also it's important to note that you
have<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.540> go<00:02:49.630> by<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.870> feel<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.530> veins<00:02:50.769> okay

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
have to go by the feel of the veins okay

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.030 
have to go by the feel of the veins okay
yes<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:52.090> can<00:02:52.269> see<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:52.660> vein<00:02:52.900> perfectly<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:53.980> I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
yes I can see this vein perfectly but I

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.430 
yes I can see this vein perfectly but I
also<00:02:54.280> feel<00:02:54.640> it's<00:02:55.150> perfect<00:02:55.630> example<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.320> a

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
also feel it's perfect example of a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.550 
also feel it's perfect example of a
textbook<00:02:56.950> vein<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.670> spongy<00:02:58.269> it's<00:02:58.510> bouncy<00:02:58.959> to

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
textbook vein it's spongy it's bouncy to

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.970 
textbook vein it's spongy it's bouncy to
feel<00:02:59.830> somebody<00:03:00.790> wants<00:03:01.030> told<00:03:01.239> me<00:03:01.360> go<00:03:01.630> by<00:03:01.870> go<00:03:02.769> by

if you can't see it or feel it well it's

a whole other story you're going in for
a<00:03:13.959> blind<00:03:14.170> stick<00:03:14.610> it's<00:03:15.610> tough<00:03:15.820> but<00:03:16.360> you<00:03:16.630> do<00:03:16.750> what

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
a blind stick it's tough but you do what

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.960 
a blind stick it's tough but you do what

you got to do but this is a perfect one
by<00:03:19.150> sight<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.810> by<00:03:20.110> feel<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.799> we're<00:03:21.010> all<00:03:21.130> ready

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
by sight and by feel and we're all ready

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.130 
by sight and by feel and we're all ready
to<00:03:21.370> go<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:22.090> get<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.690> feeling<00:03:23.019> of

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
to go you have to get to the feeling of

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.190 
to go you have to get to the feeling of
feeling<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.680> vein<00:03:23.830> first<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:25.170> step<00:03:26.170> number

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
feeling the vein first so step number

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.650 
feeling the vein first so step number
three<00:03:26.799> I<00:03:26.830> think<00:03:27.250> this<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.549> number<00:03:27.940> three

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
three I think this is number three

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.720 
three I think this is number three
I'm<00:03:28.750> not<00:03:29.019> wearing<00:03:29.320> gloves<00:03:29.530> obviously<00:03:30.519> would

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
I'm not wearing gloves obviously would

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.140 
I'm not wearing gloves obviously would
be

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
be

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.509 
be
I<00:03:31.180> don't<00:03:31.390> have<00:03:31.480> any<00:03:31.659> you<00:03:32.379> wrap<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.620> Scott<00:03:33.280> down

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
I don't have any you wrap it Scott down

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.809 
I don't have any you wrap it Scott down
with<00:03:33.760> alcohol<00:03:34.079> okay<00:03:35.220> let<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.340> dry<00:03:36.549> for<00:03:36.579> a

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
with alcohol okay let it dry for a

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:37.949 
with alcohol okay let it dry for a
little<00:03:36.879> bit<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:37.269> doesn't<00:03:37.299> stink<00:03:37.720> when<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
little bit so it doesn't stink when the

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.800 
little bit so it doesn't stink when the
needle<00:03:38.200> goes<00:03:38.379> in<00:03:38.590> okay<00:03:39.430> my<00:03:40.000> favorite<00:03:40.480> needles

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
needle goes in okay my favorite needles

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.910 
needle goes in okay my favorite needles
to<00:03:40.959> use<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.349> I<00:03:41.379> think<00:03:41.590> pretty<00:03:41.739> much

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
to use and I think pretty much

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.500 
to use and I think pretty much
everyone's<00:03:42.310> favorite<00:03:42.700> are<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:43.360> butterflies

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
everyone's favorite are the butterflies

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.350 
everyone's favorite are the butterflies
this<00:03:44.379> is<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.620> 21<00:03:45.099> gauge<00:03:45.370> which<00:03:45.879> is<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.030> little<00:03:46.269> bit

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
this is a 21 gauge which is a little bit

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.020 
this is a 21 gauge which is a little bit
smaller<00:03:46.689> than<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.110> true<00:03:47.590> one<00:03:48.069> each<00:03:48.220> age<00:03:48.670> I

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
smaller than the true one each age I

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.479 
smaller than the true one each age I
believe<00:03:49.299> I<00:03:49.420> use<00:03:49.659> yes<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:53.500> they're<00:03:54.250> easy

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
believe I use yes and they're easy

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.309 
believe I use yes and they're easy
because<00:03:54.760> once<00:03:55.480> you're<00:03:55.659> in<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:55.989> can<00:03:56.140> see<00:03:56.290> a

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
because once you're in you can see a

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.619 
because once you're in you can see a
flashback<00:03:56.920> whereas<00:03:57.760> straight<00:03:58.150> needles<00:03:58.450> you

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
flashback whereas straight needles you

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.000 
flashback whereas straight needles you
don't<00:03:58.810> really<00:03:58.959> know<00:03:59.200> until<00:03:59.230> you<00:03:59.620> put<00:03:59.709> the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
don't really know until you put the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.349 
don't really know until you put the
vacutainer<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.760> so<00:04:00.939> it's<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.120> little

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
vacutainer and so it's a little

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.910 
vacutainer and so it's a little
difficult<00:04:01.540> typically<00:04:02.500> you'd<00:04:02.709> have<00:04:02.890> a

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
difficult typically you'd have a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.619 
difficult typically you'd have a
vacutainer<00:04:03.340> on<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.760> other<00:04:03.909> end<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.090> this<00:04:04.209> I'm

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
vacutainer on the other end of this I'm

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.119 
vacutainer on the other end of this I'm
not<00:04:04.810> even<00:04:05.079> going<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.230> take<00:04:05.409> the<00:04:05.560> plastic<00:04:05.739> thing

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
not even going to take the plastic thing

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.410 
not even going to take the plastic thing
off<00:04:06.280> for<00:04:06.489> safety<00:04:06.909> reasons

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
off for safety reasons

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.050 
off for safety reasons
but<00:04:07.659> this<00:04:08.590> is<00:04:08.769> your<00:04:08.920> needle<00:04:09.159> you<00:04:09.370> would<00:04:09.849> take

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
but this is your needle you would take

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.420 
but this is your needle you would take
the<00:04:10.209> plastic<00:04:10.629> off<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.139> you<00:04:12.040> make<00:04:12.250> sure<00:04:12.280> you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
the plastic off and you make sure you

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.190 
the plastic off and you make sure you
hold<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.909> with<00:04:12.940> the<00:04:13.150> butterfly<00:04:13.569> wings<00:04:13.840> with

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
hold it with the butterfly wings with

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.199 
hold it with the butterfly wings with
the<00:04:14.230> bevel<00:04:14.560> up<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:15.069> bevels<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.579> hole<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:16.030> do

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
the bevel up the bevels the hole you do

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.080

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
an angle that's kind of deep enough I'm

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.070 
an angle that's kind of deep enough I'm
not<00:04:39.820> good<00:04:40.120> with<00:04:40.150> numbers<00:04:40.419> I<00:04:40.720> don't<00:04:40.870> know<00:04:40.930> the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
not good with numbers I don't know the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.779 
not good with numbers I don't know the
actual<00:04:41.410> angle<00:04:41.560> but<00:04:41.800> it's<00:04:42.280> kind<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.610> deep

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
actual angle but it's kind of deep

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.850 
actual angle but it's kind of deep
enough<00:04:43.060> but<00:04:43.660> not<00:04:43.840> totally<00:04:44.410> shallow<00:04:44.650> because

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
enough but not totally shallow because

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.960 
enough but not totally shallow because
then<00:04:45.039> you'll<00:04:45.160> miss<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.430> vein<00:04:45.580> but<00:04:45.699> if<00:04:45.789> you<00:04:45.849> go

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
then you'll miss the vein but if you go

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.399 
then you'll miss the vein but if you go
too<00:04:46.210> deep<00:04:46.389> you<00:04:46.419> can<00:04:46.690> penetrate<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.260> vein

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
too deep you can penetrate the vein

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.409 
too deep you can penetrate the vein
completely<00:04:47.919> so<00:04:48.130> it's<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.400> kind<00:04:48.940> of<00:04:48.970> like<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.180> feel

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
completely so it's a kind of like a feel

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.870 
completely so it's a kind of like a feel
thing<00:04:49.630> okay<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:50.650> after<00:04:51.099> you<00:04:51.340> have<00:04:51.400> all<00:04:51.729> your
