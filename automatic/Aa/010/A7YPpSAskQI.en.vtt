 all my colleagues and I think it's a 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.299
 experience that we will never go back to 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.700
 have the practice were treated as unity 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.939
 of intensive therapy entering the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.080
 area of intensive therapy and adult 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.880
 in which pediatric 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.730
 you live in a very good experience 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.100
 as the update with the new 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.020
 technologies and new procedure like 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.080
 of biosecurity practices were 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.090
 rotation of both pediatrics we went to the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.650
 part of adult and surgeries of all kinds 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.220
 but the one we see the most is the neuroses 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.220
 surgeries 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.370
 what 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.370
 you can feel one thing 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.580
 and good guys this is the sector of 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.680
 Ebola this sector is prepared with 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.020
 three units for possible 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.270
 patients who arrive at the hospital with 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.220
 these cases of Ebola every patient that 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.069
 come to Argentina and that has 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.050
 suspicion is the referring hospital that goes 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.640
 to come from ezeiza from where you arrive 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.950
 we have the heliport that you 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.569
 They saw the helicopters coming down 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.550
 directly there is a protocol where 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.040
 enter the patient and they will be in 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.920
 these units we have all the material 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.590
 available that he offered to the ministry 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.660
 and we are already fully trained to 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.280
 wait for the patients the boys 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.110
 they received continuous training in 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.830
 all services and in charge of all 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:18.620
 the coordinators who had rcp that 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.900
 they take the certification from all 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.450
 the courses the truth that for us 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.930
 It was a pleasure to have summoned us all 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.849
 come and receive them 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.739
 in a very interesting way to acquire 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.470
 knowledge because it interacts with 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.930
 several 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.940
 with several fields that 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.150
 that we do not see them in our city 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.120
 it is necessary to do it to carry 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.750
 our province the knowledge that 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.800
 they have the professionals of this city 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.300
 and above all management issues and 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.250
 managements because start to manage 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.670
 to occupy more important places 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.600
 nursing that we saw here initially 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.970
 give a lot of positive fruits for 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.460
 the nursing profession have other 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.370
 visions is very important to know 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.010
 that there is something different and that we can 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.100
 do it in our in our locality 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.260
 with the resources we have and thinking 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.390
 because we know new techniques here 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.700
 then complements these techniques 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.560
 that we already have in our nation 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.380
 institutions 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.350
 our goal was to plan and that 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.639
 you can take all the knowledge that 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.639
 can and that this place 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:45.610
 I think that with my company 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.110
 expectations of the we plan and good 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.230
 and all of the written plan could not be 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.230
