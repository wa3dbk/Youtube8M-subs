00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
down in the south down in the south it's

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.969 
down in the south down in the south it's
more<00:01:51.730> it's<00:01:52.730> more<00:01:52.880> carp<00:01:53.840> fishing<00:01:54.140> pet<00:01:54.619> palette

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
more it's more carp fishing pet palette

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.250 
more it's more carp fishing pet palette
we're<00:01:55.130> go<00:01:55.310> fishing<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:55.940> maybe<00:01:56.479> maybe<00:01:57.020> the

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
we're go fishing and maybe maybe the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.930 
we're go fishing and maybe maybe the
pole<00:01:57.470> shallow<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.100> what<00:01:58.250> have<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:58.400> up<00:01:58.910> there

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
pole shallow and what have you up there

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.540 
pole shallow and what have you up there
it<00:01:59.300> tends<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.660> be<00:01:59.869> more<00:02:00.080> ref<00:02:00.320> ones<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:01.430> know

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
it tends to be more ref ones you know

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.670 
it tends to be more ref ones you know
with<00:02:01.580> carp<00:02:02.300> in<00:02:02.510> amongst<00:02:02.780> them<00:02:03.080> you<00:02:03.260> know<00:02:03.380> so

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
with carp in amongst them you know so

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.040 
with carp in amongst them you know so
this<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.520> slightly<00:02:04.940> different<00:02:05.360> fishing<00:02:05.869> so

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
this is slightly different fishing so

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.830 
this is slightly different fishing so
you<00:02:06.110> have<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:07.160> know<00:02:07.280> there<00:02:07.490> are<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.580> lot

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
you have to you know there are a lot

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.240 
you have to you know there are a lot
there<00:02:08.840> are<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.959> lot<00:02:09.080> harder<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.530> catch<00:02:09.709> at<00:02:09.979> once

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
there are a lot harder to catch at once

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.230 
there are a lot harder to catch at once
so<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:11.300> know<00:02:11.720> it's<00:02:12.520> it's<00:02:13.520> different<00:02:13.790> but<00:02:14.180> it's

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
so you know it's it's different but it's

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.320 
so you know it's it's different but it's
it's<00:02:15.080> exciting<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.640> again<00:02:16.850> if<00:02:17.150> your

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
it's exciting you know and again if your

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.660 
it's exciting you know and again if your
honor<00:02:17.510> if<00:02:17.959> your<00:02:18.200> honor<00:02:18.410> pick<00:02:19.160> with<00:02:19.400> enough

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
honor if your honor pick with enough

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.280 
honor if your honor pick with enough
fish<00:02:19.910> in<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.480> can<00:02:20.600> sort<00:02:20.870> out<00:02:20.990> on<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
fish in it and you can sort out on the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.150 
fish in it and you can sort out on the
day<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.770> know<00:02:21.890> what<00:02:22.520> I<00:02:22.550> did<00:02:22.880> I'm<00:02:24.040> lucky<00:02:25.040> enough

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
day you know what I did I'm lucky enough

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.370 
day you know what I did I'm lucky enough
to<00:02:25.370> be<00:02:25.490> in<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.730> final<00:02:26.060> again<00:02:26.300> when<00:02:26.780> what<00:02:26.959> we<00:02:27.260> do

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
to be in the final again when what we do

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.840 
to be in the final again when what we do
I<00:02:27.730> think<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:29.600> had<00:02:29.690> 113<00:02:30.620> down<00:02:30.950> there<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.700> was

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
I think I had 113 down there it was

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.550 
I think I had 113 down there it was
pretty<00:02:32.000> hard<00:02:32.209> died<00:02:32.480> because<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:33.019> was<00:02:33.140> quite

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
pretty hard died because it was quite

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.800 
pretty hard died because it was quite
windy<00:02:34.480> cold

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.080 

you<00:02:39.140> know<00:02:39.260> i<00:02:39.290> I've<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:40.099> gone<00:02:40.550> there<00:02:40.880> with<00:02:41.060> a

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
you know i I've just gone there with a

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.970 
you know i I've just gone there with a
plan<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.630> fish<00:02:41.840> shallow<00:02:42.050> wherever<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.650> drove

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
plan to fish shallow wherever I drove

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.830 
plan to fish shallow wherever I drove
even<00:02:43.459> if<00:02:43.580> I<00:02:43.670> draw<00:02:43.849> in<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.060> corner<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.480> was<00:02:44.630> just

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
even if I draw in a corner I was just

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.770 
even if I draw in a corner I was just
going<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.080> fish<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.440> coachella<00:02:46.239> I'd<00:02:47.239> practice

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
going to fish the coachella I'd practice

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.660 
going to fish the coachella I'd practice
the<00:02:47.930> day<00:02:48.080> before<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.069> think<00:02:49.130> i<00:02:49.340> salted

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
the day before and I think i salted

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.320 
the day before and I think i salted
something<00:02:50.030> sorted<00:02:50.390> something<00:02:50.720> out<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:52.330> so

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
something sorted something out and so

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.750 
something sorted something out and so
when<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.540> sat<00:02:53.660> on<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.110> box<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.620> day<00:02:54.800> I'd

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
when I sat on the box on the day I'd

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.460 
when I sat on the box on the day I'd
already<00:02:56.060> make<00:02:56.450> my<00:02:56.599> mind<00:02:56.810> up<00:02:56.989> whether<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.349> be

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
already make my mind up whether it be

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.920 
already make my mind up whether it be
right<00:02:57.680> or<00:02:57.709> wrong<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:58.430> do<00:02:58.640> believe<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.450> need<00:02:59.690> to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
right or wrong I do believe you need to

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.990 
right or wrong I do believe you need to
go<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.140> these<00:03:00.380> venues<00:03:00.650> with<00:03:01.040> some<00:03:01.640> sort<00:03:01.910> of

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
go to these venues with some sort of

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.320 
go to these venues with some sort of
plan<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.599> know<00:03:03.610> hope<00:03:04.610> that<00:03:04.849> on<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.090> day<00:03:05.269> you

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
plan you know hope that on the day you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.729 
plan you know hope that on the day you
you<00:03:05.630> know<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.810> might<00:03:06.080> have<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.290> tweak<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.590> a

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
you know you might have to tweak it a

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.470 
you know you might have to tweak it a
little<00:03:06.800> bit<00:03:07.099> here<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:07.459> there<00:03:07.519> but<00:03:07.670> if<00:03:08.330> you
