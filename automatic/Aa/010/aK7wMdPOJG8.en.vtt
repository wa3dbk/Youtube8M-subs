00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.350

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.619

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.710
 neighborhood friends but this is not all 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.100
 this is impossible he was attached to the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.730
 One's skin is an incomparable love to 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.250
 nothing with nothing compares when you 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.710
 you work in the street and I work in the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.500

 I always have my shirt I have 30 40 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.550
 T-shirts is because every time they go 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.020

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.280
 fan of the sick businessman 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.130
 I think like all the fans 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.100

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.100

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.729
 and be so far 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.130
 and see it every now and then is horrible now 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.259
 luckily we have all the technology in 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.560
 internet you can listen to a management of 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.299
 there but I agree when I came 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.580
 I called my mom on the landline 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.530
 cell phones did not exist and I said 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.170

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.720
 listen to two temperley matches like this 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.880
 because it drove me crazy 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.250
 and well this is about light as it is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.290
 listen to a game or know what is 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.520
 playing temple and you are working here 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.250

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.150
 like to score many goals 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.760
 I hope so, because we can not 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.250
 form that category 2 pro of large no 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.700
 can win with tristÃ¡n suÃ¡rez does not have 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.939
 history 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.579
 but this is how you are lucky to see the 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.350
 two ascents in the field of sarmiento 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.409
 the 1 to 1 with the goal of chivas di 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.360
 bastiano and then the fatal night fan 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.429
 that nice for us of the penal 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.580
 that I went to cadaver social party and viana 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.410
 in its spectacular and I want to see it from 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.900
 back I want to see you back first 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.200
 listen to your old man and let him be quick 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.239
 Queme dies and after I leave I'm happy 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.770
 step to shout a goal here in the street of 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.820
 send him shout 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:32.320
 in the cyber that there is where that is 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:35.470
 there next to bryant I was looking through 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.060
 his excellent bearing of a match with the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.060
 headphones on and a scream 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.060
 they realized that they play successfully 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.160
 you will know what I was thinking if I 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.260
 shouts of command wherever it is that I have 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.170
 seen and do I know they look at me but good 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.050
 you know that you to the minute and the sel and 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.270
 why with a very good eye that lasts or not to 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.040
 Sometimes the party does not give him by radio 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.620
 you do not have to get into a binding cyber 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.910
 decide and sometimes after the internet is not 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.450
 all right 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.490
 and scene with 0 has to put those 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.720
 pages that you are putting the goal to goal 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:17.940
 and if the truth without suffering gas state 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.550
 but for a life brought me here by 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.700
 some but he is always 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.220
 with me and so they will close me with the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.170
 strong shirt 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.950
 but I 'm afraid if there's an end we're going 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.340
 sure that that does not fit any longer 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.150
 doubt that the look 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.150
 great
