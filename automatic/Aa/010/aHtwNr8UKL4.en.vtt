00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.160
 the following is the explanation of a 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.320
 real game session so you can 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.070
 contain incomplete instructions and 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.070
 some mistakes 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.150
 after I explained to him that he's still not going 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.720
 to put their monkeys on the board but 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.240
 let's see first how the turn behaves 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.520
 you have three actions the action one is 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.490
 mandatory and that is that you must move a 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.650
 pioneer himself the second action is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.600
 move a first one or place a stone and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.870
 the third action is to move a pioneer or 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.940
 place a stone because and have these 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.129
 three actions unless you can not 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.930
 do all three in case you can not 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.570
 move the first first you have to pass 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.610
 your turn then how do you move the first 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.680
 the first ones can move in 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.780
 any of the six directions in 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.170
 straight line moving forward as much as that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.580
 but a minimum of one space because no 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.010
 you can jump from other pioneers or 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.370
 stones you can not move pioneers that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.229
 are obviously blocked and you can 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.530
 spend several actions in moving the same 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.330
 ask or use them for different first 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.860
 you can not place the first one again 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.580
 in the box where I was in the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.780
 flat turn could you do ibaka 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.420
 no no no not dead 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.360
 how you place stones you can place a 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.430
 or two stones together in pioneer moved the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.159
 Stone must be placed in a space 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.560
 empty do not move first and I can 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:32.590
 place a stone 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.119
 is an action 110 the second with place 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.740
 the stone and the extraction could be 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.350
 place my second stone together pioneer 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.420
 I just saw if you moved two pioneers 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.340
 your third action you can place a 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.080
 stone next to anything because 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.520
 because you can move this first then 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.070
 we can see this first and then that 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.350
 point when I put my stone the third 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.140
 action 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.350
 the points are going to make this way a 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.830
 here we have I think they are 1 2 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.990
 3 4 5 6 7 8 types of terrain a 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.439
 territory is formed when 12 formulas 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.140
 kind of island with with no more than three 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.850
 types of terrain of the eight that there are and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.770
 the river is also considered a type 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.310
 of terrain the player with the most first 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.780
 just the territory points at home 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.520
 partly divide and round towards 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.140
 down and moves the first ones that 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.050
 they were there in the game and the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.650
 parts of the territory are 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.100
 at least 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.100
 3 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.990
 and keep them obviously looks with edges 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.930
 Clear 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.930
 I've had a guy in there 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.270
 I would earn the points 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.739
 against this type of land the points 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.069
 are the amount is easy that in the 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.349
 ground as well as in your boss with two 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.010
 types of terrain only that day space 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.019
 For 2 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.360
 and with a type of terrain in the amount 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.860
 space by three or so the less 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.629
 types of terrain have more points you 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.920
 do you obviously find yourself alone 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.290
 spaces that serve not those that are 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.819
 under new contacts and the game is 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.310
 ends when one of these three occurs 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.569
 things when the whole board is 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.950
 divided the territory already 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.290
 They pointed because the monkeys are going to 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.640
 leave the territories that are created 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.200
 during the last turn comply with 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.780
 normal way 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.569
 the second way is that only one player 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.099
 can move in this case ends 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.379
 immediate if there are no more scores 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.910
 when you can not move is because in 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.099
 the whole crazy shift this death not because 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.420
 the to text thermo no no for death and 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.950
 finally the third way to finish 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.050
 the game is with a player does not have 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.750
 fidelina on the board 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.610
 but that's a rule that is not a 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:51.220
 English version but it was from the 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.220
 original that we said but nice 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.470
 then big territory but also 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.010
 to grab it before the rest is 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.700
 be without hands 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.700
 and 3
