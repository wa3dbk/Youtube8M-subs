00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.639
 how to spend 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:15.379
 there again and again 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.379
 Hello and welcome to the BDA 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:23.009
 the so-called Cathedral of Racing 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.529
 this dangerous pose 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.539
 that was maybe the cathedral, it is now only a small one 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.779
 30 m 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.720
 from these seven kilometers 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.140
 unfortunately I only have 4500 55 meters left 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.540
 that's the curves 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.390
 to get there 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.580
 11 StBerG 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.820
 necessarily only five goals 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.870
 but either way we could just take a closer look 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.150
 van Gaal was still off 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.620
 Here we go 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 Take Paul Scharner 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.390
 the Glarner 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.900
 Father on 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.380
 go to town 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.210
 back in times 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.870
 Werder you have early on the fire one clarified 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.530
 to take away the momentum 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.820
 this one also crushed earth masses 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 although it is hard to brake 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.120
 on fellow citizens the never ending 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.930
 It is very easy to stop old 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.650
 you have to be careful 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.170
 here was my car 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.260
 there you can overtake 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.390
 now the place remains very pathetic now vertex 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 but not before he is in the ARD 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.040
 are when braking 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.770
 that one could still smell this driveway right in the driveway 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.230
 Chicane all black 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.080
 then flip over 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.120
 nice 3 4 liters lowers at that time were 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.860
 so was three days in the roller coaster 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.860
 a third gear totally exaggerates them 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.930
 were speeds across the place 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.970
 He just wanted two courses 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.010
 and below in the second 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.490
 from the RC you do not come here to rest 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.730
 this left preparation 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.849
 an office adapter right here 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.629
 at the end of the track 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.809
 maximum skew 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.809
 Britta gas imports ensures best times 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:20.269
 and accelerate out quite right 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.889
 Benningen right direction 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.109
 the FCR a year ago 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.109
 we are absolutely in the balance 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.859
 Kanguru little Geisberger track 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.079
 200 but I think it needs 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.059
 Oberreitnau Beijing Ghana 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.709
 if that is the most important 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.119
 the roadside destinies here are the races decided 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.609
 There are also many talents here 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.739
 Out in the mouth and BMW 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.019
 and that was more like Aasen 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.119
 only German expected so they remained calm 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:56.199
 but the old times 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:59.049
 everyday life was very special 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.539
 I wish a lot of fun here was the DAX DAX ETR 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:02.649
 who are all afraid?
