00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:18.080
 we continue with the work of the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:18.080
 mustache rotating the blues 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.630
 look do not do anything you'll find 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.230
 as we draw a circle from 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.230
 Breast 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.899
 this movement has already been used to 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.629
 warming 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.300
 it is important to immobilize the pool 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.559
 so that the rotation is well at 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.440
 chest level 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.829
 you must have the feeling that the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.280
 move away from the inside think about 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.860
 well push the chest to the side 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.860
 in front of the other side and behind without 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.440
 dig your back then you will go down 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.190
 your arms in order to work only 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.190
 the bust 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.720
 do not forget to immobilize your 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.720
 shoulders 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.970
 and 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.990
 dominique of the chandelier 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.220
 you are right 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.680
 you will help yourself alternately 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.960
 each arm to let go of your 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.750
 bust and describe 1.8 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.510
 afterwards you can leave the 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.900
 arm fall in order to make work the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.630
 bust alone thinking about not using your 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.680
 shoulders and let go of the bust 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.080
 on each side from top to bottom 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.970
 have the feeling of drawing at 8 with 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.970
 your bust from top to bottom 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.840
 m 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.410
 and 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:45.919
 the camel with the doubs standing 

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:46.490
 perpendicular to the mirror the right foot 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.619
 in front of 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.089
 we push the must as if we are 

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:52.659
 leans and at his window 

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:55.909
 we raise the chest upwards to the top 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:57.309
 by inspiring and relaxing by returning to 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:59.960
 its initial position 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:02.330
 be careful not to dig the back of 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.529
 way not to say 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:10.719
 think about working well with the 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:16.520
 inch chest rides up and release 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:20.930
 inches goes up and relax French well 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:24.249
 connect the top three points up and 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.249
 return to the initial position 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.590
 I show my chest up 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.200
 and I come back from an initial position 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.610
 think about drawing a Serb from the bottom to 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:42.680
 the top of the front to the back redhead 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.389
 where you are better off 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.910
 at first gave way with the 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.440
 head then you try to stabilize 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.360
 the head 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.360
 and only work with the chest 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.670
 he 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:00.680
 think well inspired 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:00.680
 and expires release 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.720
 and
