00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 hello, my friends, I want you to write 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.510
 please and watch the whole video 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.260
 if friend of the past you will be told that 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.240
 someday I would be underwater surrounded 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.260
 of sharks in a tank in australia 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.260
 I would never believe it 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.060
 When you get to the place they put a video with you 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.740
 the shark music the movie in the 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.180
 which explains the rules and things that 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.180
 you must not do to survive 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.990
 if it is a controlled environment and they are not 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.090
 the most dangerous sharks in the world 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.500
 but for me it is one of the most 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.500
 great things that I've done in my life 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.800
 yes 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.800
 yes 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.470
 by overcoming these fears once being 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.470
 there you feel an immense peace 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.469
 ah 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.850
 plus 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.920
 I think it was a good way to 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.450
 say goodbye to that continent that was my 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.450
 last day in australia 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.840
 Wow 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.170
 it's hard to believe that a place can be 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.420
 return as your home in just a couple 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.880
 of months but it is possible that after a 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.830
 life you have people there somewhere 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.840
 favorite to party your food 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.390
 favorite a place where you're going to do the 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.580
 pantry everything is there and that makes a 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.590
 place to go back to your house 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.590
 there are also surprises everywhere 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.290
 when leaving the sanctuary of the sharks 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.569
 We went to the beach to eat where 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.590
 ironically they brought people water 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.590
 because there were sharks 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.790
 I wish if I could say goodbye to all 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.980
 the cities I've been in a boat 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.360
 with an unforgettable sunset with the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.190
 people with whom I passed the best 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.800
 moments friends 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.400
 so he fired me without them seeing 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.400
 perfect 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.650
 m 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.800
 for the sake of not 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.200
 good 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.980
 hawas 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.170
 while less time we have in a 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.630
 place more we worry about meeting 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.430
 the things we want to do so 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.460
 during those minutes that I had left 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.460
 I went up to the bridge and I said goodbye to the view 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.360
 plus 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.510
 write it 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.960
 when advancing
