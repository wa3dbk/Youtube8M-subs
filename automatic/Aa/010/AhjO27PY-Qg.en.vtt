00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:08.650
So I just wanted to take a
moment to say a few things.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.800
First, that being on "Dance
Showdown" has been such an

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.260
amazing learning experience
for me.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.660
And I am so very proud of myself
and everybody else who

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.110
participated, because
we worked so hard.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.020
And I watched everybody's
routine and everybody worked

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.550
really hard.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.476
Execution was on point, and we
did all so well, and I'm so

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:29.240
proud of everyone.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.080
So, congratulations
to everybody.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.850
I'm really proud
of myself too.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.950
And something it taught me about
myself is that I am a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.730
hard worker.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.680
Not that I didn't know that
before, but that also if I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.710
think that I've reached my limit
that I really haven't,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.230
because literally
by hour three of

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.370
rehearsals, I was spent.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.990
I was like, Anze, I
am not a dancer.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.920
I don't dance like this on the
regular, and we pushed

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.710
ourselves for another
five hours.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.430
So, I'm a very dedicated person,
and I hold myself very

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.340
accountable.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.680
And so, yeah, I'm proud of
myself, and this has been

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.230
truly, truly amazing.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.670
What I have to say about my
dance partner, Anze, is that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.830
he is brilliant.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.400
And I just want to say thank
you to him for pushing me

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.530
every day and for being a great
dancer and having that

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.960
reflect on me.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.780
Hopefully, I made him look good
too, because he made me

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.250
look amazing.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.470
I wouldn't have chose any other
dance partner, although

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.880
everybody's dance partner
was great.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.810
I got to meet most of them,
all of them actually.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.135
I just want to say I guess the
most exciting part about all

00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:32.010
of this was the things
that you guys didn't

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.960
get to see on camera.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.800
It was the interactions
between us

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.860
and our dance partners.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.920
It was the rehearsals.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.030
Blood, sweat, and tears.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.580
OK, maybe not the blood part,
but definitely the sweat and

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.980
tears went into this.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.530
And I'm sure I can speak for
everybody when I say that

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.090
we're all so very
proud of this.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.480
And I just want to take time to
say thank you to all of you

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.420
who took time to vote for me and
everybody else every day.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.390
It was a very grueling
process.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.580
I uploaded a video every
day to my channel to

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.760
remind people to vote.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.730
And so those of you who shared
my video, and who liked it,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.750
and who told people
about it, and who

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.370
shared my story on Facebook--

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.710
Holly [INAUDIBLE], I love you.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.130
She was like one of my hugest
supporters, and she's

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.880
fantastic, and she has
no reason to be.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.870
We know each other through
YouTube, but I've never

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.250
actually met her in real life.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.090
So, girl we got to get together
for some tea and some

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.065
chatting, and I love you and
thank you so much to you and

00:02:26.065 --> 00:02:27.570
to everybody who supported me.
