00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.070
 I'm bringing you the game of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.080
 holbox called reality fireworks are the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.480
 fireworks are more real than 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.699
 I found the blocks to see if they already 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.769
 previous video uefs a special year 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.760
 accompanied it is in the description of this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.680
 video I 'll explain why it's not to do 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.050
 A video alone is just to explain 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.489
 about this game telling that a lot of people 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 asked me 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.660
 come on then this game is not 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.910
 only I basically observe this view 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.399
 which is wonderful guy under the buildings 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.739
 They are very real and very colorful too. 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.710
 This leaves the party a bit more. 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.140
 dynamic is not even better in our 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.719
 goal is not only to observe these fires 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.329
 that are bursting here there is a gentle up 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.520
 what a pleasant sound is that story 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.350
 you already well gross nabuco joaquim 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.910
 Our goal is basically this guys 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.100
 We have to fly, you can see that 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.729
 here in the playlist the list of players 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.439
 here in the play was added number one is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.229

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:19.530
 ie has a flight here gran finale 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:21.299
 she will explain what is also what 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.420
 It would be if I go basically we have to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.570
 fight on some of the fireworks 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.509
 let's get there and almost a year later he 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.159

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.420
 get the points to buy here in 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.240

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.689
 we buy sports there if the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.030
 what is expensive is that the block if glue is what is 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.310
 one a block coolant 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.799
 here is a chicoil group that is a super 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.829
 I hop that it costs ten flights 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.549
 here the two flights and here the laser gum 15 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.049

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.610
 buy these items here and play if he 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.649
 it's a bit simple a bit modest but 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.409
 it is also very fun the place that the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.899
 owner built here an island all green 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.780
 Was this review helpful? 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.460
 blocks is just to see a block just to the ground 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.190
 and 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.660
 the blocks here from the mountains and our 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.700
 This guy's objective is you can see that 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.310
 I'm playing with more players and we 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.830

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.260
