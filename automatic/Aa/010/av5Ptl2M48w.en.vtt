fury ex are still in this card same fury
chipset<00:01:42.420> same<00:01:43.079> everything<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.040> only<00:01:44.220> thing

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
chipset same everything the only thing

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.280 
chipset same everything the only thing
to<00:01:44.490> do<00:01:44.549> between<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.030> card<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.200> is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
to do between this card and now it is

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.380 
to do between this card and now it is
that<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.590> air-cooled<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.640> smaller<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that it's air-cooled it's smaller and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.539 
that it's air-cooled it's smaller and
it's<00:01:48.810> clocked<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.439> bit<00:01:49.920> lower<00:01:50.220> now

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it's clocked a little bit lower now

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.950 
it's clocked a little bit lower now
another<00:01:51.149> thing<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.720> are<00:01:51.750> going<00:01:51.869> to

another thing out if you are going to
say<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.250> overclocking<00:01:53.250> yeah<00:01:53.399> AMD

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
say is overclocking yeah AMD

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.580 
say is overclocking yeah AMD
specifically<00:01:54.600> said<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.110> video<00:01:55.290> that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.260 
specifically said in this video that
this<00:01:55.710> card<00:01:55.950> was<00:01:56.100> really<00:01:56.520> not<00:01:56.759> geared<00:01:57.060> for

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
this card was really not geared for

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630 
this card was really not geared for
overclocking<00:01:57.719> whatsoever<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.310> is

geared<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.270> low<00:02:00.390> power<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.200> run

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
geared for low power is to run

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.920 
geared for low power is to run
completely<00:02:02.040> silent<00:02:02.909> they're<00:02:03.420> claiming<00:02:03.689> this
