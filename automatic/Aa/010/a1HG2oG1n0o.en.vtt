 low fried plantains and and beans 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.549
 today then what is known 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.829
 normally as light male banana if 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.740

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.789
 delicious as they do not here to 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.369
 warm up engines excellent idea clear 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.439
 what good energy do we need to 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.740
 make them wrong emit oil to fry in 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:57.340
 normal oil we are going to put creampie 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.890
 from anyone and that he cited and those 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.049
 traditional refried beans that 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.459
 you here usually do blacks 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.649
 not if we make blacks here in 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.780
 Vera Cruz can be done with a bath or 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.989
 any kind of peak that it's from your 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.330
 I like good, no more, let's see 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.069
 how do you prepare it maleni we cut you the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.249
 two points to the bananas 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.249
 this quickie if you see them 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.829
 and we already have our oil here 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.049
 we start in two or we start like this in three 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:36.459
 normal so that it goes faster happens to 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.459
 good they split in three 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.610
 pure potassium wrong in and it's clear that if 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.740
 We will give it back if we wait for a 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.959
 little bit so let's try to put it 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.810
 enough oil to cool them like that 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.459
 tasty nice that and we're going to try to 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.470
 give it only two rounds to not 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.630
 be clear there and not risk 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.819
 we burn that is the most important thing because 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.340
 anyone can do it and then more 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.890
 we let them brown a little more hey 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.569
 maleni is and while well the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.310
 most of the people know how to make some 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.620
 refried beans but you how 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.890
 recommend you put them like tuna 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:17.280
 of us we season it with butter 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.989
 onion and this one we refer to and type 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.050
 old grandma with the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.700
 grinder well until they dry boil 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.650
 jr seitan tickets these are the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.959
 traditional liqueurs of beautiful color 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.700
 dry men and good a fact here 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.980
 important that is going wrong with us 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.709
 ita is the use of butter all that 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.230
 obviously the taste changes 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.880
 the color to use nothing else clear oil 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.900
 that if then it gives a flavor more this one 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.310
 home more lighter rancher original 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.890
 Well, here are waiting for the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.660
 beans to be ready the dish 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.300
 We are seeing that the platanitos 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.950
 they are taking a golden color aha when 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.110

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.410
 I invite you to walk, turn and turn 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.240
 clear wait long enough for me 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.960

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.780
 that I crave clear and delicious male what 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.310
 way to start the day with you 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.170
 little shirt tell me nothing more 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.410
 this is customary in veracruz no 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.850
 very traditional veracruz and here one 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.130
 find the male banana where 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.470
 want but really across the country in 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.410
 the supermarket in the markets the water 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.030
 it is not clear that yes and they burn very 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.960
 can be this for start of 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.680
 open appetite 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.600
 final or dessert because yes we can 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.060
 do nothing else with the cream and the cheese and 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.890
 we in record if there is something 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.870
 interesting that from the last time that 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.960
 we were with maleni is this and 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.350
 we remember is how do you combine 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.569
 between the sweet with what yes and the 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.090
 so great creativity that has that 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.550
 As you see, you tell me and I eat bread from the plate 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.819

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.099

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:11.820
 drain to drain for us 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.160
 carry in excess of clear fat 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.950
 many people do not like to go bananas 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.540
 because they burn because they do 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.760
 turn and flip the banana and you saw that 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.740
 nothing more than two turns ready comes out 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.310
 quickie you want to put the best here and not 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.800
 This does not burn you or anything but we can 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.780
 put it like that once you put a lot 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.030
 attention in the creativity that they have 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.410
