the<00:02:18.540> game<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.050> know<00:02:19.200> what<00:02:19.920> Tim<00:02:20.280> want<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.550> test

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
the game you know what Tim want to test

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.660 
the game you know what Tim want to test
results<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:21.780> get<00:02:22.260> from<00:02:22.800> game<00:02:23.160> against

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
results you can get from game against

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.180 
results you can get from game against
bolts<00:02:24.030> nothing<00:02:24.569> from<00:02:25.290> my<00:02:25.410> perspective<00:02:25.709> and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
bolts nothing from my perspective and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.800 
bolts nothing from my perspective and
it's<00:02:26.670> stupid<00:02:27.120> because<00:02:27.269> they<00:02:27.540> are<00:02:27.629> just

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
it's stupid because they are just

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.089 
it's stupid because they are just
blocking<00:02:28.940> right<00:02:29.940> now<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.150> servers<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.980> I

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
blocking right now the servers and I

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.210 
blocking right now the servers and I
waited<00:02:32.430> one<00:02:32.610> hour<00:02:32.760> on<00:02:32.910> meeting<00:02:33.330> 40<00:02:33.690> minutes<00:02:33.930> I

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
waited one hour on meeting 40 minutes I

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.449 
waited one hour on meeting 40 minutes I
think<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.640> simply<00:02:36.299> won't<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.900> up<00:02:37.049> I<00:02:37.459> think

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
think that it simply won't be up I think

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.039 
think that it simply won't be up I think
the<00:02:38.549> priority<00:02:39.209> actually<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.170> them<00:02:40.410> or

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
the priority actually is for them or

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.180 
the priority actually is for them or
it's<00:02:43.049> not<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.410> matchmaking<00:02:43.830> how<00:02:44.040> much

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
it's not just matchmaking how much

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.520 
it's not just matchmaking how much
making<00:02:44.489> against<00:02:44.640> people<00:02:45.120> but<00:02:45.349> same<00:02:46.349> can

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
making against people but same can

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.990 
making against people but same can
happen<00:02:46.560> when<00:02:46.980> image-making<00:02:47.400> just<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.819> create

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
happen when image-making just to create

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.940 
happen when image-making just to create
the<00:02:48.209> Lord<00:02:48.450> where<00:02:48.750> your<00:02:49.019> game<00:02:49.290> basically<00:02:49.709> just

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the Lord where your game basically just

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.370 
the Lord where your game basically just
for<00:02:50.400> playing<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.060> practice<00:02:51.420> mode<00:02:51.630> it's<00:02:52.079> still

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
for playing the practice mode it's still

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.509 
for playing the practice mode it's still
like<00:02:52.590> finally<00:02:53.220> finding<00:02:53.549> servers<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:55.519> so

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
like finally finding servers and so

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.250 
like finally finding servers and so
there's<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.790> priority<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.569> people<00:02:57.989> like<00:02:58.140> you

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
there's a priority of people like you

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.699 
there's a priority of people like you
know<00:02:58.379> maybe<00:02:58.620> can<00:02:58.829> be<00:02:58.950> 50<00:02:59.790> people<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.269> are

the real game because as you can see
starts<00:03:22.829> in<00:03:23.069> I<00:03:23.430> mean<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.569> priority<00:03:25.170> is

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
starts in I mean the priority is

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.410 
starts in I mean the priority is
definitely<00:03:25.859> for<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.340> practice<00:03:26.970> mode<00:03:27.209> which

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
definitely for the practice mode which

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.699 
definitely for the practice mode which
is<00:03:27.569> weird<00:03:28.400> very<00:03:29.400> strange<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:30.349> don't<00:03:31.349> agree<00:03:31.560> with

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
is weird very strange I don't agree with

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.229 
is weird very strange I don't agree with
that<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:34.310> don't<00:03:35.310> even<00:03:35.579> let<00:03:35.730> me<00:03:35.880> start<00:03:36.180> with

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
that and don't even let me start with

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.740 
that and don't even let me start with
the<00:03:36.950> okay<00:03:37.950> it's<00:03:38.400> actually<00:03:38.549> pre<00:03:39.000> game<00:03:39.239> but<00:03:39.510> as

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
the okay it's actually pre game but as

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.370 
the okay it's actually pre game but as
you<00:03:40.260> can<00:03:40.349> see<00:03:41.329> pregame<00:03:42.329> pregame<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:43.019> think

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
you can see pregame pregame I think

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.039 
you can see pregame pregame I think
people<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:44.299> feeling<00:03:45.299> because<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.660> pregame<00:03:46.019> is

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
people I feeling because the pregame is

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.319 
people I feeling because the pregame is
there<00:03:46.319> alive<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:46.769> 10<00:03:46.980> minutes<00:03:47.160> I<00:03:47.400> looked<00:03:47.669> they

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
there alive for 10 minutes I looked they

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.750 
there alive for 10 minutes I looked they
are<00:03:48.540> just<00:03:48.720> blocking<00:03:49.169> those<00:03:49.590> servers<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.489> it's

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
are just blocking those servers and it's

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.879 
are just blocking those servers and it's
not<00:03:50.940> kicking<00:03:51.329> them<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.480> don't<00:03:55.470> think<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.739> was

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
not kicking them so I don't think it was

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.500 
not kicking them so I don't think it was
good<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.250> good<00:03:56.370> choice<00:03:56.609> for<00:03:56.639> the<00:03:56.940> test<00:03:57.209> test

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
good to good choice for the test test

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.629 
good to good choice for the test test
version<00:03:57.959> right<00:03:58.079> now<00:03:58.139> it's<00:03:58.590> completely

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
version right now it's completely

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.129 
version right now it's completely
up<00:03:59.880> nobody<00:04:00.510> can<00:04:00.690> play<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:02.780> don't<00:04:03.780> think<00:04:03.840> they

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
up nobody can play it I don't think they

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.930 
up nobody can play it I don't think they
meant<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.799> like<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.340> practice<00:04:05.760> more

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
meant it like for the practice more

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.930 
meant it like for the practice more
