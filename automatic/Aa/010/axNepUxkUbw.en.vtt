will work in the back and not hit on the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.199 
will work in the back and not hit on the
engine<00:03:08.790> case<00:03:09.000> or<00:03:09.239> anything<00:03:09.650> I'm<00:03:10.650> just<00:03:11.209> if

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
engine case or anything I'm just if

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.150 
engine case or anything I'm just if
anyone<00:03:12.510> knows<00:03:12.840> if<00:03:13.080> it'll<00:03:13.230> work<00:03:13.350> or<00:03:13.709> not

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
anyone knows if it'll work or not

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.920 
anyone knows if it'll work or not
all<00:03:14.820> right<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.120> don't<00:03:15.390> want<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.570> do<00:03:15.690> all<00:03:15.840> the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
all right I don't want to do all the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.170 
all right I don't want to do all the
lettering<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.500> then<00:03:16.880> have<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.000> damn<00:03:18.150> thing

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
lettering and then have the damn thing

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.930 
lettering and then have the damn thing
not<00:03:18.600> fit<00:03:18.870> because<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:20.220> engine<00:03:20.640> you<00:03:20.820> know

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
not fit because it the engine you know

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.820 
not fit because it the engine you know
the<00:03:21.120> engine<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.630> transmission<00:03:21.780> are<00:03:22.470> l1

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
the engine and the transmission are l1

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.570 
the engine and the transmission are l1
and<00:03:24.380> there's<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.440> lot<00:03:25.680> not<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.920> lot<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.250> clearance

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
and there's a lot not a lot of clearance

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:35.510 
and there's a lot not a lot of clearance
between<00:03:26.700> there<00:03:27.739> between<00:03:28.739> the

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.640 

between<00:03:36.330> them<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.780> can<00:03:36.840> see<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.260> difference

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
between them you can see the difference

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
between them you can see the difference
of<00:03:37.800> size<00:03:37.980> right<00:03:38.310> there<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:39.330> here<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:41.280> can<00:03:41.430> see

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
of size right there and here you can see

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.530 
of size right there and here you can see
where<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:43.590> stands<00:03:43.980> about<00:03:44.280> an<00:03:44.490> inch<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.360> I

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
where it stands about an inch and I

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.280 
where it stands about an inch and I
don't<00:03:45.600> know<00:03:46.040> an<00:03:47.040> inch<00:03:47.640> taller<00:03:48.000> it'd<00:03:48.990> be<00:03:49.140> great

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
don't know an inch taller it'd be great

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.830 
don't know an inch taller it'd be great
if<00:03:49.380> it'll<00:03:49.590> fit<00:03:50.390> but<00:03:51.390> I'm<00:03:51.510> just<00:03:51.660> worried<00:03:52.080> it<00:03:53.840> it

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
if it'll fit but I'm just worried it it

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.520 
if it'll fit but I'm just worried it it
it<00:03:55.610> may<00:03:56.610> not<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:57.750> know<00:03:57.780> I'd<00:03:57.990> really<00:03:58.380> feel

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
it may not you know I'd really feel

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.340 
it may not you know I'd really feel
better<00:03:58.890> with<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.130> larger<00:04:00.000> tire<00:04:00.240> like<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:03.350> if

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
better with a larger tire like that if

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.290 
better with a larger tire like that if
I'm<00:04:04.560> doing<00:04:04.890> up<00:04:05.010> to<00:04:05.100> 70<00:04:05.430> miles<00:04:05.580> an<00:04:05.790> hour<00:04:05.940> I

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
I'm doing up to 70 miles an hour I

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.570 
I'm doing up to 70 miles an hour I
really<00:04:07.050> would

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
really would

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.040 
really would
so<00:04:08.580> I'm<00:04:08.790> hoping<00:04:09.210> that<00:04:09.420> it<00:04:09.690> will<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:12.390> will<00:04:12.630> fit<00:04:12.870> I

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
so I'm hoping that it will it will fit I

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.690 
so I'm hoping that it will it will fit I
know<00:04:13.170> it'll<00:04:13.410> fit<00:04:13.590> on<00:04:13.710> the<00:04:13.800> rim<00:04:13.980> perfect<00:04:14.520> but<00:04:14.670> I

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
know it'll fit on the rim perfect but I

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.130 
know it'll fit on the rim perfect but I
just<00:04:15.000> don't<00:04:15.210> know<00:04:15.420> if<00:04:15.570> it'll<00:04:15.720> clear<00:04:16.170> the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
just don't know if it'll clear the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.420 
just don't know if it'll clear the
engine<00:04:19.140> case<00:04:19.380> because<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:21.270> tire<00:04:21.600> will

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
engine case because the this tire will

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.700 
engine case because the this tire will
can<00:04:23.430> hit<00:04:24.680> very<00:04:25.680> close<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.490> back<00:04:26.730> of<00:04:27.000> the

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
can hit very close to the back of the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.340 
can hit very close to the back of the
cylinder<00:04:28.710> where<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.700> cylinder<00:04:30.060> goes<00:04:31.020> into

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
cylinder where the cylinder goes into

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.400 
cylinder where the cylinder goes into
the<00:04:31.500> engine<00:04:33.740> so<00:04:34.820> hopefully<00:04:35.820> it'll<00:04:35.970> work<00:04:36.410> I'm

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
the engine so hopefully it'll work I'm

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.140 
the engine so hopefully it'll work I'm
gonna<00:04:37.740> have<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:37.980> go<00:04:38.070> over<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.370> go<00:04:38.940> over<00:04:39.060> the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
gonna have to go over and go over the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.060 
gonna have to go over and go over the
shop<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.540> look<00:04:41.060> okay
