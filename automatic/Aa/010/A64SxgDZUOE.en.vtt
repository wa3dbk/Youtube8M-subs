00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
something on the beta there's some like

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.160 
something on the beta there's some like
small<00:01:29.729> poll<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.630> no<00:01:30.840> one<00:01:30.990> knew<00:01:31.140> about

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
or something and I guess they're

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.780 
or something and I guess they're
implementing<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.320> tomorrow<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.750> don't<00:01:36.750> know

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
implementing it tomorrow so I don't know

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.640 
implementing it tomorrow so I don't know
I<00:01:38.790> don't<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.840> honestly<00:01:40.350> gonna<00:01:40.470> be

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
I don't think it's honestly gonna be

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.580 
I don't think it's honestly gonna be
good<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.040> inscape<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:42.229> people<00:01:43.229> don't

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
good for inscape because people don't

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.560 
good for inscape because people don't

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
analogy I saw on a video that I watched

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.380 
analogy I saw on a video that I watched
about<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.540> old-school<00:01:49.320> RS<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.790> person<00:01:51.180> said

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
that

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.639 
that
people<00:01:53.970> don't<00:01:54.240> play<00:01:54.420> minecraft<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> good

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
people don't play minecraft for the good

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.090 
people don't play minecraft for the good
graphics<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:57.720> fucking<00:01:58.229> stellar<00:01:58.619> or

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
graphics and the fucking stellar or

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.800

basically<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> good<00:01:59.970> graphics<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.689> stuff

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
basically the good graphics and stuff

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.539 
basically the good graphics and stuff
they<00:02:00.930> play<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.530> fun<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.520> is

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
they play it because it's fun which is

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.280 
they play it because it's fun which is
basically<00:02:03.210> like<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.600> same<00:02:03.840> thing<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
basically like the same thing that

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.719 
basically like the same thing that
applies<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.680> runescape<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.130> people<00:02:05.580> don't

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
applies to runescape like people don't

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
no idea what I'm talking about but it

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.890 
no idea what I'm talking about but it
really<00:05:28.669> kind<00:05:28.910> of<00:05:28.940> bums<00:05:29.150> me<00:05:29.270> out

you<00:05:30.050> know<00:05:30.140> but<00:05:30.890> maybe<00:05:31.160> it'll<00:05:31.460> be<00:05:31.550> good<00:05:31.580> for<00:05:31.730> the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
you know but maybe it'll be good for the

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.210 
you know but maybe it'll be good for the
game<00:05:32.090> but<00:05:32.270> I<00:05:32.330> doubt<00:05:32.390> it<00:05:32.780> because<00:05:33.080> this<00:05:33.890> game

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
game but I doubt it because this game

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.930 
game but I doubt it because this game
has<00:05:34.250> undergone<00:05:35.030> so<00:05:35.510> many<00:05:35.720> changes<00:05:35.990> and

has undergone so many changes and

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.190 
has undergone so many changes and
inconsistency<00:05:37.940> it<00:05:38.180> just<00:05:38.390> it<00:05:38.660> makes<00:05:38.930> people

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
inconsistency it just it makes people

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.010 
inconsistency it just it makes people
not<00:05:39.530> want<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:39.830> play<00:05:40.040> when<00:05:40.970> someone<00:05:41.000> is<00:05:41.660> like

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
not want to play when someone is like

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.200 
not want to play when someone is like
straight<00:05:42.440> forward<00:05:42.800> with<00:05:42.890> a<00:05:42.950> game<00:05:43.220> from<00:05:43.880> start

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
straight forward with a game from start

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.409 
straight forward with a game from start
to<00:05:44.390> finish<00:05:44.419> it<00:05:45.110> it<00:05:45.680> makes<00:05:46.460> a<00:05:46.610> player<00:05:46.820> base<00:05:47.090> for

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
to finish it it makes a player base for

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.120 
to finish it it makes a player base for
it<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:47.900> want<00:05:48.080> to<00:05:48.169> do<00:05:48.320> that<00:05:48.590> kind<00:05:48.919> of<00:05:48.950> thing

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
it that want to do that kind of thing

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.620 
it that want to do that kind of thing
that's<00:05:49.250> on<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:49.550> game<00:05:49.700> so<00:05:49.910> if<00:05:50.000> they<00:05:50.120> change<00:05:50.390> it

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
that's on the game so if they change it

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.060 
that's on the game so if they change it
it<00:05:50.810> makes<00:05:50.990> people<00:05:51.169> not<00:05:51.470> want<00:05:51.680> to<00:05:51.770> play<00:05:51.919> it

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
it makes people not want to play it

it makes people not want to play it

for the evolution of combat you know and

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.250 
for the evolution of combat you know and
I<00:05:57.980> barely<00:05:58.790> played<00:05:59.060> the<00:05:59.210> beta<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.750> played<00:05:59.990> it<00:06:00.140> for

I barely played the beta I played it for

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.230 
I barely played the beta I played it for
a<00:06:00.290> little<00:06:00.410> bit<00:06:00.530> on<00:06:00.950> my<00:06:01.370> friend's<00:06:01.669> account<00:06:01.760> when

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
a little bit on my friend's account when

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.150 
a little bit on my friend's account when
it<00:06:02.419> first<00:06:02.600> came<00:06:02.840> out<00:06:02.900> because<00:06:03.590> I<00:06:03.800> didn't<00:06:04.070> have

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
it first came out because I didn't have

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.800 
it first came out because I didn't have
access<00:06:04.340> to<00:06:04.730> it<00:06:04.820> on<00:06:04.850> any<00:06:05.030> of<00:06:05.180> my<00:06:05.270> accounts<00:06:05.690> for

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 
some reason but I think it was because I

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.360 
some reason but I think it was because I
wasn't<00:06:09.020> didn't<00:06:09.410> have<00:06:09.500> membership<00:06:09.890> for<00:06:10.040> like<00:06:10.130> 6

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
months or whatever the hell it was but I

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.620 
months or whatever the hell it was but I
don't<00:06:13.130> know<00:06:13.280> it<00:06:13.669> looks<00:06:13.970> like<00:06:14.150> way<00:06:14.300> too<00:06:14.360> much

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
don't know it looks like way too much

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.560 
don't know it looks like way too much

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 
way too much effort like Peking looks

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.129 
way too much effort like Peking looks
kind<00:06:22.849> of<00:06:22.910> cool<00:06:23.090> because<00:06:23.300> you<00:06:23.509> can<00:06:23.690> like<00:06:23.840> nuke

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830

guess<00:06:28.099> but<00:06:28.599> you<00:06:29.599> know<00:06:29.690> it<00:06:29.900> still<00:06:30.110> gets<00:06:30.380> back<00:06:30.620> to

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
guess but you know it still gets back to

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.540 
guess but you know it still gets back to
it's<00:06:31.520> not<00:06:31.759> the<00:06:31.880> same<00:06:32.090> like<00:06:32.449> game<00:06:32.750> so<00:06:33.440> that's<00:06:34.400> my
