him<00:00:48.559> up<00:00:48.650> back<00:00:48.890> here<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:51.940> I'll<00:00:52.940> pull<00:00:53.270> ooh<00:00:53.510> this

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.430 

more<00:00:59.510> goop<00:00:59.920> now<00:01:00.920> goop<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.280> strong<00:01:01.610> but<00:01:02.440> that

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
more goop now goop is strong but that

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.049 
more goop now goop is strong but that
would<00:01:03.559> be<00:01:03.650> way<00:01:03.890> too<00:01:03.920> long<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.550> leap<00:01:04.729> or<00:01:04.879> arm

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
would be way too long of a leap or arm

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.600 
would be way too long of a leap or arm
for<00:01:05.360> goop<00:01:05.510> so<00:01:06.080> what<00:01:06.229> I'll<00:01:06.320> probably<00:01:06.350> do<00:01:06.800> is<00:01:07.220> let

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
for goop so what I'll probably do is let

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.190 
for goop so what I'll probably do is let
that<00:01:07.760> sit<00:01:07.970> for<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.150> little<00:01:08.240> bit<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.720> screw

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
that sit for a little bit in screw

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.149 
that sit for a little bit in screw
little<00:01:10.190> strap<00:01:10.640> on<00:01:11.060> here<00:01:11.690> so<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:12.680> ball<00:01:13.130> thing
