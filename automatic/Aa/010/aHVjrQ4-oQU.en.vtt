what I'm working on basically my my moto
became<00:00:18.930> just<00:00:19.199> kind<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.529> died<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:19.859> me<00:00:20.010> when<00:00:20.160> I

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
became just kind of died on me when I

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.790 
became just kind of died on me when I
was<00:00:20.369> riding<00:00:20.640> one<00:00:20.789> day<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.590> had<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> lot<00:00:22.769> of

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
was riding one day and had a lot of

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.710 
was riding one day and had a lot of
trouble<00:00:23.130> getting<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.400> started<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.150> stuff<00:00:24.420> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
trouble getting it started and stuff and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.500 
trouble getting it started and stuff and
it's<00:00:25.410> kind<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.650> confusing<00:00:25.800> cuz<00:00:26.460> right<00:00:27.330> around

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
it's kind of confusing cuz right around

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.720 
it's kind of confusing cuz right around
the<00:00:27.689> time<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.900> died<00:00:28.260> was<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> same<00:00:29.010> time<00:00:29.310> I

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the time that died was the same time I

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.810 
the time that died was the same time I
put<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> new<00:00:30.869> CDI<00:00:31.230> unit<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.369> thought

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
put a new CDI unit on it so I thought

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.229 
put a new CDI unit on it so I thought
you<00:00:33.300> know<00:00:33.390> maybe<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.719> was<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.760> dead<00:00:35.760> cert<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.149> it

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you know maybe it was a dead cert and it

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.540 
you know maybe it was a dead cert and it
was<00:00:36.360> something<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.320> CDI<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
was something to do with the CDI but I

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.119 
was something to do with the CDI but I
had<00:00:39.090> good<00:00:39.270> spark<00:00:39.540> set<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> timing<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.829> bunch<00:00:41.010> of

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
had good spark set the timing a bunch of

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.220 
had good spark set the timing a bunch of
bunch<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.210> times<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.719> still<00:00:43.500> no<00:00:43.620> luck<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:45.230> so

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
bunch of times and still no luck but so

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.569 
bunch of times and still no luck but so
I<00:00:46.260> ended<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.649> carrying<00:00:46.829> everything<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.309> apart

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
I ended up carrying everything in apart

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.150 
I ended up carrying everything in apart
and<00:00:47.850> here's<00:00:48.809> kind<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> found<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.829> but

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and here's kind of what I found out but

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.430 
and here's kind of what I found out but
I<00:00:50.430> thought<00:00:50.879> it'd<00:00:50.969> be<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.090> good<00:00:51.180> time<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.600> talk<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I thought it'd be a good time to talk a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010 
I thought it'd be a good time to talk a
little<00:00:52.680> bit<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.210> how<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> compressors<00:00:54.840> work

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
little bit on how the compressors work

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.599 
little bit on how the compressors work
and<00:00:55.199> stuff<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.640> starters<00:00:58.609> I'll

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
and stuff like that so for starters I'll

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.709 
and stuff like that so for starters I'll
just<00:00:59.730> kind<00:00:59.910> of<00:00:59.940> show<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> D

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
just kind of show you how the D

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.209 
just kind of show you how the D
compressor<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> moto<00:01:01.500> B<00:01:01.649> cane<00:01:01.800> works<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
compressor on a moto B cane works and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.340 
compressor on a moto B cane works and
that<00:01:02.309> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.550> works<00:01:02.699> into<00:01:03.090> what<00:01:03.960> was<00:01:04.110> wrong

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that kind of works into what was wrong

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.000 
that kind of works into what was wrong
with<00:01:04.949> my<00:01:05.549> machine<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:07.080> start<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.470> we've

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
with my machine so to start out we've

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.039 
with my machine so to start out we've
got<00:01:08.040> our<00:01:08.280> D<00:01:08.640> compressor<00:01:09.090> right<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.900> on

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
got our D compressor right here up on

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.740 
got our D compressor right here up on
the<00:01:10.110> top<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> engine<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.450> when<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> pull

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the top of the engine and when you pull

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.649 
the top of the engine and when you pull
the<00:01:12.869> lever<00:01:13.049> on<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.950> handlebars<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:15.060> pushes

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the lever on your handlebars it pushes

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.460 
the lever on your handlebars it pushes
this<00:01:15.780> down<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> we<00:01:18.720> flip<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> head<00:01:19.200> over

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
this down and so we flip the head over

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.190 
this down and so we flip the head over
you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.740> see<00:01:19.950> kind<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.430> what<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.540> does<00:01:21.810> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
you can see kind of what that does it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.350 
you can see kind of what that does it
pushes<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.880> hard<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.240> with

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
pushes in it's kind of hard to do with

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.160 
pushes in it's kind of hard to do with
one<00:01:24.540> hand<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.939> pushes<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> guy<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
one hand but so it pushes that guy in I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.140 
one hand but so it pushes that guy in I
don't<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.920> see<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:32.150> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
don't know if you can see that and so it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.140 
don't know if you can see that and so it
it<00:01:33.960> opens<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.470> whole<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.920> from<00:01:35.100> here<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
it opens up a whole going from here to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.789 
it opens up a whole going from here to
here<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.799> then<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.270> connects<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:40.590> one

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
here and then that connects to this one

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.550 
here and then that connects to this one
down<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:41.450> comes<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> exhaust<00:01:43.020> port<00:01:43.320> so

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
down here comes out the exhaust port so

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
down here comes out the exhaust port so
when<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> when<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> piston<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.329> coming<00:01:45.570> up

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
when the when the piston is coming up

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.929 
when the when the piston is coming up
it's<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.439> unable<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.100> commit<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.549> pushes

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
it's it's unable to commit just pushes

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.359 
it's it's unable to commit just pushes
everything<00:01:48.180> right<00:01:48.509> out<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.810> hole<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
everything right out that hole and

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.100 
everything right out that hole and
allows<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.909> engine<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.299> start<00:01:51.810> spinning

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
allows the engine to start spinning

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.859 
allows the engine to start spinning
faster<00:01:53.689> which<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.720> key<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:56.600> engaging<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
faster which is key for engaging the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.679 
faster which is key for engaging the
clutch<00:01:58.399> it's<00:01:59.399> basically<00:02:01.250> when<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:03.479> is

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
clutch it's basically when you this is

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.609 
clutch it's basically when you this is
the<00:02:03.930> clutch<00:02:04.890> slash<00:02:05.159> variator<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:06.290> as<00:02:07.290> you

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
the clutch slash variator and as you

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.460 
the clutch slash variator and as you
pedal<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.129> machine<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.780> belt<00:02:09.959> begins<00:02:10.259> to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
pedal the machine the belt begins to

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.500 
pedal the machine the belt begins to
spin<00:02:10.679> this

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
spin this

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.750 
spin this
and<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:13.060> pulls<00:02:14.060> these<00:02:14.360> arms<00:02:14.930> out<00:02:15.580> they<00:02:16.580> make

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
and it pulls these arms out they make

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.899 
and it pulls these arms out they make
contact<00:02:16.970> with<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.049> guy<00:02:18.260> which<00:02:19.190> drives<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
contact with this guy which drives the

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.949 
contact with this guy which drives the
crankshaft<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.659> engine<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:22.540> by<00:02:23.540> having<00:02:23.690> no

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
crankshaft of the engine so by having no

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.630 
crankshaft of the engine so by having no
compression<00:02:24.319> in<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.590> cylinder<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.310> it's

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
compression in the cylinder it's it's

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.780 
compression in the cylinder it's it's
much<00:02:26.330> much<00:02:26.569> easier<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:27.260> get<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.099> started<00:02:28.450> so

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
much much easier to get it started so

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.030 
much much easier to get it started so
got<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.780> basically<00:02:33.170> here<00:02:33.410> was<00:02:33.560> this

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
got that but so basically here was this

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.839 
got that but so basically here was this
is<00:02:34.220> what<00:02:34.400> was<00:02:34.819> wrong<00:02:34.970> with<00:02:35.180> mine

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
is what was wrong with mine

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.520 
is what was wrong with mine
usually<00:02:37.849> so<00:02:38.239> basically<00:02:39.049> I<00:02:39.140> didn't<00:02:39.319> have<00:02:39.410> any

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
usually so basically I didn't have any

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.270 
usually so basically I didn't have any
compression<00:02:39.829> and<00:02:40.390> usually<00:02:41.390> that's<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:42.049> know

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
compression and usually that's you know

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.020 
compression and usually that's you know
bad<00:02:43.280> piston<00:02:43.730> rings<00:02:44.079> cracked<00:02:45.079> head<00:02:46.030> correct

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
bad piston rings cracked head correct

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.369 
bad piston rings cracked head correct
jug<00:02:48.760> bad<00:02:49.760> gaskets<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:52.780> heads<00:02:53.780> not<00:02:54.049> torqued

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
jug bad gaskets the heads not torqued

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.339 
jug bad gaskets the heads not torqued
down<00:02:54.440> enough<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:55.720> bunch<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:56.810> different<00:02:57.049> reasons

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
down enough a bunch of different reasons

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.530 
down enough a bunch of different reasons
but<00:02:57.849> probably<00:02:58.849> the<00:02:58.940> most<00:02:58.970> common<00:02:59.390> would<00:02:59.480> be

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
but probably the most common would be

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.259 
but probably the most common would be
the<00:02:59.750> gasket<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:00.890> I<00:03:01.250> didn't<00:03:01.970> see<00:03:02.150> and

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
the gasket and so I didn't see and

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.900 
the gasket and so I didn't see and
usually<00:03:03.019> one<00:03:03.859> thing<00:03:04.010> nice<00:03:04.160> about<00:03:04.190> two<00:03:04.549> strokes

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
usually one thing nice about two strokes

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.210 
usually one thing nice about two strokes
is<00:03:05.239> it's<00:03:05.510> nice<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:05.750> oily<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.530> you'll<00:03:06.980> see

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
is it's nice and oily and you'll see

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.610 
is it's nice and oily and you'll see
when<00:03:08.090> there's<00:03:08.299> a<00:03:08.390> leak<00:03:08.540> usually<00:03:08.989> or<00:03:09.200> you'll<00:03:09.500> be

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
when there's a leak usually or you'll be

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.960 
when there's a leak usually or you'll be
able<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.859> hear<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.160> or<00:03:10.280> something<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.730> didn't

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
able to hear it or something I didn't

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.220 
able to hear it or something I didn't
see<00:03:11.090> any<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.769> but<00:03:12.769> here<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:14.329> what<00:03:14.870> was

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
see any of that but here is what was

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.870 
see any of that but here is what was
actually<00:03:15.470> wrong<00:03:15.680> with<00:03:15.829> mine<00:03:16.099> if<00:03:16.549> you<00:03:16.609> can<00:03:16.760> see

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
actually wrong with mine if you can see

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.900 
actually wrong with mine if you can see
my<00:03:17.000> head<00:03:17.150> gasket<00:03:17.599> here<00:03:18.519> it's<00:03:19.519> broken<00:03:19.760> right

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
my head gasket here it's broken right

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.629 
my head gasket here it's broken right
here<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:20.540> if<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.870> lay<00:03:21.019> this<00:03:21.200> on<00:03:21.349> top<00:03:21.410> of<00:03:21.680> here<00:03:21.859> you

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
here so if I lay this on top of here you

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.890 
here so if I lay this on top of here you
can<00:03:22.849> see<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.799> made<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.829> little<00:03:25.010> channel<00:03:25.900> from

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
can see that made a little channel from

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.770 
can see that made a little channel from
the<00:03:26.959> cylinder<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.150> decompressor

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
the cylinder to the to the decompressor

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.129 
the cylinder to the to the decompressor
hole<00:03:29.989> so<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:31.010> was<00:03:31.190> kind<00:03:31.430> of<00:03:31.459> like<00:03:31.609> my

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
hole so it was kind of like my

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.659 
hole so it was kind of like my
decompressor<00:03:33.139> was<00:03:33.349> on<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.530> little<00:03:33.829> bit<00:03:34.010> all<00:03:34.370> the

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
decompressor was on a little bit all the

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.500 
decompressor was on a little bit all the
time<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:36.370> that's<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.609> problem<00:03:37.819> I'm<00:03:38.209> actually

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
time so that's the problem I'm actually

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.750 
time so that's the problem I'm actually
going<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:38.900> just<00:03:39.109> ditch<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.980> try<00:03:40.400> running

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
going to just ditch this and try running

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.009 
going to just ditch this and try running
it<00:03:40.880> without<00:03:41.299> a<00:03:41.870> gasket<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.870> see<00:03:44.870> how<00:03:44.959> that

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
it without a gasket and see how that

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.470 
it without a gasket and see how that
goes<00:03:45.400> it'll<00:03:46.400> raise<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:46.790> compression<00:03:47.269> a

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
goes it'll raise the compression a

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.479 
goes it'll raise the compression a
little<00:03:47.959> bit<00:03:48.049> because<00:03:48.230> we're<00:03:48.530> we're<00:03:49.220> narrowing

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
little bit because we're we're narrowing

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.000 
little bit because we're we're narrowing
the<00:03:49.849> gap<00:03:50.049> but<00:03:53.200> should<00:03:54.200> work<00:03:54.379> just<00:03:54.590> fine<00:03:54.739> if<00:03:54.980> not

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
the gap but should work just fine if not

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.069 
the gap but should work just fine if not
I'll<00:03:55.370> I'll<00:03:55.639> make<00:03:55.849> a<00:03:55.879> gasket<00:03:56.359> out<00:03:56.450> of<00:03:56.599> a<00:03:56.690> pop-can

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
I'll I'll make a gasket out of a pop-can

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.069 
I'll I'll make a gasket out of a pop-can
or<00:03:57.290> something<00:03:57.590> like<00:03:57.709> that<00:03:58.660> but<00:03:59.660> yeah<00:03:59.900> that's

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
or something like that but yeah that's

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.319 
or something like that but yeah that's
that
