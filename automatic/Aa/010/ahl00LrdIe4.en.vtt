rewind<00:05:37.790> press<00:05:38.120> play<00:05:38.330> and<00:05:38.600> there<00:05:39.530> you<00:05:39.650> have<00:05:39.830> it

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
rewind press play and there you have it

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.420 
rewind press play and there you have it
we<00:05:41.150> have<00:05:41.570> a<00:05:41.870> dynamic<00:05:42.230> particle<00:05:42.950> simulation

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
we have a dynamic particle simulation

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.480 
we have a dynamic particle simulation
now<00:05:44.210> let's<00:05:44.390> try<00:05:44.540> one<00:05:44.810> more<00:05:44.990> thing<00:05:45.280> make<00:05:46.280> my

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
now let's try one more thing make my

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.440 
now let's try one more thing make my
sphere<00:05:46.760> smaller<00:05:48.430> right-click<00:05:49.430> then<00:05:49.820> add<00:05:50.030> a

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
sphere smaller right-click then add a

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:55.300 
sphere smaller right-click then add a
vibrate<00:05:51.140> tag<00:05:52.780> enable<00:05:53.780> position<00:05:54.230> press<00:05:55.070> play

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
vibrate tag enable position press play

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.640 
vibrate tag enable position press play
and<00:05:55.760> you'll<00:05:56.120> see<00:05:56.420> that<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.050> particles<00:05:57.350> are

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
and you'll see that the particles are

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.360 
and you'll see that the particles are
emitted<00:05:57.770> from<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.730> position<00:05:59.150> of<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.960> sphere

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
emitted from the position of the sphere

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.260 
emitted from the position of the sphere
now<00:06:01.370> how<00:06:01.760> easy<00:06:02.270> was<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.170> I<00:06:04.070> hope<00:06:04.850> you<00:06:04.970> enjoyed

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
now how easy was that I hope you enjoyed

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.420 
now how easy was that I hope you enjoyed
it
