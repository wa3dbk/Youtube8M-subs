00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.640 
tutorial Crouch - or wave - into while
standing<00:00:27.190> attack<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.930> is<00:00:29.110> an<00:00:29.230> extremely

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
standing attack this is an extremely

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.330 
standing attack this is an extremely
useful<00:00:29.770> technique<00:00:30.430> I<00:00:31.529> mean<00:00:32.529> mostly<00:00:32.920> I<00:00:33.040> think

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
useful technique I mean mostly I think

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.830 
useful technique I mean mostly I think
for<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.640> machine<00:00:34.000> males<00:00:34.210> who<00:00:34.360> have<00:00:34.390> very<00:00:34.690> good

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
for the machine males who have very good

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.110 
for the machine males who have very good
while<00:00:35.080> standing<00:00:35.530> launchers<00:00:36.040> they<00:00:36.790> have<00:00:36.970> that

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
while standing launchers they have that

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.100 
while standing launchers they have that
typical<00:00:37.390> mix<00:00:38.320> up<00:00:38.530> you<00:00:38.680> know<00:00:38.800> like<00:00:39.210> wave<00:00:40.210> -<00:00:40.600> into

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
typical mix up you know like wave - into

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
typical mix up you know like wave - into
a<00:00:41.620> he'll<00:00:42.010> sweep<00:00:42.280> or<00:00:42.640> some<00:00:42.820> say<00:00:43.300> furlough<00:00:43.780> or

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
a he'll sweep or some say furlough or

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.689 
a he'll sweep or some say furlough or
directly<00:00:46.210> into<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:47.160> kazoo<00:00:48.160> he<00:00:48.340> has<00:00:48.460> twin

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
directly into a kazoo he has twin

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.229 
directly into a kazoo he has twin
Pistons<00:00:49.239> or<00:00:49.480> Delvians<00:00:50.290> while<00:00:50.470> standing<00:00:50.890> -<00:00:51.239> or

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
Pistons or Delvians while standing - or

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.170 
Pistons or Delvians while standing - or
which<00:00:52.449> in<00:00:52.690> here<00:00:53.020> his<00:00:53.739> yeah<00:00:54.489> his<00:00:54.730> while

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
which in here his yeah his while

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:08.140 
which in here his yeah his while
standing<00:00:55.570> -<00:00:56.730> whoa

so this is extremely important to know
and<00:01:11.960> how<00:01:12.860> do<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.040> do<00:01:13.190> it<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.370> do<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:13.640> simple

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
and how do you do it you do a simple

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.330 
and how do you do it you do a simple
Crouch<00:01:14.480> -<00:01:14.870> and<00:01:15.200> very<00:01:15.830> quickly<00:01:17.050> push<00:01:18.050> back<00:01:18.950> and

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
Crouch - and very quickly push back and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.710 
Crouch - and very quickly push back and
the<00:01:19.810> corresponding<00:01:20.810> button<00:01:21.200> for<00:01:21.950> your<00:01:22.040> attack

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
the corresponding button for your attack

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.780 
the corresponding button for your attack
and<00:01:23.720> in<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.140> case<00:01:24.410> I<00:01:24.680> am<00:01:24.890> going<00:01:24.920> for<00:01:25.460> jeans

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
and in this case I am going for jeans

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.240 
and in this case I am going for jeans
while<00:01:26.090> standing<00:01:26.570> -<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.110> will<00:01:27.200> be<00:01:27.500> pressing<00:01:27.800> I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
while standing - so I will be pressing I

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.430 
while standing - so I will be pressing I

Swedish<00:01:58.430> machinima<00:01:58.850> player<00:01:59.060> and<00:01:59.390> as<00:02:00.140> he<00:02:00.560> said

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
Swedish machinima player and as he said

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.429 
Swedish machinima player and as he said
he<00:02:01.159> told<00:02:01.460> me<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.850> but<00:02:02.570> it's<00:02:02.869> just<00:02:03.020> nothing<00:02:03.380> I

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
he told me that but it's just nothing I

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.620 
he told me that but it's just nothing I
can<00:02:03.619> tell<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.670> timing<00:02:04.939> is<00:02:05.179> something<00:02:05.360> you

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
can tell you the timing is something you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.680 
can tell you the timing is something you
will<00:02:05.750> have<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:06.340> figure<00:02:07.340> out<00:02:07.660> by<00:02:08.660> yourself

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
will have to figure out by yourself

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.350 
will have to figure out by yourself
because<00:02:09.530> if<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.190> rush<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.970> do<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.090> too

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
because if you rush it and do it too

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.740 
because if you rush it and do it too
rapidly<00:02:11.920> you'll<00:02:12.920> end<00:02:13.130> up<00:02:13.220> like<00:02:13.459> getting<00:02:16.750> yeah

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
rapidly you'll end up like getting yeah

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.009 
rapidly you'll end up like getting yeah
I<00:02:18.049> ever<00:02:18.230> he's<00:02:18.590> his<00:02:19.160> regular<00:02:19.790> back<00:02:20.090> into<00:02:20.540> or<00:02:20.870> is

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
I ever he's his regular back into or is

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.080 
I ever he's his regular back into or is
d2<00:02:22.690> you're<00:02:23.690> gonna<00:02:23.810> mess<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.380> up<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.850> can't

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
d2 you're gonna mess it up and you can't

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.420 
d2 you're gonna mess it up and you can't
do<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:26.360> too<00:02:26.540> slowly<00:02:26.870> either<00:02:27.260> so<00:02:27.680> it's<00:02:28.069> just<00:02:28.250> one

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
do it too slowly either so it's just one

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.309 
do it too slowly either so it's just one
of<00:02:28.459> those<00:02:28.760> techniques<00:02:29.150> where<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.720> just<00:02:30.049> have

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
of those techniques where you just have

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.070 
of those techniques where you just have
to<00:02:30.530> practice<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.220> lot<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.430> get<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> sense<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.930> it

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
to practice a lot and get a sense of it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.130 
to practice a lot and get a sense of it
like<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.560> cuz<00:02:33.739> yes<00:02:34.010> comparative<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.330> electric

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
like it cuz yes comparative to electric

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.620 
like it cuz yes comparative to electric
launch<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:38.540> just<00:02:38.780> have<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.110> try<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.380> out<00:02:39.590> but

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
launch you just have to try it out but

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.180 
launch you just have to try it out but
once<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.810> do<00:02:41.959> get<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.350> hang<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.799> it's<00:02:43.040> not

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
once you do get the hang of it it's not

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.640 
once you do get the hang of it it's not
that<00:02:43.430> hard<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:46.569> something<00:02:47.569> for<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.049> newbies

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
that hard and something for you newbies
