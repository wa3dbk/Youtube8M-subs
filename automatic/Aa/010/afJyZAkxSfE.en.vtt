 see the phases 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.210
 in detail we have the first phase of 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.770
 attack 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.700
 the second cruise the third 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.369
 consolidation and the fourth of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:25.250
 stabilization in the attack phase 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:29.329
 only protein foods are consumed 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:33.840
 white meat and shellfish os turner 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:37.710
 and dairy products with skimmed milk with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.040
 a fat percentage lower than 5 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.040
 percent 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.990
 this phase goes from three to ten days a 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.380
 depending on the weight you need to lose 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.409
 you must first test the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.180
 website www.ducati.it and the test tells you 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.570
 how many days of attack you have to do 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.049
 how many days of cruises and on and so 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.270
 Street 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.149
 and you move on from this phase of 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.550
 attack on a cruise phase that lasts 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.070
 until 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:21.560
 you get the right weight also called from the 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:25.310
 site and this phase the prote 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.560
 days so eat only pure protein e 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.090
 days in which is added to the alle 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.820
 vegetable protein can be divided into 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.890
 a day of protein a day of 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.480
 protein and vegetables or two days of 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.170
 protein two days of protein e 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.240
 vegetables or five days of protein 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.410
 and vegetables two days of pure protein 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.660
 or two days of protein for 25 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.480
 days of protein as well the most 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.450
 recommended is the alternation of proteins and 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.580
 protein vegetables as well as helps 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.480
 do not tire the body and therefore the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:06.770
 this is very easily followed 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.570
 diet and tranquility come to the right 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.270
 weight 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:17.260
 we move on to the consolidation phase which 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.260
 it is a phase in which they are reintroduced 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:28.190
 this is more and more energetic foods 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.470
 introduction of fruits up yes 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.780
 First, it is divided into two phases 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.640
 first phase of the third and the second phase of 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.350
 third in the first different phase 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:43.510
 one fruit is introduced per day 50 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:47.900
 grams of bread better if whole and 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.900
 seasoned cheeses and an avid a 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.870
 week and a festoon gala meal in 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.270
 which can be consumed agip ashton 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.270
 cream a second what you want 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:07.099
 for every kilo lost you have to do ten 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.720
 days of phase pastas 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.420
 Consolidation 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.640
 so if we lose a kilo we must 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.030
 do five days of first phase e 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.280
 five days of second phase 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.280
 in the second third phase 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.380
 the fruit become two fruits at 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:33.710
 day the bread for you remains 50 grams 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.930
 starch is made two years a week 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.479
 the meal fest become two party meals 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:44.419
 gala week and so that the 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:53.840
 the body gets used to food 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:58.460
 let's say a little fatter this over 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:02.210
 phase given by the calculation goes to the phase 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:06.289
 of stabilization in which you return to 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:10.610
 eating normally only needs to be kept 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:15.280

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:18.169
 Thursday protein as well drink plenty of water and 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.600

 as in every very important diet 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.630

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.310
 well accelerated almost as if there is 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:48.710
