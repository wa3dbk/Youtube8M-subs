we're ready to take these cabinets out
that's<00:03:27.230> gonna<00:03:27.380> be<00:03:27.470> one<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.709> last<00:03:27.890> things

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
that's gonna be one of the last things

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.660 
that's gonna be one of the last things
we<00:03:28.190> do<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.290> section<00:03:30.560> of<00:03:30.830> family<00:03:31.130> stays

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
we do so this section of family stays

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.229 
we do so this section of family stays
for<00:03:32.270> right<00:03:32.360> now<00:03:32.410> although<00:03:33.410> I<00:03:33.500> took<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.239> wall

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
for right now although I took the wall

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.330 
for right now although I took the wall
by<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.600> plug<00:03:35.900> box<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.440> stuffed<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:36.830> through

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
by the plug box and stuffed it through

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.040 
by the plug box and stuffed it through
the<00:03:37.850> paneling<00:03:38.209> so<00:03:38.330> it's<00:03:38.450> not<00:03:38.570> behind<00:03:38.750> it

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
the paneling so it's not behind it

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.160 
the paneling so it's not behind it
instead<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.350> in<00:03:39.470> front<00:03:40.660> I'm<00:03:41.660> gonna<00:03:41.840> have<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:42.050> do

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
instead of in front I'm gonna have to do

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.490 
instead of in front I'm gonna have to do
the<00:03:42.290> same<00:03:42.500> thing<00:03:42.739> here<00:03:43.570> when<00:03:44.570> I<00:03:44.600> go<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.810> do<00:03:44.989> this

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
the same thing here when I go to do this

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.050 
the same thing here when I go to do this
section<00:03:45.950> here<00:03:46.250> I'm<00:03:46.370> gonna<00:03:46.489> have<00:03:46.580> to<00:03:46.850> take<00:03:47.030> that

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
section here I'm gonna have to take that

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.660 
section here I'm gonna have to take that
light<00:03:47.450> down<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.920> we<00:03:49.160> have<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.340> take<00:03:49.430> out<00:03:49.550> the

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
light down and we have to take out the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.270 
light down and we have to take out the
door<00:03:49.790> ball<00:03:49.970> too<00:03:50.150> because<00:03:50.780> they're<00:03:51.190> mounted<00:03:52.190> on

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
door ball too because they're mounted on

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.360 
door ball too because they're mounted on
top<00:03:52.460> of<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.640> paneling

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.960 

so<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.550> looks<00:03:56.730> like<00:03:57.860> we<00:03:58.860> gained<00:03:59.130> maybe<00:03:59.400> you

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
so it looks like we gained maybe you

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.860 
so it looks like we gained maybe you
know<00:04:00.060> like<00:04:00.330> an<00:04:00.450> inch<00:04:00.630> or<00:04:00.810> two<00:04:02.750> probably<00:04:03.750> like

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
know like an inch or two probably like

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.690 
know like an inch or two probably like
an<00:04:03.990> inch<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.410> height<00:04:05.100> but<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.490> really<00:04:05.610> looks

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
an inch and height but it really looks

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.240 
an inch and height but it really looks
bigger<00:04:06.690> now<00:04:06.960> that<00:04:06.990> we<00:04:07.260> yanked<00:04:08.100> all<00:04:08.190> the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
bigger now that we yanked all the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.060 
bigger now that we yanked all the
ceiling<00:04:08.520> tiles<00:04:08.700> out<00:04:09.650> they<00:04:10.650> wanted<00:04:10.950> them<00:04:11.040> gone

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
ceiling tiles out they wanted them gone

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.230 
ceiling tiles out they wanted them gone
so<00:04:11.610> that's<00:04:12.270> what<00:04:12.480> we've<00:04:12.600> got<00:04:13.850> and<00:04:14.850> I've<00:04:15.000> got<00:04:15.210> a

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
so that's what we've got and I've got a

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.720 
so that's what we've got and I've got a
mess<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.540> clean<00:04:15.750> up

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
mess to clean up

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.560 
mess to clean up
although<00:04:17.730> it<00:04:17.850> looks<00:04:18.000> worse<00:04:18.209> than<00:04:18.360> it<00:04:18.420> really

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
although it looks worse than it really

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.460 
although it looks worse than it really
is<00:04:18.720> because<00:04:19.200> it's<00:04:19.530> most<00:04:19.950> of<00:04:20.070> these<00:04:20.160> are<00:04:20.310> intact

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
is because it's most of these are intact

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.630 
is because it's most of these are intact
we've<00:04:22.470> just<00:04:22.620> got<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.890> odds<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.190> trim<00:04:23.400> pieces

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
we've just got the odds the trim pieces

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.600 
we've just got the odds the trim pieces
here<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.060> snap<00:04:24.330> apart<00:04:25.190> with<00:04:26.190> nails<00:04:26.370> sticking

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
here to snap apart with nails sticking

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.760 
here to snap apart with nails sticking
out<00:04:26.820> of<00:04:26.910> them<00:04:27.080> rest<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.200> this<00:04:28.260> line<00:04:28.440> just<00:04:28.590> pick

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
out of them rest of this line just pick

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.350 
out of them rest of this line just pick
up<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.100> chuck<00:04:29.610> in<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.850> trash<00:04:30.030> do<00:04:30.240> it<00:04:30.300> outside
