00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.090
 hello how in this video I want to show you 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.990
 how can we weave 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.469
 the relief point 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.039
 but apple combined 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.939
 Per hundred and the previous number I showed you how to make the relief point 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.340
 all the point highlighted by the side of the cimat and hitting it do it by the 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.960
 downstairs 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.730
 in this one we are going to combine 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.000
 let's put a point on top there is another point below 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.849
 so 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.649
 here we start our spin we will knit three chains 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.250
 and the first point we're not going to 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.240
 to grow as a point 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.110
 relief we will continue with the following 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.850
 here I am going to knit my first relief point will be by the top 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.600
 I take my point 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.860
 and here I leave you 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.380
 my punctual 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.660
 the second one is going to be from the bottom part 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.630
 in this way 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.530
 the third one that would be this one I went through the top 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.330
 the next one is going to do from the bottom 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 in this way 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
 and the one that follows the top 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.920
 this point relief can you apply 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.220
 percent 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.340
 goats and that in different ways is already 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.400
 some of you here I am going to walk you what the modifications are 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.450
 the variations of this point so that you can see how it is appreciated and 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.260
 see which one is more fair or the one that is easier dt g 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.430
 here I am using a thousand or a little thicker they will be called arrears 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.549
 and a thicker data 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.720
 so that you can appreciate it better 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.210
 irene first point I did not make any percent difference 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.910
 simply that if the three chains for height 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.580
 In this case, the last point is not going to make any difference either and 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.819
 simply wolf and fit 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.309
 in this way 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.809
 I'm going to do this in each and every one of the laps 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.789
 here since if the first round and in this way is how it looks appreciates 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.379
 knitting a leader's point from below 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.530
 another above 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.040
 starting with whichever you wish I hope that what I suggest 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.129
 is that when you mount the point 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.019
 It will be a number in par 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.610
 so that when you 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.620
 weigh the first point 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.810
 that day the second after the first three chains 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:56.289
 and they will be the last point in the same way in this case I gindi 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:57.999
 scale in 10 points 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:02.870
 After knitting the first 10 strong points I started to assemble the three 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.090
 caravels weaving the dots 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.790
 then here as I do not follow an odd number a number no no 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.959
 so 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.719
 that's why here it is shown that the point highlighted above and I ended up with 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.999
 the relief point 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:18.090
 under 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.110
 before the last point 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.150
 for a hundred reals mind you do not notice much 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.079
 i since this one will make them more practical 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.530
 then to weave the next spin I simply weave three chains 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.710
 and I will continue where I gil the snow point 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:39.589
 and I have left over the top there I will continue to knit it for the part 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.659
 over 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.670
 the next point as a seat on the bottom I'm going to weave it by 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.049
 downstairs 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.979
 and so I'm going to go the whole round the one that looks over does not want you over 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:57.440
 and the one that is given below by the bottom 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.869
 so I'm going to peter a few laps so you're reaching the appreciate 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:05.099
 is pointed mireia conde ruiz little more than a few laps that's how it is 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.540
 appreciates is targeted 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.029
 and that comparison which from the front 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:10.960
 as for the back 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.480
 for us to know how many laps we are already going it is easier to consider the point 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.499
 when we weave in the back 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.900
 and in this case this would be a return 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.820
 2. 3. 4 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.390
 Beijing 4 laps 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.730
 giving me percent 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.980
 the party you can appreciate a little more the tip 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.190
 and comparing it with this other one that very bad 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.580
 all points 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.810
 from the same side 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.889
 then this is how it is appreciated 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.379
 and these people asserted something different 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.460
 it's the same point dot highlight people I want you to see 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.370
 the big difference that exists 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.090
 simply with modify 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.639
 putting 1 and one 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.879
 that is very well you should not subscribe to continue learning 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.120
 until next time
