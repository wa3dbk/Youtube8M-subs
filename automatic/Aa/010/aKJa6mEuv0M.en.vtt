00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.549
 from the band 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.470
 that passes in front the longest of the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.470
 band 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.460

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.300
 to see who is the most drunk of the 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.300
 band 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.640
