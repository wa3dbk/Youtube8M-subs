00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.969
 well to really do an aggressive test of the resistance and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.289
 elasticity of the ecological transfer and water we have chosen this reason 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.499
 directly from the catalog because of its great color 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.889
 and in its widest and most delicate forms 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.820
 about percent a piece of normal t-shirt tissue 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.400
 of which is usually used normally 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.750
 with a data the mind with its pressure its time its favor 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.170
 we are checking the colorful 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.350
 I do keep 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.570
 perfectly zones and around here on the side of it reverse you can 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.540
 checked with very curious 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.570
 Of course we will not comment 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.620
 first let's check its large areas of relief and what the whole transfer 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.900
 You have been detached from paper, so we have not left any more 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.380
 thin and we will submit the first test 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.510
 terrible 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.930
 yes arieta 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.010
 so 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.250
 we choose an area because we want 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.940
 i is what we do 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.790
 it's great pressure 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.470
 on the back very strong 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.940
 to check honestly 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.300
 arieta 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.210
 if we realize that no 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.330
 return to its natural state we can choose any more delicate area or 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.710
 less and we do the same 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.970
 and we check 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 It is very elastic and does not return to its natural state 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.399
 if we make a more aggressive probation with the pointed ballpoint pen 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.640
 about to dd to bore 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.620
 we will be checking the same operation, that is, we force them to 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.980
 maximum 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.980
 it is very elastic it stays with the fabric 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.750
 if it maintains the forms later, it has not detached or distorted the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.450
 design 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.079
 and from the back that I told you before is giving you 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.370
 great relief that has really is not an ink charge as it happens with other 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.780
 inks derived from prc as I post the cetra no 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.560
 this is achieved by the same properties of the ink making a 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:21.099
 tissue suction 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:27.109
 i keeping percent the same weight also touch on its entire surface 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:32.409
 Other fabrics are tashtyk the qualities you have transferred to the water or 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:33.509
 ecological 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:40.799
 is the ability to give or take more - relief even once you have 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.339
 transferred but this will be done in other videos
