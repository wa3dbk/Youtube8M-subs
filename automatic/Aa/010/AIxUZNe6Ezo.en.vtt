00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.660

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.519

 red of the celebrities and it's a 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.020
 excellent option for the night of

 our graduation 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.150
 the volume is another one of the big ones 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.710
 trends in the dresses of this 2015 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.299
 but it is not a volume like that of the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.430
 quinceanera dresses girls the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.530
 volume is created that the same fabric or 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.840
 touch of fantasy for this magical night

 we can rent the dress in perfect 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.100
 the three experiences and the blue in all 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.229
 its ranges is one of the great 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.689
 trends designs called blue 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.909
 blue green turquoise blue roll 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.280
 marine or blue sky are the ones that 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.719
 stand out from this whole season and if you 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.580
 like to use a little more style 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.660
 conservative you can use one as 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.660
 this one that I'm seeing on screen 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.860
 vibrant colors colors like 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.150
 yellow orange strong blue and gold 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.530
 are several of the trends that 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.300
 are using at this time 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.370
 totally for a girl who wants 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.060
 stand out in this night with a lot of glamor 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.060
 and elegance 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.189
 and if we are obeying the trend 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.019
 that lives to the fashion for 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.480
 spring-summer are also watching 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.459

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.790
 just perfect mixes the style of 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.769
 princess many layers shine and the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.769

 red is also very present this year 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.999
 but it's like that girls for girls 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.829
 feel very sure of themselves and that 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:14.079
 they do not mind being the center of attention 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.019
 because we know that this color 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.969
 it's a magnet for looks and if I should 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.969
 tell it the truth is my favorite color 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.800
 and the great tendency at the end for this 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.420
 year are the two-piece dresses that 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.480

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.300
 no advantage of this what is that we can 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.370
 use it as we want with some 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.320

 and definitely because already trying 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.710
 So much money when we think it's 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.270
 crucial 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.270
