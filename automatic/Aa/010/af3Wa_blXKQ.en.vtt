 be it olives nuts 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.660
 chicken liver mushrooms or pieces of vegetables 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.950
 half a chicken fillet needs to be cut 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.110
 in small pieces 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.690
 and grind the second half to 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.229
 homogeneity and with other species 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.050
 meat or minced meat I chose beef and 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.030
 pork is more pork because from 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.729
 The choice of meat will depend on the final 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 the result with beef sausage less 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.470
 fatty but coarser in structure with 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.360
 pork softer 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.220
 but also fatter for example with rabbit 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.440
 will listen to your ass finally more 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.709
 dietary therefore probably need 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.599
 choose the composition to your taste 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:45.690
 to experiment homemade recipes 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:48.690
 sausages probably not one hundred and this 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.820
 the recipe is just one of many probably he 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.060
 not quite traditional but me and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.360
 their children like this sausage if you 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.890
 like sausage fatty can add 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.620
 pieces of bacon or fat 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.890
 before you dice it 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.619
 will freeze the freezers and then he 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.840
 easy to slice a piece of chicken I cut 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.310
 diced and right so I will knead 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.180
 I like some stuffing 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.780
 heterogeneity 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.190
 and here the second half needs to be crushed and 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.959
 make as even mincemeat as possible 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.510
