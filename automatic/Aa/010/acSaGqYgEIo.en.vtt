00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
it's power and this is the average step

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.080 
it's power and this is the average step
note<00:00:05.009> 20<00:00:05.670> 50<00:00:06.060> T<00:00:06.980> alright<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.639> kind<00:00:09.000> of

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090

note 20 50 T alright this is kind of
like<00:00:09.410> netbook<00:00:10.410> price<00:00:10.920> range<00:00:11.309> but<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.759> little

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179
