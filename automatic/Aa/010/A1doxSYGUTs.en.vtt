00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.040
 this over here 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.900
 we have to download the player up and 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.090

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.760
 this tutorial is only valid for 1.8 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.780
 It's worth not even for 1.8 point 1.8 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.970
 points or nothing 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.250
 1.8 1 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.580
 also here perfect 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.840
 and finally the smart mobile for me in 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.170
 that 1.8 we are going to download I have close 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.060
 this we put it here also and good 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.100
 let's start explaining this to 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.080
 we enter the internet 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.909
 the first thing to do is install the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.920
 folio okay this is the first thing you have to 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.400
 do these things in the order that is 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.230
 doing 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.860
 accept wait 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.780
 we will accept 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.970
 it is already installed, it is already good 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.970
 but is installed close to one hundred 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.570
 one hundred we have to open our minecraft 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.570
 so that it opens 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.740
 and good once here we choose the version 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.740
 1.8 forge that will be down at the very least 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.810
 We give you to save and play we hope 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.340
 if you do not do this the tutorial is not going to 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.050
 work I have to do 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.210
 doing I go to this intermediate step 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.640
 to open minecraft and such good as that 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.100
 you have to do it 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.630
 we can wait for it to open 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.550
 ok I think you've seen the screen 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.880
 in black but good as it is we have here 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.470
 3 mozilla of stress more active and good 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.630
 You have this here if you see that you have 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.670
 the mode well installed and a hundred 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.430
 it's worth it now that you have everything 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.170
 this over here we can close minecraft and 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.790
 now let's install the mode because no 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.230
 is still installed let's try listing 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.660
 the forge that is so to speak as the 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.420
 engine that makes it work worth and good 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.010
 what we have to do we come here to 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.230
 windows button that you have a 27 you 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.180
 you write here and windows 8 like me 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.810
 right click and execute and write 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.570
 percent arctic data percent you must 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.100
 search let's accept and bring here 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.630
 this folder that is called roaming and 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.490
 in roaming, because you have 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.810
 this folder from here the first the point 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.270
 minecraft that that's the archives of 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.340
 our minecraft good if I had done 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.720
 everything okay so far then this 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.600
 folder here that are called mods 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.950
 inside mozilla folder we open and 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.000
 to install the mode we have to open 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.090
 the in the player api and we put the file 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.580
 with the java icon, what's in it? 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.700
 here perfect we can close the 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.830
 winter and the smart moving files 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.600
 that are three, you see, you have 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.120
 here these three files with the icon 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.470
 java we all put inside equally 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.260
 Valencians this and this 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.080
 let's eliminate this already if we want and 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.070
 well now we open our minecraft 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.070
 to check that it is installed 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.370
 We hope today we have here the folk 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.480
 and good we give him to play 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.480
 and I'm going to show you how good it is 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.909
 installed the mod 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.420
 now I will leave you with a mini review of 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.280
 mod so you can see a couple of movements 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.200
 and animations that adds this mode that 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.239
 they're pretty pretty cool 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.430
 true and I think they are very important 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.290
 for minecraft good as you see here 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.090
 we have 7 monsters of 7th santi that 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.280
 before we had 3 and we're still here and 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.220
 we will have here the player up and the 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.320
 smart core the smart moving and the smash 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.970
 let's be the four things 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.010
 means that we have is the mode 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.830
 installed one hundred percent and running 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.940
 and good as I said at the beginning I 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:40.880
 I leave with 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.530
 the mini review is valid and see you now 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.150
 and well, we are here already back 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.150
 we are in a world whatever it is worth 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.820
 and well I'm going I give a superman voucher is one 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.920
 of the many movements that the 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.330
 smart move in to our main remains 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.170
 they went down chung because this going with 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.550
 pretty much let's see if the average 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.610
 this movement that is pretty cool 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.830
 of superman that returns premier f 5 well 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.480
 to make it look better and good if I had 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.820
 lopd and fine would have my coat with which 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.470
 I would be even cooler though good 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.720
 yes it's pretty good 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.930
 well do not know having this movement 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.250
 also add here in options about 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.190
 extra controls that good if we go down 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.910
 here at the bottom we have 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.710
 the smart mobile we have to enable it 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.650
 disable it to increase the 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.470
 speed or lessen the crisis 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.300
 decreases and that is increase good - 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.260
 also other movements that adds and what 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.710
 what they do is take away the creative 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.030
 wear is normal as we are worth 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.760
 here in that as in any other world 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.010
 and how is the movement of walking not 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.930
 change anything is worth the same animation 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.880
 so to speak but for example upload 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.590
 this staircase is worth looking at 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.200
 animation that is very cool the truth and 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.230
 I like a lot and good if we 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.850
 we fall from the ladder are you going to do 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.890
 this a little bit higher for you to see 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.610
 best animation that has almost seen us 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.289
 I hardly believe 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.860
 and I think that creative is also seen 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.860
 what are we going to see 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:17.610
 the second is that it's very weird and it makes 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.030
 this animation like to fall we're going to 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.030
 up again 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.580
 A) Yes 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.169
 the good determination so it's 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.580
 pretty cool really good the most 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.210
 known as it is to say it is 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.620
 the animation of bending over and the graves of 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.319
 dance shift more control makes us 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.900
 we knocked down it's already very cool this 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:43.090
 truth and we raise and lower the blocks 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:46.270
 we will continue subtracting and good 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:49.210
 as you will understand how you have thought 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.280
 Many, well, yes, you can spend 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.889
 below a site with 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.610
 the f5 appears to us as you can see 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:59.410
 subtracting here like a snake and getting off 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.080
 around here inside or is it very web for 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.639
 do hidden secrets and things like that and 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.139
 it's pretty cool really we have 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:06.460
 stretch us like this is a 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:09.580
 trampoline ok let's get here 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.200
 up there and I think if we do well 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.180
 expected I get 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.230
 it's a bit complicated but we're going to 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.230
 double shift 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.810
 it did not come out to me is that I do not really know how 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:24.000
 is done I think those by pressing shift and 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.000
 air control let's see if I get 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.250
 Let's see 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.370
 it's not easy I know how loud it is not to say 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.830
 not easy 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.330
 As you can see, he pulls his head and is very 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.780
 well you also have the animation of 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:41.139
 swim as it is the truth is very epic 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:43.330
 very cool really cool and good I 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:44.440
 I think that this mode is very important if 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.320
 We want to make our minecraft 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:50.020
 Well, the law looks much better, I think 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.370
 I'm going to leave it here because the part that 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.680
 more interesting is the tutorial that already 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:56.169
 he has done it and this is to make a 

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.500
 brief summary because we are then you can 

00:07:56.169 --> 00:08:01.260
 get lots of utilities 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.390
 good but summarizing new movements 

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.490
 for your minecraft better animations me 

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.600
 I think it's very good and nothing is that 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.880
 I really liked this tutorial if 

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.560
 you want me to make a ton as in 

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.970
 concrete you put me the comments and 

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.970
 see you next goodbye
