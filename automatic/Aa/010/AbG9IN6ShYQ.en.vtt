after<00:00:05.500> narrow<00:00:05.859> NCJ<00:00:06.490> peaceful

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 
after narrow NCJ peaceful

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.199 
after narrow NCJ peaceful
I<00:00:07.260> just<00:00:08.260> wanted<00:00:08.530> to<00:00:08.590> circle<00:00:09.430> to<00:00:09.790> deal<00:00:09.940> with<00:00:10.120> you

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:10.209 
I just wanted to circle to deal with you

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:16.440 
I just wanted to circle to deal with you
all<00:00:10.650> um<00:00:11.849> did<00:00:12.849> a<00:00:12.880> lot<00:00:13.030> of<00:00:13.059> thinking<00:00:13.480> about<00:00:15.450> like

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
all um did a lot of thinking about like

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.150 
all um did a lot of thinking about like
what<00:00:16.480> appears<00:00:17.080> now<00:00:17.259> to<00:00:17.290> be<00:00:17.410> infamous<00:00:17.920> blade

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
what appears now to be infamous blade

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.859 
what appears now to be infamous blade
cap<00:00:18.369> theory<00:00:18.759> and<00:00:20.699> I've<00:00:21.699> made<00:00:22.660> another

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
cap theory and I've made another

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.870 
cap theory and I've made another
revision<00:00:23.140> to<00:00:23.439> it<00:00:23.590> and<00:00:23.890> I<00:00:24.250> started<00:00:24.580> thinking

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
revision to it and I started thinking

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.230 
revision to it and I started thinking
about<00:00:24.939> this<00:00:25.300> a<00:00:25.539> little<00:00:26.470> bit<00:00:26.619> more<00:00:26.890> or<00:00:27.880> in<00:00:28.150> the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
about this a little bit more or in the

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.910 
about this a little bit more or in the
course<00:00:28.449> of<00:00:28.689> I<00:00:28.840> guess<00:00:28.990> about<00:00:29.199> a<00:00:29.260> week<00:00:29.470> now<00:00:29.730> and

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
course of I guess about a week now and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.180 
course of I guess about a week now and
there's<00:00:32.920> so<00:00:33.100> many<00:00:33.190> parameters<00:00:33.820> involved<00:00:34.180> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
there's so many parameters involved and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.270 
there's so many parameters involved and
that<00:00:36.190> I<00:00:37.470> think<00:00:38.470> it's<00:00:38.710> going<00:00:38.799> to<00:00:38.860> take<00:00:39.010> a<00:00:39.070> lot

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
that I think it's going to take a lot

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.850 
that I think it's going to take a lot
more<00:00:39.309> research<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:40.360> development<00:00:40.930> and<00:00:41.110> many

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
more research and development and many

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.890 
more research and development and many
more<00:00:42.100> equations<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:43.000> come<00:00:43.150> up<00:00:43.269> with<00:00:43.420> a<00:00:43.479> working

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
more equations to come up with a working

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.670 
more equations to come up with a working
theory<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:45.460> it's<00:00:45.640> perfect<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.350> I<00:00:47.440> think

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
theory that it's perfect and I think

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.680 
theory that it's perfect and I think
I've<00:00:47.890> led<00:00:48.250> a<00:00:48.280> lot<00:00:48.640> of<00:00:48.790> individuals<00:00:49.330> to<00:00:49.420> believe

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
I've led a lot of individuals to believe

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.880 
I've led a lot of individuals to believe
that<00:00:50.350> that's<00:00:50.559> my<00:00:51.040> goal<00:00:52.229> and<00:00:53.229> that<00:00:53.350> is<00:00:53.409> not<00:00:53.739> my

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
that that's my goal and that is not my

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.700 
that that's my goal and that is not my
goal<00:00:54.100> I<00:00:54.339> do<00:00:55.239> believe<00:00:55.570> I've<00:00:55.750> stated<00:00:56.110> many<00:00:56.320> times

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
goal I do believe I've stated many times

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.250 
goal I do believe I've stated many times
in<00:00:57.010> my<00:00:57.129> videos<00:00:57.159> that<00:00:57.699> that<00:00:57.879> is<00:00:58.000> not<00:00:58.210> my<00:00:58.390> goal<00:00:58.629> as

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
in my videos that that is not my goal as

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.509 
in my videos that that is not my goal as
a<00:00:59.320> matter<00:00:59.650> of<00:00:59.739> fact<00:01:00.010> I<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:01.150> was<00:01:02.080> hoping<00:01:02.409> to<00:01:02.619> get<00:01:03.159> a

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
a matter of fact I I was hoping to get a

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.969 
a matter of fact I I was hoping to get a
lot<00:01:03.909> more<00:01:04.150> input<00:01:04.299> as<00:01:04.629> far<00:01:04.659> as<00:01:05.019> developing<00:01:05.530> it

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
lot more input as far as developing it

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.810 
lot more input as far as developing it
further<00:01:07.290> I've<00:01:08.290> had<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.530> few<00:01:08.740> suggestions<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.640> I

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
further I've had a few suggestions and I

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.950 
further I've had a few suggestions and I
do<00:01:09.880> appreciate<00:01:10.240> those<00:01:10.660> and<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:10.900> have

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
do appreciate those and I have

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.260 
do appreciate those and I have
incorporated<00:01:11.650> them<00:01:12.180> however<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:14.520> feel<00:01:15.520> it's<00:01:16.150> a

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
incorporated them however I feel it's a

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.790 
incorporated them however I feel it's a
bit<00:01:16.450> difficult<00:01:16.630> for<00:01:16.900> me<00:01:17.110> to<00:01:17.230> try<00:01:17.410> and<00:01:17.530> explain

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
bit difficult for me to try and explain

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.080 
bit difficult for me to try and explain
exactly<00:01:18.010> how<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.490> use<00:01:18.730> this<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:19.260> think<00:01:20.260> I've<00:01:20.410> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
exactly how to use this I think I've a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.890 
exactly how to use this I think I've a
few<00:01:22.090> websites<00:01:23.880> explained<00:01:24.880> how<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.180> use<00:01:25.360> it<00:01:25.720> and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
few websites explained how to use it and

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.900 
few websites explained how to use it and
I've<00:01:26.620> had<00:01:26.740> some<00:01:26.920> excellent<00:01:27.190> some<00:01:27.460> positive

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
I've had some excellent some positive

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.440 
I've had some excellent some positive
response<00:01:31.080> but<00:01:32.080> there<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.380> saying<00:01:33.450> some

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
response but there is the saying some

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.720 
response but there is the saying some
time<00:01:34.600> ago<00:01:34.840> that<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:37.390> know<00:01:37.510> your<00:01:37.690> limitations

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
time ago that to know your limitations

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.370 
time ago that to know your limitations
is<00:01:39.730> to<00:01:39.940> know<00:01:40.120> your<00:01:40.300> greatest<00:01:40.690> potential

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.980 

so<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.580> means<00:01:44.790> said<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:47.090> think<00:01:48.090> we're

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
so what that means said I think we're

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.080 
so what that means said I think we're
gonna<00:01:49.080> have<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> say<00:01:49.470> goodbye<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.850> plate

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
gonna have to say goodbye to this plate

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.969 
gonna have to say goodbye to this plate
gap<00:01:51.330> Theory<00:01:57.170> probably<00:01:58.170> won't<00:01:58.409> hear<00:01:58.619> any<00:01:58.770> more

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
gap Theory probably won't hear any more

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.440 
gap Theory probably won't hear any more
of<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.610> from<00:01:59.790> me<00:02:01.610> do<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> believe<00:02:02.940> it<00:02:03.149> doesn't

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
of it from me do I believe it doesn't

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.080 
of it from me do I believe it doesn't
work<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> reason<00:02:04.799> why<00:02:04.920> I'm

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
work is that the reason why I'm

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.609 
work is that the reason why I'm
disbanding<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.509> no<00:02:06.690> that's<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.470> reason

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
disbanding it no that's not the reason

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
disbanding it no that's not the reason
at<00:02:07.799> all<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.220> fact<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:10.259> does<00:02:10.500> why<00:02:11.060> however<00:02:12.140> as<00:02:13.140> I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
at all in fact it does why however as I

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.890 
at all in fact it does why however as I
just<00:02:13.500> stated<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:17.330> it's<00:02:18.330> going<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> take<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.690> lot

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
just stated it it's going to take a lot

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.199 
just stated it it's going to take a lot
more<00:02:18.930> work<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:21.470> my<00:02:22.470> hopes

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
more work and my hopes

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.509 
more work and my hopes
we're<00:02:24.209> not<00:02:24.360> met<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.890> therefore<00:02:26.040> Mun<00:02:26.340> take<00:02:26.489> a

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
we're not met so therefore Mun take a

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.000 
we're not met so therefore Mun take a
different<00:02:26.760> approach<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:29.780> anyway

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
different approach in this but anyway

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.500 
different approach in this but anyway
hope<00:02:32.010> y'all<00:02:32.250> keep<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.550> more<00:02:32.790> as<00:02:33.120> in<00:02:33.360> college

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
hope y'all keep it more as in college

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.039 
hope y'all keep it more as in college

history is my fireplace this year it is
getting<00:02:37.260> quite<00:02:37.470> cool<00:02:37.890> here<00:02:38.100> in<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> Midwest

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
getting quite cool here in the Midwest

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:47.569 
getting quite cool here in the Midwest
so<00:02:40.110> anyway<00:02:41.630> thanks<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:42.750> watching<00:02:43.080> guys<00:02:46.579> we'll
