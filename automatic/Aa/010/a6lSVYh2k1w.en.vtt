00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.060 

basically<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.540> makes<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.930> boat<00:01:46.049> fly<00:01:46.380> faster

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
basically it makes the boat fly faster

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.850 
basically it makes the boat fly faster
and<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:48.299> gives<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.259> bit<00:01:49.470> better

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
and it gives it a little bit better

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.240 
and it gives it a little bit better
range<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:52.820> should<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.850> pretty<00:01:54.920> good<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
range so it should be pretty good and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.480 
range so it should be pretty good and
