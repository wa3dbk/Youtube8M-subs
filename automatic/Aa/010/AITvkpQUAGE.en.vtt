00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
again now this is just after boot up

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.880 
again now this is just after boot up
secondly<00:02:21.730> remember<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.940> did<00:02:23.890> applications

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
secondly remember I did applications

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.970 
secondly remember I did applications
isn't<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:26.410> connected<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.530> camera<00:02:27.799> is

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
isn't it connected to the camera is

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.240 
isn't it connected to the camera is
obviously<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.459> video<00:02:28.700> camera<00:02:29.799> we<00:02:30.799> try<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.069> do

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
obviously the video camera we try to do

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.709 
obviously the video camera we try to do
that<00:02:33.069> we<00:02:34.069> have<00:02:34.160> nothing<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.840> just<00:02:35.870> cancels<00:02:36.349> out
