00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.670
 the following happens in the name of the people 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.980
 judgment 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.080
 The accused will be at the age of two and 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.080
 sentenced to three months' imprisonment 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.110
 Please take a seat 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.570
 I come now to the grounds 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.710
 the story is based on a true one 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.300
 We do not even make history 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.919
 but that's what it was 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.720
 almost our source of inspiration 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.910
 as jutta league our producers 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.009
 had read this article and me 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.469
 coincidentally, too, and then as we did 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.610
 we have virtually communicated about it 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.820
 had the feeling we have a 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.820
 history 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:41.800
 I think for the filmic means 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.129
 we clearly run direction thriller 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.399
 but the figures are very grounded in the 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.320
 here and now and we want to 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.579
 tell this story the drama 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.109
 do not neglect that means we 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.440
 really want real figures 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.440
 tell 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.980
 is a pocket knife with the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.660
 brown handle what might it do 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.660
 seen 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:22.950
 I have to leave this lying here 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.950
 totally on the thing which maybe 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.360
 okay i hope i believe it's someone 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.670
 is the break in the so to speak 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.240
 the moods and the character 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.030
 colors happen very abruptly there is there 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.520
 no big no big transitions yes 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.570
 and that's just one of them 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.710
 bad or maybe not at all 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.200
 predictable figure which already lead to it 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.070
 You can do that before sometimes 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.070
 be scared 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.149
 what happens here is already in 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.230
 a certain way so extreme that 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.970
 That must be in a human already 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.320
 somehow lie in it and in the character 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.430
 and in the psyche of a human in it 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.620
 lie that can not be said so to speak 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.060
 solely biographically justified 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.600
 because otherwise I would be through the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.400
 go to town and would actually have 300 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.120
 amoklÃ¤ufer give 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.500
 how does the customers react ? 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.180
 ask and fear there is actually 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.390
 Whenever you fear this carpet 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.189
 including that that something happens 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.120
 that to the children what happens you have 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:51.049
 talked to bernd 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:53.090
 I have his voice you can do it 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.560
 ill he has tried me from the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.780
 bridge we wanted to crash 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.670
 How naive are you to kill yourself? 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.209
 I do not want to get involved with him 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.140
 let me in 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.780
 i believe that mister stubborn and 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.480
 stalking is the problem that one the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.090
 relatively unconscious is that 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.060
 you can do so little about it and that 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.920
 The law does not really matter 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.530
 protects 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.510
 because only when something happened 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.930
 you can intervene and that means that 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.180
 stalker if he knows what he limits 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.889
 it must be possible to keep it that way 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.790
 sacrifice really on the edge of 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.269
 bring despair 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.730
 yes of course I lie and believe that 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.870
 you a convicted offender and 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.239
 I have the rape 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.819
 thought out or what Mr. board 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.060
 also filed a complaint against her 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.169
 the injury and driver's escape 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.190
 Mr. Fischer feels from out to 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:51.980
 wrongly accused and persecuted her for 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.139
 paranoid i believe important for the movie 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.510
 is or like me too miguel 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.930
 has understood how a show wants to show him 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.900
 Truly the truth 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.109
 all moments extremely permeable pure 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.760
 are and you do not try somehow 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.530
 to put figures over it 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.680
 which then were original 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.870
 but just the situation as you 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.870
 Written are really to play
