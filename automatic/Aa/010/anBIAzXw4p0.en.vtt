00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.620

 Igor Matvienko 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:51.000
 Do I have a contract about one thing that during 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.599
 modulation at the end irina did not take off and did not 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.240
 fluttered around the hall needed to fly 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.580
 in on straight so circle around fly 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.710

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:14.490
 cinematographically Viktor Drobob and I 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.050
 great regret that this song is written 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.530
 not in Russian 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.120
 but beautiful at the end of the modulation and not enough 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.250

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.000

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.990
 aisles 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.330
 rehearsed what ira did 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.220
 great 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:32.270
 how to say a big feat because 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.440
 nobody knows what she has 20 minutes before 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.160
 exit and pricked 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:39.620

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.980
 well only modulation course 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.810
 it was heard that everything was creaking now but 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.110
 anyway, I thought there would be no sound 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:57.130
 I was very worried but everything was common 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.130
 worthy enough
