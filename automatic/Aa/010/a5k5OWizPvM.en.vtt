00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
is there is no CD drive so that's why

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.849 
is there is no CD drive so that's why
we're<00:00:25.949> not<00:00:25.980> calling<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.519> thing<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.789> CDJ<00:00:27.859> you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
we're not calling this thing a CDJ you

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.630

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
play a music back from a USB device so

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.030 
play a music back from a USB device so
up<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> USB<00:00:33.540> port<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.590> notice<00:00:34.890> it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
up here is a USB port you notice it

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.670 
up here is a USB port you notice it
blinks<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.820> select<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.540> color<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.530> your

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
blinks you can select a color for your

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.709 
blinks you can select a color for your
USB<00:00:38.100> stick<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.700> lights<00:00:38.940> up<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> color

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
USB stick and it lights up in the color

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.080 
USB stick and it lights up in the color
so<00:00:39.989> that's<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.260> new<00:00:40.379> feature<00:00:40.559> that's<00:00:41.280> first

so that's a new feature that's first

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.290 
so that's a new feature that's first
introduced<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.809> x<00:00:43.110> DJ<00:00:43.640> 1000<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:44.820> you're

the track by playlist by DPM by key you
know<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.820> for<00:00:59.969> example<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.719> into<00:01:01.460> he

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
know so for example if you go into he

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.640 
know so for example if you go into he
going<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.820> track<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:04.049> go<00:01:04.229> into<00:01:04.470> menu

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
going to track you can now go into menu

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.679 
going to track you can now go into menu
or<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> know<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.909> now<00:01:06.030> sort<00:01:06.479> your

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.560 
results so let's say you want to sort
them<00:01:08.220> by<00:01:08.250> BPM<00:01:08.760> from<00:01:09.570> 80<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.130> 200<00:01:11.130> 40<00:01:11.820> BPM<00:01:12.240> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
them by BPM from 80 to 200 40 BPM you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.890 
them by BPM from 80 to 200 40 BPM you
have<00:01:12.750> all<00:01:13.110> your<00:01:13.320> tracks<00:01:13.619> sort<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.790> way<00:01:15.000> so

have all your tracks sort it that way so

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.679 
have all your tracks sort it that way so
this<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.080> your<00:01:16.229> brows<00:01:16.590> feature<00:01:16.920> right<00:01:17.280> here

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
this is your brows feature right here

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.969 
this is your brows feature right here
let's<00:01:18.689> get<00:01:18.900> some<00:01:19.080> music<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:19.380> right<00:01:19.770> here

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
let's get some music going right here

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.700 
let's get some music going right here
you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.180> down<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.600> mahak<00:01:22.080> used<00:01:22.530> to

you can see down there mahak used to

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
you can see down there mahak used to
access<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.250> accuse<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.420> no<00:01:24.540> hawk<00:01:24.720> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
access to accuse there are no hawk you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
access to accuse there are no hawk you
buttons<00:01:25.229> over<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> perform

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
buttons over here I go on to the perform

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.140 
buttons over here I go on to the perform
screen<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:28.049> here

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.760 

on<00:01:32.150> my<00:01:32.330> Hawk<00:01:32.510> use<00:01:32.780> if<00:01:33.050> I<00:01:33.140> want<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.380> record<00:01:33.530> new

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
on my Hawk use if I want to record new

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.370 
on my Hawk use if I want to record new
hot<00:01:34.100> cues<00:01:34.780> just<00:01:35.780> go<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:35.930> record

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.260 

and<00:01:40.770> flame<00:01:41.070> back<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.579> way

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
and flame back that way

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.330 
and flame back that way
so<00:01:43.869> down<00:01:44.289> here<00:01:44.350> is<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:44.829> waveform<00:01:45.399> that<00:01:47.159> gives<00:01:48.159> me

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
so down here is a waveform that gives me

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.609 
so down here is a waveform that gives me
an<00:01:48.640> overview<00:01:49.119> of<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.420> entire<00:01:49.600> track<00:01:50.140> this<00:01:50.469> is

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
an overview of the entire track this is

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.520 
an overview of the entire track this is
of<00:01:50.770> course<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:51.189> touchscreen<00:01:51.700> that's<00:01:52.570> our<00:01:53.229> very

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
of course a touchscreen that's our very

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.050 
of course a touchscreen that's our very
first<00:01:53.770> player<00:01:54.070> that<00:01:54.340> introduces<00:01:54.909> this

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
first player that introduces this

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.809 
first player that introduces this
technology<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.319> I<00:01:56.350> can<00:01:56.619> needle<00:01:56.979> drop<00:01:57.250> by

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
technology so I can needle drop by

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.779 
technology so I can needle drop by
simply<00:01:58.299> putting<00:01:58.600> my<00:01:58.840> finger<00:01:59.380> right<00:01:59.670> over<00:02:00.670> the

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
simply putting my finger right over the

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.690 
simply putting my finger right over the
waveform<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.479> then<00:02:02.020> up<00:02:02.170> here<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.979> see<00:02:03.280> a<00:02:03.310> more

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
waveform and then up here you see a more

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.339 
waveform and then up here you see a more
detailed<00:02:04.560> version<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.709> the<00:02:05.860> waveform<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:08.170> can

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
detailed version of the waveform you can

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.630 
detailed version of the waveform you can
zoom<00:02:08.379> in<00:02:08.799> and<00:02:08.830> can<00:02:09.429> zoom<00:02:09.640> out<00:02:10.019> and<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:12.250> colors

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
zoom in and can zoom out and the colors

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.940 
zoom in and can zoom out and the colors
right<00:02:12.819> there<00:02:13.030> indicate<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.629> beats<00:02:13.840> so<00:02:14.349> right

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
right there indicate the beats so right

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.940 
right there indicate the beats so right
there<00:02:15.250> red<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.239> one<00:02:17.040> two<00:02:18.040> three<00:02:18.549> four<00:02:18.910> 1234

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
there red is the one two three four 1234

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:28.080 
there red is the one two three four 1234
I<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:22.360> up<00:02:22.660> here<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:25.660> shows<00:02:25.959> me<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.610> beats

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
I have up here this shows me the beats
