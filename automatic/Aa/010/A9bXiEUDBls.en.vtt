00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
have been put in in the past oh maybe

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.450 
have been put in in the past oh maybe
ten<00:00:54.270> years<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.930> more<00:00:55.469> than<00:00:55.710> likely<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
ten years is more than likely going to

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.330 
ten years is more than likely going to
have<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> float<00:00:57.210> switch<00:00:57.859> it's<00:00:58.859> probably<00:00:58.980> look

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
have a float switch it's probably look

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.180 
have a float switch it's probably look
something<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.649> what<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
something like this what you can do is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.960 
something like this what you can do is
just<00:01:02.219> pull<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.390> top<00:01:03.600> off<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.400> and<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:05.909> if

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
just pull the top off of it and see if

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.830 
just pull the top off of it and see if
there's<00:01:06.180> any<00:01:06.330> water<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.310> if<00:01:08.420> if<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.450> float<00:01:09.810> is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
there's any water and if if the float is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.020 
there's any water and if if the float is
in<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.229> position<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:11.430> been<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.760> turn<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
in this position it's been to turn the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.539 
in this position it's been to turn the
system<00:01:12.210> off<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.140> cannot<00:01:13.409> run<00:01:13.710> yours

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
system off so that it cannot run yours

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.340 
system off so that it cannot run yours
can<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.909> wired<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> only<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:15.900> outdoor

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
can be wired so that only your outdoor

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.070 
can be wired so that only your outdoor
unit<00:01:16.680> doesn't<00:01:16.860> run<00:01:17.479> again<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> way<00:01:18.930> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
unit doesn't run again not the way that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.100 
unit doesn't run again not the way that
I<00:01:19.140> would<00:01:19.619> prefer<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.340> wired<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.110> it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
I would prefer it to be wired but it

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
I would prefer it to be wired but it
could<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> way<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
could be that way so if you have a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.670 
could be that way so if you have a
problem<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.840> might<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.259> check<00:01:25.619> your

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
problem you might want to check your

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.990 
problem you might want to check your
breakers<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:26.430> check<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.759> float

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
breakers and then check your float

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
breakers and then check your float
switch<00:01:27.409> this<00:01:28.409> one<00:01:28.619> being<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> attic<00:01:29.400> it

through<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.299> other<00:01:39.540> tube<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.829> if<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.700> have

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
through this other tube so if you have

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.580 
through this other tube so if you have
one<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> attic<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:43.079> went<00:01:43.380> on

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
one in the attic and it's all went on

one in the attic and it's all went on
this<00:01:44.460> huge<00:01:44.670> pan<00:01:45.110> we<00:01:46.110> also<00:01:46.259> need<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> clear<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
this huge pan we also need to clear the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.510 
this huge pan we also need to clear the
drain<00:01:47.159> line<00:01:48.439> you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.619> clear<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> drain<00:01:50.280> line

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
drain line you can clear the drain line

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.840 
drain line you can clear the drain line
outside<00:01:52.070> usually<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> drain<00:01:53.399> line<00:01:53.579> will<00:01:53.700> come

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
outside usually the drain line will come

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.160 
outside usually the drain line will come
out<00:01:54.030> where<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.670> outdoor<00:01:56.670> unit<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.299> because<00:01:58.020> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
out where the outdoor unit is because it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.840 
out where the outdoor unit is because it
usually<00:01:58.290> follows<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.040> refrigerant<00:01:59.610> lines

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
usually follows the refrigerant lines

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.109 
usually follows the refrigerant lines
and<00:02:00.560> then<00:02:01.560> you'll<00:02:01.770> have<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.579> refrigerant

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
and then you'll have the refrigerant

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.090 
and then you'll have the refrigerant
lines<00:02:03.299> going<00:02:03.570> between<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.229> air<00:02:04.439> handler<00:02:04.890> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
lines going between the air handler and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.789 
lines going between the air handler and
the<00:02:05.729> unit<00:02:06.060> outside<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.810> therefore<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.560> drain

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
the unit outside and therefore the drain

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.830 
the unit outside and therefore the drain
line<00:02:08.009> would<00:02:08.220> would<00:02:08.789> usually<00:02:09.030> take<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.599> same

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
line would would usually take the same

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.530 
line would would usually take the same
path

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
path

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.839 
path
so<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.599> can<00:02:11.780> find<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.079> PVC<00:02:12.439> tube<00:02:12.890> outside<00:02:13.459> or

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
so you can find a PVC tube outside or

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.050 
so you can find a PVC tube outside or
pipe<00:02:14.540> or<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.439> might<00:02:15.620> find<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.250> what<00:02:16.760> we<00:02:16.879> call<00:02:17.030> a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
pipe or you might find a what we call a

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.880 
pipe or you might find a what we call a
poly<00:02:17.450> pipe<00:02:17.840> which<00:02:18.829> is<00:02:18.859> a<00:02:19.040> black<00:02:19.750> flexible

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
poly pipe which is a black flexible

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.179 
poly pipe which is a black flexible
almost<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:22.099> hose<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:23.140> drain<00:02:24.140> line<00:02:24.379> and<00:02:24.650> that's

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
almost a hose like drain line and that's

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.890 
almost a hose like drain line and that's
where<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.459> want<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.819> put<00:02:26.329> your<00:02:26.480> drain<00:02:26.689> line

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
where you want to put your drain line

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.959 
where you want to put your drain line
around<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.700> are<00:02:28.700> your<00:02:28.909> vacuum<00:02:29.389> your<00:02:30.379> wet<00:02:31.099> dry

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:31.969 
around and are your vacuum your wet dry

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.209 
around and are your vacuum your wet dry
vac<00:02:32.239> around<00:02:32.659> and<00:02:33.019> see<00:02:33.620> if<00:02:33.709> you<00:02:33.799> can<00:02:33.920> suck<00:02:34.189> it

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:34.219 
vac around and see if you can suck it

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.360 
vac around and see if you can suck it
out<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.700> get<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:35.629> running<00:02:35.810> again<00:02:35.989> if<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.980> have
