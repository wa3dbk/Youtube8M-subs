 today 2 c 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.070

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.810
 zombies words of affection was already happening 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.050

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.960
 saw unity tell you it's not easy 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:48.600
 all so there's a goal to stay 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:54.809
 to be deleted I'm sharing my 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.520
 ideas and I would surely not that this 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.890
 that the summit do indeed depend on this 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.890
 I was going to sing well at all 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.760
 it's hard when you go there it's over 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:17.690
 said although it's not that at all 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:25.810
 even manage more liberal that in one shot 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:25.810
 theatre 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.520
 the rest of you what she is that 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.810
 has sought so much for everyone each time 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.160
 we have a new notoriety 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.340
 if that's what does not penalize us what 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.340
 I prefer 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:23.320
 shameful preconceived you see it's 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.940
 still once beauty follow my 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.940
 fault and a super fast 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:45.760
 it would be difficult light gun 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:16.750
 next I will renew that 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.750
 had this extension is crying 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.019
 2 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:25.639
 I am less pressure action here 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.900
 so did my mates tell me that everything 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.550
 it is to see his hand is in dis 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.740
 just what kind of setback 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.740
 by the way the worst has happened but only 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:48.400
 two at a time this people but especially 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.400
 toulouse which gives 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.980
 but it's also the first time that I 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.980
 so I'm pretty happy with the choice 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:22.130
 and here we are claiming is not 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:27.770

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:32.270
 job is from 1400 to 1700 add up close 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:35.949

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.870
