for the second star lava hound explodes

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.089 
for the second star lava hound explodes
that<00:04:19.630> is<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.870> defense<00:04:20.229> of<00:04:20.410> lava<00:04:20.650> hound<00:04:20.950> and

that is the defense of lava hound and

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.279 
that is the defense of lava hound and
that<00:04:21.609> is<00:04:21.880> definitely<00:04:22.120> slowing<00:04:22.690> this<00:04:22.930> attack

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
that is definitely slowing this attack

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.260 
that is definitely slowing this attack
down<00:04:23.500> preventing<00:04:24.310> jud<00:04:24.520> head<00:04:24.700> from<00:04:24.820> having

down preventing jud head from having

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.330 
down preventing jud head from having
really<00:04:25.479> any<00:04:25.690> chance<00:04:26.050> at<00:04:26.229> three<00:04:26.470> stars<00:04:26.770> that

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
really any chance at three stars that

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.670 
really any chance at three stars that
wipes<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.789> lot<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.569> attackers<00:04:29.139> out<00:04:29.349> of<00:04:29.590> the

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
wipes a lot of the attackers out of the

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.119 
wipes a lot of the attackers out of the
way<00:04:29.889> and<00:04:30.129> now<00:04:30.550> he<00:04:30.610> has<00:04:30.940> his<00:04:30.970> heroes<00:04:31.449> left<00:04:32.129> 63%

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.040 
way and now he has his heroes left 63%
damage<00:04:33.430> looks<00:04:33.610> like<00:04:33.849> maybe<00:04:34.150> he's<00:04:34.750> going<00:04:34.960> to

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
damage looks like maybe he's going to

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.899 
damage looks like maybe he's going to
have<00:04:35.169> a<00:04:35.199> shot<00:04:35.500> at<00:04:35.710> grabbing<00:04:36.129> the<00:04:36.400> third<00:04:36.610> star
