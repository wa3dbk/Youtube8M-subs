there<00:00:02.679> are<00:00:02.800> numerous<00:00:03.010> things<00:00:03.219> that<00:00:03.699> result<00:00:04.090> in

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.450 
there are numerous things that result in

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.759 
there are numerous things that result in
a<00:00:04.689> patient<00:00:05.019> needing<00:00:05.259> to<00:00:05.319> have<00:00:05.470> heart<00:00:05.740> surgery

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:05.769 
a patient needing to have heart surgery

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:08.640 
a patient needing to have heart surgery
today<00:00:06.310> and<00:00:06.669> that<00:00:07.000> would<00:00:07.149> include<00:00:08.020> a<00:00:08.260> problem

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
today and that would include a problem

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.470 
today and that would include a problem
with<00:00:08.860> their<00:00:09.070> coronary<00:00:09.580> arteries<00:00:09.969> blockages

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
with their coronary arteries blockages

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.419 
with their coronary arteries blockages
of<00:00:10.540> their<00:00:10.750> coronary<00:00:11.080> arteries<00:00:11.559> then<00:00:12.160> you<00:00:12.280> have

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 
of their coronary arteries then you have

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.249 
of their coronary arteries then you have
a<00:00:12.460> huge<00:00:12.910> category<00:00:13.269> that's<00:00:13.690> actually<00:00:14.049> growing

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:14.259 
a huge category that's actually growing

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.740 
a huge category that's actually growing
now<00:00:14.620> where<00:00:15.070> the<00:00:15.309> valves<00:00:15.790> either<00:00:16.000> leak<00:00:16.509> or

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
now where the valves either leak or

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.909 
now where the valves either leak or
they're<00:00:17.320> too<00:00:17.439> tight

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:17.919 
they're too tight

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.679 
they're too tight
the<00:00:18.279> third<00:00:18.580> category<00:00:18.850> all<00:00:19.359> they're<00:00:19.510> less

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
the third category all they're less

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.210 
the third category all they're less
common<00:00:19.720> but<00:00:20.230> still<00:00:20.470> exists<00:00:20.949> in<00:00:21.070> which

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
common but still exists in which

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.710 
common but still exists in which
patients<00:00:21.640> have<00:00:21.760> had<00:00:21.789> congenital<00:00:22.570> heart

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
patients have had congenital heart

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.320 
patients have had congenital heart
problems<00:00:23.289> but<00:00:23.800> they<00:00:23.920> were<00:00:23.980> born<00:00:24.340> with<00:00:24.430> and<00:00:24.880> now

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
problems but they were born with and now

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.609 
problems but they were born with and now
they've<00:00:25.510> grown<00:00:25.689> into<00:00:25.840> adulthood<00:00:26.289> either

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
they've grown into adulthood either

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.189 
they've grown into adulthood either
having<00:00:27.039> had<00:00:27.279> them<00:00:27.640> diagnosed<00:00:28.420> late<00:00:28.960> in

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
having had them diagnosed late in

having had them diagnosed late in
adulthood<00:00:29.769> or<00:00:30.449> knowing<00:00:31.449> that<00:00:31.599> it<00:00:31.689> was<00:00:31.840> there

but<00:00:32.320> now<00:00:32.529> needing<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.129> have<00:00:33.250> something<00:00:33.730> done

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
but now needing to have something done

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.439 
but now needing to have something done
about<00:00:34.449> it<00:00:34.510> a<00:00:34.780> fourth<00:00:35.500> category<00:00:35.680> would<00:00:36.159> be

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
about it a fourth category would be

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.430 
about it a fourth category would be
electrical<00:00:37.449> problems<00:00:37.839> with<00:00:38.019> the<00:00:38.110> heart<00:00:38.260> in

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
electrical problems with the heart in

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.320 
electrical problems with the heart in
which<00:00:38.769> there<00:00:39.040> would<00:00:39.129> be<00:00:39.190> some<00:00:39.519> conductivity

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
which there would be some conductivity

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.930 
which there would be some conductivity
problem<00:00:40.809> or<00:00:40.930> rapid<00:00:41.769> heartbeat<00:00:42.159> problem<00:00:42.640> that

problem or rapid heartbeat problem that

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.189 
problem or rapid heartbeat problem that
would<00:00:43.059> result<00:00:43.420> in<00:00:43.690> needing<00:00:43.989> to<00:00:44.049> have

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
would result in needing to have

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.439 
would result in needing to have
specialized<00:00:44.860> studies<00:00:45.220> done<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.699> then

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
specialized studies done and then

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.539 
specialized studies done and then
possible<00:00:47.229> interventions<00:00:47.920> traditionally

possible interventions traditionally
everybody<00:00:49.059> knows<00:00:49.299> about<00:00:49.600> open<00:00:49.930> heart<00:00:50.080> surgery

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
everybody knows about open heart surgery

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.410 
everybody knows about open heart surgery
through<00:00:50.500> what<00:00:50.799> we<00:00:50.890> call<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:51.309> sternotomy<00:00:52.030> where

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
through what we call a sternotomy where

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.180 
through what we call a sternotomy where
people<00:00:52.720> quote<00:00:52.930> have<00:00:53.350> their<00:00:53.589> chest<00:00:53.920> cracked

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
people quote have their chest cracked

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.490 
people quote have their chest cracked
which<00:00:54.519> is<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.879> typical<00:00:55.600> terminology<00:00:56.379> for

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
which is the typical terminology for

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.079 
which is the typical terminology for
that<00:00:56.559> but<00:00:56.920> basically<00:00:57.280> it's<00:00:57.519> dividing<00:00:58.000> the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089 
that but basically it's dividing the

00:00:58.089 --> 00:00:59.820 
that but basically it's dividing the
breastbone<00:00:58.390> going<00:00:59.260> through<00:00:59.409> the<00:00:59.470> middle<00:00:59.710> of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830 
breastbone going through the middle of

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.829 
breastbone going through the middle of
the<00:00:59.949> sternum<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.460> get<00:01:01.119> access<00:01:01.269> to<00:01:01.479> the<00:01:01.659> heart

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
the sternum to get access to the heart

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.899 
the sternum to get access to the heart
and<00:01:02.019> this<00:01:02.080> has<00:01:02.260> served<00:01:02.830> physicians<00:01:03.760> and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
and this has served physicians and

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.900 
and this has served physicians and
patients<00:01:04.059> very<00:01:04.629> well<00:01:04.930> for<00:01:05.379> 30-40<00:01:06.340> years<00:01:06.370> we

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
patients very well for 30-40 years we

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.180 
patients very well for 30-40 years we
have<00:01:07.090> become<00:01:07.240> more<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.140> more<00:01:08.410> comfortable

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
have become more and more comfortable

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.940 
have become more and more comfortable
with<00:01:09.490> doing<00:01:10.480> the<00:01:10.870> same<00:01:11.170> types<00:01:11.500> of<00:01:11.680> procedures

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
with doing the same types of procedures

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.610 
with doing the same types of procedures
through<00:01:12.310> smaller<00:01:12.670> incisions<00:01:12.790> so<00:01:13.630> we<00:01:14.080> have

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
through smaller incisions so we have

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.310 
through smaller incisions so we have
begun<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:15.250> fairly<00:01:15.850> comprehensive<00:01:16.210> program<00:01:16.960> and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
begun a fairly comprehensive program and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.200 
begun a fairly comprehensive program and
where<00:01:17.770> every<00:01:18.220> patient<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.640> comes<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.180> our

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
where every patient that comes to our

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.540 
where every patient that comes to our
Center<00:01:19.660> is<00:01:19.810> looked<00:01:20.140> at<00:01:20.350> initially<00:01:21.160> for<00:01:21.520> a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
Center is looked at initially for a

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.400 
Center is looked at initially for a
minimally<00:01:22.030> invasive<00:01:22.060> approach<00:01:22.510> a<00:01:22.990> small

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
minimally invasive approach a small

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.410 
minimally invasive approach a small
incision<00:01:23.770> approach<00:01:24.250> or<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.580> robotic<00:01:25.090> approach

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
incision approach or a robotic approach

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.330 
incision approach or a robotic approach
one<00:01:25.810> of<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:25.990> two<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.410> if<00:01:27.040> they<00:01:27.190> are

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
one of the two and if they are

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.710 
one of the two and if they are
candidates<00:01:27.850> for<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:28.030> then<00:01:28.360> that's<00:01:28.510> how<00:01:28.660> we

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
candidates for that then that's how we

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.740 
candidates for that then that's how we
do<00:01:28.960> that<00:01:29.170> if<00:01:29.320> we<00:01:30.010> can't<00:01:30.310> do<00:01:31.060> it<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.360> way<00:01:31.510> then

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
do that if we can't do it that way then

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.930 
do that if we can't do it that way then
of<00:01:31.780> course<00:01:32.080> we<00:01:32.260> offer<00:01:32.409> them<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.950> provide<00:01:33.730> them

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
of course we offer them and provide them

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.340 
of course we offer them and provide them
the<00:01:33.970> traditional<00:01:34.240> approach<00:01:34.870> but<00:01:35.080> every

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
the traditional approach but every

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.680 
the traditional approach but every
patient<00:01:35.710> first<00:01:36.220> is<00:01:36.460> considered<00:01:36.940> for<00:01:37.180> a<00:01:37.210> small

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
patient first is considered for a small

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.990 
patient first is considered for a small
incision<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.290> less<00:01:38.560> invasive<00:01:38.740> surgery<00:01:39.370> I<00:01:39.580> do

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
incision and less invasive surgery I do

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.390 
incision and less invasive surgery I do
think<00:01:40.330> it's<00:01:40.450> important<00:01:40.960> today<00:01:41.290> as<00:01:42.010> we<00:01:42.250> go

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
think it's important today as we go

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.580 
think it's important today as we go
forward<00:01:42.730> that<00:01:42.909> patients<00:01:43.780> understand<00:01:44.230> that<00:01:44.440> as

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
forward that patients understand that as

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.280 
forward that patients understand that as
we<00:01:44.950> have<00:01:45.400> emerging<00:01:46.060> technologies<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:47.140> are

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
we have emerging technologies that are
