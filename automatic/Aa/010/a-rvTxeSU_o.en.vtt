00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.169 

okay<00:00:01.110> today<00:00:01.500> we'll<00:00:01.800> discover<00:00:02.370> them<00:00:02.790> mask

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
okay today we'll discover them mask

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.769 
okay today we'll discover them mask
modifier<00:00:04.009> mask<00:00:05.009> modifier<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:06.000> right<00:00:06.420> here<00:00:06.690> of

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
modifier mask modifier is right here of

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.310 
modifier mask modifier is right here of
course<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.580> it<00:00:08.580> needs<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.450> vertex<00:00:09.960> groups

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
course and it needs a vertex groups

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.990 
course and it needs a vertex groups
right<00:00:10.620> now<00:00:10.769> it's<00:00:10.920> not<00:00:11.070> doing<00:00:11.130> anything<00:00:11.580> so

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
right now it's not doing anything so

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.230 
right now it's not doing anything so
let's<00:00:12.210> convert<00:00:12.599> let's<00:00:13.530> create<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.639> vertex

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
let's convert let's create a vertex

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.230 
let's convert let's create a vertex
group<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.859> to<00:00:16.859> do<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.730> need<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
group and to do so you just need to

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.630 
group and to do so you just need to
select<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.230> couple<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.619> vertices<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.400> saw

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
select a couple of vertices with saw

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.300 
select a couple of vertices with saw
select<00:00:21.090> one<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> longer<00:00:21.869> edge<00:00:22.109> loops<00:00:22.500> here

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
select one of the longer edge loops here

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.230 
select one of the longer edge loops here
and<00:00:23.630> maybe<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.900> one<00:00:25.460> okay<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.580> looks<00:00:26.820> nice

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
and maybe that one okay that looks nice

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.470 
and maybe that one okay that looks nice
just<00:00:27.510> press<00:00:28.349> plus<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.039> then<00:00:29.580> assign<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.300> can

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
just press plus and then assign you can

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.470 
just press plus and then assign you can
rename<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.050> group<00:00:31.080> obviously<00:00:31.759> but<00:00:32.759> that's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
rename the group obviously but that's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.360 
rename the group obviously but that's
not<00:00:33.690> very<00:00:33.719> important<00:00:34.260> important<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.040> we

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
not very important important is that we

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.900 
not very important important is that we
click<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.760> sign<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.270> now<00:00:36.570> go<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.910> vertex

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
click the sign if you now go to vertex

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.319 
click the sign if you now go to vertex

ctrl tab then you can see that in fact
those<00:00:46.530> vertices<00:00:47.070> are<00:00:47.309> selected<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:48.500> if<00:00:49.500> we

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
those vertices are selected and if we

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.250 
those vertices are selected and if we
now<00:00:49.860> choose<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.489> group<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:51.149> see<00:00:51.420> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
now choose this group you can see that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
now choose this group you can see that
only<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.550> group<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.149> visible<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.100> if<00:00:56.100> we

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
only this group is visible and if we

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.090 
only this group is visible and if we
invert<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.469> parts<00:00:58.980> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
invert that you can see that parts of

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.790 
invert that you can see that parts of
the<00:00:59.250> monkey<00:00:59.609> are<00:00:59.820> gone<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.590> essentially<00:01:01.590> this

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the monkey are gone and essentially this

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.090 
the monkey are gone and essentially this
is<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> same<00:01:02.399> thing<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.879> hiding<00:01:03.329> these<00:01:04.100> except

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
is the same thing as hiding these except

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.200 
is the same thing as hiding these except
for<00:01:05.129> oh<00:01:05.640> well<00:01:06.090> sorry<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.409> press<00:01:07.680> H<00:01:08.210> while

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
for oh well sorry if you press H while

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.500 
for oh well sorry if you press H while
those<00:01:09.510> vertices<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.290> selected<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.130> case

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
those vertices are selected just in case

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.070 
those vertices are selected just in case
um<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.350> hide<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.189> once<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:15.080> enter

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
um you can hide these but once you enter

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.770 
um you can hide these but once you enter
mesh<00:01:16.890> mode<00:01:17.549> object<00:01:18.299> mode

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
mesh mode object mode

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.170 
mesh mode object mode
they'll<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.950> visible<00:01:20.340> again<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> mask

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
they'll be visible again so the mask

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.380 
they'll be visible again so the mask
modifier<00:01:21.750> does<00:01:21.990> exactly<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:23.460> hides<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
modifier does exactly that it hides the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
modifier does exactly that it hides the
vertices<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.890> selected<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.549> your

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
vertices that you have selected in your

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.679 
vertices that you have selected in your
group<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.560> does<00:01:28.560> not<00:01:28.740> display<00:01:29.400> them<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.970> edit

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
group and does not display them in edit

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.960 
group and does not display them in edit
mode<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.250> object<00:01:32.250> mode<00:01:32.400> I'm<00:01:32.549> sorry

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
mode and object mode I'm sorry

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.740 
mode and object mode I'm sorry
and<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:34.770> modifier<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.939> probably<00:01:36.479> more

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and this modifier is probably more

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.980 
and this modifier is probably more
useful<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.619> modeling<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.780> final

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
useful for modeling then for the final

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.130 
useful for modeling then for the final
render<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:41.340> sure<00:01:41.640> how<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.180> would<00:01:42.540> um<00:01:42.810> oh

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
render I'm not sure how you would um oh

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.950 
render I'm not sure how you would um oh
you<00:01:43.920> would<00:01:44.280> use<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.299> final<00:01:45.600> render

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you would use this in a final render

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
you would use this in a final render
except<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.680> maybe<00:01:46.860> combined<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
except for maybe combined with a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.930 
except for maybe combined with a
solidify<00:01:48.689> modifier

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
solidify modifier

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.420 

that<00:01:51.690> looks<00:01:51.900> interesting<00:01:52.410> but<00:01:52.740> anyways<00:01:53.190> we'll

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
that looks interesting but anyways we'll

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.080 
that looks interesting but anyways we'll
get<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> solidify<00:01:54.450> modifier<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:55.680> time

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
get to the solidify modifier in time

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.260 
get to the solidify modifier in time
okay

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
okay

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.960 
okay
that's<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.560> mass<00:01:58.770> modifier<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.640> rather

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
that's the mass modifier for you rather

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.990 
that's the mass modifier for you rather
short<00:02:00.330> one<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:01.130> we<00:02:02.130> will<00:02:02.400> talk<00:02:02.640> about<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
short one and we will talk about the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000 
short one and we will talk about the
mirror<00:02:03.330> modifier<00:02:03.630> next<00:02:04.230> time<00:02:04.380> which<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
mirror modifier next time which is a

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.140 
mirror modifier next time which is a
very<00:02:05.400> important<00:02:05.970> one<00:02:06.120> thanks<00:02:06.690> for<00:02:06.810> watching
