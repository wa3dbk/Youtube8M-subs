dimensions and laid out a floor plan
with<00:01:50.000> some<00:01:50.299> chords<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.899> had<00:01:51.049> laying<00:01:51.259> around

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
with some chords I had laying around

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.380 
with some chords I had laying around
from<00:01:51.799> like<00:01:51.829> my<00:01:52.009> hot<00:01:52.189> glue<00:01:52.340> gun<00:01:52.399> in<00:01:52.670> my<00:01:52.700> clap<00:01:53.090> top

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
from like my hot glue gun in my clap top

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.209 
from like my hot glue gun in my clap top
took<00:01:53.929> some<00:01:54.079> wires<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.560> some<00:01:54.649> wire<00:01:54.829> cutters

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
took some wires and some wire cutters

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.609 
took some wires and some wire cutters
and<00:01:55.399> I<00:01:55.490> started<00:01:55.880> making<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.630> base<00:01:56.869> for<00:01:57.439> my

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
and I started making the base for my

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.679 
and I started making the base for my
tree<00:01:57.920> branches<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.640> wires<00:01:58.880> are<00:01:59.299> basically

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
tree branches the wires are basically

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.510 
tree branches the wires are basically
just<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:00.439> it'll<00:02:00.619> be<00:02:00.770> more<00:02:00.920> sturdy<00:02:01.250> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
just so that it'll be more sturdy I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.399 
just so that it'll be more sturdy I
figured<00:02:02.390> out<00:02:02.569> that<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.810> guys<00:02:02.929> couldn't<00:02:03.350> see

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
figured out that you guys couldn't see

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.190 
figured out that you guys couldn't see
so<00:02:04.219> I<00:02:04.250> moved<00:02:04.819> to<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.060> floor<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:05.929> is<00:02:06.079> what

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
so I moved to the floor and this is what

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.529 
so I moved to the floor and this is what
my<00:02:06.319> tree<00:02:06.679> branch<00:02:06.920> looks<00:02:07.429> like<00:02:07.729> after<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.509> I

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
my tree branch looks like after that I

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.479 
my tree branch looks like after that I
took<00:02:08.750> some<00:02:09.049> hot<00:02:09.200> glue<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.769> started<00:02:10.160> gluing

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
took some hot glue and started gluing

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.460 
took some hot glue and started gluing
the<00:02:10.880> piece<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.239> wire<00:02:11.420> together<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.989> form<00:02:12.260> my

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
the piece of wire together to form my

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.979 
the piece of wire together to form my
branch<00:02:12.860> from<00:02:13.430> experience<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.299> know<00:02:14.360> that<00:02:14.480> wires

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
branch from experience I know that wires

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.289 
branch from experience I know that wires
usually<00:02:15.680> don't<00:02:16.280> hot<00:02:16.549> glue<00:02:16.760> together<00:02:16.910> very

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
usually don't hot glue together very

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:17.530 
usually don't hot glue together very
well

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
well

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.110 
well
so<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:17.900> also<00:02:18.110> took<00:02:18.319> this<00:02:18.590> paper<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.310> wrapped<00:02:19.940> it

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
so I also took this paper and wrapped it

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.780 
so I also took this paper and wrapped it
around<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.569> wires<00:02:20.780> as<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.739> was<00:02:22.069> hot<00:02:22.489> gluing

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
around the wires as I was hot gluing

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.610 
around the wires as I was hot gluing
them<00:02:22.910> just<00:02:23.269> for<00:02:23.450> some<00:02:23.630> extra<00:02:23.750> support<00:02:26.620> after

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
them just for some extra support after

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.750 
them just for some extra support after
you<00:02:27.709> get<00:02:27.860> done<00:02:27.980> gluing<00:02:28.160> them<00:02:28.310> together<00:02:28.459> you're

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
you get done gluing them together you're

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.430 
you get done gluing them together you're
going<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.940> want<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.150> take<00:02:29.299> some<00:02:29.510> duct<00:02:29.989> tape<00:02:30.019> or

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
going to want to take some duct tape or

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.259 
going to want to take some duct tape or
really<00:02:30.650> any<00:02:30.829> kind<00:02:31.069> of<00:02:31.250> tape<00:02:31.430> would<00:02:31.700> work<00:02:31.970> and

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
really any kind of tape would work and

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.150 
really any kind of tape would work and
you're<00:02:32.629> just<00:02:32.810> going<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.079> want<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.379> wrap<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
you're just going to want to wrap the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.850 
you're just going to want to wrap the
entire<00:02:34.340> branch<00:02:35.299> in<00:02:35.599> duct<00:02:35.840> tape<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.709> going

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
entire branch in duct tape this is going

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.009 
entire branch in duct tape this is going
to<00:02:36.920> make<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.160> sturdier<00:02:37.730> as<00:02:38.000> well<00:02:38.420> as<00:02:38.690> give<00:02:38.900> it

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
to make it sturdier as well as give it

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.069 
to make it sturdier as well as give it
some<00:02:39.200> texture<00:02:39.680> because<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.880> wire<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.540> good

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
some texture because the wire is good

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.900 
some texture because the wire is good
and<00:02:42.319> all<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:42.470> it's<00:02:42.889> not<00:02:43.130> really<00:02:43.340> as<00:02:43.430> thick<00:02:43.760> as

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
and all but it's not really as thick as

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.729 
and all but it's not really as thick as
I<00:02:44.120> wanted<00:02:44.480> mine<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.660> be<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.440> pretty<00:02:45.650> much

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
I wanted mine to be and it's pretty much

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.740 
I wanted mine to be and it's pretty much
just<00:02:46.190> flat<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:46.700> straight<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.239> it's<00:02:47.389> not<00:02:47.480> too

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
just flat and straight so it's not too

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.090 
just flat and straight so it's not too
textured<00:02:48.170> like<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.350> real<00:02:48.620> branch<00:02:48.920> would

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
textured like a real branch would

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.199 
textured like a real branch would
actually<00:02:49.489> meet

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.979 

after<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.299> get<00:02:57.420> done<00:02:57.510> wrapping<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.959> entire

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
after you get done wrapping the entire

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.330 
after you get done wrapping the entire
thing<00:02:58.379> and<00:02:58.500> duct<00:02:58.650> tape<00:02:58.860> you're<00:02:59.069> just<00:02:59.189> going<00:02:59.310> to

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
thing and duct tape you're just going to

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.890 
thing and duct tape you're just going to
want<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.549> take<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.730> outside<00:02:59.939> and<00:03:00.150> spray-paint

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
want to take it outside and spray-paint

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.350 
want to take it outside and spray-paint
it<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.349> whatever<00:03:01.530> color<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.579> choose

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
it and whatever color you choose

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.780 
it and whatever color you choose
I<00:03:03.390> took<00:03:03.780> gold<00:03:04.379> and<00:03:04.709> I<00:03:04.920> painted<00:03:05.189> the<00:03:05.310> front<00:03:05.579> and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
I took gold and I painted the front and

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.229 
I took gold and I painted the front and
the<00:03:06.329> back<00:03:06.480> with<00:03:06.840> gold<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.470> then<00:03:08.400> brought<00:03:08.970> the

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
the back with gold I then brought the

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.119 
the back with gold I then brought the
gold<00:03:09.450> branch<00:03:09.750> inside<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.500> started<00:03:10.829> taking

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
gold branch inside and started taking

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.130 
gold branch inside and started taking
those<00:03:11.220> cut<00:03:11.519> up<00:03:11.640> pieces<00:03:11.909> of<00:03:12.090> cardboard<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.840> we

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
those cut up pieces of cardboard that we

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.780 
those cut up pieces of cardboard that we
made<00:03:13.319> earlier<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.129> started<00:03:14.430> believing

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
made earlier and I started believing

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.059 
made earlier and I started believing
them<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.720> tree<00:03:15.900> branch<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.709> supposed

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
them to the tree branch this is supposed

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.500 
them to the tree branch this is supposed
to<00:03:17.159> look<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:17.370> leaves<00:03:17.760> if<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.239> haven't

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
to look like leaves if you haven't

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.270 
to look like leaves if you haven't
figured<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.750> out<00:03:18.900> yet<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:20.069> just

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
figured that out yet and I just

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.330 
figured that out yet and I just
basically<00:03:20.459> kept<00:03:21.060> doing<00:03:21.239> that<00:03:21.480> for<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.019> entire

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
basically kept doing that for the entire

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.630 
basically kept doing that for the entire
branch

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
branch

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.220 
branch
I<00:03:23.760> really<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:24.510> laid<00:03:24.690> them<00:03:24.870> wherever<00:03:25.140> I

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
I really just laid them wherever I

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.539 
I really just laid them wherever I
wanted<00:03:25.560> if<00:03:25.829> you're<00:03:25.980> unsure<00:03:26.099> about<00:03:26.280> your

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
wanted if you're unsure about your

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.099 
wanted if you're unsure about your
design<00:03:26.849> lay<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.269> down<00:03:27.299> first<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.049> then

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
design lay it down first and then
