00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
can see that on this large series seven

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.780 
can see that on this large series seven
tablets<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.440> shrunk<00:02:55.680> down<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.920> little<00:02:56.130> bit<00:02:56.310> but

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
tablets it shrunk down a little bit but

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.820 
tablets it shrunk down a little bit but
there<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.569> also<00:02:57.750> an<00:02:57.959> upside<00:02:58.260> in<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.560> as<00:02:58.709> you

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
there is also an upside in that as you

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.130 
there is also an upside in that as you
can<00:02:58.860> see<00:02:59.069> it's<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.489> backlit<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.660> there's<00:03:01.050> a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
can see it's it's backlit so there's a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.289 
can see it's it's backlit so there's a
little<00:03:01.319> bit<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:02.040> see<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.400> entire<00:03:02.790> power<00:03:03.090> of

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
little bit you see the entire power of

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.520 
little bit you see the entire power of
all<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.510> coloring<00:03:03.870> and<00:03:03.930> all<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.140> line<00:03:04.350> work

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
all the coloring and all the line work

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.550 
all the coloring and all the line work
also<00:03:05.150> if<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.420> was<00:03:06.630> digital<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.080> begin<00:03:07.200> with

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
also if this was digital to begin with

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.039 
also if this was digital to begin with
it<00:03:07.739> never<00:03:07.950> left<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.459> medium<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.630> display

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
it never left that medium in the display

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.410 
it never left that medium in the display
so<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.680> has<00:03:10.830> pretty<00:03:11.100> much<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.430> best<00:03:11.670> fidelity

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
so it has pretty much the best fidelity

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.729 
so it has pretty much the best fidelity
you<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.840> when<00:03:13.049> you're<00:03:13.140> reading<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.560> now
