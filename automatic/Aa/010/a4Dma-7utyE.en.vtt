about a six and a half inch skillet here
which<00:00:36.640> is<00:00:36.790> pretty<00:00:37.030> heavy<00:00:37.420> but<00:00:38.320> if<00:00:38.469> you're<00:00:38.620> not

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
backpacking too far it's almost worth

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.890 
backpacking too far it's almost worth
including<00:00:41.680> that<00:00:42.070> in<00:00:42.760> your<00:00:43.030> common<00:00:43.420> man<00:00:43.600> cook

kit for two dollars it's gonna cook a

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.600 
kit for two dollars it's gonna cook a
lot<00:00:46.450> better<00:00:46.720> than<00:00:46.990> a<00:00:47.080> tin<00:00:47.290> can<00:00:47.500> skillet<00:00:48.040> or

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
lot better than a tin can skillet or

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.430 
lot better than a tin can skillet or
even<00:00:48.970> some<00:00:49.180> of<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.390> thin<00:00:49.600> skillets<00:00:50.260> the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
even some of the thin skillets the

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.180 
even some of the thin skillets the
couple<00:00:50.740> baskets<00:00:51.540> now<00:00:52.540> what<00:00:52.960> I've<00:00:53.110> done<00:00:53.140> is<00:00:53.710> to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
couple baskets now what I've done is to

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.390 
couple baskets now what I've done is to
rig<00:00:54.370> some<00:00:54.610> coals<00:00:54.940> out<00:00:55.390> of<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.840> fire<00:00:56.400> over

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
rig some coals out of the fire over

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.130 
rig some coals out of the fire over
underneath<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.910> skillet<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.810> create

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
underneath the skillet to create

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
underneath the skillet to create
essentially<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.800> burner<00:01:00.210> effect<00:01:01.739> off<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:03.040> the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
essentially a burner effect off to the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.609 
essentially a burner effect off to the
side<00:01:03.400> of<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.610> fire<00:01:03.820> because<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:04.839> fry<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.199> need

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
side of the fire because to fry you need

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.730 
side of the fire because to fry you need
holes<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.460> so<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.210> purpose<00:01:08.049> of<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.259> campfire

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
holes and so the purpose of the campfire

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.920 
holes and so the purpose of the campfire
is<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.100> heat<00:01:09.280> water<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:10.390> produce<00:01:10.570> the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
is to heat water and to produce the

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.420 
is to heat water and to produce the
coals<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:11.470> we're<00:01:11.590> going<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:11.830> use<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.220> fry

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
coals that we're going to use to fry

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.660 
coals that we're going to use to fry
everything<00:01:12.610> else<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:14.020> water<00:01:15.010> for<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.340> tea<00:01:15.520> is

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
everything else so water for the tea is

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.290 
everything else so water for the tea is
in<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.909> fire<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.430> coals<00:01:18.700> are<00:01:18.880> being<00:01:19.090> made

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
in the fire and the coals are being made

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.750 
in the fire and the coals are being made
as<00:01:19.479> we<00:01:19.630> go<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.320> we'll<00:01:20.530> add<00:01:20.710> more<00:01:20.740> coals<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.550> this

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
as we go so we'll add more coals to this

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.149 
as we go so we'll add more coals to this
as<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.210> begins<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.600> fry<00:01:22.900> and<00:01:23.110> cook<00:01:23.350> will<00:01:23.950> add

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
as it begins to fry and cook will add

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.250 
as it begins to fry and cook will add
some<00:01:24.400> coals<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:25.180> coals<00:01:25.420> will<00:01:25.630> actually<00:01:26.049> die

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
some coals the coals will actually die

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.620 
some coals the coals will actually die
down<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.940> consequently<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.120> temperature

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
down and consequently the temperature

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.510 
down and consequently the temperature
will<00:01:28.810> drop<00:01:28.840> just<00:01:29.080> like<00:01:29.500> we<00:01:29.710> were<00:01:29.890> cooking<00:01:30.370> on

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
will drop just like we were cooking on

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.240 
will drop just like we were cooking on
our<00:01:30.700> electric<00:01:31.360> range<00:01:31.600> at<00:01:31.780> home<00:01:34.860> okay<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.010> fire

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
our electric range at home okay the fire

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.539 
our electric range at home okay the fire
got<00:01:36.940> down<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.240> little<00:01:37.479> bit<00:01:37.630> under<00:01:37.930> our<00:01:38.049> skillet

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
got down a little bit under our skillet

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.510 
got down a little bit under our skillet
want<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.610> listen<00:01:39.820> for<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.330> sound<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.869> sizzling

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
want to listen for the sound of sizzling

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.060 
want to listen for the sound of sizzling
that's<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.700> good<00:01:42.909> sound<00:01:43.350> when<00:01:44.350> that<00:01:44.500> dies<00:01:44.740> down

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
that's a good sound when that dies down

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.000 
that's a good sound when that dies down
you<00:01:45.729> need<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.000> rake<00:01:46.180> some<00:01:46.450> more<00:01:46.600> coals<00:01:47.010> from

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
you need to rake some more coals from

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.880 
you need to rake some more coals from
the<00:01:48.130> fire<00:01:48.369> over<00:01:48.610> underneath<00:01:48.970> your<00:01:49.270> skillet

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the fire over underneath your skillet

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.140 
the fire over underneath your skillet
now<00:01:50.890> notice<00:01:51.159> that<00:01:51.189> I'm<00:01:51.400> turning<00:01:51.640> this<00:01:51.909> with<00:01:52.119> a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
now notice that I'm turning this with a

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.270 
now notice that I'm turning this with a
wooden<00:01:52.479> spoon<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:53.049> really<00:01:53.799> think<00:01:53.950> wood

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
wooden spoon I really think wood

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.630 
wooden spoon I really think wood
implements<00:01:54.850> are<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.060> best<00:01:55.299> for<00:01:55.600> cast<00:01:55.810> iron

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
implements are the best for cast iron

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.630 
implements are the best for cast iron
because<00:01:57.640> things<00:01:57.880> don't<00:01:58.060> stick<00:01:58.360> very<00:01:58.659> well<00:01:59.640> to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
because things don't stick very well to

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.149 
because things don't stick very well to
the<00:02:00.760> wood<00:02:00.939> and<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.299> can<00:02:01.450> move<00:02:01.600> things<00:02:01.840> around

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the wood and you can move things around

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.880 
the wood and you can move things around
handles<00:02:03.159> don't<00:02:03.340> get<00:02:03.520> hot<00:02:04.080> works<00:02:05.080> real<00:02:05.350> well<00:02:05.380> so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
handles don't get hot works real well so

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.089 
handles don't get hot works real well so
