00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.820 
see working okay here we go said zero
his<00:06:28.110> head's<00:06:28.350> kind<00:06:29.130> of<00:06:29.280> stuck<00:06:29.550> looking<00:06:29.820> down<00:06:30.830> so

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
his head's kind of stuck looking down so

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.770 
his head's kind of stuck looking down so
the<00:06:31.950> sinus<00:06:32.400> is<00:06:32.550> very<00:06:32.970> sound<00:06:33.300> just<00:06:33.540> like<00:06:33.600> the

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
the sinus is very sound just like the

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.900 
the sinus is very sound just like the
originals<00:06:34.200> but<00:06:34.470> it<00:06:34.710> seems<00:06:34.950> like<00:06:35.040> he<00:06:35.550> has<00:06:35.640> a<00:06:35.670> lot

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
originals but it seems like he has a lot

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.190 
originals but it seems like he has a lot
less<00:06:36.120> room<00:06:36.330> to<00:06:36.360> move<00:06:36.540> around<00:06:36.660> and<00:06:36.930> I<00:06:37.020> guess

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
less room to move around and I guess

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.140 
less room to move around and I guess
that<00:06:37.380> has<00:06:37.590> to<00:06:37.710> do<00:06:37.830> with<00:06:37.950> his<00:06:38.040> armor<00:06:38.400> and<00:06:38.580> the

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
that has to do with his armor and the

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.120 
that has to do with his armor and the
way<00:06:39.270> his<00:06:39.540> uh<00:06:39.570> his<00:06:40.110> torso<00:06:40.590> and<00:06:40.800> body<00:06:40.980> is

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
way his uh his torso and body is

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.220 
way his uh his torso and body is
constructed<00:06:41.370> now<00:06:41.760> as<00:06:42.390> you<00:06:42.480> can<00:06:42.540> see<00:06:42.600> he<00:06:43.020> he

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
constructed now as you can see he he

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.050 
constructed now as you can see he he
does<00:06:43.410> balance<00:06:43.800> okay<00:06:44.250> with<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.460> sword<00:06:45.740> and<00:06:47.060> I'm

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
does balance okay with the sword and I'm

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.430 
does balance okay with the sword and I'm
pretty<00:06:48.300> sure<00:06:48.390> if<00:06:48.780> you<00:06:48.870> can<00:06:48.990> balance<00:06:49.110> with<00:06:49.320> this

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
pretty sure if you can balance with this

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.570 
pretty sure if you can balance with this
giant<00:06:49.800> thing<00:06:49.830> you<00:06:50.070> can<00:06:50.220> balance<00:06:50.340> with<00:06:50.550> the

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 
giant thing you can balance with the

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.280 
giant thing you can balance with the
other<00:06:50.760> ones<00:06:50.970> too<00:06:51.120> which<00:06:51.840> is<00:06:51.870> pretty<00:06:52.080> cool

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
other ones too which is pretty cool

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.050 
other ones too which is pretty cool
because<00:06:52.470> if<00:06:52.710> you<00:06:52.800> look<00:06:52.919> at<00:06:53.100> the<00:06:53.130> Mega<00:06:53.550> Man<00:06:53.730> 1<00:06:53.880> he

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
because if you look at the Mega Man 1 he

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.610 
because if you look at the Mega Man 1 he
can't<00:06:54.270> balance<00:06:54.510> without<00:06:54.960> a<00:06:55.169> stand<00:06:55.650> for<00:06:55.919> his

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
can't balance without a stand for his

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.840 
can't balance without a stand for his
cluster<00:06:58.620> char<00:06:58.830> this<00:06:59.010> is<00:06:59.130> the<00:06:59.220> fully<00:06:59.460> charged

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
cluster char this is the fully charged

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.790 
cluster char this is the fully charged
Buster<00:07:00.210> shot<00:07:00.390> that<00:07:00.570> he<00:07:00.630> gets<00:07:00.840> and<00:07:01.050> he<00:07:01.560> can't

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
Buster shot that he gets and he can't

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.080 
Buster shot that he gets and he can't
balance<00:07:01.980> on<00:07:02.250> his<00:07:02.400> own<00:07:02.490> without<00:07:02.700> he<00:07:02.820> is<00:07:02.970> that

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090 
balance on his own without he is that

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.090 
balance on his own without he is that
stupid<00:07:03.419> stand<00:07:03.780> so<00:07:04.290> it's<00:07:04.410> nice<00:07:04.560> that<00:07:04.590> zero

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 
stupid stand so it's nice that zero

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.640 
stupid stand so it's nice that zero
