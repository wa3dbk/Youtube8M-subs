00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.460
 Therefore, I believe it is an order of the day that we continue in the

 Technology in the development in the business deal with it like 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.070
 we can be mobile in the future without harming the environment as much as we do

 yes, this blow continues the percent crisis as an opportunity

 it has succeeded 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.650
 maybe he'll look like the next electric car from Renault like 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.129
 our sexy concert tickets here 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.229

 currently offers 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.370
 that one just builds up Council of States ears so that one can take advantage of this

 Percentage of noise install prices he also gets a rethink in mind 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.590
 so you just get used to it and more and more

 Attentive acts when it is in the conclusion Ditib the quiet my dad comes too 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.400
 on soft soles therefore and Elektro Scooter Timmer already sees more 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.879
 they are also very quiet 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:18.659

 Pröll Okonkwo think I have a trip of the electric car Co in the Michel 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.400
 is the first of four cars 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.430
 the Renault Trend from the 12 brings with the announcement

 the first automaker to be a complete fleet 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:56.349
 an electric car brings them on the road we are curious who 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.449
 had a lot to do technologically awesome and that themselves 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.579
 the mobility behind will change the future of the future
