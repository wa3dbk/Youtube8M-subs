00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:11.400
 glad to continue we want what I want 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.200
 show sometimes there is a need 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.670
 make a quick ladder 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.640
 well call so fire escapes 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.220
 knotted ladder without slats all 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.220
 it is clear that if we have a long 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.349
 rope problem what is how 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.040
 tie these knots here so that they are 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.320
 at the same distance from each other and when 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.780
 this would not need to stretch the whole 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 rope on each bundle yes that is yourself 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.930
 you understand that this time is very long and 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.890
 nowhere does it mean there is a way of mating 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:49.890
 similar stairs now I give it to you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:54.960
 I will show but we look then see the basis 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.460
 all here we leave that end out 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.129
 which we loop well in order 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.780
 to secure the stairs or leave 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.270
 tail for strapping around the support means 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 remember here is long and we will have it 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.310
 now look here this tail is located 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.700
 i have here what i do i make a loop 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.610
 Now this type of look I did overlaps 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.680
 turn away 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.730
 it is clear yes from myself that is here 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.290
 It turns out that the tail is a loop 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:31.040
 the main rope comes behind it means 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.450
 here is a ring 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.550
 what size do we make it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.260
 distance between nodes so we 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.450
 make the distance that we 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.390
 comfortable yes here for example I chose here 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.880
 such is the distance and now look 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.720
 here is the junction take here and now 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.830
 the next loop is done just as well she 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.980
 made cranking here like the first but 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:01.220
 not superimposed on it and on top of it 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:03.600
 here then there is a loop 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.280
 align so that we have this all 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.519
 know 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.550
 here we are trying to put the nodules here 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.340
 these were all in one place 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:19.530
 laid trimmed so here it is now 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:22.260
 again show we do and here from above 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.010
 everything is done from the top as we would like 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.989
 raise the cylinder up what it will be 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.510
 in here it diverges and does not fit in 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.540
 one arm that's okay, we mainly 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.200
 respect the size here is the rope which 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.280
 It remains consistently better under 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.700
 straighten so she smaller view 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.299
 forged so we have already collected this 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.640
 the bay 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:49.640
 also in the last round 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.760
 all here we have here is such a bay 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.370
 now we remember this end here 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.720
 was the lowest 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.540
 the lowest tweak after steve started 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.799
 now we just take it and push it through 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:12.380
 in the center of the bay below we take and push through 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.380
 center of the bay we all start to get 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.989
 pull pull on the pair appeared to uzelochek 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.040
 I'll get away so that it can be seen 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.810
 pull appeared in the knot 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.849
 begin to pull on appears second 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:37.530
 knot 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:40.799
 pull 3 and so it will be with us 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.980
 pull knot by knot 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.099
 and the last is tied up now what 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.380
 it turned out and now we see what 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.910
 distance between nodes if we 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.329
 did everything right it turns out 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.090
 about the same that is already easier 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:00.000
 to align well looked where we 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.099
 let's say uneven distance between 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.870
 nodes here let's say more we 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.360
 just relaxed the knot and 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.120
 drove him there where we need to 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:13.200
 he was in the middle between these 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:17.850
 with ropes and here we are chasing us 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.970
 need to trim the web site aligned here 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.959
 these here is ulmark its 2 downstairs yes and so we 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.210
 she was driven further 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.680
 clear yes and here we are left late 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:31.020
 Now if we need somewhere to climb in 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.860
 we have a great 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:39.729
 hand knotted rope 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.189
 such a simple design okay 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.439
 I will continue to show stairs 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:47.969
 more complicated with ropes with 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:50.080
 crossbars without crossbars of some kind 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.180
 wooden there is still a bit of one 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.460
 ropes and explain how to work with them 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.159
 because working with outboard 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.360
 ladders has its own nuances because 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:04.409
 they are still moving it again if you 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.409
 look further
