00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.730
 all my dear ones 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 l recently commented in the comments 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.139
 heard that you maybe one 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.120
 she wants to get a new series 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.090
 will be a continuation of his picture series 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.490
 and idea in the first video is that we 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.439
 so have a little everyday life at home and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 Whenever I do something like that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.490
 I love a bath I love to wait 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.460
 and the cozy bath of Kneip is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.740
 really perfect for the fall season 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.960
 you only need one cap of it and it 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.790
 smells indescribably beautiful 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.780
 really nice warm the fragrance recalls 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.780
 me always at the fall 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.250
 I use something today as you stand 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.320
 new and last two wm match all this 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.910
 is quite fluid in consistency though 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.890
 as soon as it is in contact with water and 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.890
 Your skin is easily on 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.469
 and while we're at it myself 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.120
 also use my razor 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.120
 and my shaving gel from valeo 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.320
 also from baljak and my new body 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.490
 bataan and that is that the cocoa butter 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.490
 for dry skin 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.160
 I use today for the first time so 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.620
 I can not say that much yet 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.770
 only that the smell is incredibly good 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.900
 like the consistency is pretty firm 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.830
 So she does not move so fast 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.480
 she really seems to care very well 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.480
 after the car I was not possible 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.430
 and I choose neckar 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.060
 and of course it does not know otherwise 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.990
 I use my bio demmer 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.990
 facial water to it 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.819
 and as my favorite I wear one 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.590
 face mask balea on that is the 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.209
 milk and honey mask and I have them 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.370
 quite often I like to use 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.290
 The really like the donation visibly 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.310
 the moisture and also I like 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.310
 the smell city yes all 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.340
 The mask should take 10 to 15 minutes 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.780
 can work and in the time can be a lot 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.970
 Quickly show how I put my lips 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.250
 Feeling yourself do you need it 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.150
 honi no matter what a team to her 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.680
 I also like sugar and sugar 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.180
 if you want and you taste 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.970
 do not mind a bit 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.770
 olive oil or any other oil and 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.850
 in the vessel now comes a teaspoon 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.250
 sugar a shallow teaspoon of honey and 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.010
 optional the olive oil for those who 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.240
 to like it 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.240
 The whole thing should be mixed well 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.260
 and it is best if in the end so 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.580
 A really viscous mass is created 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.090
 and now it is time 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.629
 to wash off our face mask and 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.060
 homemade lips pini 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.319
 try 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.099
 he really only needs it 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.099
 a tiny little bit 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.510
 Spelling asked with his forefinger 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.510
 and that's what you do best in 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.790
 circling movements of the kp's skin 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.230
 and honey and olive oil become the lips 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.130
 really nice and soft 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.130
 made and cared for 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.920
 and another advantage of kieling it 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.040
 can eat and it tastes good 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.040
 fantastic 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.780
 the hair care i wanted a little 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.780
 bit with the disco ran into care 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.759
 I spray the cure only in the end 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.759
 my hair is right 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.650
 and in real time today I drink the 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.300
 oriental spices of teapot and 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.190
 that at the moment it is one of my favorite 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.909
 the so wonderful autumnal and 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.909
 aromatic 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.430
 and here you have a little look 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.530
 on my bedside next to my bed 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.050
 is always the apricot among other things 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.380
 I'll get oil and that's what I use 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.630
 for nail care it looks like 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.210
 nail polish and I wear a bit 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.640
 thereof around the girl and 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.660
 pass it with your fingers so well 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.660
 it goes into the skin 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:05.830
 something else I always next to mine 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.699

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.610

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.910
 to bed 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.120
 I hope the video I could 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.960
 little bit to your own home 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.850
 to inspire 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.080
 Sometimes it feels really good 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.690
 to think of yourself 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.860
 just a bit to relax me 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:33.140
