00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
functionality now I will say this is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
functionality now I will say this is
also<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> few<00:01:15.030> pro<00:01:15.479> level<00:01:15.840> boots<00:01:15.990> and

also one of the few pro level boots and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.210 
also one of the few pro level boots and
I<00:01:16.140> will<00:01:16.259> say<00:01:16.380> that's<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.590> pro<00:01:16.799> level<00:01:17.070> boot

on the tech 10 at Tech seven these are
newer<00:02:17.150> style<00:02:17.480> they're<00:02:17.690> still<00:02:17.900> set<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.200> and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
forget it but the way that they work

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.460 
forget it but the way that they work
does<00:02:20.300> two<00:02:20.480> things<00:02:20.720> really<00:02:20.930> well

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
does two things really well

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.900 
does two things really well
and<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:21.860> see<00:02:21.980> here<00:02:22.250> even<00:02:22.460> on<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.640> instep

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
and you can see here even on the instep

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.310 
and you can see here even on the instep
this<00:02:23.060> buckles<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.540> top<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.930> doesn't<00:02:23.990> get<00:02:24.260> in

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
this buckles on top so it doesn't get in

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.540 
this buckles on top so it doesn't get in
the<00:02:24.350> way<00:02:24.410> in<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.620> crash<00:02:24.830> but<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.280> way<00:02:25.370> that

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
the way in the crash but the way that

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.250 
the way in the crash but the way that
these<00:02:25.670> work<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.510> have<00:02:26.630> these<00:02:26.780> big<00:02:27.020> these

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
these work is you have these big these

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.840 
these work is you have these big these
almost<00:02:27.530> arrow<00:02:27.740> heads<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.310> slide<00:02:28.550> through<00:02:28.790> a

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
almost arrow heads that slide through a

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.120 
almost arrow heads that slide through a
huge<00:02:29.360> loop<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.320> what<00:02:30.440> happens<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:30.920> they're

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
huge loop and what happens is they're

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.980 
huge loop and what happens is they're
self<00:02:31.460> adjusting<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.180> there's<00:02:32.360> room<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.510> wiggle

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
self adjusting so there's room to wiggle

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.510 
self adjusting so there's room to wiggle
and<00:02:33.140> they<00:02:33.200> don't<00:02:33.830> have<00:02:33.950> anywhere<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.280> go<00:02:34.370> they

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
and they don't have anywhere to go they

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.830 
and they don't have anywhere to go they
almost<00:02:34.640> fit<00:02:34.910> into<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.120> wedge<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.660> can't

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
almost fit into a wedge so you can't

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.370 
almost fit into a wedge so you can't
screw<00:02:36.080> them<00:02:36.170> up

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
screw them up

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.720 
screw them up
the<00:02:36.500> nice<00:02:36.680> part<00:02:36.860> too<00:02:37.070> is<00:02:37.100> when<00:02:37.340> they're<00:02:37.460> caked

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
the nice part too is when they're caked

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.640 
the nice part too is when they're caked
with<00:02:37.850> mud<00:02:37.970> it's<00:02:38.660> easier<00:02:38.990> to<00:02:39.110> get<00:02:39.200> your<00:02:39.320> finger

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
with mud it's easier to get your finger

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.170 
with mud it's easier to get your finger
in<00:02:39.680> there<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.010> work<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:40.340> this<00:02:40.490> less<00:02:40.820> small

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
in there and work on this less small

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.970 
in there and work on this less small
parts<00:02:41.630> like<00:02:41.960> you<00:02:42.080> saw<00:02:42.320> with<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.500> previous

parts like you saw with the previous

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
you're also underneath these buckles you

boot<00:02:54.410> outside<00:02:54.830> of<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.010> weighted<00:02:55.430> area<00:02:55.610> that

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
boot outside of this weighted area that

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.730 
boot outside of this weighted area that
has<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:55.970> emboss<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.570> going<00:02:57.020> to<00:02:57.140> be<00:02:57.230> microfiber

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
has the emboss is going to be microfiber

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.050 
has the emboss is going to be microfiber
member<00:02:57.980> there's<00:02:58.130> six<00:02:58.340> colors<00:02:58.640> here<00:02:58.820> as<00:02:58.880> well

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
member there's six colors here as well

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.610 
member there's six colors here as well
so<00:02:59.360> that's<00:02:59.510> going<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.780> be<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.960> synthetic

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
so that's going to be a synthetic

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.680 
so that's going to be a synthetic
leather<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.190> has<00:03:01.370> limited<00:03:01.760> imperfections

leather that has limited imperfections

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.390 
leather that has limited imperfections
and<00:03:02.810> that's<00:03:02.930> how<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.110> save<00:03:03.410> that<00:03:03.560> 15%<00:03:04.310> and

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
and that's how you save that 15% and

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.980 
and that's how you save that 15% and
weight<00:03:04.610> going<00:03:04.850> from<00:03:05.060> leather<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.840> the

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990
