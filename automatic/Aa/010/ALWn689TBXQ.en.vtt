00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.139
 let's start this dress is very 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.420
 simple and practically we're going to 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.080
 finish very quickly the only thing that 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.180
 we need is a rectangle that measures 13 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.600
 centimeters on each of its sides 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.660
 this fabric extends a little bit 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.890
 as much as lycra but if it extends 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.070
 a little bit ok so let's make it a 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 small fold more or less than half 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.880
 centimeter like that and on the bottom 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.150
 as well 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.860
 You can pass a seam or not on the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.730
 top part I will not pass 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.610
 sewing 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.720
 and after I do that, I'm going to pass a 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.060
 Sewing on the entire side 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.080
 but this has to be given to 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.080
 equality like here 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.180
 ready, I already met him here in the 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.420
 side and sebastiÃ  here and in the part of 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.290
 simply double up 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.290
 let's go back 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.690
 that is to say we are going to try semi 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.130
 a short party dress but very 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.130
 simple but mounted 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.930
 we are going to fold a sheet here to 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.620
 to do 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.620
 I have stepped on 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.140
 and then I already put my needle more or less 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.590
 from here down one centimeter and I put 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.420
 three jackets in silver 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.860
 this may be optional or it is not 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.869
 decoration now I will go through here and 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.869
 try to leave in the same place 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.530
 and in this way 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.100
 we talk a little so there is a 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:27.220
 little pleated and we give another round 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.450
 ok, I'm going to return the needle 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.450
 the same chaquiras 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.950
 Then our dress is like this and 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:49.069
 I'm going to use the belt this already 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.170
 I did in the previous video ok 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.450
 but if they have not done it measure 13 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.879
 centimeters by two centimeters we doubled 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.879
 the fabric and we put click ok 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.810
 and so we have left for the bag 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:08.800
 we use to use this rectangle 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.860
 which measures 8 centimeters by 3 or 4 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.670
 centimeters down we're going to sew in 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.670
 one side 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.320
 and try to do it fast here 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.290
 and they get a side and then in the 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.099
 bottom part 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.099
 I turn around 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.810
 that the corners look good 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:45.350
 since I have it like that I'm going to fold another 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:48.470
 time here and again another round 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.900
 and whether you come back to meet here or 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.340
 put a little jacket here I'm going to sew 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.160
 and apart I put the badge that you make of 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.530
 the bag is now going to pass a needle through 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.450
 the center more or less there 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.450
 and I'm going to put a bead 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.260
 they can also be glued with cold silicone 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.630
 illicit 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.260
 We passed twice so that we do not know 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.260
 go to throw 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.569
 and we make a new back here 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.400
 and that would be all 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.400
 he was very very nice father 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.210
 and now he showed them how to read 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.130
 ah
