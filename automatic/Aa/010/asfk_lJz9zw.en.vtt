00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
DSLR type rigs it's a hybrid rig that

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.070 
DSLR type rigs it's a hybrid rig that
shoot<00:00:17.339> stills<00:00:17.669> and<00:00:17.880> video<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.689> pretty<00:00:18.929> good

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
shoot stills and video it's pretty good

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.259 
shoot stills and video it's pretty good
for<00:00:19.140> stills<00:00:19.529> but<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.369> terrible<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:20.880> video

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:21.269 
for stills but it's terrible for video

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.640 
for stills but it's terrible for video
so<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> treat<00:00:22.259> it<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.529> an

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
so you have to treat it like an

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.679 
so you have to treat it like an
old-school<00:00:23.039> film<00:00:23.669> camera<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.390> to

old-school film camera you have to

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.730 
old-school film camera you have to
create<00:00:24.929> a<00:00:25.289> cage<00:00:25.949> around<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.789> in<00:00:26.909> order<00:00:27.089> to<00:00:27.329> put

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
create a cage around it in order to put

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.739 
create a cage around it in order to put

things<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.439> nature<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.279> that's

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
things of that nature so that's

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.040 
things of that nature so that's
essentially<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.240> we've<00:00:33.390> done<00:00:33.600> we've<00:00:33.810> given

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
essentially what we've done we've given

essentially what we've done we've given
it<00:00:34.200> some<00:00:34.440> 15<00:00:34.800> millimeter<00:00:35.220> of

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.310 
it some 15 millimeter of

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.790 
it some 15 millimeter of
industry-standard<00:00:36.120> rods<00:00:36.690> we've<00:00:37.350> built<00:00:37.650> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
industry-standard rods we've built the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.830 
industry-standard rods we've built the
cage<00:00:38.100> around<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.730> camera<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.630> again

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
cage around the camera this is again

cage around the camera this is again
it's<00:00:40.020> called<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.350> super<00:00:40.500> fly<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.220> just

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
it's called the super fly so we just

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.380 
it's called the super fly so we just
kind<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.550> come<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.060> give<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.270> this

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.230 
and just click it on a tripod again for
hand-holding<00:01:50.039> it's<00:01:50.369> great<00:01:50.609> for<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:50.850> while<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
hand-holding it's great for a while and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.999 
hand-holding it's great for a while and
then<00:01:51.359> you<00:01:51.479> want<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.659> put<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:51.990> some<00:01:52.289> form<00:01:52.889> of

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
then you want to put it on some form of

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.529 
then you want to put it on some form of
stability<00:01:53.340> device<00:01:53.819> whether<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.420> be

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
stability device whether that be

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:55.609 
stability device whether that be
something<00:01:54.869> you're<00:01:55.020> wearing<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
something you're wearing like a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.919 
something you're wearing like a
Steadicam<00:01:56.490> something<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.420> nature<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
Steadicam something of that nature or a

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.949 
Steadicam something of that nature or a
tripod<00:01:58.520> or<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.819> jib<00:02:00.119> or<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.389> crane<00:02:00.659> or<00:02:00.840> that

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
tripod or that jib or that crane or that

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.019 
tripod or that jib or that crane or that
dolly<00:02:01.279> so<00:02:02.279> anyway<00:02:02.579> that's<00:02:02.729> another

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:03.029 
dolly so anyway that's another

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:05.569

just<00:02:06.179> take<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.020> pieces<00:02:07.200> put<00:02:07.619> them<00:02:07.740> together

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
just take the pieces put them together

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.889 
just take the pieces put them together
and<00:02:08.189> come<00:02:08.729> up<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:08.879> something<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.629> works

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and come up with something that works

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.589 
and come up with something that works

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
instance we stuck this one all together

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.780 
instance we stuck this one all together
and<00:02:25.290> we<00:02:25.410> have<00:02:25.650> now<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> shoulder<00:02:26.580> stability

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
and we have now a shoulder stability

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.250 
and we have now a shoulder stability
unit<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:27.599> just<00:02:27.780> kind<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:27.959> press<00:02:28.080> it

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260

against your shoulder and stabilize your
DSLR<00:02:31.319> camera<00:02:31.709> for<00:02:31.920> shooting<00:02:32.280> we<00:02:32.610> also<00:02:32.790> put<00:02:33.120> our

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
DSLR camera for shooting we also put our

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.540 
DSLR camera for shooting we also put our
friction<00:02:33.569> follow<00:02:33.900> focus<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.530> here<00:02:34.800> not<00:02:35.040> using

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
friction follow focus on here not using

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.050 
friction follow focus on here not using
rods<00:02:35.849> this<00:02:36.180> time<00:02:36.390> we<00:02:36.569> used<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:36.989> our<00:02:37.200> ma<00:02:37.500> 210

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
rods this time we used one of our ma 210

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.610 
rods this time we used one of our ma 210
articulating<00:02:39.060> arms<00:02:39.390> we<00:02:39.840> stuck<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.319> on<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
articulating arms we stuck it on the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.180 
articulating arms we stuck it on the
side<00:02:40.860> there<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.400> our<00:02:41.580> 15<00:02:42.000> rail<00:02:42.810> mount<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.410> now

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
side there of our 15 rail mount and now

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.150 
side there of our 15 rail mount and now
we<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.519> just<00:02:44.760> put<00:02:45.209> it<00:02:45.299> over<00:02:45.420> here<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.099> put<00:02:47.099> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
we can just put it over here and put a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.850 
we can just put it over here and put a
little<00:02:47.280> pressure<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.910> lids<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.860> focus

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
little pressure on the lids and focus

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.390 
little pressure on the lids and focus
away<00:02:50.959> lots<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.260> possibilities<00:02:52.920> with<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
away lots of possibilities with the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.130 
away lots of possibilities with the
configuration<00:02:54.030> such<00:02:54.209> as<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.569> you<00:02:54.900> could<00:02:55.049> put

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
configuration such as this you could put

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.800 
configuration such as this you could put
another<00:02:55.349> plate<00:02:55.680> on<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.950> back<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.660> put<00:02:57.660> your

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
another plate on the back and put your

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.180 
another plate on the back and put your
batteries<00:02:58.110> on<00:02:58.260> there<00:02:58.500> for<00:02:58.680> powering<00:02:59.010> a

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
batteries on there for powering a
