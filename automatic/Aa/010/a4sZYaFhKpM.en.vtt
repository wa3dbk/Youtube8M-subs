 but we are not sure that each canton of Montemboeuf 9 or 10 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.820
 it's almost certain that all the many more random 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.730
 I could tell you a word after 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.510
 but it's a car that has been compared to the kz1 the very significantly 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.590
 lightened 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.000

 lightweight 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.389
 e and which allowed him to reach a top speed of the order of 145 km 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.470
 gold it's a car that has a nice track record daddy fall here because this 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.810
 car at the stop the the chassis 750 115 the summer 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.640
 the factory certainly does not total Montreal taxis the tz of the routine 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.490
 and 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.729
 at the afp scott delta ran the alfa roméo at the time there 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.520
 including the gta the stable threw a bridge 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 and this one was built especially for the city 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.840
 nine paid or alfa roméo museum is right this car has never run 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.310
 but otherwise the other tests and games of goose winners exceptional because it 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.960

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.019
 less luck in the 24 hours of mans since they were engaged in 65

 a very very closed cockpit and a truncated rear for amelie and 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.119
 to actually improve there to aerodynamic drag 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.449
 this production 1965 to 1967 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.140
 so when I told you earlier that 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.779
 there was uncertainty about the world knows that in 1965 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.419
 kind long hilly chassis 750 109 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.809
 to smile ring 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:03.789
 but for the chassis 750 112 was rebuilt with

 a car disappeared again along the way 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.329
 and then for the choice say that after after 1968 eyes
