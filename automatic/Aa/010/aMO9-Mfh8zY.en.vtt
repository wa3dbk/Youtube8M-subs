00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.270
 Now that we have the engine tuning 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.329
 have completed and the new engine 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:27.140
 we have to work so well 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:29.570
 Now the chassis devote ourselves because 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.079
 at the moment it still looks like this 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.079
 when I drive 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.700
 Of course it is not allowed to do that 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.890
 fatal simply because I get away with it 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.950
 have a significant grip loss that 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.950
 the lines jump and that is yes 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.369
 also not sense of the thing 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.710
 the cause for that could easily be on 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.830
 damper oil lie 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:19.320
 that's just too fluid 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:23.020
 too soft and we'll swap it now 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.640
 to the think to oil change must 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.560
 Of course, we first have the del too 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.420
 remove 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.990
 So unscrew how to disassemble 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.170
 that likes to call and then it works 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.170
 continue 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.370
 Not 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:43.720
 the oil you just saw 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:46.160
 was this army tamir silicone thanks all 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.980
 that does not make me fake everything 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.440
 a viscosity of 710 ps 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:59.150
 that's already pretty hard 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:02.750
 but not hard enough because it works 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:08.080
 still more violent and this is the one here 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.270
 is electronic all that has 2500 cds 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.270
 and we will do it now 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.270
 try out 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.010
 the oil itself is already pretty 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.300
 hard 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.300
 xcom out of the bottle 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.290
 if you even call that oil 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.239
 can move here as good as possible 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:42.739
 nothing more 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:46.400
 that's really hard but all the more 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.849
 better for a tight chassis in contrast 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.299
 to a damper moves with the 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.510
 another oil with one of mine 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.829
 bit faster but also already 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.889
 not so fast anymore 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.750
 directly after filling the oil 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.099
 Of course we do not install anything yet 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.870
 or close again 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.419
 simply because during the 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.139
 fill in air bubbles and have formed 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:14.480
 We have to let them out when we are 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.090
 the dampers are still standing a bit 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.139
 we can let the back 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.139
 Remove damper 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.020
 in the rear damper comes naturally 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.020
 exactly the same oil rhymes the front 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.010
 at the other reception it is nothing 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.160
 I do not have to think about anything else 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.540
 show again with filling 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.380
 Let's continue right away 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.310
 now the family come to the car and 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.340
 then we can actually do the same 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.010
 even the test drive do not make you wonder 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.350
 I have the opportunity now too 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.220
 the same position again 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:01.190
 So changing the position of the springs 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.920
 Now I'm building the leather front 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.050
 and the blue ones at the back 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.250
 Look at the driving behavior then 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.250
 also normal changes 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:45.160
 making it the best athlete if that 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:48.380
 it is then possible to get away from it 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.910
 before the ride again a small test 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:55.760
 with a demonstration 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:58.600
 the new oil is now in it and it moves 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:03.170
 still very slow 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:05.650
 that was gone is firmer and slacker now 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.650
 as a celebration 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.250
 the first measure for the mature 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.450
 to counteract jumping has so 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.810
 nothing brought 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:46.230
 too bad but I have another one 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:48.230
 possibility another idea and the 

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:51.090
 I'll show you in the next video 

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.950
 over a thumbs up one 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.110
 comment or maybe even one 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:58.700
 Subscription I would be very happy 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:58.700
 see you next time
