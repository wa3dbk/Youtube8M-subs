don't get that reinforced kind of mesh

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.190

tackiness on the energy sling so it's a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.810

pattern similar type studs on there

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.780 
pattern similar type studs on there
little<00:03:06.800> less<00:03:06.980> quality<00:03:07.400> you<00:03:07.459> do<00:03:07.580> get<00:03:07.700> the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
little less quality you do get the

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.760 
little less quality you do get the
miCoach<00:03:08.150> compatibility<00:03:08.870> with<00:03:09.380> it<00:03:09.500> which<00:03:09.620> is

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
miCoach compatibility with it which is

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.190 
miCoach compatibility with it which is
to<00:03:09.980> be<00:03:10.070> expected<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.120> traction<00:03:11.450> 2.0<00:03:11.989> stud

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
that portion of it and you do get kind

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.090 
that portion of it and you do get kind
of<00:03:17.390> similar<00:03:17.930> features<00:03:17.989> on<00:03:18.680> they<00:03:18.830> don't<00:03:18.980> give

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
of similar features on they don't give

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.910 
of similar features on they don't give
you<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.430> what<00:03:19.880> they<00:03:19.970> call<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.239> energy<00:03:20.920> kind

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
you the what they call the energy kind

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.100 
you the what they call the energy kind
of<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.130> little<00:03:22.310> energy<00:03:22.700> break<00:03:23.330> right<00:03:23.600> bet<00:03:23.810> that

of a little energy break right bet that

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.509 
of a little energy break right bet that
back<00:03:24.290> here<00:03:24.530> as<00:03:24.650> far<00:03:24.830> as<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.070> bottom<00:03:25.340> of<00:03:25.430> the

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
back here as far as the bottom of the

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:26.890 
back here as far as the bottom of the
shoe<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:25.790> concerned<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.330> they<00:03:26.450> don't<00:03:26.600> they

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
shoe is concerned so they don't they

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.110 
shoe is concerned so they don't they
don't<00:03:27.049> give<00:03:27.200> you<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.350> same<00:03:27.590> features<00:03:28.250> exactly

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
don't give you the same features exactly

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.410 
don't give you the same features exactly
features<00:03:29.510> as<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.870> get<00:03:30.080> with<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.350> UM<00:03:31.330> with<00:03:32.330> the

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
features as you get with the UM with the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.380 
features as you get with the UM with the
1.0<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.019> as<00:03:33.140> you<00:03:33.230> can<00:03:33.320> see<00:03:33.380> same<00:03:33.920> stud<00:03:34.160> pattern

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
1.0 so as you can see same stud pattern

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.000 
1.0 so as you can see same stud pattern
going<00:03:35.390> and<00:03:35.540> definitely<00:03:36.440> same<00:03:36.620> stud<00:03:36.830> pattern

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
going and definitely same stud pattern

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.530 
going and definitely same stud pattern
so<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:37.400> don't<00:03:37.610> really<00:03:37.940> stack<00:03:38.269> or<00:03:38.390> face

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
so you don't really stack or face

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.120 
so you don't really stack or face
anything<00:03:38.780> as<00:03:39.019> far<00:03:39.140> as<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.410> but<00:03:39.890> you<00:03:39.980> don't

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
anything as far as that but you don't

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.130 
anything as far as that but you don't
get<00:03:40.190> the<00:03:40.310> energy<00:03:40.640> pulse<00:03:40.880> coming<00:03:41.690> through<00:03:41.959> here

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
get the energy pulse coming through here

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.020 
get the energy pulse coming through here
they<00:03:42.440> give<00:03:42.590> you<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.739> same<00:03:42.890> design<00:03:43.190> it's

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
they give you the same design it's

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.090 
they give you the same design it's
similar<00:03:44.299> break<00:03:44.690> but<00:03:45.049> a<00:03:45.260> little<00:03:45.620> looser<00:03:45.950> and

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
similar break but a little looser and

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.340 
similar break but a little looser and
it's<00:03:46.220> not<00:03:46.370> as<00:03:46.549> it's<00:03:46.760> just<00:03:46.790> not<00:03:47.060> as<00:03:47.269> snug<00:03:48.110> and

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
it's not as it's just not as snug and

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.670 
it's not as it's just not as snug and
not<00:03:48.500> as<00:03:48.620> glove<00:03:49.010> like<00:03:49.250> of<00:03:49.880> a<00:03:49.970> fit<00:03:50.150> as<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.510> 1.0<00:03:50.989> so

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
not as glove like of a fit as the 1.0 so

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.319 
not as glove like of a fit as the 1.0 so
energy<00:03:52.010> pulse<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.459> not<00:03:52.640> included<00:03:53.090> in<00:03:53.180> these

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
energy pulse is not included in these

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.520 
energy pulse is not included in these
they<00:03:53.510> give<00:03:53.660> you<00:03:53.720> kind<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:53.989> same<00:03:54.200> design

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
they give you kind of the same design

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.949 
they give you kind of the same design
but<00:03:54.560> it's<00:03:55.220> not<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.610> same<00:03:55.820> kind<00:03:56.480> of<00:03:56.630> feature

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
but it's not the same kind of feature

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.509 
but it's not the same kind of feature
where<00:03:57.290> they<00:03:57.440> they<00:03:57.950> kind<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.220> live<00:03:58.459> off

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
where they they kind of live off

00:03:58.519 --> 00:03:59.949 
where they they kind of live off
supposed<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.120> level<00:03:59.360> out<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.510> amount<00:03:59.840> of

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
supposed to level out the amount of

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.110 
supposed to level out the amount of
energy<00:04:00.110> you<00:04:00.470> exert<00:04:00.739> throughout<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.790> match<00:04:01.940> or

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
energy you exert throughout a match or

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.220 
energy you exert throughout a match or
training<00:04:02.390> session<00:04:02.690> so<00:04:02.810> it's<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.959> little<00:04:03.049> bit

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
training session so it's a little bit

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.080 
training session so it's a little bit
different<00:04:03.470> on<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.590> front<00:04:03.950> again<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:04.970> could

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
different on that front again that could

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.819 
different on that front again that could
be<00:04:05.209> just<00:04:05.390> a<00:04:05.450> little<00:04:05.480> little<00:04:06.260> gimmicky<00:04:06.680> I

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
be just a little little gimmicky I

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.860 
be just a little little gimmicky I
didn't<00:04:07.370> see<00:04:07.459> a<00:04:07.489> huge<00:04:07.790> difference<00:04:08.209> as<00:04:08.630> far<00:04:08.660> as

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
didn't see a huge difference as far as

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.509 
didn't see a huge difference as far as
the<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.320> flexibility<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.160> bend<00:04:10.370> on<00:04:10.459> the

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
the the flexibility and the bend on the

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.729 
the the flexibility and the bend on the
shoes<00:04:10.790> but<00:04:11.540> as<00:04:11.630> far<00:04:11.810> as<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.170> kind<00:04:12.470> of<00:04:12.530> hold

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
shoes but as far as the the kind of hold

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.500 
shoes but as far as the the kind of hold
and<00:04:13.130> moving<00:04:13.549> laterally<00:04:13.850> and<00:04:14.090> I<00:04:14.150> definitely

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
and moving laterally and I definitely

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.780 
and moving laterally and I definitely
saw<00:04:14.600> a<00:04:14.630> difference<00:04:14.959> at<00:04:15.079> one<00:04:15.170> point<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.440> was<00:04:15.790> far

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
saw a difference at one point I was far

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.699 
saw a difference at one point I was far
exceed<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.180> 2.0<00:04:17.600> is<00:04:17.660> for<00:04:17.870> sure<00:04:18.079> I'm<00:04:18.500> gonna

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
exceed the 2.0 is for sure I'm gonna

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.259 
exceed the 2.0 is for sure I'm gonna
give<00:04:18.829> you<00:04:18.890> a<00:04:18.950> little<00:04:19.070> bit<00:04:19.250> grittier<00:04:19.549> with<00:04:20.180> the

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
give you a little bit grittier with the

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:21.670 
give you a little bit grittier with the
energy<00:04:20.570> sling<00:04:20.840> so<00:04:20.989> you<00:04:21.079> have<00:04:21.289> a<00:04:21.320> little<00:04:21.440> bit

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
energy sling so you have a little bit

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.200 
energy sling so you have a little bit
better<00:04:21.799> touch<00:04:22.099> and<00:04:22.340> instep<00:04:22.700> on<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.880> ball<00:04:23.090> as

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
better touch and instep on the ball as

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.230 
better touch and instep on the ball as
well<00:04:23.360> cool<00:04:24.260> feature<00:04:24.820> they<00:04:25.820> do<00:04:25.880> give<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.150> the

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
well cool feature they do give you the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.040 
well cool feature they do give you the
mesh<00:04:26.390> on<00:04:26.539> in<00:04:26.750> the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
mesh on in the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.960 
mesh on in the
protection<00:04:27.830> on<00:04:27.949> here<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.250> here<00:04:28.490> in<00:04:28.759> a

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
protection on here and here in a

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.040 
protection on here and here in a
second-tier<00:04:29.360> model<00:04:29.629> I<00:04:29.690> thought<00:04:29.840> that<00:04:29.960> was

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
second-tier model I thought that was

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.119 
second-tier model I thought that was
pretty<00:04:30.139> cool<00:04:30.349> they<00:04:30.500> don't<00:04:30.650> give<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.919> neon

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:31.129 
pretty cool they don't give you the neon

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.070 
pretty cool they don't give you the neon
laces<00:04:31.520> I'm<00:04:32.210> also<00:04:32.389> with<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.750> second-tier

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
laces I'm also with the second-tier

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.300 
laces I'm also with the second-tier
model<00:04:33.379> so<00:04:33.470> that's<00:04:33.530> that's<00:04:33.860> a<00:04:34.009> little<00:04:34.160> bit

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
model so that's that's a little bit

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.770 
model so that's that's a little bit
different<00:04:34.610> as<00:04:34.699> well<00:04:34.819> so<00:04:35.030> that<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.629> is<00:04:35.750> a

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
different as well so that that is a

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.800 
different as well so that that is a
decent<00:04:36.699> decently<00:04:37.699> different<00:04:38.060> difference<00:04:38.629> if

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
decent decently different difference if

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.170 
decent decently different difference if
you<00:04:38.930> will<00:04:39.110> between<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.889> two<00:04:40.099> but<00:04:40.550> still<00:04:41.060> a

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
you will between the two but still a

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.029 
you will between the two but still a
very<00:04:41.389> good<00:04:41.599> shoe<00:04:41.780> obviously<00:04:42.349> I<00:04:42.409> felt<00:04:42.889> like

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
very good shoe obviously I felt like

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.159 
very good shoe obviously I felt like
they<00:04:43.159> were<00:04:43.190> very<00:04:43.460> very<00:04:43.629> comfortable<00:04:44.629> my<00:04:44.960> feet

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
they were very very comfortable my feet

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.420 
they were very very comfortable my feet
they<00:04:45.319> still<00:04:45.530> fit<00:04:45.710> very<00:04:45.949> nicely

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
they still fit very nicely

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.129 
they still fit very nicely
the<00:04:46.940> only<00:04:47.090> difference<00:04:47.479> obviously<00:04:47.900> is<00:04:47.990> I

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
the only difference obviously is I

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.689 
the only difference obviously is I
didn't<00:04:48.409> feel<00:04:48.530> like<00:04:48.710> this<00:04:49.220> sling<00:04:49.430> on<00:04:49.550> these

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
didn't feel like this sling on these

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.850 
didn't feel like this sling on these
held<00:04:49.940> us<00:04:50.150> as<00:04:50.360> nicely<00:04:50.690> as<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.110> 1.0<00:04:51.530> switch<00:04:51.740> is

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
held us as nicely as the 1.0 switch is

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.350 
held us as nicely as the 1.0 switch is
to<00:04:51.949> be<00:04:52.039> expected<00:04:52.280> but<00:04:53.000> they<00:04:53.060> do<00:04:53.150> give<00:04:53.300> you

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
to be expected but they do give you

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.430 
to be expected but they do give you
similar<00:04:53.539> features<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.050> they<00:04:54.110> do<00:04:54.169> give<00:04:54.319> you<00:04:54.409> the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
similar features so they do give you the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.879 
similar features so they do give you the
outer<00:04:54.650> padding<00:04:55.400> toe<00:04:56.060> padding<00:04:56.800> obviously<00:04:57.800> in

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
outer padding toe padding obviously in

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.040 
outer padding toe padding obviously in
the<00:04:57.979> bottom<00:04:58.310> as<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:58.759> said<00:04:58.940> before<00:04:59.090> they<00:04:59.750> do<00:04:59.810> not

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
the bottom as I said before they do not

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.379 
the bottom as I said before they do not
give<00:05:00.229> you<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.590> same<00:05:00.830> as<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.729> 1.0<00:05:02.180> is<00:05:02.210> they're

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
not going to give you the same features

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
the same energy pulse feature which is

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.990 
the same energy pulse feature which is
take<00:05:06.590> it<00:05:06.680> for<00:05:06.770> what<00:05:06.889> it's<00:05:06.979> worth<00:05:07.039> from<00:05:07.699> adidas

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
take it for what it's worth from adidas

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.300 
take it for what it's worth from adidas
so<00:05:08.330> kind<00:05:09.199> of<00:05:09.289> to<00:05:09.560> each<00:05:09.680> their<00:05:09.860> own<00:05:09.919> but<00:05:10.280> I

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
so kind of to each their own but I

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.680 
so kind of to each their own but I
thought<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.880> one<00:05:11.210> point<00:05:11.419> I<00:05:11.479> was<00:05:11.569> obviously

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
thought the one point I was obviously

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.149 
thought the one point I was obviously
fit<00:05:12.020> a<00:05:12.050> little<00:05:12.229> bit<00:05:12.409> snugger<00:05:12.740> I<00:05:12.770> felt<00:05:13.069> like

fit a little bit snugger I felt like

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:14.230
