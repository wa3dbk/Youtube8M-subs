it's<00:00:01.589> going<00:00:01.740> to<00:00:01.800> be<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:01.890> quick<00:00:02.159> video<00:00:02.370> on<00:00:02.520> the

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.020 
it's going to be a quick video on the

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.140 
it's going to be a quick video on the
siphoning<00:00:04.020> Python<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.770> how<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.580> set<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.060> up

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
siphoning Python on how to set it up

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.730 
siphoning Python on how to set it up
basically<00:00:06.690> it's<00:00:06.779> going<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.960> first<00:00:07.200> start<00:00:07.500> with

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
basically it's going to first start with

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.790 
basically it's going to first start with
a<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.639> adapter<00:00:09.630> right<00:00:09.750> here<00:00:09.809> it's<00:00:10.620> going<00:00:10.740> to

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
a the adapter right here it's going to

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.390 
a the adapter right here it's going to
hook<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.490> most<00:00:11.730> sinks<00:00:12.240> some<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> dozen<00:00:13.469> most

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
hook the most sinks some a dozen most

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400 
hook the most sinks some a dozen most
your<00:00:14.580> kitchen<00:00:14.910> sinks<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.269> well<00:00:15.480> next<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
your kitchen sinks and well next is

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.320 
your kitchen sinks and well next is
going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.710> be<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.070> actual<00:00:17.250> gravity<00:00:17.820> feeder

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
going to be the actual gravity feeder

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.929 
going to be the actual gravity feeder
part<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.710> does<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.160> actually<00:00:20.340> controls

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
part what this does is actually controls

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.990 
part what this does is actually controls
the<00:00:21.029> siphon<00:00:21.660> or<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> filling<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.680> tank<00:00:23.010> so

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the siphon or the filling of the tank so

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.370 
the siphon or the filling of the tank so
if<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.210> want<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.420> siphon<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.109> leave<00:00:25.350> it

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
if you want to siphon it you leave it

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.519 
if you want to siphon it you leave it
down<00:00:25.789> like<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.330> that's<00:00:28.050> actually<00:00:28.260> going

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
down like that and that's actually going

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.950 
down like that and that's actually going
to<00:00:28.680> draw<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> wire<00:00:29.310> from<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.939> sink<00:00:30.210> through

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
to draw the wire from the sink through

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.389 
to draw the wire from the sink through
here<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> create<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.619> siphon<00:00:32.070> that's<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.340> to

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
here to create a siphon that's going to

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.910 
here to create a siphon that's going to
pull<00:00:32.640> water<00:00:32.820> through<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:33.210> pull<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:33.780> out<00:00:33.960> all

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
pull water through here pull it out all

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
pull water through here pull it out all
excess<00:00:35.489> water<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:36.120> wastewater<00:00:36.690> sucks<00:00:37.050> from

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
excess water all wastewater sucks from

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.780 
excess water all wastewater sucks from
the<00:00:37.320> tank<00:00:37.559> will<00:00:37.829> actually<00:00:38.129> go<00:00:38.250> into<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> sink

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the tank will actually go into the sink

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.420 
the tank will actually go into the sink
as<00:00:38.910> you<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> sand<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> all<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
as you can see with the sand so all the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.590 
as you can see with the sand so all the
water's<00:00:41.700> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.910> go<00:00:42.030> from<00:00:42.239> there

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
water's going to go from there

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.389 
water's going to go from there
if<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.290> want<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.530> fill<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> tank<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.280> as

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
if you want to fill the tank it's as

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.540 
if you want to fill the tank it's as
quick<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.789> easy<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.149> pushing<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.899> twisting

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
quick as easy as pushing up and twisting

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
quick as easy as pushing up and twisting
the<00:00:47.550> wooden<00:00:47.879> through<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.360> metal<00:00:48.690> screws<00:00:49.020> hold

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the wooden through the metal screws hold

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.600 
the wooden through the metal screws hold
it<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.559> place<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.489> go

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it in place so it's not going to go

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.569 
it in place so it's not going to go
anywhere<00:00:50.870> what<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.050> does<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.410> actually

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
anywhere what this does is actually

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.279 
anywhere what this does is actually
closes<00:00:53.579> off<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.730> valve<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.239> here<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.690> pushes

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
closes off the valve in here and pushes

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.330 
closes off the valve in here and pushes
the<00:00:55.379> water<00:00:55.530> back<00:00:55.860> through<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> actual<00:00:56.699> tube

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
the water back through the actual tube

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.240 
the water back through the actual tube
so<00:00:59.340> with<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.640> it's<00:01:00.510> quite<00:01:00.809> easy<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.140> use<00:01:01.440> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
so with that it's quite easy to use so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.490 
so with that it's quite easy to use so
if<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.460> put<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.789> push<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.149> down<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.719> turn<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
if you put it push it down and turn the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.010 
if you put it push it down and turn the
water<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.790> it's<00:01:05.790> going<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.420> push<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> water

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
water on it's going to push the water

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.039 
water on it's going to push the water
through<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:08.299> but<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.510> only<00:01:09.600> thing<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
through here but the only thing that you

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.289 
through here but the only thing that you
want<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.350> keep<00:01:10.500> an<00:01:10.680> eye<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> spray

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
want to keep an eye on as if the spray

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.910 
want to keep an eye on as if the spray
isn't<00:01:12.540> going<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.049> over<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.350> place<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
isn't going to be all over the place and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.850 
isn't going to be all over the place and
it<00:01:14.159> does<00:01:14.340> fill<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.790> quite<00:01:15.150> rapidly<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.799> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it does fill up quite rapidly so you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920 
it does fill up quite rapidly so you
definitely<00:01:17.009> keep<00:01:17.520> an<00:01:17.640> eye<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.720> one

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
definitely keep an eye on that the one

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.270 
definitely keep an eye on that the one
thing<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.619> make<00:01:19.710> sure<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.130> water

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
thing I do to make sure the water

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.910 
thing I do to make sure the water
doesn't<00:01:20.700> spray<00:01:20.939> heater<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.390> top<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:22.740> out

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
doesn't spray heater on the top or out

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.340 
doesn't spray heater on the top or out
of<00:01:23.070> here<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.520> spray<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:24.060> over<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:25.170> can

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
of here they spray all over as you can

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.330 
of here they spray all over as you can
just<00:01:25.560> put<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.750> towel<00:01:27.750> right<00:01:28.049> over<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:29.220> is

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
just put a towel right over this is

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.890 
just put a towel right over this is
going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> help<00:01:29.729> draw<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> water<00:01:30.600> down

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
going to help draw all the water down

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.880 
going to help draw all the water down
and<00:01:32.509> actually<00:01:33.509> goes<00:01:33.689> right<00:01:34.229> into<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.560> sink

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
and actually goes right into the sink

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.450 
and actually goes right into the sink
into<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.460> nice<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.840> screen<00:01:37.460> otherwise

into a nice you know screen otherwise

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.980 
into a nice you know screen otherwise
sometimes<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.390> don't<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> hooked
