as a hologram projector will augment it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.980 
as a hologram projector will augment it
really<00:01:48.410> so<00:01:48.980> only<00:01:49.220> you<00:01:49.490> or<00:01:49.760> anyone<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.480> want<00:01:50.810> to

really so only you or anyone you want to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.830 
really so only you or anyone you want to
see<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.350> polygram<00:01:51.830> can<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:53.180> eye<00:01:53.210> ring<00:01:53.630> will

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
see the polygram can the eye ring will

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.020 
see the polygram can the eye ring will
also<00:01:54.290> have<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.590> real<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.070> front<00:01:55.370> camera<00:01:55.790> on<00:01:55.910> it
