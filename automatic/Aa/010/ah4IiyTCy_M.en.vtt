hello and welcome to my video on how to

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.829 
hello and welcome to my video on how to
create<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.620> vending<00:00:04.980> machine<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.430> Python<00:00:05.879> so

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
create a vending machine in Python so

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.669 
create a vending machine in Python so
first<00:00:08.030> define<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.210> program<00:00:09.570> I'll<00:00:10.170> call<00:00:10.500> it

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
first define the program I'll call it

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.050 
first define the program I'll call it
vending<00:00:12.830> machine<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> capital<00:00:14.340> M<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:17.060> I'm

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
vending machine with a capital M and I'm

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.320 
vending machine with a capital M and I'm
going<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.020> video<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.880> program

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
going to do this video in this program

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.220 
going to do this video in this program
as<00:00:22.340> for<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.460> user<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.060> enter<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.720> amount<00:00:25.019> of

as for the user to enter the amount of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.140 
as for the user to enter the amount of
coins<00:00:25.470> they<00:00:25.800> want<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.099> enter<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.640> then<00:00:26.880> ask

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
coins they want to enter and then ask

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.200 
coins they want to enter and then ask
them<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.570> enter<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.740> amount<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.429> coins<00:00:29.670> so

amount of coins and I'm gonna create a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.010 
amount of coins and I'm gonna create a
variable<00:00:35.790> called<00:00:35.910> Queen<00:00:36.980> nun<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.329> I<00:00:39.329> needed

the user to enter that and for that I am
going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.050> use<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> while<00:00:52.559> loop<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.280> need<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
going to use a while loop and I need a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:09.649 
going to use a while loop and I need a
count<00:00:57.559> variable<00:00:58.559> oh<00:01:06.740> wait<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.130> need<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.549> add<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
count variable oh wait I need to add the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.600 
count variable oh wait I need to add the
M<00:01:09.840> count<00:01:10.470> equal<00:01:11.280> zero

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.330 

and<00:01:14.650> when<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.920> count<00:01:16.490> variable<00:01:17.390> reaches<00:01:18.340> the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
and when the count variable reaches the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.760 
and when the count variable reaches the
number<00:01:20.170> that<00:01:21.170> is<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:22.040> here<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:23.720> stops<00:01:24.110> the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
number that is in here it stops the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.120 
number that is in here it stops the
wirework<00:01:25.670> variable<00:01:26.450> stops<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.470> just<00:01:27.860> type

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
wirework variable stops so I just type

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.540 
wirework variable stops so I just type
this<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:28.760> it<00:01:29.630> will<00:01:30.140> ask<00:01:30.320> for<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.680> amount<00:01:31.400> of

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
this in it will ask for the amount of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.780 
this in it will ask for the amount of
coins<00:01:31.790> that<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:33.470> user<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.130> going<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.430> enter

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
coins that the user is going to enter

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.960 
coins that the user is going to enter
and<00:01:35.620> this<00:01:36.620> is<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.190> variable<00:01:37.550> that<00:01:37.700> I<00:01:37.790> just

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
and this is a variable that I just

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.910 
and this is a variable that I just
created<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.690> I<00:01:38.990> need<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.230> put<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.440> here<00:01:39.770> as

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
created and I need to put that here as

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.440 
created and I need to put that here as
well

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
well

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:48.310 
well
total<00:01:41.500> credit<00:01:43.630> equals<00:01:44.630> 0<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:46.810> whenever<00:01:47.810> the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
total credit equals 0 and whenever the

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.460 
total credit equals 0 and whenever the
scope<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:49.310> go<00:01:49.670> through<00:01:50.030> these<00:01:50.690> variable

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
scope this go through these variable

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.030 
scope this go through these variable
goes<00:01:51.650> through<00:01:51.920> his<00:01:52.040> face<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.580> adds<00:01:53.050> one<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.710> the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
goes through his face it adds one to the

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.969 
goes through his face it adds one to the
already<00:01:55.310> existing<00:01:55.610> count<00:01:56.360> which<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:56.780> zero<00:01:57.080> so

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
already existing count which is zero so

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.250 
already existing count which is zero so
it<00:01:58.400> goes<00:01:58.610> up<00:01:58.820> once<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.720> comes<00:01:59.960> up<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
it goes up once and it comes up the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.950 
it goes up once and it comes up the
count<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.770> absolute<00:02:01.220> one<00:02:01.460> goes<00:02:02.330> up<00:02:02.450> again<00:02:02.720> and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
count and absolute one goes up again and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.490 
count and absolute one goes up again and
that's<00:02:03.380> one<00:02:03.710> comes<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.210> then<00:02:05.869> at<00:02:06.140> once

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
that's one comes to and then at once

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.889 
that's one comes to and then at once
again<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.340> becomes<00:02:07.430> three<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.570> so<00:02:08.720> on

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
again and it becomes three and so on

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.390 
again and it becomes three and so on
and<00:02:09.700> when<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.030> counts<00:02:11.630> that<00:02:12.290> count<00:02:12.620> reaches

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
and when that counts that count reaches

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.699 
and when that counts that count reaches
the<00:02:14.390> amount<00:02:14.840> in<00:02:15.110> coin<00:02:15.590> none<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:17.420> wire<00:02:18.410> loop

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
the amount in coin none the wire loop

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.100 
the amount in coin none the wire loop
stops<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.519> that's<00:02:20.090> what<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.390> need<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.810> enter

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
stops and that's what I need to enter

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.680 
stops and that's what I need to enter
now<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.470> need<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:22.010> ask<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.820> user<00:02:23.209> for<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:25.540> need<00:02:26.540> to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
now I need to ask the user for I need to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.740 
now I need to ask the user for I need to
display<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.530> amount<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:28.100> money<00:02:28.459> in<00:02:28.850> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
display the amount of money in the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.170 
display the amount of money in the
account<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.440> they<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.680> just<00:02:30.830> entered<00:02:31.180> like

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
account that they have just entered like

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.240 
account that they have just entered like
this<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:34.519> and<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:35.540> bit<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:36.380> rounds

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
this like this and this bit it rounds

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.460 
this like this and this bit it rounds
the<00:02:37.519> total<00:02:38.269> credit<00:02:40.239> into<00:02:41.239> two<00:02:41.810> decimal<00:02:42.320> places

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
the total credit into two decimal places

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.330 
the total credit into two decimal places
so<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.580> would<00:02:43.790> be<00:02:44.000> if<00:02:44.480> I<00:02:45.019> added<00:02:45.350> one<00:02:45.769> pound<00:02:46.040> and

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
so it would be if I added one pound and

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.990 
so it would be if I added one pound and
one<00:02:46.519> pound<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:47.330> would<00:02:47.480> be<00:02:47.690> two<00:02:48.140> pound<00:02:49.000> two

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
one pound it would be two pound two

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.199 
one pound it would be two pound two

all<00:05:07.919> we<00:05:08.070> need<00:05:08.099> to<00:05:08.280> do<00:05:08.550> is<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.300> same<00:05:09.889> for<00:05:10.889> the

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
all we need to do is the same for the

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.659 
all we need to do is the same for the
rest<00:05:12.510> of<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:13.669> items<00:05:15.020> but<00:05:16.020> we<00:05:16.349> use<00:05:16.620> an<00:05:16.889> L<00:05:17.370> if

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
rest of the items but we use an L if

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.180 
rest of the items but we use an L if
because<00:05:18.479> we've<00:05:18.599> already<00:05:18.780> use<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.050> if<00:05:19.530> statement

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
because we've already use a if statement

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.529 
because we've already use a if statement
and<00:05:21.139> we<00:05:22.139> just<00:05:22.320> do<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.740> same<00:05:23.039> like<00:05:23.280> this<00:05:23.580> so

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
and we just do the same like this so

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.750 
and we just do the same like this so
it's<00:05:25.020> literally<00:05:25.710> just<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:26.220> same<00:05:26.490> as

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
it's literally just the same as

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.950 
it's literally just the same as
everything<00:05:27.389> else<00:05:27.570> and<00:05:29.120> you<00:05:30.120> can<00:05:30.300> see<00:05:30.479> if<00:05:30.539> if

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
everything else and you can see if if

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.730 
everything else and you can see if if
it's<00:05:31.349> item<00:05:31.800> what<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.430> then<00:05:32.820> o<00:05:33.060> which<00:05:33.690> is<00:05:33.870> focus

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
it's item what to then o which is focus

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.900 
it's item what to then o which is focus
obviously

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
obviously

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:42.710 
obviously
it<00:05:36.180> will<00:05:36.390> take<00:05:36.720> away<00:05:38.210> 0.69<00:05:39.210> P<00:05:39.600> and<00:05:40.670> item<00:05:41.670> 399<00:05:42.480> P

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
it will take away 0.69 P and item 399 P

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.660 
it will take away 0.69 P and item 399 P
item<00:05:43.290> for<00:05:43.530> 15<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.670> so<00:05:44.880> on<00:05:44.910> and<00:05:45.680> then<00:05:46.680> we<00:05:46.980> need

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
item for 15 and so on and then we need

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.760 
item for 15 and so on and then we need
to<00:05:47.700> the<00:05:48.360> program<00:05:49.050> to<00:05:49.440> output<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:51.230> rest<00:05:52.230> of<00:05:52.530> the

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
to the program to output the rest of the

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.560 
to the program to output the rest of the
money<00:05:53.190> so<00:05:53.670> if<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:55.110> user<00:05:55.350> has<00:05:55.920> entered<00:05:56.540> under<00:05:57.540> a

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
money so if the user has entered under a

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.210 
money so if the user has entered under a
pound<00:05:58.470> and<00:05:58.970> they<00:05:59.970> have<00:06:00.150> chosen<00:06:00.450> item<00:06:01.220> 3

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
pound and they have chosen item 3

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.250 
pound and they have chosen item 3
leukocyte<00:06:02.790> which<00:06:03.450> is<00:06:03.630> in<00:06:03.780> 99<00:06:04.350> P<00:06:05.360> there<00:06:06.360> is<00:06:06.390> one

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
leukocyte which is in 99 P there is one

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.520 
leukocyte which is in 99 P there is one
P<00:06:07.530> left<00:06:07.860> over<00:06:08.310> so<00:06:08.910> the<00:06:09.330> system<00:06:10.050> needs<00:06:10.380> to

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
P left over so the system needs to

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
P left over so the system needs to
output<00:06:11.010> that<00:06:11.310> money<00:06:12.240> so<00:06:13.010> I've<00:06:14.010> rounded<00:06:14.310> that

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
output that money so I've rounded that

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.240 
output that money so I've rounded that
again<00:06:14.790> I<00:06:14.970> found<00:06:15.270> all<00:06:15.510> of<00:06:15.540> these<00:06:15.860> so<00:06:16.860> that<00:06:17.070> they

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
again I found all of these so that they

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.760 
again I found all of these so that they
have<00:06:17.550> they<00:06:17.850> are<00:06:17.880> proper<00:06:18.450> and<00:06:18.690> realistic<00:06:19.500> to

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
have they are proper and realistic to

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.910 
have they are proper and realistic to

credit so it takes that away from 99 p
which<00:07:50.080> is<00:07:50.110> no<00:07:50.530> point<00:07:50.830> five<00:07:51.160> six<00:07:51.760> I<00:07:52.120> think<00:07:52.150> and

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:53.040 
which is no point five six I think and

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:59.070 
which is no point five six I think and
it<00:07:54.040> outputs<00:07:54.370> the<00:07:54.730> money<00:07:54.940> so<00:07:55.710> that's<00:07:56.710> done
