00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello youtube people and welcome a 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.620
 more time to a video of the history channel 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.910
 of the day today is aliens colonial marines 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.460
 it's disgusting and not just in the relative aspect 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.920
 to the gameplay and the game in general itself 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.950
 this is something that has already been noticed by 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.230
 Several professional reviewers and sites 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.530
 dedicated to video games in general 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.360
 but also for some decisions 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.010
 quite unfortunate in the development 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.710
 of the same game that has been given to 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.079
 know obviously in the wake of the reviews 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.270
 disastrous that you are getting the most 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.230
 important to say of this kind of 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.120
 things is it seems that the box gave several 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.480
 different companies various studies 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.670
 different game handling for 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.040
 able to comply with the agreement that had 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.989
 signed there for the year 2006 with sega 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.690
 to publish a game for which 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.660
 has the rights to the movie aliens 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.140
 from don and century fox this is 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.250
 delayed by the work of as they say 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.470
 the sources of the company 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.960
 the box work in borderlands 2 this 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.630
 forced to guide box to pull back the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.120
 date several times including the last 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.150
 that they said was for 2011 when 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.310
 was presented in the e3 the game where 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.650
 they got an agreement with sega to 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.990
 delay the game's starting line 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.390
 another nine months this gave him time to 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.840
 gear box to finish putting all his 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.369
 effort the borderlands 2 and then 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.979
 I would obviously pay attention 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.750
 to aliens the theme is that to achieve this 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.619
 he also gave him the management of 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.850
 franchise 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.560
 the timegate study that was who 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.030
 commissioned the entire campaign something that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.520
 according to the sources of the company 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.390
 I was very far behind in relation to the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.940
 rest of the game 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.970
 in fact timegate completed the campaign in 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:57.360
 how much multiplayer this was 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.090
 finished by airbox in its entirety the 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.430
 problem is that this type of management 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.700
 where a disaster was completely made 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.560
 Take the game to have very low points 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.130
 as for the gameplay on behalf of the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.340
 intelligence 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.530
 official the duration of the campaign what 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.960
 unsatisfactory of the end and many others 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.210
 things more than we can if it 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.550
 wants to understand from part of the review 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.880
 vers obviously there are those who are more or 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.340
 less serious I in particular think that it is 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.980
 something quite quite negative the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.570
 campaign is yes extremely short the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.210
 artificial intelligence was demonstrated 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:38.400
 by several professional players who 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:40.740
 is horrendous and this is now a kind 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.010
 of all against all between the studies 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.560
 saying good this was because of such 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.500
 blame for that other but in general what 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.480
 only that can be said is that the fault 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.760
 itself is from gearbox and this must be a 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.100
 stain in your story because because 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.720
 first the professionals who had 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.090
 the possibility of playing a demo of 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.770
 game they say that this demonstration does not 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.330
 is for nothing in the game itself and that 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.500
 it is only a manufacture for 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.160
 make it look better than it actually 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.069
 was and that the game itself does not look 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.280
 absolutely 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.790
 no aspect as they had been done 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.819
 believe 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.170
 that's why the disappointment mainly of 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.709
 all these people at the time they had 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.139
 the possibility of taking the experience 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.480
 in their hands for the first time that is what 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.189
 which I think good that as I said you have 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.230
 a stain on the history of gearbox 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.439
 because this game was sold only in 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.599
 base to marketing there was no demo not 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.579
 He showed absolutely nothing beyond 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.799
 obviously the segments carefully 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.019
 selected from the game and this 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.629
 show that was later said was 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.169
 false and there's also the fact that 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.790
 sega that obviously did not want another 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.159
 delay because yesterday vox has said no 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.909
 is happy with the final development 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.590
 of the game 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.150
 the version that we today have the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.099
 possibility to buy for nothing less 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.889
 that 50 dollars or 60 the pc version is 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.590
 a little cheaper but obviously it comes 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:09.439
 he forced them to take the game though 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.900
 it was wrong badly finished because 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.560
 because they had to fulfill the agreement that 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.829
 they had signed so long ago 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.130
 of which arrives came to almost sue yesterday 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.900
 box for this is something delicate and this already 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.430
 yesterday he had boxed with duke nukem 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.050
 forever 'but good in that case was the 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.730
 hand that had touched them because duke 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.860
 nukem forever 'had been in 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.180
 development for a long time and 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.730
 many had been involved 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.900
 studies there were several parts of which 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.530
 that you had to remake others that 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.680
 obviously they did not serve things that xbox 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.270
 had to take and redo completely and 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.240
 obviously it was never going to be something 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.790
 completely positive but in this case 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.180
 where gear box wanted to take more than what 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.800
 could in their hands and could not comply with 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.900
 the obligations that had been 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.100
 committed to doing only because 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.410
 obviously they wanted to publish 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.620
 first your original property that is 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.270
 borderlands and then concentrate on a 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.210
 agreement they had signed 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.290
 this is also something that has to be 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.850
 negatively taken by part of 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.040
 us as players and apart in a 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.440
 time when the gamer is being made 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.450
 older and is becoming aware of 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.300
 this kind of thing in development is 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.560
 much more difficult and much more serious 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.320
 when it happens cheats 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.290
 I'm going to make him spend the money he's worth 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.990
 this game for a product that is not 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.520
 the height in quality standards of 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.210
 rest of the things that are in the market 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.100
 but good will be the east end for the 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.960
 aliens franchise in the games the 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.690
 truth was something very very promising is 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.160
 a pity that it ended like this but 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.930
 now it seems they are going to continue 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.310
 the fights between the studies the 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.530
 cross versions of who had 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.690
 really the fault of this ending 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.250
 in the way that ended if they have 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.770
 some opinion as always leave it in 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.000
 the comments below I am judge and we 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.000
 we see the next
