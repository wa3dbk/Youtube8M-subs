00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
that so every time I work out whether

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.290 
that so every time I work out whether
it's<00:01:38.590> during<00:01:38.920> practice<00:01:39.460> whether<00:01:39.970> it's<00:01:40.150> just

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
it's during practice whether it's just

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.940 
it's during practice whether it's just
working<00:01:40.630> out<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:40.900> gym<00:01:40.990> for<00:01:41.620> out<00:01:41.770> their

working out in the gym for out their
game<00:01:42.130> I'll<00:01:42.280> always<00:01:42.430> grab<00:01:42.940> a<00:01:42.970> bar<00:01:43.240> just<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.810> try

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
game I'll always grab a bar just to try

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.180 
game I'll always grab a bar just to try
to<00:01:44.020> replenish<00:01:44.320> those<00:01:44.560> muscles<00:01:44.980> that<00:01:45.040> make

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
to replenish those muscles that make

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.890 
to replenish those muscles that make
those<00:01:45.340> muscles<00:01:45.820> recover<00:01:46.480> a<00:01:46.630> little<00:01:46.720> bit

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
those muscles recover a little bit

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.870 
those muscles recover a little bit
faster<00:01:47.290> I<00:01:47.470> have<00:01:47.680> a<00:01:47.710> box<00:01:48.010> of<00:01:48.130> in<00:01:48.280> my<00:01:48.460> locker<00:01:48.700> and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
faster I have a box of in my locker and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.370 
faster I have a box of in my locker and
they<00:01:49.000> are<00:01:49.240> continuously<00:01:49.810> at<00:01:50.050> my<00:01:50.200> locker

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
they are continuously at my locker

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.290 
they are continuously at my locker
stopping<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.160> stealing<00:01:51.490> those<00:01:51.580> bars<00:01:51.880> from<00:01:52.180> me

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
stopping and stealing those bars from me

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.720 
stopping and stealing those bars from me
and<00:01:52.420> so<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:53.650> biggest<00:01:54.010> problem<00:01:54.460> for<00:01:54.550> me<00:01:54.700> is

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
and so the biggest problem for me is

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.400
