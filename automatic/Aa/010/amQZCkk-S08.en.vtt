00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
typically I put the front down so that

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.930 
typically I put the front down so that
when<00:00:31.230> you're<00:00:31.349> finished<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.460> get<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> front

what I'm doing here is

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.690 
what I'm doing here is
like<00:01:35.050> I<00:01:35.320> did<00:01:35.650> go<00:01:35.800> ahead<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.070> roll<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.370> right

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
like I did go ahead and roll it right

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.190 
like I did go ahead and roll it right
there<00:01:37.000> because<00:01:37.180> that's<00:01:37.510> where<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.930> sleeve

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
there because that's where the sleeve

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.040 
there because that's where the sleeve
ends<00:01:38.530> are<00:01:41.820> I'm<00:01:42.820> going<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:43.270> fold<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.630> a<00:01:43.690> little

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
ends are I'm going to fold this a little

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.140 
ends are I'm going to fold this a little
bit<00:01:44.200> larger<00:01:44.710> I<00:01:44.740> think<00:01:45.690> then<00:01:46.690> I<00:01:46.810> could<00:01:48.150> just

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
bit larger I think then I could just

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.880 
bit larger I think then I could just
right<00:01:49.360> up<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.690> next<00:01:49.930> line<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:50.740> the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
right up to the next line this is the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.609 
right up to the next line this is the
front<00:01:51.310> facing<00:01:51.729> me<00:01:52.119> now<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.690> here<00:01:53.350> is<00:01:53.470> your
