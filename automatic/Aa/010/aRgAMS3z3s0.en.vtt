doesn't have to be the same game you get
about<00:06:03.510> five<00:06:03.900> minutes<00:06:04.290> to<00:06:04.440> save<00:06:04.680> your<00:06:04.860> game<00:06:04.980> or

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
about five minutes to save your game or

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.150 
about five minutes to save your game or
whatever<00:06:05.580> and<00:06:05.910> you<00:06:06.120> have<00:06:06.150> to<00:06:06.420> close<00:06:06.660> the<00:06:06.810> game

whatever and you have to close the game
so<00:06:08.160> it<00:06:08.460> is<00:06:08.670> not<00:06:08.880> optimal<00:06:09.390> you<00:06:09.480> can<00:06:09.690> cannot<00:06:10.170> play

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470
