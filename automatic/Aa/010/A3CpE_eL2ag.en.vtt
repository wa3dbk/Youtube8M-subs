00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
in and the hand which we've basically

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:54.800 
in and the hand which we've basically
got<00:01:53.340> now<00:01:53.549> yeah<00:01:53.849> so<00:01:54.149> what<00:01:54.299> we're<00:01:54.390> gonna<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.689> is

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
got now yeah so what we're gonna do is

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.209 
got now yeah so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:01:54.899> gonna<00:01:54.990> remove<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.799> put<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.039> to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
we're gonna remove that and put it to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.709 
we're gonna remove that and put it to
the<00:01:56.250> side<00:01:56.340> put<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> bowl<00:01:57.359> filled<00:01:57.569> it<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:59.719> right
