 we challenge ourselves so that together we can 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:39.500
 change guatemala in my case I challenge to 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.750
 gabriel orozco from channel 22 andric arias 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.670

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.650
 and here the neighborhoods of channel 22 also 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:49.100
 so that together they can make a change 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.320
 guatemala and make a better country and in 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.260
 my case I challenge to give them here there was bull 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.170
 and to luís sierra with the food bill 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.170
 food bucket chain is important that 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.590
 all Guatemalans unite and 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.680
 let's be supportive with our brothers 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.489
 many times we let those moments pass 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.310
 where we can help others today is 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.560
 when young people are going to leave 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.300
 go ahead and move forward our country 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.360
 It is important that 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.580
 if you made famous or all 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.730
 we made famous in the bucket of 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.710
 water with him 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.800
 with ice 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.070
 and we can make the change for the bucket 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.050
 of food so the challenges challenge to 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.870
 guatemala the challenges 3 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.520
