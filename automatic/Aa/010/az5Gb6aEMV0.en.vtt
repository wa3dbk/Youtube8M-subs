00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.790
 before watching this video 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.720
 recommend you subscribe and click on 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.940
 thumb up 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.190
 Good day, dear 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.950
 channel escape users and guests te vi 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.100
 with you again i'm artem carpenters today 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.279
 in our video tutorial we will sort this out 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.199
 the error is complete as the file hangs up tv 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:28.410
 Now I will show you what kind of error 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.219
 Going to the spawn folder, run it yourself 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.870
 applications we have an error file just 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.390
 do it for 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:40.829
 if we click ok we will open full 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.840
 applications but functions in this smoothly 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.750
 did not have any that's how you 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.550
 see even if I open the mod let's say 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:56.550
 here and opened the mod fits and also no 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.170
 no, this is fraught with failure here 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.329
 so today I will show you a couple 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.880
 making these errors exactly these 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.850
 solutions we will have two start from the very 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 first and simplest most likely 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.439
 but choose what you will 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.110
 more convenient because every time to run 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.689
 application as administrator too 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.970
 not always convenient here but appear 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.540
 all functions at once, but there is more 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.040
 The solution in the mod folder is quite 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.350
 there is a file settings settings 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.979
 configuration we open it with 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:43.079
 notebook and the first line after 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:46.619
 general file with goats 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:51.210
 line and there is tsiferka 1 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.369
 if we replace with zero and keep 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.600
 running full we already have this error 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.229
 there will be no all functions 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.659
 given full in treasures will be 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.509
 be done here dear friends you a couple 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.739
 making also the third solution is 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:13.670
 add equal except firewall 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:16.850
 but this is not always convenient either 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.160
 I personally do through the parameters 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.220
 configuration settings just put 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.980
 tsiferku 0 and everything already goes on 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.550
 just basically no problem 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.410
 These are the friends that's the case I just 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.239
 I would like to ask you to 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.540
 comments on the video you wrote 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.640
 what next lesson do you want me to 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.170
 disassembled showed you on the example of fashion 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.920
 so I think that most likely soon 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.750
 a series of video lessons on pavel will be released 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.590
 did create a faction so i 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.540
 I wondered here, for example, we take 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.549
 any mod ready and just 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.010
 there we will create a new faction with all 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.410
 features that are there in it 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.620
 let's sort it all out now I'll show you everything 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.720
 I'll tell you now, but for now in the comments 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.360
 under the video do not forget to write what 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.400
 a lesson for you to make out what you want here 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.010
 and with you there was artem carpenters game 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.010
 channel escape tivi all bye and good luck
