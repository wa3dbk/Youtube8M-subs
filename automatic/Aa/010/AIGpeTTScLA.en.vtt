00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello friends on air 3d news to 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.969
 or with a selection of fresh news from the world 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.009
 high tech these days even 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.080
 iron man prints artificial 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.000
 limbs and with the advancement of technology they 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.779
 only get to the foot for example 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.029
 sxsw festival japanese company exe 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.189
 showed an artificial hand worth 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.840
 only 300 dollars to reduce the price 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 developers first used 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.890
 3d method of printing main components 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.309
 secondly deprived the gadget of their own 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.170
 brains 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.360
 for processing signals coming from 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.620
 electro biographical sensor 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.629
 used tablet or smartphone 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 carrier number of pre-orders 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.070
 it turned out that now they are no longer 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.079
 accepted but soon and xiii 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.390
 plans to provide more samples 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.199
 scientists and industry researchers and then 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.000
 go to mass production 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.980
 feeder joined the project 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.440
 spartan thanks to this browser for 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.449
 windows 10 got a lot of improvements in 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.289
 areas of graphic design layout and 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.600
 typography 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.580
 details are the spartan got 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.070
 support pick location nodal 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.450
 points in the gradients of es es and learned 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.939
 work with a variety of modes 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.280
 the imposition of the latter will be much more 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.960
 than in internet explorer 11 in it by the way 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.090
 you can try new now 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.860
 functions for this need to tick 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.840
 enable experimental features in 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.909
 Platform news of course good but 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.979
 a real balsam for the soul of web designers 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.540
 spilled only when the project 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.460
 spartan translate to open source 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.530
 code of which, alas, is not expected even 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.990
 no kickstarter dear viewers on this 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.299
 uber blocks modular 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.950
 production and prototyping system 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.150
 and also just very funny 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.040
 adult constructor 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.659
 standard sized blocks universal 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.369
 wide coupling mechanism 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.030
 a variety of controller elements and 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.520
 electronics 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.500
 the recipe is just the possibilities are huge you can 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.880
 assemble your own 3d lathe printer 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.649
 machine and or even a robot 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.630
 and if the alleged creators 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.600
 There will be few options that no one forbids 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.000
 connect to this arduino or raspberry 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.159
 pi and continue to create uber prices 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.870
 Blocks start at $ 50 but for 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.580
 this amount can only razdra 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.290
 of yourself in this case is applicable 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.000
 the rule the more the better therefore 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.700
 look at the project page on 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.320
 kickstarter and explore all your options 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.750
 inner child not playing enough 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.120
 to the left you will be very grateful more 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.210
 authorities are looking at 3dnews.ru before the meeting 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.210
 friends
