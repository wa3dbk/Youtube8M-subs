 since dominique de villepin came to see him on Saturday a long 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.180

 and this fight 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:18.390
 between its different forms 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.419
 a fight is the life appeased according to him 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.859
 dominique de villepin we can not stop praising the windows of his friend 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.859
 thematic it's magic the league 2 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.199
 extraordinary which is besides 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.570
 one of its trademarks and very strong light since the 10th and 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.660
 sign 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.890
 what is it 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.710
 I have that is this premium both its vitality its taste for life and at the same time 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.129
 time his research the question is still very cautious in his work 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.090
 always a question about things will they go further 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.990
 fourteen stained glass windows mainly in black and white 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.820
 only the three of the chair of readers 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.210
 its exception by the presence of Roma 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.100
 they are an adaptation of a series of others of china carried out in 2005 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.850
 for a book of bibliophile dominique de villepin book ever 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.900
 broadcast 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.390
 it's a word that awaits you if its work for the first time transposed 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.490
 on a stained glass window 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.780
 achievement that will certainly remain unique this did we have who had done 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.130
 when we are very very beautiful stained glass windows 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.690
 four policemen the characters 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.130
 we work very interested much adapted by the graphic designer pascal duquette 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.390
 is realized by the workshops of Ã©ric simard 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.690
 the perfect price transposition 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.510
 the solution the decorated glass technique 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.030
 the work nearly 17 years on paper being so vitrified 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.490
 something that did not want on belly punch 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.020
 it was precisely that which could be betrayed 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.260
 even an outside gesture there we kept only the clarity of his 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.320
 work through this technique 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.260
 the works are light and the suspension effect guaranteed 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.159
 in this place steeped in history 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.420
 contemporary and classic no longer arises remains the black and white a little dull 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.830
 but wanted to conserve and austerity places most of 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.730
 stained glass are but too many colors 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.940
 r and totally work 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.169
 transformed 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:13.109
 the first the will and if it was to keep transparency 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:17.730
 as for example the greenery is legible after hesitation it is in 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.329
 visiting the priory saint como that man who gave his consent to the 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.129
 realization of six stained glass windows 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:23.970
 in China 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.469
 painting and poetry have always been linked 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.229
 in this house and burial sites of pierre de ronsard the 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.279
 painting now resonates with the poet's work
