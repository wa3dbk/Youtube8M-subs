00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
you've got a little bit of a while to

you've got a little bit of a while to
wait<00:00:36.760> because<00:00:36.970> you're<00:00:37.690> gonna<00:00:37.839> have<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.199> get

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
wait because you're gonna have to get

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.130 
wait because you're gonna have to get
level<00:00:38.680> 29<00:00:39.300> before<00:00:40.300> you'll<00:00:40.449> be<00:00:40.600> able<00:00:40.720> to<00:00:40.930> build

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
level 29 before you'll be able to build

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.329 
level 29 before you'll be able to build
this<00:00:41.260> little<00:00:41.410> building<00:00:41.710> here<00:00:41.860> that's<00:00:42.129> right

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:42.339 
this little building here that's right

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.759 
this little building here that's right
and<00:00:42.550> you<00:00:42.670> are<00:00:42.699> on<00:00:43.059> level<00:00:43.239> 30<00:00:43.750> addy<00:00:44.199> so<00:00:44.470> I<00:00:44.500> guess

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
and you are on level 30 addy so I guess

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.410 
and you are on level 30 addy so I guess
this<00:00:44.920> must<00:00:45.070> be<00:00:45.250> relatively<00:00:45.640> new<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:46.059> you<00:00:46.120> it<00:00:46.269> is

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
this must be relatively new to you it is

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.729 
this must be relatively new to you it is
relatively<00:00:46.900> new<00:00:47.050> to<00:00:47.079> me<00:00:47.260> but<00:00:47.409> I'm<00:00:47.470> already

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
relatively new to me but I'm already

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.250 
relatively new to me but I'm already
seeing<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.250> huge<00:00:48.699> benefits<00:00:49.420> of<00:00:49.570> it<00:00:49.720> and<00:00:50.110> this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
seeing the huge benefits of it and this

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.990 
seeing the huge benefits of it and this
building<00:00:50.559> here<00:00:50.710> that<00:00:50.739> isn't<00:00:51.489> completely<00:00:51.790> I'm

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
building here that isn't completely I'm

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.310 
building here that isn't completely I'm
afraid<00:00:52.300> for<00:00:52.480> you<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.659> build<00:00:52.780> it'll<00:00:53.019> cost<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.290> I

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
afraid for you to build it'll cost you I

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.259 
afraid for you to build it'll cost you I
think<00:00:53.559> it's<00:00:53.650> about<00:00:53.940> 19,000<00:00:54.940> we<00:00:55.000> couldn't

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
think it's about 19,000 we couldn't

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.450 
think it's about 19,000 we couldn't
quite<00:00:55.420> remember<00:00:55.540> about<00:00:56.140> 19,000<00:00:57.040> gold<00:00:57.190> coins

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
take a couple of days for it to actually

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.780 
take a couple of days for it to actually
build<00:01:05.409> but<00:01:05.740> it's<00:01:05.890> a<00:01:05.979> lot<00:01:06.250> cheaper<00:01:06.280> than<00:01:06.640> the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
build but it's a lot cheaper than the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.010 
build but it's a lot cheaper than the
stuff<00:01:07.090> you'll<00:01:07.240> be<00:01:07.330> building<00:01:07.570> at<00:01:07.689> a<00:01:07.750> similar

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
stuff you'll be building at a similar

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.510

cream maker which unlock on similar

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.719

levels<00:01:11.110> are<00:01:11.229> like<00:01:11.320> kind<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.500> 40<00:01:11.920> grand<00:01:12.159> 36

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
levels are like kind of 40 grand 36

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.109 
levels are like kind of 40 grand 36
grand<00:01:12.909> so<00:01:13.900> it's<00:01:14.650> far<00:01:14.860> cheaper<00:01:14.920> than<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.520> but

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
grand so it's far cheaper than that but

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.910 
grand so it's far cheaper than that but
it's<00:01:16.689> not<00:01:16.930> about<00:01:17.080> the<00:01:17.170> building<00:01:17.470> this<00:01:17.590> isn't
