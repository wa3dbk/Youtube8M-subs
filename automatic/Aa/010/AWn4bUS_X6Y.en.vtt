like that
if<00:05:31.389> I<00:05:31.509> use<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:32.139> co<00:05:32.590> III<00:05:32.889> amp<00:05:33.430> with<00:05:34.120> mine

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
if I use the co III amp with mine

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.890 
if I use the co III amp with mine
jung-yoon<00:05:34.780> amp<00:05:35.350> but<00:05:36.220> uh<00:05:36.250> an<00:05:36.639> amp<00:05:37.120> does

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
jung-yoon amp but uh an amp does

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.040 
jung-yoon amp but uh an amp does
increase<00:05:38.440> the<00:05:38.680> audio<00:05:39.220> quality<00:05:39.400> a<00:05:39.639> little<00:05:39.910> bit

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
increase the audio quality a little bit

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.719 
increase the audio quality a little bit
it<00:05:41.050> cost<00:05:41.289> about<00:05:41.380> seven<00:05:41.889> dollars<00:05:42.039> on<00:05:42.490> eBay

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
it cost about seven dollars on eBay

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.250 
it cost about seven dollars on eBay
which<00:05:43.210> isn't<00:05:43.720> a<00:05:44.199> lot<00:05:45.660> when<00:05:46.660> you<00:05:46.780> compare<00:05:47.080> it<00:05:47.169> to

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
which isn't a lot when you compare it to

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.450 
which isn't a lot when you compare it to
the<00:05:47.350> price<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.740> headphones<00:05:48.160> and

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
the price of the headphones and

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.580 
the price of the headphones and
everything<00:05:48.880> else<00:05:51.720> together<00:05:52.720> they<00:05:52.990> really

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
everything else together they really

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.500 
everything else together they really
make<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.860> really<00:05:54.280> good<00:05:54.490> listening<00:05:54.940> experience

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
make a really good listening experience

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.540 
make a really good listening experience
so<00:05:55.780> it's<00:05:56.020> it's<00:05:56.440> worthwhile<00:05:56.800> to<00:05:56.949> spend<00:05:57.160> another

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
so it's it's worthwhile to spend another

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.430 
so it's it's worthwhile to spend another
seven<00:05:57.910> dollars<00:05:58.030> down<00:05:58.419> for<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.720> small<00:05:58.990> app<00:05:59.169> or

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
seven dollars down for a small app or

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.750 
seven dollars down for a small app or
going<00:05:59.979> for<00:06:00.250> something<00:06:00.580> more<00:06:00.729> expensive<00:06:02.760> the

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
going for something more expensive the

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.200 
going for something more expensive the
sound<00:06:04.229> can<00:06:05.229> get<00:06:05.440> very<00:06:05.650> loud<00:06:05.889> on<00:06:06.130> these<00:06:06.340> so<00:06:06.760> you

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
sound can get very loud on these so you

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.300 
sound can get very loud on these so you
can<00:06:07.509> have<00:06:07.660> to<00:06:07.780> be<00:06:07.810> careful<00:06:08.289> with<00:06:08.410> that<00:06:08.530> but

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
can have to be careful with that but

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.070 
can have to be careful with that but
other<00:06:09.580> than<00:06:09.820> that<00:06:10.030> these<00:06:10.240> headphones<00:06:10.539> are

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
other than that these headphones are

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.920 
other than that these headphones are
