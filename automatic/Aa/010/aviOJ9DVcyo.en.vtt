unpleasant things to you later so we

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.979 
unpleasant things to you later so we

and<00:06:55.540> I<00:06:55.870> think<00:06:56.110> that<00:06:56.230> is<00:06:56.380> an<00:06:56.560> intellectually

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
and I think that is an intellectually

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.350 
and I think that is an intellectually
and<00:06:57.430> morally<00:06:58.080> bankrupt<00:06:59.080> position<00:06:59.680> so<00:07:00.370> if
