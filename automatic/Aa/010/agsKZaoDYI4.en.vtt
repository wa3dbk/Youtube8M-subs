00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.540
 How I hate Moscow ... 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.120
 This big bustling city with its huge population. 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.480
 One metro ride is worth something ... 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.600
 True, this has its advantages. 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.840
 For example, you may be lucky enough to find an old Game Boy on one of the flea markets, 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.760
 for which the last owner asks for some miserable 300 rubles. 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.900
 Such a low price is no accident. 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.800
 Unfortunately, he had a small defect with the screen, 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.380
 but we will easily eliminate him now. 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.080
 As you can see, several columns do not work on the sides, 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.920
 because of what the image on the screen is incomplete. 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.880
 This is a very common problem for 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.740
 first models Boy Game'ev. 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.940
 It is solved quite simply. 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.620
 First we need two screwdrivers. 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.820
 The first one is this Tri-wing screwdriver. 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.720
 Screws of this type are very often used in Nintendo products. 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.740
 For example, in modern Wiimote'ah they also apply. 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.860
 So I advise you to stock it up. 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.680
 You can buy it in any online stores, for example, 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.700
 in the shop "CHIP and DIP", there I bought it 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.940
 The second screwdriver is the usual Philips type Philips. 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.180
 We also need a soldering iron. 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.460
 Well, let's get started! 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.120
 First you need to remove the battery cover, 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.360
 since there are two screws under it. 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.500
 Here 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.840
 and here. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.540
 Also four more on the back cover. Here, here, 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.960
 here and here. 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.640
 All must be removed. 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.620
 Be careful when removing the back cover. 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.420
 since the two halves of the Game Boy are connected by a train. 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.540
 It must be disabled, but very carefully. 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.760
 After successfully disconnecting the loop, 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.420
 The back part can be postponed and completely go to the part with the screen. 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.840
 There are 10 more screws on the board, 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.120
 but for them we already need the usual cross screwdriver. 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.520
 So we got to the screen. 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.280
 Now you need to remove a small rubber tape glued under it. 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.000
 This must be done very carefully so as not to damage the screen itself. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.440
 I personally used a small office knife, 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.160
 to gently pry her. 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.020
 The gum itself retired quite easily, 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.060
 but under it there was a very old layer of glue, 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.140
 which also had to be deleted. 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.480
 Now you need to connect both parts back 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.420
 and put something non-conductive between them. 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.240
 Well, now the fun part! 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.020
 To restore screen contact 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.520
 It is necessary to warm the cable with a soldering iron. 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.300
 The main thing is not to overdo it. 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.000
 and before starting, be sure to remove the soldering iron from the tip 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.580
 all solder otherwise it will fall on the train. 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.480
 But after that we just drive a soldering iron under non-working columns. 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.280
 and after seeing them gradually appear. 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.860
 Well that's all. 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.480
 It remains now only to clean it and collect it back. 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.220
 Well that's all. 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.600
 The casing was thoroughly washed with soap, 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.960
 it remains only to find a protective plastic on the screen 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.520
 and buttons A and B. 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.920
 The former owner loved to scratch them with something 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.100
 therefore it does not hurt to put new ones 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.760
 but this is the next time. 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.900
 To summarize, I want to say that the Game Boy was in fairly good condition, 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.020
 apart from a pair of scratches on the case. 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.440
 Even the dirt on it was quite a bit. 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.180
 The entire recovery process takes about an hour, 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.880
 does not require special skills. 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.700
 Therefore, if you got a Game Boy with a similar fault, 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.780
 Feel free to take it for a reasonable amount. 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.440
 Fix it pretty simple. 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.780
 I was very happy with my purchase. 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.640
 I really love this console, not even so much for its games, 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.920
 and so much for the fact that it just is. 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.020
 I stupidly like to look at it. 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.900
 No matter how trite it sounds. 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.220
 There is something in it ... 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.240
 old school or something. 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.060
 In general, I advise you to try. It is really worth it. 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.440
 Thank you so much for watching! 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.740
 I will be very pleased if my instruction is useful to you. 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.200
 See you again!
