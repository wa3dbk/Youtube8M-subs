issue<00:00:39.640> I<00:00:39.850> thought<00:00:40.090> he<00:00:40.210> didn't<00:00:40.570> see<00:00:40.840> it<00:00:40.960> so<00:00:41.200> now

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
issue I thought he didn't see it so now

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.900 
issue I thought he didn't see it so now
he's<00:00:41.530> turning<00:00:41.800> around<00:00:41.860> but<00:00:42.129> he<00:00:42.280> turned<00:00:42.640> in

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
he's turning around but he turned in

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.570 
he's turning around but he turned in
hopes<00:00:43.540> that<00:00:43.660> Cespedes<00:00:44.350> would<00:00:44.559> think<00:00:44.800> that<00:00:44.860> no

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
hopes that Cespedes would think that no

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.710 
hopes that Cespedes would think that no
it's<00:00:45.820> not<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.059> bottom<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.390> wall<00:00:46.510> I<00:00:46.660> don't

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
it's not the bottom the wall I don't

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.380 
it's not the bottom the wall I don't
know<00:00:46.989> what<00:00:47.230> pop<00:00:47.980> melvin<00:00:48.370> is<00:00:48.489> complaining

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
know what pop melvin is complaining

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.319 
know what pop melvin is complaining
about<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.980> little<00:00:51.220> turn<00:00:51.550> there<00:00:51.790> I<00:00:51.820> initially

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
about that little turn there I initially

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.330 
about that little turn there I initially
thought<00:00:52.360> that<00:00:52.600> Ichiro<00:00:53.140> lost<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.829> ball<00:00:54.040> but<00:00:54.310> I

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
thought that Ichiro lost the ball but I

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.200 
thought that Ichiro lost the ball but I
think<00:00:54.610> he'd<00:00:54.730> do<00:00:54.880> it<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:55.239> slow<00:00:55.540> Cespedes<00:00:56.140> down

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
think he'd do it so slow Cespedes down

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.600 
think he'd do it so slow Cespedes down
now<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.480> that<00:00:58.780> nobody<00:00:59.140> reads<00:00:59.470> that<00:00:59.739> that<00:01:00.430> hit

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
now that that nobody reads that that hit

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.940 
now that that nobody reads that that hit
the<00:01:00.760> Y<00:01:00.970> in<00:01:01.210> Sony<00:01:01.540> so<00:01:01.930> yeah<00:01:02.530> maybe<00:01:02.739> they'll

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
the Y in Sony so yeah maybe they'll

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.520 
the Y in Sony so yeah maybe they'll
check<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.310> out<00:01:03.460> on<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.119> replay<00:01:04.600> but<00:01:04.899> that<00:01:05.380> was

check it out on a replay but that was

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.249 
check it out on a replay but that was
the<00:01:05.649> correct<00:01:05.890> call<00:01:06.009> nobody<00:01:06.520> reached<00:01:06.700> over<00:01:07.259> and

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
the correct call nobody reached over and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
late tag they probably should be arguing
