00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 And here in continuation see how we 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.450
 we will land 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:15.870
 in his apartment on the need here 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:19.890
 such simple pots necessarily with 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:24.140
 holes make sure that the height was not 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:31.460
 less than 25 centimeters not less 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:34.829
 preferably 35 that's desirable 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.980
 it is undesirable to make a drainage 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:44.239
 I'm doing like that 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.239
 let's see this broken brick 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:56.730
 if in this the workpiece did such and here 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:02.239
 a little bit where i put it now 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:09.210
 fall asleep here his land is covered up 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:14.520
 here so we do such a funnel and now 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.880
 here is our sapling we just from here 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880
 by this method 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.310
 he goes here with the roots 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:29.880
 along with this its just yourself here 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:34.500
 neatly here's one sapling 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:41.119
 goes on here such a pot is the same 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.409
 the story itself here is simply depressed and 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.409
 he calmly goes out and 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.299
 and now we are a good climb and 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:04.329
 we plant money and put it somewhere 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.049
 let's say either on the windowsill or if already 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:10.569
 heat on the balcony in the process if 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.090
 let's say you have a cucumber that winds 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.500
 we can here 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:22.599
 poke some twig and desirable 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.040
 take a twig right here from the street break off 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:30.280
 from a tree 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:33.720
 such that it was natural and or 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.739
 tie it does not matter add a mesh 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:44.530
 This is the method we will have cucumber 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:48.099
 all year round I have this Polish variety 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.940
 but that does not mean that we can we can 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:55.090
 use any well look at 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.889
 characteristics of course but the principle itself you 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:05.010
 understand everyone success subscribe to 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:05.010
