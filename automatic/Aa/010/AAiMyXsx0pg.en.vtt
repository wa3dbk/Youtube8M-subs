so I think that's what's up stuff is
protesting<00:02:20.250> there<00:02:20.580> he<00:02:20.700> was<00:02:20.880> not<00:02:21.090> signaling<00:02:21.570> a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
protesting there he was not signaling a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.030 
protesting there he was not signaling a
top<00:02:21.870> or<00:02:22.020> anything<00:02:22.320> about<00:02:22.530> nature<00:02:22.830> which<00:02:22.980> I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
top or anything about nature which I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.740 
top or anything about nature which I
think<00:02:23.220> Solano's<00:02:23.550> corner<00:02:23.940> was<00:02:24.090> thinking<00:02:24.630> he

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
think Solano's corner was thinking he

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.250 
think Solano's corner was thinking he
had<00:02:24.840> done<00:02:29.360> again<00:02:30.360> just<00:02:30.540> kind<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.870> battling<00:02:31.170> for

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
had done again just kind of battling for
