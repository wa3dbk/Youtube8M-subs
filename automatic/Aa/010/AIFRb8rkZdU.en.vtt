we<00:01:21.900> may<00:01:22.050> have<00:01:22.170> lost<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.440> last<00:01:22.650> game<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.160> it

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
we may have lost the last game but it

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.000

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
was a good challenge for everybody and I

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.320 
was a good challenge for everybody and I
think<00:01:26.190> that<00:01:26.370> there's<00:01:26.670> always<00:01:26.880> benefits<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
think that there's always benefits to

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.910 
think that there's always benefits to
take<00:01:27.480> from<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.470> purpose<00:01:28.890> here

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
take from that the purpose here

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520 
take from that the purpose here
obviously<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.910> want<00:01:30.120> to<00:01:30.240> win<00:01:30.450> matches<00:01:31.140> and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
obviously you want to win matches and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.530 
obviously you want to win matches and
series<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.160> as<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:32.580> purpose<00:01:32.910> was<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.150> build

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.710

telling<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.140> guys<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.160> gym<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.910> don't<00:01:54.600> mind

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
telling the guys in the gym I don't mind

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.810 
telling the guys in the gym I don't mind
a<00:01:54.840> serious<00:01:55.200> loss<00:01:55.410> for<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:56.010> fourth<00:01:56.400> game<00:01:56.640> we'd

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
a serious loss for that fourth game we'd

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.640 
a serious loss for that fourth game we'd
beat<00:01:56.970> South<00:01:57.180> Africa<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.690> work<00:01:57.900> up<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.530> would

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
beat South Africa and work up that would

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.220 
beat South Africa and work up that would
be<00:01:58.800> a<00:01:58.830> perfect<00:01:59.700> response<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.990> series

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
be a perfect response to for this series

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.870 
be a perfect response to for this series
yeah<00:02:01.620> I<00:02:01.680> think<00:02:01.800> everybody<00:02:02.430> was<00:02:02.670> really

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
yeah I think everybody was really

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.820 
yeah I think everybody was really
pleased<00:02:03.240> for<00:02:03.270> David<00:02:03.870> because<00:02:04.200> she<00:02:04.470> showed<00:02:04.800> a

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
pleased for David because she showed a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.820 
pleased for David because she showed a
side<00:02:05.160> of<00:02:05.190> his<00:02:05.490> betting<00:02:05.730> that<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:07.650> we've

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
side of his betting that that we've

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.139 
side of his betting that that we've
probably<00:02:08.099> didn't<00:02:08.459> see<00:02:08.609> before<00:02:08.759> where<00:02:09.119> he

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
probably didn't see before where he

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.300 
probably didn't see before where he
better<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.689> a<00:02:09.719> long<00:02:09.899> time<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.229> Shepherd<00:02:11.099> guys

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
better for a long time and Shepherd guys

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.730 
better for a long time and Shepherd guys
and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
and

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.470 
and
I<00:02:11.890> almost<00:02:12.280> took<00:02:12.460> a<00:02:12.550> senior<00:02:12.850> role<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.210> that's<00:02:13.360> a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
I almost took a senior role and that's a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.750 
I almost took a senior role and that's a

another<00:02:26.710> step<00:02:27.040> up<00:02:27.570> certainly<00:02:28.570> hopefully<00:02:28.930> bode

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
another step up certainly hopefully bode

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.290 
another step up certainly hopefully bode
well<00:02:29.950> for<00:02:30.310> us<00:02:30.340> from<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.910> time<00:02:31.120> I've<00:02:31.270> been

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
well for us from the time I've been

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.270 
well for us from the time I've been
following<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.930> don't<00:02:32.110> think<00:02:32.350> I've<00:02:32.470> had<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> world

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
following I don't think I've had a world

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.770 
following I don't think I've had a world
cup<00:02:33.490> where<00:02:33.670> South<00:02:33.940> Africa<00:02:34.360> has<00:02:34.480> not<00:02:34.630> been

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
cup where South Africa has not been

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.360 
cup where South Africa has not been
favorited<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:36.640> it's<00:02:37.510> no<00:02:37.690> different<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:39.220> a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
favorited so it's no different in a

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.420 
favorited so it's no different in a
World<00:02:39.610> Cup<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:40.300> play<00:02:40.510> free<00:02:41.410> good<00:02:41.830> matches<00:02:42.280> in

disciplines you know the ogc was was a

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.160 
disciplines you know the ogc was was a
very<00:03:12.490> compact<00:03:12.970> series<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.360> million<00:03:13.660> five<00:03:13.870> games

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
very compact series a million five games

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.280 
very compact series a million five games
in<00:03:14.320> basically<00:03:14.740> 10<00:03:14.920> days<00:03:15.100> day<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:17.140> have

Australian is australia and new zealand
before<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.460> was<00:03:22.300> certainly<00:03:22.450> very<00:03:22.630> valuable

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
before that was certainly very valuable

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.980 
before that was certainly very valuable
for<00:03:23.290> us<00:03:23.320> and<00:03:23.700> coming<00:03:24.700> back<00:03:24.880> here<00:03:25.180> playing<00:03:25.780> in

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
for us and coming back here playing in

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.020 
for us and coming back here playing in
West<00:03:26.230> Indies<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.530> getting<00:03:27.100> three<00:03:27.340> no<00:03:27.400> up<00:03:27.670> in

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.200 
West Indies and getting three no up in
many<00:03:28.480> ways<00:03:29.460> you<00:03:30.460> know<00:03:30.580> it<00:03:30.730> was<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:30.910> little<00:03:31.000> bit

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
many ways you know it was a little bit

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.150 
many ways you know it was a little bit
of<00:03:31.300> a<00:03:31.390> less<00:03:31.600> intensity<00:03:32.110> especially<00:03:32.560> after<00:03:32.740> we

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
of a less intensity especially after we

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.610 
of a less intensity especially after we
get<00:03:33.370> internal<00:03:33.760> app<00:03:33.990> so<00:03:34.990> it<00:03:35.080> gives<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.410> team<00:03:35.560> a

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
get internal app so it gives the team a

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.730 
get internal app so it gives the team a
bit<00:03:35.830> more<00:03:36.010> space<00:03:36.310> in<00:03:37.320> checking<00:03:38.320> your<00:03:38.440> squad

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
bit more space in checking your squad

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.100 
bit more space in checking your squad
out<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.970> going<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.330> the<00:03:40.420> World<00:03:40.600> Cup<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.870> think

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
out so going to the World Cup I think

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.110 
out so going to the World Cup I think
we'd<00:03:41.290> be<00:03:41.500> very<00:03:41.950> fresh<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.700> try<00:03:42.850> and<00:03:43.000> get<00:03:43.060> you

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
we'd be very fresh to try and get you

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.360 
we'd be very fresh to try and get you
know<00:03:43.390> back<00:03:43.630> into<00:03:43.870> them<00:03:44.080> into<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.070> serious

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
know back into them into the serious

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.150 
know back into them into the serious
competition<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.290> think<00:03:47.440> it's<00:03:47.710> really<00:03:47.920> good

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
competition so I think it's really good

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.440 
competition so I think it's really good
preparation<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.700> we've<00:03:48.940> had<00:03:49.090> that<00:03:49.210> we<00:03:49.330> had<00:03:49.420> a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
preparation that we've had that we had a

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.600 
preparation that we've had that we had a
really<00:03:49.630> tough<00:03:49.750> series<00:03:50.260> in<00:03:50.740> Australia<00:03:51.340> where

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
really tough series in Australia where

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.270 
really tough series in Australia where
we<00:03:51.700> didn't<00:03:51.940> do<00:03:52.030> too<00:03:52.150> well<00:03:52.770> had<00:03:53.770> a<00:03:53.800> few<00:03:53.980> hiccups

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
we didn't do too well had a few hiccups

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.030 
we didn't do too well had a few hiccups
in<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.270> series<00:03:55.480> came<00:03:56.140> back<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.560> we've<00:03:56.860> done

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
in that series came back and we've done

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.060 
in that series came back and we've done
pretty<00:03:57.160> well<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:59.110> i<00:03:59.140> think<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.530> preparations

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
pretty well so i think the preparations

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.970 
pretty well so i think the preparations
been<00:04:00.250> probably<00:04:00.670> really<00:04:01.000> good<00:04:01.180> in<00:04:01.330> it<00:04:01.510> not

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
been probably really good in it not

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.850 
been probably really good in it not
being<00:04:02.980> have<00:04:03.550> any<00:04:03.700> fear<00:04:04.600> of<00:04:04.690> burnout<00:04:05.140> in<00:04:05.560> terms

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
being have any fear of burnout in terms

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.550 
being have any fear of burnout in terms
of<00:04:05.980> intensity<00:04:06.460> and<00:04:06.820> in<00:04:07.120> crucial<00:04:07.900> pneus<00:04:08.230> before

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
of intensity and in crucial pneus before
