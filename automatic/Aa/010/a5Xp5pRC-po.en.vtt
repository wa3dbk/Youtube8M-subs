 the flies and now I'll show you 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:22.310
 as you know the software for your elgato 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.429
 game capture hd installed and 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.429
 So set up so first if you 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:32.960
 your game capture successfully 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:35.329
 So you have connected to the ps3 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:42.910
 you have connected then you go first 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:46.640
 on this internet and typing a garden 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.320
 go here to the website and then 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.920
 Just click in the middle of the picture 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.230
 game capture hd then you come here 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.050
 the site is the official site of 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.760
 the game capture and then you can here 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.120
 again something is very important if 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.879
 you guys get the technical stuff here 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.060
 information and then very important here 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.470
 the system requirements because that is 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.050
 they need a little bit 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.900
 a bit more requirements than that 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.160
 hapag hd pvr 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:23.510
 that takes four gigabyte ram 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:25.520
 and windows 7 or mac then 1 2 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.500
 gigahertz dual core processor 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.470
 so i have an i3 right now 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.840
 Okay that 's it then and then 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.520
 I would have to go to download then 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.800
 a window then appears either if 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.370
 your make-up will be yours or mac 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.710
 stop for windows 7 so I 've got it 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.020
 Downloaded times because I wanted that 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.500
 Do not do it in the video then 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.960
 just install normally and then 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.140
 Got the little symbols 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.740
 so game capture hdh it is like that 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.740
 then open it 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:11.960
 and include your game capture on yours 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:13.540
 pc or laptop then so 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.740
 So I already have it 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.220
 set up so here you see now 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.830
 a ps3 background or my ps3 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.070
 this is just how it works then you can 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.650
 set here 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.330
 here you have to 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.060
 adjust what input devices you like 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.100
 have either ipad playstation3 xbox 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.390
 or otherwise, for example, like 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.700
 or so here then what an input 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.020
 her then I believe in xbox can 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.690
 you can then set that either 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.940
 component hdmi at playstation is it 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.940
 stop only component because about hdmi goes 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.900
 not because it is encrypted yes 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:57.380
 then stop which profile either hd 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.910
 1080p 20 p or stop as you wish and 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.570
 the quality so we take course 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.130
 on in the best quality I would 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.780
 Also recommend to anyone if that 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.370
 can directly in best quality 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.870
 what should you actually pick up for what ? 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.450
 in the worse record if you're 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.030
 can here I have everything 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.470
 admitted and I look again 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.560
 Maybe something better 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.200
 can get out or not 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.450
 yes then you have your ps3 here 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.790
 background if I move here now 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.540
 for example, it comes across small 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.540
 delay 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.260
 yes and then you can go here if you are 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.860
 then this red button will click 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:44.600
 recorded and then is lit orange 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.670
 So then and then when you get back on it 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.950
 clicks then the recording and stops 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.480
 the elgato is that way you can do that 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.010
 takes if you had connected 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.380
 now, for example, you 're doing something 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.590
 horny then I could yes on this 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.600
 so rewind and then because of that 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.020
 So to speak, I always take it that way, I believe three 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.300
 minutes, so it takes on halt 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.950
 and then you can do that 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.960
 rewind and then on the cards 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.890
 then you can record the records 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.900
 actually already happened so and 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.520
 here you can just stop an audio 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.470
 because if you make that out loud then 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.040
 you also hear the ps3 sound right here 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.630
 about the laptop or about your boxes 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.100
 on the pc so I 've rented the now 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.990
 that is only higher on the television 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.730
 because that's kind of a bit 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.920
 weird when watching tv 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.350
 then you play the sound from the laptop 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.990
 yet at the same time it stops irritated 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.770
 and then here you can 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.680
 edit age you can directly 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.480
 cut and you have yours then yours 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.850
 you can still have some videos here 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.790
 select where you store the volt and 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.280
 here then what that's supposed to mean and so and so 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.100
 then here you choose in what you do that 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.520
 in what you want to deny that so 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.660
 we save the mp4 original 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.950
 and then you can still stop in that 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.740
 four 1080p or for movie maker apple tv 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.560
 and hold all that right in 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.600
 save the format 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:14.270
 yes and that was it and actually 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.140
 I would like to thank you for watching and 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.140
 Until next time 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.370
