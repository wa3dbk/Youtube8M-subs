rimless cube build I've been working on

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.950 
rimless cube build I've been working on
it's<00:00:16.750> a<00:00:16.930> deep<00:00:17.260> blue<00:00:17.470> model<00:00:17.710> it's<00:00:18.430> rated<00:00:18.700> for

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
it's a deep blue model it's rated for

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.390 
it's a deep blue model it's rated for
7.5<00:00:19.960> gallons<00:00:20.410> but<00:00:20.590> with<00:00:20.740> all<00:00:20.860> the<00:00:20.980> rock<00:00:21.190> and

7.5 gallons but with all the rock and

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.360 
7.5 gallons but with all the rock and
there's<00:00:21.520> actually<00:00:21.850> closer<00:00:22.030> to<00:00:22.120> 6<00:00:22.740> but<00:00:23.740> the

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.370 
there's actually closer to 6 but the

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
mixed and I also got a pre-filter sponge

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.470 
mixed and I also got a pre-filter sponge
on<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.540> intake<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:50.200> help<00:00:50.500> with<00:00:51.300> filtering<00:00:52.300> the

on the intake to help with filtering the
water<00:00:52.829> also<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.910> eventually<00:00:55.510> we'll<00:00:55.809> also

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
water also but eventually we'll also

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.690 
water also but eventually we'll also
have<00:00:56.200> C<00:00:56.470> camp<00:00:56.680> pure<00:00:56.950> gin<00:00:57.160> in<00:00:57.309> there<00:00:57.460> as<00:00:57.550> well

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
have C camp pure gin in there as well

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.240 
have C camp pure gin in there as well
because<00:00:58.600> I've<00:00:58.809> run<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.440> for<00:00:59.739> quite<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.040> couple

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
because I've run that for quite a couple

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.430 
because I've run that for quite a couple
months<00:01:00.579> now<00:01:00.700> in<00:01:00.880> my<00:01:01.110> twenty<00:01:02.110> gallon<00:01:02.290> with<00:01:02.380> a

months now in my twenty gallon with a

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.350 
months now in my twenty gallon with a
lot<00:01:02.590> of<00:01:02.620> success<00:01:03.040> so<00:01:03.610> that'll<00:01:04.059> be<00:01:04.149> filtration

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
lot of success so that'll be filtration

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.350 
lot of success so that'll be filtration

movement I've got a Cray Lea Nano in
here<00:01:13.690> that's<00:01:14.080> right<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.409> for<00:01:14.560> 240<00:01:15.310> gallons<00:01:15.460> per

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
here that's right it for 240 gallons per

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.270 
here that's right it for 240 gallons per
hour<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:17.229> from<00:01:17.440> an<00:01:17.560> overhead<00:01:17.770> view<00:01:17.979> I'll<00:01:18.130> show

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
hour and from an overhead view I'll show

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.890 
hour and from an overhead view I'll show
you<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.490> main<00:01:18.640> reason<00:01:18.909> why<00:01:19.000> I<00:01:19.030> got<00:01:19.330> this<00:01:19.570> one

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
you the main reason why I got this one

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.240 
you the main reason why I got this one
it<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.560> small<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.400> is<00:01:21.520> compact<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:23.250> that's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
it is small and it is compact and that's

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.950 
it is small and it is compact and that's
important<00:01:24.670> than<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:24.850> nano<00:01:25.090> tank<00:01:25.360> because

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
important than a nano tank because

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.620 
important than a nano tank because
obviously<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.770> space<00:01:27.549> is<00:01:27.820> limited<00:01:28.030> and

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
obviously the space is limited and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.899 
obviously the space is limited and
anything<00:01:29.500> that's<00:01:29.920> going<00:01:30.190> inside<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.670> tank

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
anything that's going inside the tank

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.789 
anything that's going inside the tank
you<00:01:31.150> know<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.330> don't<00:01:31.600> want<00:01:31.840> to<00:01:32.049> detract<00:01:32.500> from

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
you know you don't want to detract from

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.539 
you know you don't want to detract from
the<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:34.180> visual<00:01:34.420> aesthetic<00:01:34.960> and<00:01:35.619> appeal<00:01:36.520> of

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
the the visual aesthetic and appeal of

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.440 
the the visual aesthetic and appeal of
the<00:01:36.760> tank<00:01:36.970> you<00:01:37.090> don't<00:01:37.150> want<00:01:37.330> to<00:01:37.390> be

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
the tank you don't want to be

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.230 
the tank you don't want to be
distracting<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.490> kind<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.549> from<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.729> head<00:01:40.000> on

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
distracting so kind of from a head on

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.760 
distracting so kind of from a head on
you<00:01:40.540> know<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:40.750> pretty<00:01:40.960> much<00:01:41.140> fades<00:01:41.470> into<00:01:41.710> the

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
you know it pretty much fades into the

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.899 
you know it pretty much fades into the
background<00:01:41.830> if<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.340> go<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> little<00:01:42.580> low<00:01:42.880> you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
background if you go a little low you

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.120 
background if you go a little low you
can<00:01:43.150> kind<00:01:43.450> of<00:01:43.540> see<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.900> but<00:01:44.409> it<00:01:44.560> blends<00:01:44.830> in

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
can kind of see it but it blends in

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.249 
can kind of see it but it blends in
there<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:45.729> go<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.090> blends<00:01:46.570> in<00:01:46.810> really<00:01:46.840> well

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
there you go it blends in really well

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.340 
there you go it blends in really well
with<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.680> tank<00:01:48.009> so<00:01:48.700> really<00:01:49.659> happy<00:01:49.869> with<00:01:50.140> that

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
with the tank so really happy with that

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.420 
with the tank so really happy with that
from<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.860> side<00:01:51.130> view<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:52.360> can<00:01:52.600> see<00:01:52.900> that<00:01:53.430> all

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
from the side view you can see that all

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.219 
from the side view you can see that all
of<00:01:54.729> this<00:01:54.820> rock<00:01:55.119> work<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.570> visible<00:01:55.960> from<00:01:56.080> the

side<00:01:56.439> this<00:01:57.130> back<00:01:57.570> wall<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:58.630> rock<00:01:58.990> is<00:01:59.259> getting

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
side this back wall of rock is getting

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.300 
side this back wall of rock is getting
light<00:01:59.770> from<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.600> par38<00:02:01.600> end<00:02:02.079> this<00:02:02.890> does<00:02:03.159> not

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
light from the par38 end this does not

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.429 
light from the par38 end this does not
extend<00:02:03.610> more<00:02:03.759> than<00:02:03.909> two<00:02:04.180> inches<00:02:04.360> in<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.689> tank<00:02:04.930> so

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
extend more than two inches in a tank so

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.389 
extend more than two inches in a tank so
very<00:02:06.040> happy<00:02:06.340> with<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:07.229> nice<00:02:08.229> strong<00:02:08.649> even

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
very happy with that nice strong even

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.030 
very happy with that nice strong even
flow<00:02:09.640> throughout<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.060> tank<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.720> I'm<00:02:11.409> betting

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
flow throughout the tank and I'm betting

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.760 
flow throughout the tank and I'm betting
it's<00:02:12.370> gonna<00:02:12.489> work<00:02:12.670> out<00:02:12.849> really<00:02:13.060> well<00:02:13.239> and

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it's gonna work out really well and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.900 
it's gonna work out really well and
obviously<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:15.069> blends<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.459> well<00:02:15.640> with<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
obviously it blends in well with the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.330 
obviously it blends in well with the
background<00:02:16.300> which<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.110> painted<00:02:17.770> black

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
background which I painted black

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.760 
background which I painted black
and<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.760> had<00:02:18.940> somebody<00:02:19.150> asked<00:02:19.450> me<00:02:19.480> what<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.380> use

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.180 
and I had somebody asked me what I use
all<00:02:21.580> my<00:02:21.940> backgrounds<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.540> paint<00:02:22.810> with<00:02:23.190> krylon

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
all my backgrounds I paint with krylon

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.930 
all my backgrounds I paint with krylon
fusion<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.910> use<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.840> gloss<00:02:26.200> black<00:02:27.100> because

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
fusion I use the gloss black because

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.949 
fusion I use the gloss black because
that's<00:02:28.060> what<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.360> best<00:02:28.569> but<00:02:28.780> they<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:28.930> a

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
that's what I like best but they have a

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.559 
that's what I like best but they have a
different<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.350> few<00:02:29.500> different<00:02:29.770> types<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:31.090> it

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
different a few different types but it

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.290 
different a few different types but it
bonds<00:02:32.050> really<00:02:32.260> well<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.740> glass<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.760> only<00:02:33.970> takes

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
bonds really well to glass it only takes

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.720 
bonds really well to glass it only takes
like<00:02:34.450> 20<00:02:35.020> minutes<00:02:35.290> maybe<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.980> dry<00:02:36.250> and<00:02:36.550> that

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
like 20 minutes maybe to dry and that

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.729 
like 20 minutes maybe to dry and that
might<00:02:36.880> be<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> long<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:38.350> only<00:02:38.470> need<00:02:38.620> about

might be a long and you only need about

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.040 
might be a long and you only need about
2<00:02:39.040> or<00:02:39.069> 3<00:02:39.190> coats<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.660> does<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:40.959> job

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
2 or 3 coats and that does the job

also has a sine curve let's got to on

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.630 
also has a sine curve let's got to on

then neutral and cool white so the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.440 
then neutral and cool white so the
reason<00:03:38.079> I<00:03:38.170> like<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.410> is<00:03:38.590> because<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:39.820> blends

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
reason I like it is because it blends

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.840 
reason I like it is because it blends

for reflecting light back up into the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.970 
for reflecting light back up into the
tank<00:05:17.290> it<00:05:17.700> kind<00:05:18.700> of<00:05:18.730> looks<00:05:18.910> like<00:05:18.940> sand<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:19.980> also

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980

little<00:05:21.490> really<00:05:21.730> help<00:05:21.880> in<00:05:22.000> this<00:05:22.150> tank<00:05:22.360> is<00:05:22.830> SPS

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
little really help in this tank is SPS

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.430 
little really help in this tank is SPS
like<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.040> lot<00:05:24.220> of<00:05:24.340> flow<00:05:24.660> so<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:25.750> can't<00:05:26.230> really

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
like a lot of flow so you can't really

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.960 
like a lot of flow so you can't really
create<00:05:26.620> a<00:05:26.710> sandstone<00:05:27.130> if<00:05:27.280> there's<00:05:27.430> no<00:05:27.550> sand<00:05:27.820> in

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970
