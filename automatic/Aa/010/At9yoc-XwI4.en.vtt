well<00:00:49.379> let's<00:00:49.980> check<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.340> out<00:00:51.680> there<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> few

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
well let's check it out there is a few

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.590 
well let's check it out there is a few
different<00:00:53.399> ways<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.879> determine<00:00:54.300> whether

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
different ways to determine whether

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.799 
different ways to determine whether
timing<00:00:54.989> belt<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.379> place<00:00:55.739> or<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.809> we're

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
timing belt is in place or not we're

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.930 
timing belt is in place or not we're
going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.109> performing<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.920> visual<00:00:59.370> check<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
going to be performing a visual check of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.540 
going to be performing a visual check of
the<00:01:00.059> timing<00:01:00.359> belt<00:01:00.390> itself<00:01:01.129> first<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.370> we

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
the timing belt itself first of all we

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.690 
the timing belt itself first of all we
need<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.940> remove<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> top<00:01:03.660> engine<00:01:04.110> cover<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
need to remove the top engine cover and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
need to remove the top engine cover and
to<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.090> simply<00:01:06.630> turn<00:01:07.409> these<00:01:07.740> three<00:01:08.310> bolts

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
to do that simply turn these three bolts

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.210 
to do that simply turn these three bolts
90<00:01:09.119> degrees<00:01:09.479> clockwise<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:10.380> counterclockwise

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.970 

simply<00:01:14.220> turn<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.550> 90<00:01:14.880> degrees<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.800> cover<00:01:16.800> it

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
simply turn on 90 degrees and cover it

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.450 
simply turn on 90 degrees and cover it
off<00:01:18.170> next<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.380> gotta<00:01:19.560> remove<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> timing

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
off next you gotta remove the timing

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.960 
off next you gotta remove the timing
belt<00:01:20.580> cover<00:01:20.850> itself<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.700> undo<00:01:23.700> one

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
belt cover itself to do that undo one

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.090 
belt cover itself to do that undo one
clip<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.480> one<00:01:24.660> side<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.260> another<00:01:25.590> clip<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.010> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
clip on one side and another clip on the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.719 
clip on one side and another clip on the
other<00:01:26.130> side<00:01:27.680> then<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.860> need<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.190> move<00:01:29.370> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
other side then you need to move the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.120 
other side then you need to move the
hose<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.810> run<00:01:31.110> across<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.680> timing<00:01:32.010> belt

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
hose of the run across the timing belt

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.400 
hose of the run across the timing belt
cover<00:01:32.400> simply<00:01:33.360> pull<00:01:33.570> them<00:01:33.660> to<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.840> top<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
cover simply pull them to the top of the

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:47.300 
cover simply pull them to the top of the
engine<00:01:45.290> now<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.470> time<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> find<00:01:47.040> out<00:01:47.190> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
engine now it's time to find out the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.460 
engine now it's time to find out the
truth<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:48.119> timing<00:01:48.600> belt<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:50.720> broken<00:01:54.229> at<00:01:55.229> this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
truth the timing belt is broken at this

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.370 
truth the timing belt is broken at this
point<00:01:55.800> we're<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.400> be<00:01:57.140> removing<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
point we're going to be removing the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.820 
point we're going to be removing the
front<00:01:58.590> end<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.550> car<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.170> get<00:02:01.530> to

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
front end of the car so we can get to

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.280 
front end of the car so we can get to
the<00:02:03.229> timing<00:02:04.229> belt<00:02:04.530> itself<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.720> also<00:02:06.720> after

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the timing belt itself and also after

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.340 
the timing belt itself and also after
that<00:02:07.320> we're<00:02:07.680> going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> be<00:02:08.100> removing<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:10.080> top

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
that we're going to be removing the top

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.640 
that we're going to be removing the top
part<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> engine<00:02:11.750> including<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.380> head

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
part of the engine including the head

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.070 
part of the engine including the head
itself
