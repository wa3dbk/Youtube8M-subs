Hi This is Sami from fawziacademy.com 
In this video I will show you how to fix the SSL Error 

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:21.133
When I connect to hermesonline.com this is my brokerage company which I used to buy and sell 

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:34.299
stock online I receive the following SSL Error  
This is probably not the site you are looking for!    Google Chrome may show this warning if 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.400
phishing and malware protection is enabled. It indicates that the URL listed in the website's certificate doesn't match the actual URL of the 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:59.900
site.When you connect to a secure website the server hosting that site presents your browser with something called a "certificate" to verify its 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.400
identity. 
This certificate contains identity information, 
Such as the address of the website, which is 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.033
verified by a third party that your computer trusts. 
By checking that the address in the certificate 

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:25.699
matches the address of the website, 
It is possible to verify that you are securely communicating with the website you intended, 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:37.200
and not a third party 
(such as an attacker on your network).
In this case, the address listed in the certificate 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:47.133
does not match the address of the website your browser tried to go to.
 One possible reason for this is that your 

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:56.466
communications are being intercepted by an attacker who is presenting a certificate 
For a different website, which would cause a 

00:01:56.466 --> 00:02:05.132
mismatch. 
Another possible reason is that the server is set up to return the same certificate for multiple 

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:15.566
websites, 
Including the one you are attempting to visit, 
Even though that certificate is not valid for all of 

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:25.432
those websites. 
Google Chrome can say for sure that you reached www.hermesonline.com, but cannot 

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:34.033
verify that that is the same site as hermesonline.com which you intended to reach.
If you proceed, Chrome will not check for any 

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:48.999
further name mismatches.
Then you have to write again the website include 
www.hermesonline.com it will be solve the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.166
mismatch
