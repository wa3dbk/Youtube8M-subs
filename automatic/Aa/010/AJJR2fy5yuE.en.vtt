00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
if your trap is less than 2 feet from

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.740 
if your trap is less than 2 feet from
your<00:02:14.740> floor<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.400> will<00:02:15.610> work<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.420> try<00:02:16.690> it

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
your floor this will work so so try it

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.520 
your floor this will work so so try it
out<00:02:16.870> first<00:02:18.030> push<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.270> there<00:02:19.450> grab<00:02:20.110> whatever

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
out first push it in there grab whatever

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.270 
out first push it in there grab whatever
it<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:21.040> can<00:02:21.220> grab<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.560> pull<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:23.890> back<00:02:24.070> out

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
it is you can grab and pull it back out

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.430 
it is you can grab and pull it back out
because<00:02:24.670> believe<00:02:25.210> me<00:02:25.240> sometimes<00:02:25.930> this<00:02:26.230> will

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
because believe me sometimes this will

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.900 
because believe me sometimes this will
do<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.770> trick<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:27.310> know<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:30.370> reason<00:02:30.730> why<00:02:30.850> I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
do the trick I know the reason why I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.640 
do the trick I know the reason why I
know<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.750> crawled<00:02:32.020> underneath<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.500> house

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
know is I crawled underneath the house

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.110 
know is I crawled underneath the house
one<00:02:32.890> time<00:02:33.100> cut<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.520> pipe<00:02:33.760> out<00:02:35.820> replace<00:02:36.820> the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
one time cut the pipe out replace the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.330 
one time cut the pipe out replace the
entire<00:02:37.390> thing<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.960> found<00:02:38.530> out<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.220> was

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
entire thing and found out that it was

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.760 
entire thing and found out that it was
hair<00:02:39.610> sticking<00:02:40.000> down<00:02:40.300> off<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.660> these<00:02:40.900> off<00:02:41.320> of

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
hair sticking down off of these off of

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.650 
hair sticking down off of these off of
these<00:02:41.890> screws<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:43.060> couldn't<00:02:43.420> reach

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
these screws and I couldn't reach

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.050 
these screws and I couldn't reach
everything<00:02:44.020> down<00:02:44.380> there<00:02:44.590> at<00:02:44.710> all<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.880> all

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
everything down there at all it all

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.510 
everything down there at all it all
built<00:02:46.720> up<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.260> Reno<00:02:47.620> wasn't<00:02:47.950> doing<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.250> trick

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
built up and Reno wasn't doing the trick

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.970 
built up and Reno wasn't doing the trick
how<00:02:49.120> I<00:02:49.150> had<00:02:49.570> this<00:02:49.750> little<00:02:49.960> tool<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.950> I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
how I had this little tool that I

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.320 
how I had this little tool that I
figured<00:02:51.310> out<00:02:51.370> later<00:02:51.580> I<00:02:51.760> could<00:02:52.090> have<00:02:52.180> just

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
figured out later I could have just

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.210 
figured out later I could have just
reach<00:02:53.020> down<00:02:53.050> in<00:02:53.470> there<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.710> pulled<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> stuff

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
reach down in there and pulled the stuff

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.730 
reach down in there and pulled the stuff
up<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.670> now<00:02:54.850> anytime<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.450> drain<00:02:55.720> clogs<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.680> know

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
up so now anytime I drain clogs I know

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.030 
up so now anytime I drain clogs I know
I'm<00:02:57.160> gonna<00:02:57.340> try<00:02:57.580> this<00:02:57.640> first<00:02:58.650> at<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.770> point

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
I'm gonna try this first at this point

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
sometimes they're ready to be stripped

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.880 
sometimes they're ready to be stripped
anyways<00:03:40.330> because<00:03:40.570> they're<00:03:40.930> waterlogged<00:03:41.440> and
