hey there everybody Mike here with
badlands<00:00:05.220> paintball<00:00:05.879> today<00:00:06.569> we're<00:00:06.750> gonna<00:00:06.870> be

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
badlands paintball today we're gonna be

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.720 
badlands paintball today we're gonna be
doing<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.379> little<00:00:07.560> bit<00:00:07.799> more<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.189> an<00:00:08.250> in-depth

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
doing a little bit more of an in-depth

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.749 
doing a little bit more of an in-depth
look<00:00:08.880> at<00:00:09.120> our<00:00:09.599> air<00:00:09.870> tanks<00:00:10.590> we<00:00:11.130> previously<00:00:11.460> did

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
look at our air tanks we previously did

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.350 
look at our air tanks we previously did
a<00:00:11.820> video<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.210> co2<00:00:12.960> versus<00:00:13.830> air<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.370> love<00:00:15.089> air

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
a video on co2 versus air I love air

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.300 
a video on co2 versus air I love air
tanks<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.049> use<00:00:16.379> air<00:00:16.560> myself<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.220> we're

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
tanks I use air myself so we're

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.620 
tanks I use air myself so we're
definitely<00:00:17.490> going<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.850> take<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> better<00:00:18.359> look

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
definitely going to take a better look

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.560 
definitely going to take a better look
at<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.260> air<00:00:19.410> tanks<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.189> carry<00:00:20.570> there's

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
at the air tanks that we carry there's

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 
at the air tanks that we carry there's
gonna<00:00:21.750> come<00:00:21.920> your<00:00:22.920> tanks<00:00:23.160> themselves<00:00:23.310> gonna

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
gonna come your tanks themselves gonna

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.009 
gonna come your tanks themselves gonna
come<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> lot<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> different<00:00:24.660> shapes<00:00:24.869> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
come in a lot of different shapes and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.810 
come in a lot of different shapes and
sizes<00:00:25.260> that's<00:00:25.980> kind<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.279> what<00:00:26.430> differentiates

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
sizes that's kind of what differentiates

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.759 
sizes that's kind of what differentiates
them<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.869> also<00:00:28.050> they're<00:00:28.289> gonna<00:00:28.380> come<00:00:28.619> in

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
them and also they're gonna come in

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.519 
them and also they're gonna come in
different<00:00:28.920> materials<00:00:29.789> too<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.449> let's<00:00:31.320> take<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
different materials too so let's take a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.350 
different materials too so let's take a
look<00:00:31.740> at<00:00:31.830> them<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.279> we<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.700> three<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.210> our

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
look at them here we have three of our

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.389 
look at them here we have three of our
most<00:00:33.690> common<00:00:33.960> sizes<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.219> our

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
most common sizes that we have in our

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.100 
most common sizes that we have in our
shop<00:00:35.640> starting<00:00:36.630> with<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> 48<00:00:37.640> 3,000<00:00:38.640> psi<00:00:39.110> this

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
shop starting with the 48 3,000 psi this

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.500 
shop starting with the 48 3,000 psi this
is<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> steel<00:00:40.620> tank<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.850> death<00:00:42.030> they<00:00:42.180> are<00:00:42.239> most

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
is a steel tank so death they are most

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.240 
is a steel tank so death they are most
common<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.960> our<00:00:43.020> tank<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.649> pushes

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
common in our tank that we have pushes

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.160 
common in our tank that we have pushes
out<00:00:44.370> around<00:00:44.610> five<00:00:44.879> minutes<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.840> are<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
out around five minutes or so are the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.860 
out around five minutes or so are the
most<00:00:46.410> common<00:00:46.950> markers<00:00:47.340> out<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:48.750> I

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
most common markers out there like I

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.529 
most common markers out there like I
said<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.590> steel<00:00:50.039> design<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
said this one is a steel design so it is

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:52.939 
said this one is a steel design so it is
gonna<00:00:51.690> hold<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.020> little<00:00:52.170> bit<00:00:52.320> less<00:00:52.649> pressure

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
gonna hold a little bit less pressure

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
gonna hold a little bit less pressure
overall<00:00:53.489> but<00:00:53.879> ridiculously<00:00:54.539> durable<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.199> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
overall but ridiculously durable and a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.590 
overall but ridiculously durable and a
lot<00:00:55.469> less<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> lot<00:00:56.460> more<00:00:56.670> inexpensive<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.570> can

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
lot less a lot more inexpensive you can

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.029 
lot less a lot more inexpensive you can
say<00:00:57.870> compared<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> some<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.710> higher-end

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
say compared to some of the higher-end

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.560 
say compared to some of the higher-end
counterparts<00:00:59.850> we've<00:01:00.600> also<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.920> 50<00:01:02.670> 45

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
counterparts we've also got the 50 45

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.140 
counterparts we've also got the 50 45
carbon<00:01:04.320> fiber<00:01:04.650> air<00:01:04.949> tank<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:06.030> we'll

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
carbon fiber air tank and then we'll

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.620 
carbon fiber air tank and then we'll
also<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.960> 68<00:01:07.610> 45<00:01:08.610> carbon<00:01:09.150> fiber<00:01:09.360> air

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
also have the 68 45 carbon fiber air

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.740 
also have the 68 45 carbon fiber air
tank<00:01:09.930> now<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.560> air<00:01:10.890> tanks<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:11.700> sorry<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
tank now the air tanks here sorry the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
tank now the air tanks here sorry the
carbon<00:01:13.080> fibre<00:01:13.320> inter<00:01:13.650> tanks<00:01:14.060> just<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.240> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
carbon fibre inter tanks just what I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.730 
carbon fibre inter tanks just what I
said<00:01:15.360> they're<00:01:15.720> made<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.110> carbon<00:01:16.350> fiber

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
said they're made of a carbon fiber

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
said they're made of a carbon fiber
material<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:18.090> gonna<00:01:18.210> make<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.540> guys

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
material so that's gonna make these guys

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.420 
material so that's gonna make these guys
a<00:01:18.750> lot<00:01:19.140> lighter<00:01:19.500> well<00:01:19.770> at<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> same<00:01:20.130> time

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
a lot lighter well at the same time

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.030 
a lot lighter well at the same time
amazing<00:01:20.880> very<00:01:21.119> strong<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.470> these<00:01:22.740> numbers

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
amazing very strong so these numbers

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.219 
amazing very strong so these numbers
here<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.729> kind<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.000> confusing<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.810> this

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
here can be kind of confusing and this

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.690 
here can be kind of confusing and this
is<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> good<00:01:25.619> chance<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.009> kind<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.250> talk<00:01:26.310> about

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
is a good chance to kind of talk about

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.980 
is a good chance to kind of talk about
the<00:01:26.759> different<00:01:27.090> numbers<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.450> you've<00:01:27.689> heard<00:01:27.780> me

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the different numbers so you've heard me

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.850 
the different numbers so you've heard me
say<00:01:28.170> 48<00:01:28.650> 3,000<00:01:29.369> you've<00:01:29.729> heard<00:01:29.970> me<00:01:30.119> say<00:01:30.329> 68<00:01:31.170> 45

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
say 48 3,000 you've heard me say 68 45

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
say 48 3,000 you've heard me say 68 45
so<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> first<00:01:33.180> number<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.990> each<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.409> those

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
so the first number in each of those

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.109 
so the first number in each of those
little<00:01:34.650> sequences<00:01:35.189> there<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.060> case

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
little sequences there and in this case

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.710 
little sequences there and in this case
the<00:01:36.509> 48<00:01:36.990> 3000<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.369> 48<00:01:38.759> stands<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> cubic

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the 48 3000 the 48 stands for the cubic

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.810 
the 48 3000 the 48 stands for the cubic
inches<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.560> tank<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.130> that's<00:01:41.280> how<00:01:41.430> big<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
inches of the tank so that's how big the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.210 
inches of the tank so that's how big the
actual<00:01:42.150> tank<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.930> how<00:01:43.530> much<00:01:43.710> air<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:43.950> hold

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
actual tank is how much air can hold

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.780 
actual tank is how much air can hold
within<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.780> tanks<00:01:46.590> case<00:01:46.799> here<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.189> 68

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790

within it in this tanks case here is 68
cubic<00:01:48.240> inches<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.869> 48<00:01:49.259> vs.<00:01:49.619> 60<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.460> guy's<00:01:50.700> got

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
cubic inches so 48 vs. 60 this guy's got

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.060 
cubic inches so 48 vs. 60 this guy's got
an<00:01:51.000> extra<00:01:51.210> 20<00:01:51.479> cubic<00:01:51.780> inches<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.799> being

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
3000i also it makes the carbon fiber

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.170 
3000i also it makes the carbon fiber
tank<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.770> exceptional<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.549> there<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.030> be<00:02:03.060> a

now<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.630> second<00:02:07.110> number<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.710> in

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
now the second number that we have in

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:08.859 
now the second number that we have in
this<00:02:07.890> series<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
this series is the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.140 
this series is the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
pressure of the tank can hold so for the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.410 
pressure of the tank can hold so for the
48<00:02:11.540> 3000<00:02:12.319> this<00:02:12.560> guy<00:02:12.739> holds<00:02:13.129> 3,000<00:02:14.030> pounds<00:02:14.360> per

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
pressure that just means like I just

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.710 
pressure that just means like I just
said<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.370> can<00:02:22.489> hold<00:02:22.730> more<00:02:22.970> pressure<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.599> can

said it can hold more pressure it can

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.259 
said it can hold more pressure it can
hold<00:02:24.049> more<00:02:24.379> air<00:02:24.739> for<00:02:25.640> those<00:02:25.760> guys<00:02:26.000> out<00:02:26.209> there

disassembled<00:03:19.819> so<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.900> top<00:03:21.200> bonnet

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
disassembled so you have the top bonnet

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.069 
disassembled so you have the top bonnet
piece<00:03:22.130> here<00:03:22.430> that's<00:03:23.120> gonna<00:03:23.239> have<00:03:23.480> all<00:03:23.780> of

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
piece here that's gonna have all of

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.180 
piece here that's gonna have all of
these<00:03:24.200> threads<00:03:24.560> aren't<00:03:24.799> that's<00:03:25.010> what's

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
these threads aren't that's what's

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.470 
these threads aren't that's what's
actually<00:03:25.280> gonna<00:03:25.459> thread<00:03:25.730> into<00:03:25.849> the<00:03:25.970> tank<00:03:26.269> so

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
actually gonna thread into the tank so

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.089 
actually gonna thread into the tank so
yeah<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.959> bonnet<00:03:27.349> you<00:03:27.379> actually<00:03:27.829> have<00:03:27.950> the

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
yeah the bonnet you actually have the

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.729 
yeah the bonnet you actually have the
film<00:03:28.519> ipil<00:03:28.849> here<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.299> side<00:03:29.540> I've<00:03:30.230> got<00:03:30.560> each

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
film ipil here on the side I've got each

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.559 
film ipil here on the side I've got each
one<00:03:30.950> of<00:03:31.040> your<00:03:31.160> burst<00:03:31.459> discs<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.299> gauge

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
one of your burst discs and the gauge

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:33.789 
one of your burst discs and the gauge
the<00:03:32.840> gauge<00:03:33.019> is<00:03:33.169> going<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:33.410> tell<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.620> how<00:03:33.709> much

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
the gauge is going to tell you how much

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.930 
the gauge is going to tell you how much
pressure<00:03:34.099> is<00:03:34.310> in<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.519> system

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
pressure is in the system

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.849 
pressure is in the system
now<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.540> burst<00:03:35.900> discs<00:03:36.260> these<00:03:36.440> are<00:03:36.590> unique

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
now the burst discs these are unique

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.289 
now the burst discs these are unique
could<00:03:37.099> get<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.250> few<00:03:37.489> questions<00:03:37.609> about<00:03:38.120> these

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
could get a few questions about these

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.379 
could get a few questions about these
guys<00:03:38.629> if<00:03:39.109> you<00:03:39.739> end<00:03:39.949> up<00:03:40.160> fresher<00:03:40.819> izing<00:03:41.269> your

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
guys if you end up fresher izing your

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.629 
guys if you end up fresher izing your
tank<00:03:41.720> too<00:03:42.139> much<00:03:42.470> getting<00:03:42.829> too<00:03:43.099> much<00:03:43.310> pressure

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
tank too much getting too much pressure

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.430 
tank too much getting too much pressure
on<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.970> rather<00:03:44.449> than<00:03:44.629> doing<00:03:44.780> any<00:03:45.019> damage<00:03:45.230> to

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
on it rather than doing any damage to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.530 
on it rather than doing any damage to
the<00:03:45.560> regulator<00:03:45.980> or<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.280> tank<00:03:46.519> itself<00:03:46.940> you

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
the regulator or the tank itself you

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.210 
the regulator or the tank itself you
have<00:03:47.690> these<00:03:47.870> burst<00:03:48.230> discs<00:03:48.739> they<00:03:49.069> will

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
have these burst discs they will

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.159 
have these burst discs they will
actually<00:03:49.400> pop<00:03:49.879> and<00:03:50.180> allow<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.540> air<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:50.900> escape

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
actually pop and allow the air to escape

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.710 
actually pop and allow the air to escape
out<00:03:51.799> of<00:03:51.949> the<00:03:52.010> system<00:03:52.370> safely<00:03:52.790> rather<00:03:53.480> than

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
out of the system safely rather than

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.960 
out of the system safely rather than
over<00:03:53.989> pressurizing<00:03:54.680> your<00:03:54.799> tank<00:03:55.069> so<00:03:55.370> these

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
over pressurizing your tank so these

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.000 
over pressurizing your tank so these
regulators<00:03:56.480> not<00:03:56.840> only<00:03:57.079> control<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.680> amount

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
regulators not only control the amount

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.530 
regulators not only control the amount
of<00:03:58.160> air<00:03:58.310> coming<00:03:58.579> out<00:03:58.730> of<00:03:58.790> your<00:03:58.879> tank<00:03:59.120> making

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
of air coming out of your tank making

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.900 
of air coming out of your tank making
your<00:03:59.629> tank<00:03:59.900> very<00:04:00.319> very<00:04:00.739> sorry<00:04:01.430> your<00:04:01.609> marker

your tank very very sorry your marker

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.789 
your tank very very sorry your marker
system<00:04:02.090> very<00:04:02.359> accurate<00:04:02.870> but<00:04:03.379> they<00:04:03.470> help<00:04:03.620> keep

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
system very accurate but they help keep

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.830 
system very accurate but they help keep
you<00:04:03.949> safe<00:04:03.980> -<00:04:04.489> and<00:04:04.730> allow<00:04:04.910> you<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.120> easily<00:04:05.359> fail

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
you safe - and allow you to easily fail

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.330 
you safe - and allow you to easily fail
to<00:04:06.139> see<00:04:06.290> how<00:04:06.319> much<00:04:06.560> air<00:04:06.739> you<00:04:06.769> have<00:04:07.010> in<00:04:07.190> your

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
to see how much air you have in your

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.699 
to see how much air you have in your
system<00:04:07.579> so<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.480> know<00:04:08.599> what<00:04:08.810> air<00:04:09.109> tanks<00:04:09.590> that

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
system so you know what air tanks that

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.069 
system so you know what air tanks that
hold<00:04:09.859> a<00:04:10.099> lot<00:04:10.459> more<00:04:10.489> air<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:11.090> course<00:04:11.389> more<00:04:11.780> shots

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
hold a lot more air of course more shots

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.379 
hold a lot more air of course more shots
for<00:04:12.379> you<00:04:12.500> they're<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.280> lot<00:04:13.459> safer<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.209> lot

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
for you they're a lot safer and a lot

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.629 
for you they're a lot safer and a lot
more<00:04:14.569> accurate<00:04:15.079> as<00:04:15.199> well<00:04:15.319> -<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.280> we<00:04:16.370> really

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
more accurate as well - so we really

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.430 
more accurate as well - so we really
really<00:04:16.820> love<00:04:16.969> the<00:04:17.150> air<00:04:17.269> tanks<00:04:17.690> here<00:04:17.900> you<00:04:18.260> got<00:04:18.409> a

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
really love the air tanks here you got a

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.080 
really love the air tanks here you got a
