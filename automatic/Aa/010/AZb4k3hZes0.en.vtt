00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
pretty sure it's when he makes too much

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.229 
pretty sure it's when he makes too much
noise<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.770> something<00:00:40.860> i'm<00:00:41.129> not<00:00:41.250> sure<00:00:41.399> usually

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
noise or something i'm not sure usually

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
does any more any time even if you set

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.160
