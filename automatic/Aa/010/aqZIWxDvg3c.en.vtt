00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
out but let's see let's go to a visually

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:41.580 
out but let's see let's go to a visually
appealing<00:05:37.060> map

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.370 

basically<00:05:42.490> what<00:05:42.640> this<00:05:42.760> is<00:05:42.940> is<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.960> dual<00:05:44.170> mag

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
basically what this is is the dual mag

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.520 
basically what this is is the dual mag
animation<00:05:45.360> your<00:05:46.360> guy<00:05:46.510> reloads<00:05:46.960> faster<00:05:47.410> with

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
animation your guy reloads faster with

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.200 
animation your guy reloads faster with
the<00:05:47.620> dual<00:05:47.770> mags<00:05:48.010> you<00:05:48.250> can<00:05:48.430> get<00:05:48.580> it<00:05:48.700> basically

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
the dual mags you can get it basically

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.420 
the dual mags you can get it basically
you<00:05:49.570> can<00:05:49.720> get<00:05:49.840> it<00:05:49.960> every<00:05:50.230> reload<00:05:50.620> after<00:05:51.250> a

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
you can get it every reload after a

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.140 
you can get it every reload after a
little<00:05:51.670> bit<00:05:51.760> of<00:05:51.790> practicing<00:05:53.940> right<00:05:54.940> now<00:05:54.970> the

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
little bit of practicing right now the

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 
have slight a hand on you can get a dual

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.430 
have slight a hand on you can get a dual
mag<00:07:34.670> reload<00:07:35.060> every<00:07:35.450> time<00:07:35.690> which<00:07:35.930> is<00:07:35.960> basically

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 
mag reload every time which is basically

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.490 
mag reload every time which is basically
having<00:07:36.740> slight<00:07:37.100> a<00:07:37.130> hand<00:07:37.340> on<00:07:38.140> see<00:07:39.140> if<00:07:39.170> I<00:07:39.320> have<00:07:39.470> a

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:39.500 
having slight a hand on see if I have a

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:45.550 
having slight a hand on see if I have a
dual<00:07:39.800> mag<00:07:40.010> on<00:07:42.760> no<00:07:43.760> i<00:07:43.790> don't<00:07:44.150> but<00:07:44.390> if<00:07:45.260> you<00:07:45.470> have

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 
dual mag on no i don't but if you have

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.080 
dual mag on no i don't but if you have
it<00:07:45.680> on<00:07:45.740> a<00:07:45.800> non<00:07:46.040> sleight-of-hand<00:07:46.670> class<00:07:46.910> i

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.090 
it on a non sleight-of-hand class i

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.880 
it on a non sleight-of-hand class i
think<00:07:47.300> that<00:07:47.450> goes<00:07:47.750> best<00:07:48.050> because<00:07:48.500> you<00:07:48.650> can<00:07:48.770> get

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:48.890 
think that goes best because you can get

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.770 
think that goes best because you can get
like<00:07:49.010> a<00:07:49.070> sleight-of-hand<00:07:49.430> reload<00:07:50.060> in<00:07:50.540> without

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:50.780 
like a sleight-of-hand reload in without

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.470 
like a sleight-of-hand reload in without
slide<00:07:51.080> a<00:07:51.110> hand<00:07:51.550> every<00:07:52.550> time<00:07:52.580> so<00:07:53.090> like<00:07:53.330> i<00:07:53.450> said

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:53.480 
slide a hand every time so like i said

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.820 
slide a hand every time so like i said
it<00:07:53.720> takes<00:07:53.870> a<00:07:53.960> little<00:07:54.080> bit<00:07:54.260> of<00:07:54.320> getting<00:07:54.470> used<00:07:54.620> to

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:54.830 
it takes a little bit of getting used to

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.850 
it takes a little bit of getting used to
but<00:07:54.920> you'll<00:07:55.250> get<00:07:55.370> used<00:07:55.430> to<00:07:55.670> it<00:07:55.990> I<00:07:56.990> think<00:07:57.800> I

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:57.860 
but you'll get used to it I think I

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.540 
but you'll get used to it I think I
might<00:07:58.040> yeah<00:07:58.640> there<00:07:58.850> we<00:07:58.940> go<00:07:58.970> so<00:07:59.950> just<00:08:00.950> a<00:08:01.520> little
