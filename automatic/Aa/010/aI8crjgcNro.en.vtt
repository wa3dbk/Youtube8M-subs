00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
brings blood to the skin so putting this

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.149 
brings blood to the skin so putting this
in<00:02:04.689> a<00:02:04.780> scrub<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.439> know<00:02:05.530> would<00:02:05.710> be<00:02:05.829> really

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159
