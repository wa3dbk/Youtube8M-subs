00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:17.190
 video and I'll try to teach you so good. 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:20.100
 admit that logically low which is the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.039
 video invente in the site of the idea and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.840
 get the big mac version it takes 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:32.130
 in the case of 62 and as I already downloaded here 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.840
 to participate, just open it to nbc 6 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.640
 2 2 6 2 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.660
 knows the verse to pick of 3 19 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.820
 the nbb purple any paste in the base paste 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.600
 ska where you have here an address where 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.899
 stay 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.149
 if it is a matter of not being extinguished 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.460
 just look for step that has this tsv 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.390
 Ex point that if you need the place 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.309
 right 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:07.970
 copy and paste it here 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.970
 now the fight is real viseu in the nexus - and 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.330
 wait to load the pc cart 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.400
 here is to choose the more you 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.430
 may have 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.850
 if you have a charm and lights and xx 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:33.789
 If you go in this I have are in this and that 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:38.869
 It's for those who use the reality TV in April. 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:41.990
 then the options that the 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.110
 deficit is the field we feel 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.689
 I'll actually try to explain, I 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.100
 I prefer the dynamic if it is effect 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.250
 sectional 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.390
 I will not put on me because I just weight 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.299
 of a business 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.310
 the only choice you are each one chooses 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:03.560
 whatever you want does not have any is needed 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.080
 catch any 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.450
 here is an important part and then 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.420
 to be here by the average xbox 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.290
 we have to be annually also 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.890
 So we'll be here in a little while. 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.850
 folder 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:24.980
 the video in the lounge now put the 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.940
 amount of memory that supposedly 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.660
 have in the case of meningitis x 160 2gb are 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:37.930
 to place 2048 houses or 1 gigabytes 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.930
 1,024 here have values â€‹â€‹know how to put 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.690
 and gone last in a document but 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.180
 denis way to stand 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.540
 that point at which seek and make 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.790
 these flashpoint changes understand 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.799
 target one of these here that I will leave one 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.970
 time on the screen and I'll put in the caption 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:05.720
 video is a must just look here and 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:14.340
 edit is easy to play against where is 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:19.470
 It's well the house and everything is right here in the game. 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:23.180
 is to show how you've been playing two more 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.180
 days and the game in the cart fails 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:39.220
 Tim did not even know how to sing. 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:43.120
 initial by all want it is to be a 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.750
 business close and I really hope that 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.170
 This is recording because if not more 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.170
 fight 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.080
 will you be sure you are correctly? 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.980
 It just came up when I opened the game going 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.790
 know these things and be serious 20.26 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.200
 lions and the shift is to show the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.000
 nbb 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.000
 a bb 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.209
 wait another two years 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:56.759
 i dont in salvador is the wine 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.410
 I 'm inside the dreamhack it arrives in blue 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.880
 There it is but I'm going out to show it. 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.729
 how did it go 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.460
 I 'm with gigantic farley. 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.669
 I 'm not going out, I'm leaving here with you. 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:18.949
 as it was outside 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.949
 I'll try to leave, it's not to slow down. 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.069
 Hmm 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.090
 elton loses one less point 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.880
 and for this size nb to work is 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.020
 necessary to use the crime was not 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.750
 bigger 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.750
 so in case you do not have to download 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:04.740
 out already in the two years to win and 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:10.560
 I'll show you how to get nb100 to 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:16.669
 difference is there to the exterior how 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.669
 I am disgusted and I think that plays a minimum 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.940
 leaves half that does not stay much 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:26.730
 the week was very clear that 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:36.950
 stay with helsing 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:43.080
 you can see the docs.com ecm stays like this 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:47.010
 logically I saw I stayed like this 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:52.970
 I hope it can help anyone with 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:52.970
 doubts weaknesses just ask worth it
