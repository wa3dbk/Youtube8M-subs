think it'll be that good after librarian

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.330 
think it'll be that good after librarian
comes<00:06:38.480> out<00:06:38.660> because<00:06:38.990> it's<00:06:39.620> a<00:06:39.740> control<00:06:40.100> deck

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.130 
and you just get pluses and eventually
you<00:06:42.800> just<00:06:42.830> run<00:06:43.160> out<00:06:43.340> of<00:06:43.370> cards<00:06:43.840> and<00:06:44.840> once
