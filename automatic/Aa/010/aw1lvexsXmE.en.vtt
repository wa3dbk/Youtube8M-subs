dollars a bought all that kind of stuff
right<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.850> reason<00:01:12.030> why<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> find<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.660 
right so the reason why I find this
fascinating<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.100> because<00:01:14.280> there's<00:01:14.430> like

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
fascinating is it because there's like

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
fascinating is it because there's like
there's<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.240> lower<00:01:15.600> echelon<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.350> people

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
