 Hello everyone 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.579
 This is the second at bat 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.309
 This movie has just been released in the spring of 2010 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:29.009
 We will explain to you about gps navigation system gp33 from 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.010
 gp33 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.000
 It is from the past 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.420
 Released as a successor to the monochrome gps navigation system gp32. 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.580
 As you can see the high brightness high resolution 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.750
 In order to adopt vga liquid crystal of the order from 4.31 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.200
 We will offer you a big race if it's very easy to see 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.560
 can do 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.270
 For graphic images 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.150
 Of course this simple plot 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.760
 Settlers to benched Alling destinations 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.380
 And 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.080
 GPS reception status and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.670
 I'm sorry that the coc blank 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.180
 Various 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.230
 We can provide you with graphic expressions 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.980
 With regard to operability, follow the operation of no good and 3d 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.900
 Every time as a totally new type of gps navigation system 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.660
 The main role of the gps navigation system is 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.460
 Receive public information from the ps3 temple that is here 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.840
 And such as pc plotter and fish finder area 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.590
 To send public information to that navigation instrument 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 And this gp33 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.620
 canvas 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.040
 Equipped with both new and old interfaces such as nna0183 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.540
 Because 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.610
 If you are using the latest magnet, of course 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.990
 For those who use traditional gourds and radar 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.990
 It is an opportunity to use 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.409
 Beijing University 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.419
 Destination submission

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.579
 And remember the maximum route 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.219
 Yakult 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.619
 Outperforms gp32 in the furnace 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.619
 I am sending raw yesterday and 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.489
