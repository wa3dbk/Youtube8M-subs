00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.539
 only the sixth and I do not bring them a 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.300
 new skin preview and this time 

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:11.060
 with looks the stellar guardian or two and 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.910
 lord taylor very looks person is a skin 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.230
 of 1350 rp so you can wait for about 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.160
 quite considerable changes 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.259
 and they are watching inactivity so good 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.940
 let's see here is the champion and how 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.100
 is 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.270
 it looks like it's cosplay from on to 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.250
 sailor moon or something like that 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.870
 with the cane and the little girl is going to 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.430
 see what I mean the 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.330
 interactions 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.330
 a joke 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.020
 down 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.760
 the dance 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.220
 dances completely new 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.520
 so that the Indian 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.899
 and the laughs 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.450
 so I had an annoying laugh for 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.920
 know the skills 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.920
 has part of the different 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.990
 here is the q 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.230
 we are going to see the particular forward 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.230
 the with the w 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.650
 here are your auto attacks the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.160
 little stars how nice 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160
 the e 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.159
 and here is the passive 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.159
 here is how they stay locked 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.800
 enemies affected by the cv 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.060
 what the fuck 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.060
 we are going to see the r 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.420
 and the heretic 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.369
 is primarily a 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.369
 an artist light show again the e 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.929
 you want and let's see the rich 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.929
 prepare to say oh, how rich 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.610
 any resemblance to it is not 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.280
 mere coincidence 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.260
 so, well, it would be everything here 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.810
 again the champion is pretty 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.000
 pretty nice the sprint 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.410
 is the one of all Mr. Fox textile and others 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.100
 the next death certainly continues 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.840
 being the same 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.840
 until the next goodbye
