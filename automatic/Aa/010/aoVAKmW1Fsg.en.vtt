with the receiver all in all it took me

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.130 
with the receiver all in all it took me
a<00:00:40.940> long<00:00:41.940> time<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.390> figure<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.750> how<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> get

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
a long time to figure out how to get

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.959 
a long time to figure out how to get
this<00:00:43.350> working<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> first<00:00:44.460> time<00:00:44.700> there's<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
this working the first time there's a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.549 
this working the first time there's a
lot<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.239> interference<00:00:45.600> down<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.170> only<00:00:46.320> about

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
lot of interference down here only about

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.340 
lot of interference down here only about
half<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> 16<00:00:47.430> channels<00:00:47.960> didn't<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.140> some

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
half of the 16 channels didn't have some

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.049 
half of the 16 channels didn't have some
sort<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.559> RF<00:00:49.860> interference<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.610> had<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> use

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
sort of RF interference so I had to use

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.350 
sort of RF interference so I had to use
medium<00:00:51.480> squelch<00:00:52.760> for<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.969> particular

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
medium squelch for this particular

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.549 
medium squelch for this particular
setting<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.039> was<00:00:56.190> able<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:57.079> 97<00:00:58.079> 98

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559

did squelch a little bit there's a

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.939 
did squelch a little bit there's a
separate<00:01:03.030> look<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.899> saw<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> DJ<00:01:04.559> booth<00:01:04.739> in

the<00:01:04.979> back<00:01:05.070> here's<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.909> receiver<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:06.930> that

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the back here's a receiver it's not that

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.210 
the back here's a receiver it's not that
far<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:07.979> there<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> kitchen<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.909> between

far but there was a kitchen in between
that<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> root<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.119> why

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that I think was the root of why

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.140 
that I think was the root of why

be<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> bit<00:01:45.030> further<00:01:45.270> away<00:01:45.390> than<00:01:46.380> where<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
be a bit further away than where the

be a bit further away than where the
receiver<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> ran<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> cord<00:01:48.360> along<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
receiver is so I ran a cord along the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.280 
receiver is so I ran a cord along the
floor<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.979> back<00:01:50.189> wall<00:01:50.490> there<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.259> fed<00:01:52.259> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
floor of that back wall there and fed a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.060 
floor of that back wall there and fed a
signal<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> transmitter<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.860> point

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
signal to the transmitter and the point

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.039 
signal to the transmitter and the point
of<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.280> was<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> feed<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> couple<00:01:57.270> speakers<00:01:57.810> back

between the first two setups and this
setup<00:03:14.189> which<00:03:14.609> is<00:03:14.760> probably<00:03:15.060> why<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:15.299> setup

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
setup which is probably why this setup

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.809 
setup which is probably why this setup
we<00:03:16.079> didn't<00:03:16.319> have<00:03:16.469> any<00:03:16.680> audio<00:03:16.889> dropouts

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
it's an AKG wireless perception worked

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.129 
it's an AKG wireless perception worked

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
I did get some audio dropouts and I have

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.250 
I did get some audio dropouts and I have
my<00:03:29.310> transmitter<00:03:30.299> up<00:03:30.510> higher<00:03:30.780> than<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.079> have<00:03:31.229> the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
my transmitter up higher than I have the

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.219 
my transmitter up higher than I have the
receiver<00:03:31.680> from<00:03:31.799> my<00:03:31.949> wireless<00:03:32.370> mic<00:03:32.579> so<00:03:33.229> overall

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
receiver from my wireless mic so overall

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.679 
receiver from my wireless mic so overall
I<00:03:34.379> like<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.069> concept<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.970> system<00:03:36.479> but

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
I like the concept of the system but

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.259 
I like the concept of the system but
where<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.049> lacks<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.590> most<00:03:37.919> is<00:03:38.250> trying<00:03:39.120> to

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
where it lacks the most is trying to

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.780 
where it lacks the most is trying to
feed<00:03:39.449> a<00:03:39.479> speaker<00:03:40.139> in<00:03:40.319> an<00:03:40.500> adjacent<00:03:40.889> room<00:03:41.250> where

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
feed a speaker in an adjacent room where

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.569 
feed a speaker in an adjacent room where
you<00:03:41.909> have<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> wall<00:03:42.569> in<00:03:42.599> between<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.500> those<00:03:44.310> are

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
you have a wall in between you those are

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.849 
you have a wall in between you those are
the<00:03:44.669> most<00:03:44.819> difficult<00:03:45.079> cable<00:03:46.079> runs<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.620> those

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
the most difficult cable runs and those

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.069 
the most difficult cable runs and those
are<00:03:47.009> the<00:03:47.099> ones<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.430> would<00:03:47.489> like<00:03:47.729> to<00:03:47.879> avoid<00:03:48.239> this

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
are the ones I would like to avoid this

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.140 
are the ones I would like to avoid this
system<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:50.009> don't<00:03:50.519> have<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:50.819> complete

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
system I just don't have the complete

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.020 
system I just don't have the complete
confidence<00:03:51.629> I<00:03:51.900> need<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.439> it<00:03:52.590> yet<00:03:52.799> otherwise<00:03:53.729> if

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
confidence I need in it yet otherwise if

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.879 
confidence I need in it yet otherwise if
it's<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.359> same<00:03:54.569> room<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.079> think<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.799> will

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
it's in the same room I think it will

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.129 
it's in the same room I think it will
work<00:03:55.949> just<00:03:56.099> fine<00:03:56.430> if<00:03:56.879> you<00:03:57.569> are<00:03:57.750> going<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.019> use

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
work just fine if you are going to use

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.449 
work just fine if you are going to use
this<00:03:58.349> system<00:03:58.709> here's<00:03:58.919> a<00:03:58.979> trick<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.310> I

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
this system here's a trick that I

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.939 
this system here's a trick that I
learned<00:03:59.729> start<00:04:00.540> by<00:04:00.750> placing<00:04:01.229> the<00:04:01.470> receiver<00:04:01.769> on

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
learned start by placing the receiver on

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.069 
learned start by placing the receiver on
top<00:04:02.129> of<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> speaker<00:04:02.579> turning<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.150> on<00:04:03.239> you'll

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
top of the speaker turning it on you'll

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.409 
top of the speaker turning it on you'll
see<00:04:04.169> a<00:04:04.290> little<00:04:04.439> RF<00:04:04.889> light<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.939> could<00:04:06.150> light

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
see a little RF light that could light

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.360 
see a little RF light that could light
up<00:04:06.599> if<00:04:06.810> you're<00:04:07.319> receiving<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.859> green<00:04:08.129> light

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
up if you're receiving a green light

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.649 
up if you're receiving a green light
before<00:04:08.669> you<00:04:08.759> even<00:04:08.879> turn<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.090> your<00:04:09.239> transmitter

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
before you even turn on your transmitter

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.080 
before you even turn on your transmitter
that<00:04:09.949> channel<00:04:10.949> is<00:04:11.099> going<00:04:11.759> to<00:04:11.819> give<00:04:12.000> you

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
that channel is going to give you

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.479 
that channel is going to give you
problems<00:04:12.569> flip<00:04:13.199> around<00:04:13.319> until<00:04:13.799> you<00:04:14.159> do<00:04:14.280> not

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
problems flip around until you do not

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.969 
problems flip around until you do not
see<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:15.000> green<00:04:15.269> RF<00:04:15.659> light<00:04:15.930> anymore<00:04:16.500> that<00:04:16.829> will

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
see the green RF light anymore that will

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.189 
see the green RF light anymore that will
be<00:04:17.099> your<00:04:17.250> clean<00:04:17.549> channel<00:04:17.970> then<00:04:18.750> match<00:04:18.989> your

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
be your clean channel then match your

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:20.810 
be your clean channel then match your
transmitter<00:04:19.650> up<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:20.009> same<00:04:20.250> channel

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
transmitter up to the same channel

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.920 
transmitter up to the same channel
that'll<00:04:21.239> save<00:04:21.389> you<00:04:21.479> a<00:04:21.509> lot<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.779> back-and-forth

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
that'll save you a lot of back-and-forth

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.649 
that'll save you a lot of back-and-forth
between<00:04:22.529> the<00:04:22.770> transmitter<00:04:23.219> and<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.520> receiver

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
between the transmitter and the receiver

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.919 
between the transmitter and the receiver
trying<00:04:24.659> to<00:04:24.719> find<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:25.110> cleanest<00:04:25.560> channel
