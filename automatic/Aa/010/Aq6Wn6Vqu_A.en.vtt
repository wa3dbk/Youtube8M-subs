00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello everyone, you may be with you today 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.080
 I'll show you how my gun shoots past 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.969
 releases I showed how to collect here 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.270
 such a wonderful one is very powerful 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.810
 lego gun like he shoots 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.970
 shoots such details here I even 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.210
 these details came up with calibers here 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.149
 for example, this is 4 caliber in detail 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:36.690
 compare with here this anna covina goes to 4 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:41.460
 for 2 to 3 caliber gauge 6 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:46.070
 calibers for 8 and 10 even obzkazal here 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.110
 but I prefer to 4 on 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.670
 on means or 3 and 2 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.539
 that's how you look back and see she see 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.090
 does not go back because it prevents it from 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.010
 Now if I pull the trigger it is easy 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.519
 he will go in there because when I click 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.030
 on the trigger he sees there rises such 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:17.909
 to such a stick with a circle 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.740
 set and run this here 4 caliber 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.490
 ny bullet 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.700
 here in this tower 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.390
 Now I will show you this oh 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.390
 fell 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:39.900
 what's wrong is so easy to do here 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.350
 set and not fully start it somewhere 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.659
 so she stays at least one 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:52.040
 then take this design nothing with it 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.700
 do and aim for that one 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:01.100
 the cross fell right on the target and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.100
 shoot see it blows stolen you 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.179
 here and so I showed how this gun 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.770
 shoots 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:11.780
