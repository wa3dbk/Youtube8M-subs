away from his family and that thing has

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:44.649 
away from his family and that thing has
been<00:07:42.249> that's<00:07:43.249> the<00:07:43.370> hardest<00:07:43.699> thing<00:07:43.759> on<00:07:44.029> him<00:07:44.180> as

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:44.659 
been that's the hardest thing on him as

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:47.110 
been that's the hardest thing on him as
far<00:07:44.959> as<00:07:44.990> the<00:07:45.079> plane<00:07:46.009> and<00:07:46.339> stuff<00:07:46.519> like<00:07:46.699> that<00:07:46.909> he

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 
far as the plane and stuff like that he

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.900 
far as the plane and stuff like that he
could<00:07:47.300> do<00:07:47.539> that

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:47.910 
could do that

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.750 
could do that
a long<00:07:48.180> time<00:07:48.800> so<00:07:49.800> I<00:07:49.830> thought<00:07:50.130> I<00:07:50.310> thought<00:07:50.580> that

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:50.760 
a long time so I thought I thought that

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.060 
a long time so I thought I thought that
he<00:07:50.970> wouldn't<00:07:51.210> have<00:07:51.660> lasted<00:07:51.990> as<00:07:52.530> long<00:07:52.560> as<00:07:52.800> he

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.070 
he wouldn't have lasted as long as he

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.560 
he wouldn't have lasted as long as he
has<00:07:53.360> because<00:07:54.360> of<00:07:55.520> just<00:07:56.520> the<00:07:56.730> the<00:07:56.970> timeframe

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:57.570 
has because of just the the timeframe

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.210 
has because of just the the timeframe
away<00:07:57.870> from<00:07:58.080> his<00:07:58.230> family

00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 
away from his family

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.909 
away from his family
