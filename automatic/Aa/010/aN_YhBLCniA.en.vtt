00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.490
 it's going a little tired but it's going 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.480
 it was very hot very hot 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:18.359
 the Swiss they never disappoint me 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:21.090
 it was very hot yeah if that makes me 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.170
 something anyway because I 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.430
 know it's a bit of a myth 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.220
 you see and then how I cost a little 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.849
 jazz all that makes me happy because it 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.060
 pleases me 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.070
 there are not many french rappers 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.280
 the chance to do that you see so that's 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.390
 a good sort for my record we will say 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.680
 jazz there are some little pieces 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.210
 jazzy you see from time to time a little 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.040
 more crazy soul but after to 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.649
 a little jazzy chic pieces in the album 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.820
 is a piece called paris with 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.110
 a mere miles of davis who jumped 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.190
 because they did not want to leave the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.449
 simple but there is something I like 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.699
 take some jazz stuff too 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.320
 for a piece 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.079
 I listen to more American rap cora 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.110
 French that's for sure right now 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.340
 I listen a lot yunteng I listen 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.890
 many future i listen lille divergent 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.420
 not known voice who knows it's guys a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.189
 little chunky years after finally my music 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.960
 me it's not too trapdoor but I like 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.060
 listen well to what I find that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.439
 this is the future of raptors and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.950
 guys a little who nasty scratch in 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.570
 same time you see it's a bit of a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.600
 a bit bastard either as music it's 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.390
 no rap from before you see there is more to 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.210
 more guy mika pusse of these - c - 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.979
 how to say it's my dice bag 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.240
 flea songs actually because we have 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.680
 dream it's the trick a little bit they're 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.270
 inspired by chicago stuff with a 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.560
 guy who balances a sentence and it comes back 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.570
 it's always the same thing on 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.829
 after all that to 30 to this thing 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.399
 find the trap of atlanta it is 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.659
 the impression is a little more 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.090
 searched in quotation marks because 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.460
 each piece it's not the same thing it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.630
 there's a recipe you see but the guys they 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.820
 make an effort to find melodies 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.850
 different with each jump me what 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.219
 I have the impression it is always a 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.469
 what's going on in the united states 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.170
 in fact I do not feel like a guy 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.420
 who arrives with a trick that create and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.280
 who brings you back I do not see that much in 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.610
 France after me that's what I try 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.140
 to do 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.030
 I look at the united states that's what 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.010
 I'm listening but I was not trying to 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.780
 pump their thing and it's just to be at 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.160
 their level what in fact I think not 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.319
 that it's a bad boy story of 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.069
 gangsters I thought more than that one thing 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.310
 who are amusing us and then we will say for 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.080
 the music we make for our 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.220
 creation 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.319
 I find that it goes together after and 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.970
 at home also the fact that I have a 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.170
 temperament also ask that does not mean 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.450
 neither do you know what I mean 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.860
 it does not mean anything I could be cool 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.530
 we do not expect to be cool out on 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.510
 what does it mean but I do not think we 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:51.720
 needs that to walk but me 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.050
 in any case to create for the style 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.370
 of writing that I have to send 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.750
 punchline make word games while 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.680
 simple salacious and all that I need 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.890
 by far to be in his street ok thanks to 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.890
 you
