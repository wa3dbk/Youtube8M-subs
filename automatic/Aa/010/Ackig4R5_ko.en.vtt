now<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.740> something<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.069> has<00:00:08.309> been<00:00:08.460> done

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
now this is something that has been done

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.480 
now this is something that has been done
in<00:00:08.790> mods<00:00:09.030> before<00:00:09.570> but<00:00:10.230> now<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:10.740> can<00:00:11.190> kind<00:00:11.370> of

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
in mods before but now we can kind of

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.789 
in mods before but now we can kind of
mess<00:00:11.700> around<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.300> do<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.719> vanilla<00:00:13.170> this

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
mess around and do it in vanilla this

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.099 
mess around and do it in vanilla this
was<00:00:13.980> thought<00:00:14.160> up<00:00:14.280> by<00:00:14.309> google<00:00:14.820> crab<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.450> we

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
was thought up by google crab and we

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.590 
was thought up by google crab and we
have<00:00:16.289> these<00:00:16.440> nice<00:00:16.740> creepy<00:00:17.430> suits<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.150> armor

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
have these nice creepy suits of armor

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.630 
have these nice creepy suits of armor
they've<00:00:19.320> got<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> few<00:00:19.800> quirks<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.310> them<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:20.580> i

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
they've got a few quirks to them but i

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.070 
they've got a few quirks to them but i
think<00:00:20.820> they<00:00:20.910> look<00:00:21.119> pretty<00:00:21.270> cool<00:00:21.510> they're<00:00:21.810> kind

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
think they look pretty cool they're kind

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.830 
think they look pretty cool they're kind
of<00:00:22.230> haunted<00:00:22.800> as<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.400> see<00:00:23.640> they<00:00:24.180> follow<00:00:24.510> my

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
of haunted as you can see they follow my

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.560 
of haunted as you can see they follow my
movements<00:00:25.500> pretty<00:00:25.949> carefully<00:00:26.939> around<00:00:27.210> here

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
movements pretty carefully around here

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.120 
movements pretty carefully around here
and<00:00:27.750> they<00:00:28.109> do<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.349> some<00:00:28.529> quirks<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.070> you

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and they do have some quirks like if you

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.700 
and they do have some quirks like if you
get<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> little<00:00:29.490> too<00:00:29.609> close<00:00:29.880> they<00:00:30.630> bite<00:00:30.929> nice

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
get a little too close they bite nice

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.170 
get a little too close they bite nice
smack<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.219> they<00:00:32.730> got<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> little

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
smack you they got to be a little

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.850 
smack you they got to be a little
careful<00:00:33.390> with<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.350> yeah<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
careful with them but yeah this is a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.430 
careful with them but yeah this is a
simple<00:00:35.520> command<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.719> will<00:00:36.840> make<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.380> you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
simple command that will make it so you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.350 
simple command that will make it so you
spawn<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> skeleton<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> cannot<00:00:38.850> move<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
spawn a skeleton that cannot move and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.450 
spawn a skeleton that cannot move and
it's<00:00:39.899> invisible<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.680> it's<00:00:40.800> wearing<00:00:41.100> armor

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
it's invisible and it's wearing armor

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010 
it's invisible and it's wearing armor
now<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> reason<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> skeleton<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.719> because

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
now the reason for a skeleton is because

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.080 
now the reason for a skeleton is because
if<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> did<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.530> zombie<00:00:43.950> its<00:00:44.129> its<00:00:44.399> arms<00:00:44.940> would

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
if you did it zombie its its arms would

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.910 
if you did it zombie its its arms would
stick<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.289> would<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.530> lot<00:00:46.710> louder

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
stick out and it would be a lot louder

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
stick out and it would be a lot louder
and<00:00:47.280> kind<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.550> moan<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.820> stuff<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.989> will

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and kind of moan and stuff and it will

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.900 
and kind of moan and stuff and it will
have<00:00:49.289> invisibility<00:00:49.800> particles<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.789> have

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
have invisibility particles if you have

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
have invisibility particles if you have
your<00:00:51.000> particle<00:00:51.420> set<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.039> you

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
your particle set on to all but if you

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.340 
your particle set on to all but if you
have<00:00:53.250> them<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.489> minimal<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.750> can't<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.230> it

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
have them on minimal you can't see it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.840 
have them on minimal you can't see it
and<00:00:55.500> even<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.129> particles<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.579> it's

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and even if you have particles on it's

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.310 
and even if you have particles on it's
not<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.120> noticeable<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.079> looks<00:00:58.230> like

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
not that noticeable it just looks like

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.200 
not that noticeable it just looks like
it's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.559> stinky<00:00:58.920> old<00:00:59.039> suit<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.340> armor<00:00:59.609> so<00:01:00.090> these

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it's a stinky old suit of armor so these

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.520 
it's a stinky old suit of armor so these
are<00:01:00.270> pretty<00:01:00.539> cool<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.960> know<00:01:01.020> there's<00:01:01.289> further

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
are pretty cool I know there's further

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.740 
are pretty cool I know there's further
ways<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.949> augment<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.210> could<00:01:03.449> make<00:01:03.719> it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
ways to augment this that could make it

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
ways to augment this that could make it
so<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> they're<00:01:04.379> not<00:01:04.500> moving<00:01:04.680> at<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.189> but

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
so that they're not moving at all but

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.070 
so that they're not moving at all but
that<00:01:05.580> would<00:01:05.760> involve<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.119> bit<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
that would involve a bit more of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.929 
that would involve a bit more of
commands<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.740> stuff<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.430> also

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
commands and stuff like that and also

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.000 
commands and stuff like that and also
maybe<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:10.020> ya<00:01:10.350> turning<00:01:10.890> yet

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
maybe so they don't ya turning yet

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.590 
maybe so they don't ya turning yet
that's<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> big<00:01:11.640> thing<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.880> makes<00:01:12.240> them<00:01:12.420> not

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
that's the big thing that makes them not

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.190 
that's the big thing that makes them not
look<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:13.830> they<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.130> our<00:01:14.939> normal<00:01:15.630> suits<00:01:15.900> but

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
look as if they are our normal suits but

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.020 
look as if they are our normal suits but
I<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.040> haunted<00:01:17.460> suit<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.729> armor

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
I do like the like haunted suit of armor

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.249 
I do like the like haunted suit of armor
thing<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.600> would<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.780> great<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.020> an

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
thing this would be great for an

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.929 
thing this would be great for an
adventure<00:01:19.619> map<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> haunted<00:01:20.400> house<00:01:20.580> bill

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
adventure map or a haunted house bill

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.730 
adventure map or a haunted house bill
because<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.049> have<00:01:22.200> these<00:01:22.320> things<00:01:22.619> that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
because you can have these things that

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.080 
because you can have these things that
if<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.130> player<00:01:23.340> gets<00:01:23.460> too<00:01:23.640> close<00:01:23.790> they

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
if the player gets too close they

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.969 
if the player gets too close they
actually<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.479> hit<00:01:24.540> by<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.259> their

actually get hit by them and their
little<00:01:26.189> creepy<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.700> same<00:01:26.790> time<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
little creepy at the same time the
