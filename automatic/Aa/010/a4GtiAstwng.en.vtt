considering<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.780> basically

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
considering that like that's basically

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
considering that like that's basically
the<00:01:22.770> exact<00:01:23.100> same<00:01:23.340> time<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.509> last<00:01:24.840> deal

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the exact same time that the last deal

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960 
the exact same time that the last deal
see<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.409> not<00:01:25.590> mistaken<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.220> meant<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> come<00:01:26.850> out

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
see if not mistaken is meant to come out

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.630 
see if not mistaken is meant to come out
so<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.330> believe<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.930> tremor<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.979> that's<00:01:29.310> kind

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
so I believe it's tremor so that's kind

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.830 
so I believe it's tremor so that's kind
of<00:01:29.759> what's<00:01:30.060> been<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> air

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
of what's been going on in the air
