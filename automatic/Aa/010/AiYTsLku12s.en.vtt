00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
to just take a fluffer brush or a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.640 
to just take a fluffer brush or a
shading<00:02:40.250> brush<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.700> we're<00:02:41.060> just<00:02:41.180> going<00:02:41.390> to

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
important thing in a smoky eye is

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.780 
important thing in a smoky eye is
blending<00:05:04.440> as<00:05:04.590> much<00:05:04.770> as<00:05:04.919> possible<00:05:05.070> i<00:05:05.490> know<00:05:05.550> it

blending as much as possible i know it

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.670 
blending as much as possible i know it
seemed<00:05:06.060> excessive<00:05:06.570> but<00:05:06.930> it's<00:05:07.080> very<00:05:07.169> important

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
seemed excessive but it's very important

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.730 
seemed excessive but it's very important
to<00:05:07.710> blend<00:05:08.040> because<00:05:08.520> when<00:05:09.270> we<00:05:09.510> when<00:05:10.470> we<00:05:10.500> get

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
to blend because when we when we get

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.010 
to blend because when we when we get
past<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:11.160> on<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:12.000> crease<00:05:12.240> you<00:05:12.479> actually<00:05:12.840> want

past the on the crease you actually want

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.930 
past the on the crease you actually want
the<00:05:13.110> colors<00:05:13.410> to<00:05:13.560> fade<00:05:13.800> out<00:05:14.070> and<00:05:14.520> I<00:05:14.729> don't<00:05:14.880> know

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
the colors to fade out and I don't know

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.940 
the colors to fade out and I don't know
if<00:05:15.060> you<00:05:15.180> caught<00:05:15.479> on<00:05:15.510> but<00:05:15.900> um<00:05:16.050> that's<00:05:16.470> why<00:05:16.740> i<00:05:16.770> use

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
if you caught on but um that's why i use

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.550 
if you caught on but um that's why i use
the<00:05:17.190> brown<00:05:17.490> so<00:05:18.270> it<00:05:18.360> kind<00:05:18.570> of<00:05:18.690> blends<00:05:18.990> the<00:05:19.320> black

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
the brown so it kind of blends the black

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.010 
the brown so it kind of blends the black
um<00:05:19.860> into<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.790> skin<00:05:21.180> so<00:05:21.479> it<00:05:21.510> doesn't<00:05:21.900> look<00:05:21.960> like

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
um into the skin so it doesn't look like

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.810 
um into the skin so it doesn't look like
just<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.410> hard<00:05:22.740> line<00:05:22.950> where<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.250> black<00:05:23.520> stops

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
just a hard line where the black stops

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.390 
just a hard line where the black stops
and<00:05:24.180> then<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:24.990> followed<00:05:25.229> through<00:05:25.680> with<00:05:25.710> arena

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400
