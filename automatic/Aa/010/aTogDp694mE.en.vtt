for you also for someone who used scroll
J's<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> couple<00:01:03.660> projects<00:01:04.080> before<00:01:04.500> what

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
J's on a couple projects before what

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.469 
J's on a couple projects before what
couldn't<00:01:05.100> actually<00:01:05.250> get<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.939> data

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
couldn't actually get the data

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.380 
couldn't actually get the data
attributes<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.380> behave<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.950> way<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:09.150> want

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
attributes to behave the way they want

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.170

it<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.650> cause<00:01:10.890> clears<00:01:11.400> everything<00:01:11.880> up

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it so this cause clears everything up

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.870 
it so this cause clears everything up
and<00:01:12.450> you'll<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.930> all<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.380> need<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.740> know<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
got the first one overview then we go

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.670 
got the first one overview then we go
through<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.640> scroll<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> basics<00:01:54.840> how<00:01:55.619> to

attribute work how to apply the first
data<00:02:00.630> attributes<00:02:01.170> then<00:02:01.920> we'll<00:02:02.100> simply

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
data attributes then we'll simply

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.450 
data attributes then we'll simply
animate<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> background<00:02:03.540> images<00:02:04.409> then<00:02:05.280> we'll

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
animate the background images then we'll

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.880 
animate the background images then we'll
look<00:02:05.729> at<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.909> absolute<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.659> relative<00:02:06.890> modes

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
on your own project as well the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.200 
on your own project as well the
structure<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.360> actually<00:03:03.680> following<00:03:04.680> a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
structure is actually following a

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.790 
structure is actually following a
progression<00:03:06.210> so<00:03:06.450> we<00:03:06.720> starting<00:03:07.110> with<00:03:07.260> basics

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
progression so we starting with basics

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.600 
progression so we starting with basics
and<00:03:08.240> as<00:03:09.240> we<00:03:09.600> teach<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.560> more<00:03:11.130> more

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
and as we teach you the more more

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.850 
and as we teach you the more more
advanced<00:03:11.970> stuff<00:03:12.270> we<00:03:12.560> progressing<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
advanced stuff we progressing to the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.610 
advanced stuff we progressing to the
next<00:03:13.980> unit<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.690> at<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.960> start<00:03:16.170> you'll<00:03:16.440> have

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
next unit so at the start you'll have

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.100 
next unit so at the start you'll have
only<00:03:16.770> introduction<00:03:17.550> available<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.720> rest<00:03:18.780> of

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
only introduction available the rest of

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.460 
only introduction available the rest of
them<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.470> will<00:03:20.220> be<00:03:20.370> grayed<00:03:20.670> out<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.470> it's

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
them is will be grayed out and it's

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.530 
them is will be grayed out and it's
basically<00:03:22.920> just<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.400> give<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.880> structure

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
basically just to give you the structure

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.470 
basically just to give you the structure
to<00:03:24.870> follow<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.950> can<00:03:26.190> unlock<00:03:26.850> all<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.270> these

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
to follow you can unlock all of these

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.800 
to follow you can unlock all of these
units<00:03:28.200> if<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.489> but<00:03:29.850> I<00:03:30.030> definitely

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
units if you like to but I definitely

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.070 
units if you like to but I definitely
encourage<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:32.280> your<00:03:32.340> own<00:03:32.810> interest<00:03:33.810> to

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
encourage you in your own interest to

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.030 
encourage you in your own interest to
follow<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.800> full<00:03:35.400> order<00:03:35.880> of<00:03:35.970> these<00:03:36.150> ones<00:03:36.420> and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
follow the full order of these ones and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.040 
follow the full order of these ones and
I<00:03:38.040> think<00:03:38.880> that's<00:03:39.060> why<00:03:39.239> that's<00:03:39.660> how<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.810> get

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
I think that's why that's how you get

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.870 
I think that's why that's how you get
the<00:03:40.200> most<00:03:40.380> out<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.920> course<00:03:41.100> here<00:03:41.670> we've

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
the most out of the course here we've

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.090 
the most out of the course here we've
got<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.270> basic<00:03:42.720> template<00:03:43.440> we'll<00:03:43.650> use<00:03:43.830> for

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
got the basic template we'll use for

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.190 
got the basic template we'll use for
most<00:03:44.340> of<00:03:44.550> our<00:03:44.670> demos<00:03:45.090> as<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.300> starting<00:03:45.750> point<00:03:45.930> so

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
most of our demos as a starting point so

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.920 
most of our demos as a starting point so
hopefully<00:03:46.770> you've<00:03:46.950> got<00:03:47.160> some<00:03:48.000> knowledge<00:03:48.600> of

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
hopefully you've got some knowledge of

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.840 
hopefully you've got some knowledge of
media<00:03:49.560> queries<00:03:49.980> how<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.310> make<00:03:50.580> things

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
media queries how to make things

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.170

and<00:03:54.600> margins<00:03:55.440> for<00:03:55.650> different<00:03:56.360> breakpoints<00:03:57.420> so

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
and margins for different breakpoints so

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.860 
and margins for different breakpoints so
we'll<00:03:58.470> use<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.890> template<00:03:59.459> as<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.870> starting

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
we'll use this template as a starting

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.190 
we'll use this template as a starting
point<00:04:01.080> for<00:04:01.320> most<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.800> demos<00:04:02.100> and

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
point for most of the demos and

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.600 
point for most of the demos and
hopefully<00:04:04.200> you'll<00:04:04.680> get<00:04:04.890> familiar<00:04:05.130> with<00:04:05.430> it

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
hopefully you'll get familiar with it

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.729 
hopefully you'll get familiar with it
very<00:04:06.060> quickly<00:04:06.330> because<00:04:07.200> then<00:04:07.380> we'll<00:04:07.530> move

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
very quickly because then we'll move

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.270 
very quickly because then we'll move
into<00:04:08.510> implementing<00:04:09.510> scroller<00:04:10.200> on<00:04:10.440> some<00:04:11.160> of

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
into implementing scroller on some of

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.900 
into implementing scroller on some of
the<00:04:11.400> parts<00:04:11.790> we<00:04:11.880> usually<00:04:12.330> take<00:04:12.540> take<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.769> look<00:04:14.670> at

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910

the parts we usually take take a look at
one<00:04:15.540> of<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:15.810> section<00:04:16.200> at<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.500> time<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:17.760> in<00:04:17.940> this

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
one of the section at a time so in this

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.900 
one of the section at a time so in this
demo<00:04:18.810> we<00:04:19.140> practicing<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.190> absolute<00:04:20.669> and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
demo we practicing the absolute and

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.240 
demo we practicing the absolute and
relative<00:04:21.030> modes<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:22.410> as<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.620> can<00:04:22.800> see<00:04:23.039> we<00:04:23.220> are

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
relative modes so as you can see we are

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.180 
relative modes so as you can see we are
animating<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:24.030> two<00:04:24.210> boxes<00:04:24.860> just<00:04:25.860> slightly

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
animating the two boxes just slightly

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.930 
animating the two boxes just slightly
after

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
after

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.620 
after
but<00:04:27.330> we<00:04:27.480> are<00:04:27.630> in<00:04:27.900> definite<00:04:28.800> control<00:04:29.400> when<00:04:30.030> they

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
but we are in definite control when they

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.410 
but we are in definite control when they
are<00:04:30.780> animating<00:04:31.380> in<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.850> you<00:04:32.850> can<00:04:33.000> play<00:04:33.210> with

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
are animating in and you can play with

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.560 
are animating in and you can play with
the<00:04:33.600> data<00:04:34.230> attributes<00:04:34.800> we<00:04:34.980> using<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:36.300> come<00:04:36.450> up

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
the data attributes we using to come up

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.160 
the data attributes we using to come up
with<00:04:36.720> your<00:04:36.870> own<00:04:37.310> animations<00:04:38.690> so<00:04:39.690> this<00:04:39.960> one

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
with your own animations so this one

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.000 
with your own animations so this one
practicing<00:04:40.770> absolute<00:04:41.280> relative<00:04:41.630> timing<00:04:43.010> this

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
practicing absolute relative timing this

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.190 
practicing absolute relative timing this
one<00:04:44.250> practicing<00:04:44.850> timing<00:04:45.270> in<00:04:45.390> general<00:04:45.750> of<00:04:45.930> the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
one practicing timing in general of the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.710 
one practicing timing in general of the
animations<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.640> as<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.880> can<00:04:48.060> see<00:04:48.330> we've<00:04:48.570> got

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
animations so as you can see we've got

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.880 
animations so as you can see we've got
the<00:04:49.250> boxing<00:04:50.250> ring<00:04:50.960> rotating<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.230> actually

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
the boxing ring rotating and actually

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.740 
the boxing ring rotating and actually
zooming<00:04:53.370> in<00:04:53.520> as<00:04:53.670> well<00:04:53.910> at<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.180> same<00:04:54.210> time

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
zooming in as well at the same time

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.950 
zooming in as well at the same time
again<00:04:55.350> we<00:04:55.920> know<00:04:56.070> exactly<00:04:56.520> when<00:04:57.450> this<00:04:57.750> is

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
again we know exactly when this is

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.360 
again we know exactly when this is
happening<00:04:58.170> so<00:04:58.500> that's<00:04:58.800> why<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.070> call<00:04:59.340> it

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
happening so that's why I call it

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.430 
happening so that's why I call it
mastering<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.420> timing<00:05:00.810> because<00:05:01.020> that's<00:05:01.320> very

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
mastering the timing because that's very

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.320 
mastering the timing because that's very
very<00:05:01.770> important<00:05:02.340> when<00:05:02.760> it<00:05:02.820> comes<00:05:03.120> to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
very important when it comes to

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.260 
very important when it comes to
scrolling<00:05:03.990> animations<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.880> in<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:06.030> last

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
scrolling animations and in the last

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.990 
scrolling animations and in the last
time<00:05:06.540> oh<00:05:06.660> I<00:05:06.690> wanted<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.050> show<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.320> is<00:05:07.820> when<00:05:08.820> we

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
time oh I wanted to show you is when we

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.290 
time oh I wanted to show you is when we
are<00:05:09.030> finally<00:05:09.720> on<00:05:09.750> the<00:05:09.900> boxing<00:05:10.650> ring<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.300> we've

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
are finally on the boxing ring and we've

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.620 
are finally on the boxing ring and we've
got<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.780> round<00:05:13.080> one<00:05:13.440> sign<00:05:14.330> pausing<00:05:15.330> for<00:05:15.360> the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
got the round one sign pausing for the

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.690 
got the round one sign pausing for the
animation<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.530> then<00:05:16.800> we'll<00:05:17.070> swap<00:05:17.490> in

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
animation and then we'll swap in

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.960 
animation and then we'll swap in
background<00:05:18.180> images<00:05:18.510> of<00:05:18.900> one<00:05:19.680> div<00:05:20.010> as<00:05:20.310> we

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
background images of one div as we

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.020 
background images of one div as we
scroll<00:05:21.270> down<00:05:21.570> and<00:05:21.920> fading<00:05:22.920> out<00:05:23.040> again<00:05:23.700> so<00:05:23.880> this

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
scroll down and fading out again so this

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.180 
scroll down and fading out again so this
demo<00:05:24.870> is<00:05:24.990> practicing<00:05:25.560> how<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.770> swap

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
demo is practicing how to swap

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.530 
demo is practicing how to swap
background<00:05:27.000> images<00:05:27.360> on<00:05:27.570> scroll<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:29.390> so<00:05:30.390> yeah

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
background images on scroll and so yeah

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.810 
background images on scroll and so yeah
these<00:05:30.720> are<00:05:30.960> three<00:05:31.590> examples<00:05:32.100> of<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.520> demos

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
these are three examples of the demos

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.970 
these are three examples of the demos
we'll<00:05:33.000> be<00:05:33.150> covering<00:05:33.360> in<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.780> class<00:05:33.960> each<00:05:34.470> unit

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
we'll be covering in the class each unit

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.700 
we'll be covering in the class each unit
has<00:05:35.010> a<00:05:35.220> video<00:05:35.460> at<00:05:35.730> the<00:05:35.760> top<00:05:36.030> and<00:05:36.270> then<00:05:37.050> short

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
has a video at the top and then short

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.280 
has a video at the top and then short
summary<00:05:38.130> plus<00:05:38.430> some<00:05:38.669> resource<00:05:39.090> links<00:05:39.540> if<00:05:40.080> it

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
summary plus some resource links if it

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.280 
summary plus some resource links if it
applies<00:05:40.560> to<00:05:40.830> that<00:05:40.950> unit<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.550> then<00:05:42.390> zip<00:05:43.050> file

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
applies to that unit and then zip file

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.930 
applies to that unit and then zip file
which<00:05:43.560> you<00:05:43.590> can<00:05:43.710> download<00:05:44.070> and<00:05:44.460> follow<00:05:44.700> the

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
which you can download and follow the

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.190 
which you can download and follow the
steps<00:05:45.210> in<00:05:45.720> a<00:05:45.930> video<00:05:46.730> step<00:05:47.730> by<00:05:47.850> step<00:05:48.210> so<00:05:48.600> this

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
steps in a video step by step so this

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.620 
steps in a video step by step so this
includes<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.860> starting<00:05:50.310> files<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:50.940> finished

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
includes the starting files and finished

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.380 
includes the starting files and finished
files<00:05:51.930> of<00:05:52.169> that<00:05:52.650> unit<00:05:53.340> as<00:05:53.490> well<00:05:53.669> so<00:05:53.970> at<00:05:54.150> the<00:05:54.300> end

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
files of that unit as well so at the end

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.450 
files of that unit as well so at the end
of<00:05:54.510> it<00:05:54.630> you<00:05:54.750> can<00:05:54.930> compare<00:05:55.350> yours

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
of it you can compare yours

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.260 
of it you can compare yours
and<00:05:56.640> the<00:05:57.330> final<00:05:57.860> files<00:05:58.860> as<00:05:59.160> well<00:05:59.430> you<00:05:59.820> can<00:05:59.970> open

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
and the final files as well you can open

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.930 
and the final files as well you can open
it<00:06:00.360> in<00:06:00.390> any<00:06:00.720> code<00:06:01.470> editor<00:06:01.830> you<00:06:01.980> like<00:06:02.220> I'm<00:06:02.550> using

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
it in any code editor you like I'm using

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.450 
it in any code editor you like I'm using
sublime<00:06:03.300> text<00:06:03.570> in<00:06:03.840> in<00:06:04.230> the<00:06:04.380> course<00:06:04.620> but<00:06:04.860> you

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
sublime text in in the course but you

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.370 
sublime text in in the course but you
can<00:06:05.490> follow<00:06:05.850> the<00:06:06.030> steps<00:06:06.300> in<00:06:06.750> any<00:06:07.050> of<00:06:07.260> your

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
can follow the steps in any of your

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.159 
can follow the steps in any of your
favorite<00:06:07.640> code<00:06:08.640> editors<00:06:09.060> and<00:06:09.240> that's<00:06:09.840> it<00:06:10.020> so

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
favorite code editors and that's it so

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.930 
favorite code editors and that's it so
hopefully<00:06:10.320> this<00:06:10.680> short<00:06:11.040> video<00:06:11.220> gave<00:06:11.790> you<00:06:11.820> a

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
hopefully this short video gave you a

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.850 
hopefully this short video gave you a
little<00:06:12.180> overview<00:06:12.510> of<00:06:12.720> what<00:06:13.140> you<00:06:13.410> can<00:06:13.440> find

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
little overview of what you can find

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.770 
little overview of what you can find
inside<00:06:14.160> of<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.700> parallax<00:06:15.120> scrolling<00:06:15.180> master

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
inside of the parallax scrolling master

inside of the parallax scrolling master
class<00:06:15.960> if<00:06:16.710> you<00:06:16.950> still<00:06:17.220> not<00:06:17.430> sure<00:06:17.669> whether<00:06:17.940> it's

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
class if you still not sure whether it's
