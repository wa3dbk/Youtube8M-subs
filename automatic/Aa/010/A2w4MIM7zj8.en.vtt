00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
bat you notice it a little different

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.780

differently you hold it vertically so
you<00:00:49.550> actually<00:00:49.700> get<00:00:49.910> sort<00:00:50.120> of<00:00:50.180> a<00:00:50.240> different

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
you actually get sort of a different

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.880 
you actually get sort of a different
perspective<00:00:50.720> on<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.170> action<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:51.680> where<00:00:51.770> this

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
perspective on the action and where this

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.620 
perspective on the action and where this
really<00:00:52.220> comes<00:00:52.460> into<00:00:52.610> play<00:00:52.700> is<00:00:53.180> in<00:00:53.330> the<00:00:53.420> game's

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
really comes into play is in the game's

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.930 
really comes into play is in the game's
multiplayer<00:00:53.840> modes<00:00:54.380> which<00:00:54.500> are<00:00:54.620> great<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.880> you

little journey here with my squid
character<00:02:40.359> there's<00:02:41.359> also<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.989> think<00:02:42.049> an<00:02:42.590> area

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
character there's also I think an area

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.550 
character there's also I think an area
very<00:02:43.219> early<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:43.819> in<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.269> game<00:02:44.450> it's<00:02:45.109> sort<00:02:45.319> of<00:02:45.379> a

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
very early on in the game it's sort of a

very early on in the game it's sort of a
shared<00:02:46.310> experience<00:02:46.489> where<00:02:46.969> I<00:02:47.030> think<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.239> lot<00:02:47.359> of

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
shared experience where I think a lot of

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:48.849

people<00:02:47.689> that<00:02:47.840> play<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.139> game<00:02:48.349> weren't<00:02:48.680> very

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
this is a different game for Nintendo

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.759 
this is a different game for Nintendo
3ds<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.840> idea<00:03:09.079> here<00:03:09.379> is<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.530> you're

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
3ds and the idea here is that you're

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.500 
3ds and the idea here is that you're
trying<00:03:09.889> to<00:03:10.069> stack<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:10.819> number<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.239> different

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
trying to stack a number of different

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.720 
trying to stack a number of different
objects<00:03:11.930> without<00:03:12.530> falling<00:03:13.159> over<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.579> want

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
objects without falling over so you want

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.979 
objects without falling over so you want
them<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:13.909> stay<00:03:14.120> upright<00:03:14.359> for<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.719> certain

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
them to stay upright for a certain

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.170 
them to stay upright for a certain
amount<00:03:15.139> of<00:03:15.260> time<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:16.340> there's<00:03:16.489> about<00:03:16.639> 200

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
amount of time and there's about 200

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.459 
amount of time and there's about 200
stages<00:03:17.659> and<00:03:17.840> just<00:03:17.989> gets<00:03:18.139> more<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.379> more

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:18.469 
stages and just gets more and more

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:20.199 
stages and just gets more and more
challenging<00:03:18.980> as<00:03:19.069> you<00:03:19.159> go<00:03:19.280> along<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.790> shape

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
challenging as you go along the shape

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.209 
challenging as you go along the shape
that<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.540> get<00:03:20.750> they<00:03:21.560> become<00:03:21.829> a<00:03:21.859> little<00:03:22.069> less

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:22.219 
that you get they become a little less

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:24.729 
that you get they become a little less
obvious<00:03:22.609> to<00:03:23.569> stack<00:03:23.810> sometimes<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.379> get<00:03:24.500> sort

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
obvious to stack sometimes you get sort

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.349 
obvious to stack sometimes you get sort
of<00:03:24.799> curved<00:03:25.069> surfaces<00:03:25.189> that<00:03:25.849> are<00:03:25.909> really<00:03:26.239> easy

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
of curved surfaces that are really easy

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.210 
of curved surfaces that are really easy
to<00:03:26.509> fall<00:03:27.049> over<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:27.379> you<00:03:27.560> got<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.739> be<00:03:27.799> careful<00:03:27.949> in

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
to fall over so you got to be careful in

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.999 
to fall over so you got to be careful in
how<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.370> stack<00:03:28.729> it<00:03:28.759> and<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.509> bases<00:03:29.930> are<00:03:30.169> get

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:31.009 
how you stack it and the bases are get

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.219 
how you stack it and the bases are get
crazy<00:03:31.340> because<00:03:31.609> there's<00:03:32.000> weird<00:03:32.540> outcroppings

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:33.229 
crazy because there's weird outcroppings

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.110 
crazy because there's weird outcroppings
and<00:03:33.530> things<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:34.250> will<00:03:34.370> break<00:03:34.549> away<00:03:34.819> if<00:03:35.000> you

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
and things that will break away if you

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.089 
and things that will break away if you
put<00:03:35.299> too<00:03:35.449> much<00:03:35.479> pressure<00:03:35.629> on<00:03:35.989> them<00:03:36.319> it's<00:03:37.069> a

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
put too much pressure on them it's a

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.770 
put too much pressure on them it's a
really<00:03:37.310> great<00:03:37.400> pick<00:03:37.639> up<00:03:37.759> and<00:03:37.909> play<00:03:38.030> game<00:03:38.299> it

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
really great pick up and play game it

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.909 
really great pick up and play game it
doesn't<00:03:38.989> take<00:03:39.109> very<00:03:39.139> long<00:03:39.319> to<00:03:39.620> get<00:03:39.709> through

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
doesn't take very long to get through

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.289 
doesn't take very long to get through
any<00:03:40.069> of<00:03:40.189> the<00:03:40.280> individual<00:03:40.759> stages<00:03:41.000> but<00:03:41.209> it

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
any of the individual stages but it

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.479 
any of the individual stages but it
feels<00:03:41.449> like<00:03:41.540> it's<00:03:41.720> got<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.870> lot<00:03:42.109> of<00:03:42.169> content<00:03:42.709> you

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
feels like it's got a lot of content you

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.469 
feels like it's got a lot of content you
can<00:03:43.579> always<00:03:43.699> try<00:03:43.909> out<00:03:44.060> different<00:03:44.090> strategies

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:44.479 
can always try out different strategies

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.539 
can always try out different strategies
-<00:03:45.049> to<00:03:45.199> get<00:03:45.290> through<00:03:45.439> all<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.620> stages<00:03:45.829> how<00:03:46.489> are

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
- to get through all the stages how are

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.909 
- to get through all the stages how are
you<00:03:46.639> controlling<00:03:46.849> the<00:03:47.540> puzzles<00:03:47.989> are<00:03:48.259> you<00:03:48.379> okay

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
you controlling the puzzles are you okay

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.559 
you controlling the puzzles are you okay

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
it gives you two ways to control it you

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.539 
it gives you two ways to control it you
can<00:03:50.750> either<00:03:50.840> use<00:03:51.139> the<00:03:51.349> stylus<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:52.009> place<00:03:52.310> your

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
can either use the stylus to place your

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.339 
can either use the stylus to place your
objects<00:03:53.030> or<00:03:53.269> you<00:03:53.419> can<00:03:53.569> just<00:03:53.720> use<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.049> circle

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
objects or you can just use the circle

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:55.929 
objects or you can just use the circle
pad<00:03:54.500> but<00:03:54.739> cool<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.400> haven't<00:03:55.669> played<00:03:55.759> that<00:03:55.819> game

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
one out door holds great so my next game

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.899 
one out door holds great so my next game
is<00:04:00.079> also<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.500> puzzle<00:04:00.859> game<00:04:00.979> is<00:04:01.129> called<00:04:01.310> pix<00:04:01.579> 3d

to solve these pixel puzzles so what the
game<00:04:07.310> gives<00:04:07.579> you<00:04:07.759> is<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.389> picture<00:04:09.019> of<00:04:09.229> what<00:04:09.439> the

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
game gives you is a picture of what the

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.499 
game gives you is a picture of what the
finished<00:04:10.340> puzzles<00:04:10.879> supposed<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.180> look<00:04:11.329> like

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509 
finished puzzles supposed to look like

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.059 
finished puzzles supposed to look like
and<00:04:11.719> then<00:04:11.870> what<00:04:12.049> you<00:04:12.169> see<00:04:12.199> is<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:12.769> like

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
and then what you see is this like

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.699 
and then what you see is this like
explosion<00:04:13.939> of<00:04:14.209> pixels<00:04:14.810> on<00:04:15.049> your<00:04:15.229> screen<00:04:15.530> and

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
explosion of pixels on your screen and

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.140 
explosion of pixels on your screen and
actually<00:04:16.039> looks<00:04:16.190> really<00:04:16.250> good<00:04:16.489> in<00:04:16.609> 3d<00:04:16.940> because

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
actually looks really good in 3d because

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.420 
actually looks really good in 3d because
they<00:04:17.329> have<00:04:17.479> a<00:04:17.509> lot<00:04:17.690> of<00:04:17.719> depth<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.109> it

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
they have a lot of depth to it

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.979 
they have a lot of depth to it
it's<00:04:19.430> over<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.639> thousand<00:04:20.090> puzzles<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.599> have<00:04:20.810> not

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
it's over a thousand puzzles I have not

it's over a thousand puzzles I have not
played<00:04:21.259> a<00:04:21.289> thousand<00:04:21.680> puzzles<00:04:21.979> but<00:04:22.280> it's

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
played a thousand puzzles but it's

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.610

really<00:04:22.909> fun<00:04:23.180> all<00:04:23.449> the<00:04:23.539> puzzles<00:04:23.810> are<00:04:23.900> timed<00:04:24.229> as

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
really fun all the puzzles are timed as

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.820 
really fun all the puzzles are timed as
well<00:04:24.800> so

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
well so

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.379 
well so
you<00:04:26.340> have<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.550> get<00:04:26.669> through<00:04:26.819> it<00:04:26.879> invest<00:04:27.210> time

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
you have to get through it invest time

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.820 
you have to get through it invest time
possible<00:04:27.870> I<00:04:28.020> was<00:04:28.289> going<00:04:28.500> through<00:04:28.680> them<00:04:28.800> pretty

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
possible I was going through them pretty

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.830 
possible I was going through them pretty
fast<00:04:29.189> I<00:04:29.610> thought<00:04:29.759> it<00:04:29.939> was<00:04:30.030> like<00:04:30.120> four<00:04:30.360> seconds

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
fast I thought it was like four seconds

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.629 
fast I thought it was like four seconds
four<00:04:31.020> seconds<00:04:31.349> that's<00:04:31.470> pretty<00:04:31.710> good<00:04:31.889> but<00:04:32.220> it's

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
four seconds that's pretty good but it's

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.010 
four seconds that's pretty good but it's
only<00:04:32.789> getting<00:04:32.909> like<00:04:33.150> one<00:04:33.419> out<00:04:33.539> of<00:04:33.569> three<00:04:33.810> stars

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
only getting like one out of three stars

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.629 
only getting like one out of three stars
which<00:04:34.349> is<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> little<00:04:34.800> crazy<00:04:35.009> thinking<00:04:35.430> that

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
which is a little crazy thinking that

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.020 
which is a little crazy thinking that
maybe<00:04:36.629> do<00:04:36.930> these<00:04:37.110> faster<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.889> don't<00:04:38.099> know<00:04:38.189> so

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
maybe do these faster I don't know so

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.610 
maybe do these faster I don't know so
it's<00:04:39.599> been<00:04:39.689> really<00:04:39.840> fun<00:04:39.930> I've<00:04:40.259> been<00:04:40.379> enjoying

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
it's been really fun I've been enjoying

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.439 
it's been really fun I've been enjoying
it<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.099> agree<00:04:41.490> with<00:04:41.669> your<00:04:41.759> comment<00:04:42.090> about<00:04:42.240> the

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
it I agree with your comment about the

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.420 
it I agree with your comment about the
the<00:04:42.479> 3d<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:43.169> does<00:04:43.379> look<00:04:43.620> good<00:04:43.800> but<00:04:44.039> I<00:04:44.069> found<00:04:44.250> it

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
the 3d it does look good but I found it

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.249 
the 3d it does look good but I found it
also<00:04:44.550> helps<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.120> out<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.330> bit<00:04:45.569> yeah<00:04:45.840> just<00:04:46.110> have

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
also helps you out a bit yeah just have

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.499 
also helps you out a bit yeah just have
this<00:04:46.439> sort<00:04:47.009> of<00:04:47.039> cloud<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.729> pixels<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:48.419> you're

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
this sort of cloud of pixels that you're

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:49.640 
this sort of cloud of pixels that you're
trying<00:04:48.719> to<00:04:48.810> make<00:04:48.960> sense<00:04:49.199> of<00:04:49.349> and<00:04:49.469> you<00:04:49.530> actually

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
trying to make sense of and you actually

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.350 
trying to make sense of and you actually
can<00:04:49.830> see<00:04:50.039> the<00:04:50.400> depth<00:04:50.669> and<00:04:50.909> how<00:04:51.000> they<00:04:51.150> might

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
can see the depth and how they might

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.809 
can see the depth and how they might
line<00:04:51.719> up<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:52.080> make<00:04:52.259> yeah<00:04:52.620> and<00:04:53.189> you<00:04:53.340> get<00:04:53.699> little

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
line up to make yeah and you get little

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.999 
line up to make yeah and you get little
strategies<00:04:54.750> as<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:55.080> go<00:04:55.229> along<00:04:55.349> you<00:04:55.530> kind<00:04:55.949> of

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
strategies as you go along you kind of

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.830 
strategies as you go along you kind of
match<00:04:56.189> up<00:04:56.219> colors<00:04:56.759> in<00:04:57.090> different<00:04:57.360> ways<00:04:57.509> but

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
match up colors in different ways but

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.390 
match up colors in different ways but
the<00:04:57.900> 3d<00:04:58.289> definitely<00:04:58.710> helps<00:04:58.919> with<00:04:59.009> that<00:04:59.190> and

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
the 3d definitely helps with that and

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.920 
the 3d definitely helps with that and
another<00:04:59.879> cool<00:05:00.120> thing<00:05:00.180> about<00:05:00.360> this<00:05:00.599> is<00:05:00.719> you<00:05:00.840> can

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
another cool thing about this is you can

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.959 
another cool thing about this is you can
actually<00:05:01.289> create<00:05:01.590> your<00:05:01.710> own<00:05:01.830> puzzles<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.759> of
