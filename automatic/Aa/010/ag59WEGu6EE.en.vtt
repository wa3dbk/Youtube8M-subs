00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.159
 Y 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.269
 hello welcome to ney lines if you want 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.830
 Know how to make this nail design with 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:19.670
 rings keep looking you will need a 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.929
 base enamel stripping tape or tape 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.480
 adhesive strips a clippers scissors or 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.410
 Something similar 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.669
 rain stones and top coat but also 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.730
 you can use glue for nails 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.980
 we start by applying the base color yo 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.469
 I'm going to use this new one because I think that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.690
 combining it with orange tones is left 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.239
 much more accomplished the ring effect but 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.239
 you can use the one you like best 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.910
 take off the end of the spri king take 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.730
 never use a pair of tweezers 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.100
 hands or you will remove the glue 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.750
 let the enamel dry well and place the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.700
 tape over the finger in the middle of the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.800
 fingernail and matching the end of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.630
 this one with the nail pressure towards 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.450
 down covering the entire width but without 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.550
 paste the end to cut in my opinion 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.710
 it is best to use a nail clipper or cut 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.320
 stepparents because the scissors can be 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.360
 problematic giving the cut by the 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.780
 part that is not stuck and calculating 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.460
 that the cut part covers the entire width 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.440
 make sure it stays well attached if you 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.050
 you have fixed the first side is a 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.000
 little long this can not happen or it 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.729
 will take off with what if this happens 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.289
 adjusted more by cutting again if 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.270
 we look for that when we use stripping 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.450
 tape the manicure will last us like a 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.979
 normal manicure the tricks are not touching 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.100
 the tape never so you do not lose 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.100
 glue better cut short that is left 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.500
 long and paste everything very well 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.020
 we take 10 rain stones and leave them 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.360
 Prepared with a transparent glaze 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.430
 we give a small brushstroke in the middle 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.740
 of the tape although you can also use 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.990
 glue and with a tool 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.750
 points with the wet tip so that it 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.580
 hold the stone we take a rain stone and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.740
 we put it on top of the enamel with a 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.970
 tap to be fixed 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.220
 finally after letting a 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.020
 little we throw a generous layer of the top 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.760
 coat to fix the result 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.960
 especially if we have not used 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.690
 glue 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.570
 and our fingernails with rings are ready 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.030
