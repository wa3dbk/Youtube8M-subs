little bit about closures so here's the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.150 
little bit about closures so here's the
problem<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.689> with<00:00:27.810> closures<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.680> use

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
problem I have with closures so I use

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
or eight years and I used to think that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.240 
or eight years and I used to think that
there<00:00:33.780> was<00:00:33.870> bottle<00:00:34.230> variation<00:00:34.770> I'd<00:00:34.890> go<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> an

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
there was bottle variation I'd go to an

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.130 
there was bottle variation I'd go to an
event<00:00:35.370> I'd<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> twelve<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.809> know<00:00:36.899> twelve

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
would have to get rid of that bottle

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.709 
would have to get rid of that bottle
whoops<00:00:47.670> there's<00:00:47.879> 50<00:00:48.180> bucks<00:00:48.360> down<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> drain

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and then a few of the other bottles were

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.060 
and then a few of the other bottles were
just<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.090> little<00:00:51.210> not<00:00:51.570> right<00:00:52.530> either<00:00:52.860> they

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
just a little not right either they

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.290 
just a little not right either they
weren't<00:00:53.280> expressive<00:00:53.850> they<00:00:54.030> were<00:00:54.120> lacking

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
weren't expressive they were lacking

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.209

fruit<00:00:54.809> they<00:00:55.110> were<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.530> earthier<00:00:56.010> than

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
fruit they were a little earthier than

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979 
fruit they were a little earthier than
the<00:00:56.309> others<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> always<00:00:57.480> attributed<00:00:57.750> that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the others so I always attributed that

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.720 
the others so I always attributed that
to<00:00:58.320> bottle<00:00:58.649> variation<00:00:59.129> well<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.520> what

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
to bottle variation well you know what

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.700 
to bottle variation well you know what
since<00:01:00.059> I've<00:01:00.210> been<00:01:00.359> moved<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> DM<00:01:01.379> cork

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
since I've been moved to the DM cork

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.759 
since I've been moved to the DM cork
which<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:03.000> supercritical<00:01:03.960> cork<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.589> has

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
which is a supercritical cork that has

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.859 
which is a supercritical cork that has
zero<00:01:05.430> TCA<00:01:05.880> because<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.450> way<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.750> those

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
zero TCA because of the way that those

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.570 
zero TCA because of the way that those
corks<00:01:07.290> are<00:01:07.409> actually<00:01:07.830> made<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
corks are actually made in the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.370 
corks are actually made in the
laboratory<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.810> discovered<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
laboratory I have discovered that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.289 
laboratory I have discovered that
opening<00:01:10.770> 12<00:01:11.010> bottles<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.460> Maiwand<00:01:11.760> under<00:01:12.000> DM

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
opening 12 bottles of Maiwand under DM

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.960 
opening 12 bottles of Maiwand under DM
every<00:01:13.020> single<00:01:13.530> bottle<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.100> absolutely

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
every single bottle is absolutely

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.179 
every single bottle is absolutely
uniform<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.900> what<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.080> was<00:01:16.290> smelling<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
uniform so what I was smelling is the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219 
uniform so what I was smelling is the
best<00:01:17.400> cork<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> world<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.270> paying<00:01:18.509> 93

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
best cork in the world I was paying 93

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.399 
best cork in the world I was paying 93
cents<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:19.680> grade<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> floor<00:01:20.490> cork<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
cents for grade one a floor cork and

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.590 
cents for grade one a floor cork and
between<00:01:22.409> 25<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:22.979> 40<00:01:23.460> percent<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> bottles

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
between 25 and 40 percent of the bottles

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.330 
between 25 and 40 percent of the bottles
under<00:01:24.780> those<00:01:25.110> expensive<00:01:25.650> natural<00:01:26.070> course

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
under those expensive natural course

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.810 
under those expensive natural course
were<00:01:26.820> changed<00:01:27.540> by<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> TCA<00:01:28.409> infection<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.640> what

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
were changed by a TCA infection so what

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.899 
were changed by a TCA infection so what
I'm<00:01:29.909> saying<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.600> say<00:01:31.229> 2<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.130> 5<00:01:32.310> percent<00:01:32.759> is

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
I'm saying is if say 2 to 5 percent is

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.249 
I'm saying is if say 2 to 5 percent is
usually<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.329> people<00:01:33.570> say<00:01:33.750> 2<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.049> 5<00:01:34.229> percent

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
usually what people say 2 to 5 percent

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.280 
usually what people say 2 to 5 percent
