00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello dear telekom actually I am 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.599
 yes a newest loyal customer one 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.110
 I already have telephone connection 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.320
 over 20 years with you as then, the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.930
 Thousands of dsl came up immediately 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.330
 slammed and was immediately as one 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.210
 the first employee 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.400
 later came the 2000s dsl and also 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.820
 when the whole was raised to 6,000 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.439
 I struck immediately 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.989
 At some point my telekom became 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.309
 dreams come true and I really got one 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.129
 vdsl-port 50.000 download and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.100
 tens of thousands of uploads really sounded that way 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.989
 I also have great fun entertaining my ears 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.390
 used for several years and also at 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.360
 league totally of you the games of mine 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.059
 looked at favorite team but 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 now dear telekom now should be soon 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.300
 I have everything completely different 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.699
 read 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:04.140
 Soon everything will be very slow 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.150
 because I am youtuber that means me 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.610
 upload many videos into the net and watch 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.729
 also like videos from the net at exactly 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.369
 to be videos from youtube and you like 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.659
 I do not think so much anyway 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.820
 in an interview, yours 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.950
 telecom spokesman philipp blank said 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.869
 Of course it can be that customer in 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.939
 need more high speed volume in the future 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.759
 but if you want more power 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.479
 They would be willing to do more 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.750
 pay 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.729
 at this point rather telekom occupied 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.979
 you us and that makes me somehow 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.840
 sad because I do not want to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.850
 more power but i just want to 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.860
 I keep my power now 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.369
 also for years with your money 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.640
 Philip had to pay long now 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.610
 announced mr sirius get them 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.770
 a hundred thousand line or one 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.840
 200,000 line or 5 million 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.000
 line and there you have more power 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.700
 and maybe you want more 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.460
 pay then I would say so great 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.530
 love telecom but that is yes 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.420
 actually only my ongoing 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.190
 to break the contract somehow 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.440
 with any weird changes 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.880
 to want to drive in and new customers 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.890
 anyway anyway 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.780
 even to want because the throttling of 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.670
 internet connections somehow sound 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.590
 a little bit as if we were back 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.690
 to be arrived in the nineties 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.610
 years or in the 80s 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.290
 when was that again as the modem 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.120
 I made fun of myself 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.180
 no longer remember it must be well 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.980
 to have been too small 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.780
 Anyway, dear telekom 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.550
 I do not know what renÃ© obermann 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.610
 as chairman of telekom 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.590
 it has thought new dsl rates with 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.240
 use volume limitation 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.100
 I know that he is the people 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.140
 I just wanted to make it that new 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.120
 but customers are secretly 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.460
 Actually, that was planned for everyone 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.680
 So introduce myself or for me 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.110
 Not 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.440
 As RenÃ© tells it, either way 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.730
 only three percent are those huge 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.340
 Data volumes use that for you 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.830
 additional costs are incurred only 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.510
 three percent weird then the seem 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.790
 Most of my friends just from these 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.860
 three percent to exist because a 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.650
 average customer of about 15 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.880
 consumed up to 20 gigabytes a month 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.120
 I feel a bit strange 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.800
 in front 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.230
 that could perhaps be my parents 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.720
 if I have four to five videos a day 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.970
 upload are already 12 gb loose 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.260
 let alone let alone because I want the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.210
 then look again or 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.360
 Comment comments or just times 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:37.340
 look what colleagues do 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:40.650
 15 to 20 gigabytes a month not a day 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.959
 at first sounded as if only new customers 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.760
 really from the second time on 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.550
 a new contract with telekom 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.560
 then came to scare and fear 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.250
 we slowly out that the telekom 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.440
 probably plans to 2016 by analogy all 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.520
 Connections on ip technology 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.890
 switch 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.500
 this will probably also stock 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.400
 telekom customers make a contract amendment 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.470
 get served 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.560
 as soon as you accept this 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.780
 probably also a throttling from 2016 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.270
 for you completely logo now we have 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.370
 Somehow in 2013 I do not know what in three 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.590
 years, I'm still doing youtube 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.609
 Then there will be youtube then 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.739
 still watched videos 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.830
 I do not know but I know completely 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.760
 sure I'm not on 384 anyway 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.290
 kilobit 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.910
 wants to be reduced down round 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.850
 I love telekom at the moment 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.730
 just hope that one of your competitors 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.740
 will be strong enough and from yours 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.720
 mistakes learn and no 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.240
 Volume limit at his rates 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.880
 will introduce but simply says 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.010
 human if the telekom is so stupid and 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.280
 his customers shoo away then we take 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.530
 I like to be over 20 now 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.570
 years telekom customer and so far that was 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.070
 somehow always ok for me and 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.050
 Actually I thought so too 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.120
 would telekom another 20 years 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.680
 be a customer if he somehow 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.630
 imprint a volume limit 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.080
 you want to be honest then 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.740
 then i am gone and should have this video 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.880
 or this one is just luring you 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.980
 Telecommunications companies hear that 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.140
 nothing so telekom heard and no 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.910
 then wants to introduce volume limit 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.380
 can you give me your advertising offer 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.030
 then send what probably in 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.560
 future will also accept 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.630
 if the telekom on the 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.250
 Volume limit omitted because yes 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.590
 our government is not really 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.360
 happy with it and save you 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.490
 anyway no one understands what that 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.450
 I should continue to do so 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.270
 stay with you 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.980
 In this sense, a loyal customer of 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.430
 Maybe not soon to be a customer 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.910
 becomes 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.910
 pure skin
