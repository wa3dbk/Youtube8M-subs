so in drop D tuning so we have D a D G B
and<00:00:15.540> E

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
and E

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.460 
and E
first<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.630> all<00:00:18.690> we'll<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> look<00:00:19.260> at<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
first of all we'll have a look at the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.140 
first of all we'll have a look at the
riffs<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.039> then<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.490> have<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> look<00:00:20.789> at<00:00:20.850> some<00:00:21.029> of

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
riffs and then we have a look at some of

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.189 
riffs and then we have a look at some of
the<00:00:21.300> melody<00:00:21.779> parts<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.680> first<00:00:22.890> riff

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.130 

we've<00:00:28.199> got<00:00:28.380> open<00:00:28.529> D<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.300> we're<00:00:30.300> muting<00:00:30.750> that

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
we've got open D and we're muting that

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.080 
we've got open D and we're muting that
string<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.420> then<00:00:33.420> we're<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> go<00:00:33.840> 10<00:00:35.090> 12

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
string and then we're going to go 10 12

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:56.690 
string and then we're going to go 10 12
13<00:00:37.730> 12<00:00:38.730> 10

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:04.200 

so<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.450> second<00:00:57.750> whiff

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:29.070 

so<00:01:05.210> slowly

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.350 

so<00:01:30.080> we<00:01:30.350> stay<00:01:30.590> here<00:01:30.770> too<00:01:31.040> at<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.250> end<00:01:34.270> then<00:01:35.270> we

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
so we stay here too at the end then we

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.850 
so we stay here too at the end then we
come<00:01:35.510> up<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.840> power<00:01:36.260> cord<00:01:36.530> here

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
come up to power cord here

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.470 
come up to power cord here
on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> eight<00:01:40.760> five<00:01:41.760> six<00:01:42.120> seven<00:01:42.450> eight

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
on the eight five six seven eight

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.410 
on the eight five six seven eight
so<00:01:45.480> at<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.660> end<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.050> second<00:01:46.380> verse<00:01:46.580> we<00:01:47.580> go

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.340 

so<00:01:51.420> five<00:01:51.810> six<00:01:52.170> seven<00:01:52.980> eight<00:01:54.050> seven<00:01:55.050> eight<00:01:55.140> nine

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
so five six seven eight seven eight nine

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.340 
so five six seven eight seven eight nine
ten

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
ten

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.500 
ten
then<00:01:58.350> we<00:01:58.440> have<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> cause--'cause<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> we

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
then we have the cause--'cause so we

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:09.840 
then we have the cause--'cause so we
have<00:02:00.830> power<00:02:01.830> cords<00:02:02.130> on<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.310> third<00:02:03.530> third<00:02:05.510> one

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:25.550 

so<00:02:10.850> it's<00:02:11.000> 3-1<00:02:11.600> open<00:02:12.170> power<00:02:12.380> cord

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.970 

three-one

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.640 

and<00:02:29.549> again

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:51.130 

so<00:02:38.650> cut<00:02:39.010> again<00:02:39.220> Saturday

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140

back<00:02:51.680> up<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.950> five

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.350 

going<00:03:13.490> back<00:03:13.640> into<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.820> only<00:03:17.000> thing<00:03:17.210> else

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
going back into the only thing else

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:28.860 
going back into the only thing else
drops<00:03:17.600> out<00:03:17.810> except<00:03:18.140> for<00:03:18.170> one<00:03:18.410> guitar<00:03:18.560> just

that's five to three open five six five

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:58.390 
that's five to three open five six five
three<00:03:51.319> iPhone<00:03:52.700> open<00:03:53.959> five<00:03:55.340> six<00:03:56.340> five<00:03:57.209> three

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
three iPhone open five six five three

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:06.199 
three iPhone open five six five three
open<00:04:03.890> over<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:04.980> course<00:04:05.190> chords<00:04:05.640> we<00:04:05.940> have<00:04:05.970> some

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
open over the course chords we have some

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:15.890 
open over the course chords we have some
arpeggios<00:04:09.140> this<00:04:10.140> is<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.290> picking<00:04:10.620> pattern<00:04:14.900> so

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
arpeggios this is a picking pattern so

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.940 
arpeggios this is a picking pattern so
you<00:04:15.959> can<00:04:16.049> see<00:04:16.200> we've<00:04:16.290> got<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.410> sweeping

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
you can see we've got a sweeping

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.980 
you can see we've got a sweeping
movement<00:04:17.370> here<00:04:22.580> so<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.760> arpeggios<00:04:24.720> are<00:04:24.900> as

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
movement here so the arpeggios are as

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:32.360 
movement here so the arpeggios are as
follows<00:04:25.350> so<00:04:25.800> we<00:04:25.889> have<00:04:26.010> an<00:04:26.100> F<00:04:26.220> arpeggio<00:04:31.250> so<00:04:32.250> it's

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
follows so we have an F arpeggio so it's

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:43.610 
follows so we have an F arpeggio so it's
15<00:04:32.820> 14<00:04:33.389> 13<00:04:33.630> 13<00:04:36.200> then<00:04:37.200> we<00:04:37.260> have<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.410> C<00:04:37.650> major<00:04:42.620> let

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
15 14 13 13 then we have a C major let

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:52.460 
15 14 13 13 then we have a C major let
me<00:04:43.710> have<00:04:43.830> a<00:04:43.860> D<00:04:44.070> minor<00:04:50.750> at<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.870> end<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.080> there

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
me have a D minor at the end of there

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:00.800 
me have a D minor at the end of there
we<00:04:52.680> playing<00:04:55.070> so<00:04:56.070> it's<00:04:56.220> 10<00:04:56.520> 10<00:04:57.560> 13<00:04:58.560> 10<00:04:59.630> so<00:05:00.630> play

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.610 

and<00:05:18.210> then<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.689> third<00:05:18.900> time<00:05:19.110> around<00:05:19.139> we<00:05:19.469> come

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
and then the third time around we come

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.600 
and then the third time around we come
up<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.770> here<00:05:20.099> so<00:05:20.550> we've<00:05:20.669> got<00:05:20.749> 17<00:05:21.749> 15<00:05:22.319> 15<00:05:22.800> 15<00:05:25.610> 15

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
up to here so we've got 17 15 15 15 15

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:37.010 
up to here so we've got 17 15 15 15 15
14<00:05:27.389> 13<00:05:27.419> 13<00:05:30.979> 14<00:05:31.979> 12<00:05:32.309> 13<00:05:32.849> 12<00:05:35.360> then<00:05:36.360> two<00:05:36.749> times

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
14 13 13 14 12 13 12 then two times

00:05:37.020 --> 00:06:02.200 
14 13 13 14 12 13 12 then two times
round<00:05:37.319> on<00:05:37.529> the<00:05:37.620> D<00:05:37.830> minor<00:05:41.719> then<00:05:42.719> we<00:05:42.839> have<00:05:42.990> this

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210

we<00:06:03.210> have

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.590 

at<00:06:18.630> the<00:06:18.780> end<00:06:18.870> of<00:06:18.990> the<00:06:19.050> song<00:06:19.259> we<00:06:19.380> have
