00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.860
 and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.230
 and 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.550
 all right 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.080
 hello dear followers of my channel in 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:38.760
 I'm going to be preparing today 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.860
 a delicious green drink the reason for 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.850
 do this video is to check if 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.420
 truly this artifact works 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 I bought this gadget my son like this 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.079
 that I want to try it to see how 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.700
 comes out the consistency of your shakes or is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.540
 very and as they say the nutritious 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.780
 well the most important thing of all this is 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.710
 that we are going to take advantage of all 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.050
 the nutrients all the fiber of these 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.900
 fruits and vegetables that we use in 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:19.840
 our juices and it's going to be very easy 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.109
 so that our body absorbs it 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.659
 it is very important to be constant when 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.789
 let's dedicate ourselves to take these juices 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.630
 especially every morning in 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:34.940
 fast good let's continue and already 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.750
 we will see the results 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.150
 I will be using pineapple I already have 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.920
 all the fruits and vegetables that I'm going to 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.110
 use cut and I buy these 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.780
 containers to have them there chopped in 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.940
 the refrigerator and do not give us laziness 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.430
 the mornings we can apply all the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.590
 good vegetables I will use as you 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.760
 I say the pineapple rock heads oli 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.220
 carrot celery here I have pickles a 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.610
 little bit of aloe and the most important thing 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.680
 for me are this is the nopal or the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.770
 pencas of the tuna that sell them here 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.220
 they are very popular and I also bought 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.230
 a large bag of these vegetables 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.410
 mixed that are pre-special for 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.170
 prepare these green juices in the bag 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.990
 brings the char that I and the spinach 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.120
 this is going to be the first multiple that I 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.239
 I'm going to prepare and I want to share it with 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.239
 your 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.000
 how do I come back and I repeat this little gadget 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.200
 I bought it for my son to do his 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.080
 Smoothies brings two glasses one could 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.260
 say it 's personal and the other is for 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.750
 make double ration 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.299
 I have uploads of smoothies that 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.920
 I have done and the truth to some 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.390
 people do not like the consistency 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.110
 they have tells me that it's like very 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.840
 thick and that this is sometimes impossible 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.970
 of taking them is why I'm going to 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.410
 try this to see if I buy mine 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.170
 for me 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.390
 this apparatus brings two blades this is 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.730
 perfect for when we add seeds 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.740
 to our preparation and this we can 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.410
 add seeds also because it has what 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.380
 same below and especially to liquefy 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.200
 Fruits and vegetables first thing 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.500
 we are going to add in this glass is the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.870
 leaves we will always add 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.820
 easier to liquefy and heavier to 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.910
 adapt will always go in the part of 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.910
 above 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.719
 for me it is very important to use 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.079
 fruits vegetables whatever to help 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:41.620
 with my blood pressure and also with my 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.950
 liver 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.560
 added the leaves the heat the chad and the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.530
 spinach and now I'm adding as 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.409
 a branch and a half of celery and a good 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.620
 piece of gherkin I'm also going to 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:58.780
 add a couple of broccoli heads and 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.379
 so I have some sweet added 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.379
 carrot 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.230
 the most important thing in this one played for me 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.840
 is to add the nopal in opal the help 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.910
 with diabetes with high blood pressure and 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.770
 has many benefits just like 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.829
 this little piece of aloe that I just 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:21.390
 add it and let's add a little bit of 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.390
 pineapple very hard ttico 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.790
 now before liquefying let's not forget 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.010
 add water there is the brand where 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.020
 says maximum until that's where we should 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:39.340
 to fill with water 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:42.010
 very important to close the glass well 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.790
 and keep in mind that it is closed 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.520
 correctly 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.340
 now at the time of liquefying only 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.320
 we can liquefy for a minute because as 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.930
 the engine is so powerful it has a 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.390
 security device that if you 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.970
 you run the engine overheats and it goes 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:02.680
 turn off and once the engine cools down 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.680
 it's going to work again 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.070
 it's my first time I'm going to use 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:13.430
 this artifact so I have a bit of 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.639
 emotion and I'm waiting to see 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.030
 the results 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.069
 we make sure it is properly placed 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.650
 Let's start to liquefy and know no 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:27.710
 exceed more than one minute 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.979
 so far everything is going well I 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.760
 like the consistency you're seeing 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:38.670
 you see that everything has been mixed 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:42.950
 let's give it 20 more seconds 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.950
 and this will be ready 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:52.140
 now we are going to serve it 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.980
 it owes me how good it looks it looks good 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.140
 consistency is not lumps or good anymore 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.540
 convinced me so I would have to 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.520
 buy mine 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.160
 well, dear friends, I hope that 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.280
 they like the video 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:13.020
 checking if it's true that this 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:15.409
 It liquefies very well and well I will tell you that if 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.279
 it convinced me 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:21.559
 and it also brings its cover that is perfect 

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:24.080
 in case you want to take it to work 

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:26.300
 you put it in the refrigerator and I'll 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.569
 you drink quietly in your work in the 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.159
 gym where you want to take it 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.139
 although it is not recommended because they say 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.919
 that the juices once they're already 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.830
 ready 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.360
 one has to drink immediately but 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.830
 sometimes 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.979
 we can not save it in the 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.979
 fridge 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:09.419
 and
