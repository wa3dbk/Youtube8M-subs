00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.340
 powders as they are I hope that 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.720
 find the best today's day 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.760
 today I bring you a video with which 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.130
 we will be able to test what is 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.780
 our agility of our mind with 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.390
 this application that is compatible both 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.620
 with ios like what is android then 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.179
 any of us will be able to 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.039
 have no problem and let's see 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.199
 how agile our minds are at the time 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.119
 to do various exercises on everything 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.589
 with colors so if you want to know about 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.269
 what application it is and how it 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.269
 use stay in this video 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.980
 and let's start the way that 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.660
 let's test our agility 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.969
 of our mind is very simple is 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.409
 through a very intrepid game and very 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.329
 fun that I think is going to 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.949
 fascinate really 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.480
 this application is totally free 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.430
 as I say it is a kind of game 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.559
 then you will love it very much and to 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.479
 downloading it is very simple if you do not enter 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.420
 let's go to what the author is if he is 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.979
 that we have a device with ios 7 not 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.299
 it's a device with android you know 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.559
 that we are going to go to what is the play 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.720
 Clear store that our store 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.280
 applications and we're going to download this 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.159
 application that is also 23 screens 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.780
 which is called a color anyway in 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.670
 any the two applications is 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.429
 exactly the same then I know 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.690
 I'm going to show what my iphone is 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.920
 As I said, it's totally free 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.119
 simply the option as well as true 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.700
 tomÃ¡s color here is appearing 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.690
 the name of what this application is and 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.069
 ready 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.090
 once we have downloaded what 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.159
 let's do is open what is the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.720
 application and the first thing we're going to see 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.979
 is this interface that really looks very 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.080
 well obviously this is an ad 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.130
 because it is a free application but 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.159
 we will simply be what is the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.959
 advertising ready as I was telling you this 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.979
 what the application interface for 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.110
 playing is very simple simply 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.380
 we press this play button 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.990
 and to play it we have four types of 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.510
 games that are different but 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.310
 basically consist of the same thing is of 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.990
 what is involved is that we have to 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.090
 relate what is the name of the color 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.070
 with what is the color itself then 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.960
 then it is very simple dynamic and 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.660
 let's start the first one that we have 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.650
 here is the classic game in which to the 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.450
 when we start playing what 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.160
 we have to do is put true or 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 false depending if the color is true 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.479
 for example here it appears what is 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.709
 the ice that is yellow and appears to us 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.080
 the child program circle then 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.760
 these true ones we select here 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.010
 if maybe blue can color little circles 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.690
 red then we put that obviously not 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.510
 here it took me a little time and we 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.790
 you can or I lost but the one that consisted 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.280
 as I comment, it's basically putting 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.340
 true or false depending on the color 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.959
 that looks out there is also in Spanish 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.209
 I have my device in English like this 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.980
 that if you do not know English what 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.390
 You can use it in Spanish if you do not 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.239
 can use in English so that 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.590
 learn better what colors are 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.260
 here as I say it is a fast game 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.730
 I'm not advertising then you can 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.720
 if it disappears, I'm going to go back to 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.970
 put 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.910
 then there goes we 're going to go back to 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.500
 start and we start says it's the 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.900
 blue and the color of the circuit is blue 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.620
 then true this is true is 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.350
 the true this is false because red 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.290
 false false 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.030
 true 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.280
 true then is what it consists of 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.410
 and work lose to be able to explain 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.880
 to the other game modes as they can 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.640
 see at this moment in my record is 8 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.830
 but I have achieved what are more points in 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.420
 what exists in this game the second 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.640
 action we have is the stopwatch 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.760
 what is this option that we have 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.290
 here is to go also relating what 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.830
 which are the colors that appear to us in 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.380
 the screen nothing more than what to do is 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.120
 that we have of the time limit until 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.400
 that the wheel we have here ends 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.230
 here we are going to put to him that is true 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.200
 here is true true false false 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.129
 false 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:53.840
 this is true true true 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:57.530
 true false is false or true and 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.120
 false as the circuit ended up for me 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.680
 as seen this game and I finish what 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.480
 deals with this option that we have here is 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.300
 that in 30 seconds that's what it gives 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.220
 the return to the little wheel that we have there 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.890
 answer as many colors 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.629
 possible as they can avoid knowing what 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.459
 it's my record that was 15 then the 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.340
 joke is to go beating his records 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.139
 you have in this application the 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.329
 attraction that we have here is to look 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.829
 the color as you can see in this what 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.389
 it is that it is going to tell us what it is 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.010
 the color on the top and what 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.260
 we're going to have to relate to what 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.870
 is the one below for me it says that red 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.030
 he entered he selected it 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.210
 apparently I'm wrong to go to 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.210
 start 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:38.009
 what we are going to do is that the name 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.509
 tell us what we are going to relate 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.129
 and he tells me it's yellow between 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:47.129
 selection is not yellow again 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:50.939
 yellow red green this is red 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.860
 you are blue is yellow 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:55.169
 then it seems wrong again 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.519
 As you can see, it creates confusions 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.899
 same at the same time because the color 

00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:00.089
 that you show differently to what 

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:02.009
 they are asking then these where you 

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:05.159
 you show the agility you have for 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.860
 be able to use it if your application already 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.999
 finally what we have is this the 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.009
 fourth which in which we have to 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:12.449
 select match the name of the 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.399
 color with what circle that is us 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.800
 showing let's play it so they see 

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:19.910
 how does it work 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.610
 let's select with the true ones 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.680
 and we have here what green is here 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.340
 what is red here what is the 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.190
 green here what is the red here what 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.290
 it's green then how can you see like that 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.060
 it works on this expression of 5 then 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.040
 it's a matter of going beating record had 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.780
 instrumented previously and from this 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.610
 way he like you are going to test 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.960
 what is your mind also to enter 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.240
 it's exactly the same game then 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.280
 do not enter any problem to achieve 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.390
 use it good to me all this was all 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.250
 for this video is because he likes 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.680
 quite the memory this game is called 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.240
 color here of everything the name appears 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.130
 to search for it, download it 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.990
 compatible with both for me is for what 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.520
 that is intensely android of no 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.410
 problem to download it in I know what 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.540
