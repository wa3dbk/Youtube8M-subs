that<00:01:09.170> as<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.560> faced<00:01:10.860> these<00:01:11.100> daunting<00:01:11.369> odds

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that as they faced these daunting odds

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.760 
that as they faced these daunting odds
the<00:01:12.659> men<00:01:13.500> would<00:01:13.650> be<00:01:13.770> tempted<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.189> turn<00:01:14.430> back

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
the men would be tempted to turn back

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.130 
the men would be tempted to turn back
board<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> boat<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.640> flee<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.150> by

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
board the boat and and flee and by

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.969 
board the boat and and flee and by
removing<00:01:19.470> eruption<00:01:20.299> that<00:01:21.590> increased<00:01:22.590> their

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
removing eruption that increased their

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.910 
removing eruption that increased their
fighting<00:01:23.700> resolve<00:01:24.500> going<00:01:25.500> forward<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.509> so

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
fighting resolve going forward and so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.580 
fighting resolve going forward and so
again<00:01:28.920> there's<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:30.509> only<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.840> fact<00:01:31.530> that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
again there's not only the fact that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.090 
again there's not only the fact that
time<00:01:32.060> passes<00:01:33.060> between<00:01:33.840> actions<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.920> one

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
time passes between actions but that one

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.330 
time passes between actions but that one
reasons<00:01:35.549> about<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.150> fact<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.920> impacts<00:01:37.920> how

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
reasons about that fact and impacts how

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.050 
reasons about that fact and impacts how
the<00:01:38.880> strategic<00:01:39.060> situation<00:01:39.570> unfolds<00:01:40.880> we<00:01:41.880> see

the strategic situation unfolds we see

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.160 
the strategic situation unfolds we see
it<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.329> only<00:01:42.509> when<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:42.930> are<00:01:42.960> multiple

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it not only when there are multiple

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.120 
it not only when there are multiple
agents<00:01:43.890> involved<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:44.939> even<00:01:45.290> in<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.680> single
