00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and if you're wondering why I am using a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.990 
and if you're wondering why I am using a
ruler<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.400> don't<00:02:29.640> make<00:02:29.760> my

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
ruler it's just so that I don't make my

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.760 
ruler it's just so that I don't make my

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
handwriting go lopsided

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.820 
handwriting go lopsided
it<00:02:32.280> keeps<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.730> letter<00:02:32.910> straight<00:02:33.380> so<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.710> do

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
it keeps the letter straight so I do

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.360 
it keeps the letter straight so I do
recommend<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.790> use<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.270> you'd<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.660> to

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370
