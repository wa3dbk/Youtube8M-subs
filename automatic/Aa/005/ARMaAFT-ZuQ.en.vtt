is now on the right side of your screen
you<00:04:28.080> want<00:04:28.139> to<00:04:28.289> head<00:04:28.410> over<00:04:28.440> to<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:29.039> north

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
you want to head over to the north

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.010 
you want to head over to the north
you'll<00:04:29.580> see<00:04:29.759> that<00:04:29.849> there<00:04:30.030> is<00:04:30.060> there's

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
you'll see that there is there's

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.070 
you'll see that there is there's
actually<00:04:31.349> a<00:04:31.380> pilot<00:04:32.130> Baba<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.789> yes<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.960> name

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
actually a pilot Baba and yes the name

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.990 
actually a pilot Baba and yes the name
twine<00:04:34.380> lit<00:04:34.770> as<00:04:34.949> it<00:04:35.099> is<00:04:35.220> lit<00:04:35.490> up<00:04:35.610> by<00:04:35.759> Twilight

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
twine lit as it is lit up by Twilight

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.770 
twine lit as it is lit up by Twilight
yes

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
yes

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.749 
yes
so<00:04:37.080> it's<00:04:37.259> works<00:04:37.500> just<00:04:37.770> like<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.919> regular<00:04:37.979> deck

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
so it's works just like a regular deck

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.999 
so it's works just like a regular deck
table<00:04:39.150> however<00:04:39.690> it<00:04:39.900> just<00:04:40.169> has<00:04:40.380> a<00:04:40.410> double

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
table however it just has a double

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.620 
table however it just has a double
appearance<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.669> everything<00:04:41.970> so<00:04:42.419> see<00:04:42.599> that

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
appearance and everything so see that

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.230 
appearance and everything so see that
there<00:04:42.900> are<00:04:43.050> two<00:04:43.319> of<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.919> dark<00:04:44.669> insects<00:04:45.030> right

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
there are two of the dark insects right

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.580 
there are two of the dark insects right
here<00:04:45.449> you<00:04:45.780> can<00:04:45.900> see<00:04:45.990> them<00:04:46.110> on<00:04:46.169> your<00:04:46.289> mat<00:04:46.349> as

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
here you can see them on your mat as

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.370 
here you can see them on your mat as
well<00:04:46.789> however<00:04:47.789> you<00:04:48.389> can't<00:04:48.630> see<00:04:48.870> them<00:04:49.020> normally

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
well however you can't see them normally

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.559 
well however you can't see them normally
they<00:04:49.620> they're<00:04:50.460> visible<00:04:50.789> most<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.150> times<00:04:51.330> so

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
they they're visible most of times so

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:52.790 
they they're visible most of times so
you<00:04:51.630> have<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.900> use<00:04:52.020> your<00:04:52.110> senses<00:04:52.319> that<00:04:52.590> are<00:04:52.680> and

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
you have to use your senses that are and

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.529 
you have to use your senses that are and
see<00:04:52.949> them<00:04:53.130> you<00:04:53.880> can't<00:04:54.090> see<00:04:54.240> them<00:04:54.389> when<00:04:54.479> they

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:54.539 
see them you can't see them when they

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.180 
see them you can't see them when they
are<00:04:54.569> attacking<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.289> guess<00:04:55.530> they<00:04:55.740> do<00:04:56.099> this

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
are attacking I guess they do this

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.399 
are attacking I guess they do this
little<00:04:56.400> electrical<00:04:57.030> charge<00:04:57.330> move<00:04:58.080> whatever

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
little electrical charge move whatever

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:59.540 
little electrical charge move whatever
and<00:04:58.620> it<00:04:58.680> will<00:04:58.770> hurt<00:04:58.889> you<00:04:59.069> if<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.190> touch<00:04:59.340> them

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
and it will hurt you if you touch them

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.550 
and it will hurt you if you touch them
while<00:04:59.699> their<00:04:59.849> charge<00:05:00.120> steps<00:05:00.360> so<00:05:00.659> just<00:05:01.440> watch

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
while their charge steps so just watch

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.020 
while their charge steps so just watch
out<00:05:01.710> for<00:05:01.860> that<00:05:01.979> when<00:05:02.159> any<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.550> these<00:05:02.639> insects

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
out for that when any of these insects

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.399 
out for that when any of these insects
are<00:05:03.150> electric<00:05:03.599> then<00:05:03.780> you<00:05:03.900> want<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.139> avoid

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
are electric then you want to avoid

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:05.809 
are electric then you want to avoid
touching<00:05:04.620> them<00:05:04.979> if<00:05:05.190> you<00:05:05.310> walk<00:05:05.460> forward<00:05:05.669> you'll

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
touching them if you walk forward you'll

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.279 
touching them if you walk forward you'll
see<00:05:05.940> that<00:05:06.060> one<00:05:06.240> like<00:05:06.509> goes<00:05:06.870> underneath<00:05:07.110> the

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
see that one like goes underneath the

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.149 
see that one like goes underneath the
gate<00:05:07.409> and<00:05:07.560> we'll<00:05:07.650> deal<00:05:07.800> with<00:05:07.830> that<00:05:07.949> in<00:05:08.039> a

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
gate and we'll deal with that in a

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.480 
gate and we'll deal with that in a
moment

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
moment

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.029

this<00:05:21.090> will<00:05:21.240> knock<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.659> insects<00:05:21.930> down<00:05:22.139> once

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
this will knock the insects down once

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:24.469 
this will knock the insects down once
again<00:05:23.069> be<00:05:23.340> careful<00:05:23.639> not<00:05:23.699> touching<00:05:24.120> at<00:05:24.180> all<00:05:24.270> it

again be careful not touching at all it
is<00:05:24.509> crushed<00:05:24.870> up<00:05:25.110> and<00:05:25.349> then<00:05:25.860> you<00:05:25.979> want<00:05:26.159> to

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
is crushed up and then you want to

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.040 
is crushed up and then you want to
gather<00:05:26.610> its<00:05:26.940> light<00:05:27.240> once<00:05:27.479> you've<00:05:27.539> defeated<00:05:27.810> it

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
gather its light once you've defeated it

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.719 
gather its light once you've defeated it
head<00:05:28.590> on<00:05:28.620> over<00:05:28.919> to<00:05:29.039> this<00:05:29.219> side<00:05:29.490> you'll<00:05:29.699> see

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
head on over to this side you'll see

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.820 
head on over to this side you'll see
there's<00:05:30.060> actually<00:05:30.330> two<00:05:30.539> more<00:05:30.780> on<00:05:31.469> your<00:05:31.680> map

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
there's actually two more on your map

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.800 
there's actually two more on your map
how<00:05:32.550> it's<00:05:32.820> in<00:05:32.909> the<00:05:32.969> same<00:05:33.120> area<00:05:33.389> we<00:05:33.479> don't<00:05:33.570> see

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
how it's in the same area we don't see

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.120 
how it's in the same area we don't see

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
you'll be able to use Minda to jump into

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:42.159 
you'll be able to use Minda to jump into
the<00:05:38.940> window<00:05:39.210> up<00:05:39.900> on<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.169> upper<00:05:40.380> ledge<00:05:40.530> there

collect their light listen to that you

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:54.049 
collect their light listen to that you
can<00:06:51.870> head<00:06:52.020> on<00:06:52.110> into<00:06:52.289> the<00:06:52.469> cave<00:06:52.650> and<00:06:52.919> this<00:06:53.849> time

00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:54.059 
can head on into the cave and this time

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:56.059 
can head on into the cave and this time
it's<00:06:54.210> actually<00:06:54.330> in<00:06:54.719> the<00:06:54.749> Twilight<00:06:55.349> world<00:06:55.800> it's

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:56.069 
it's actually in the Twilight world it's

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:57.709 
it's actually in the Twilight world it's
actually<00:06:56.460> really<00:06:56.819> bright<00:06:57.150> in<00:06:57.300> there<00:06:57.419> so<00:06:57.629> it

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:57.719 
actually really bright in there so it

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:58.879 
actually really bright in there so it
makes<00:06:57.900> it<00:06:58.020> quite<00:06:58.199> a<00:06:58.229> bit<00:06:58.289> easier<00:06:58.589> because<00:06:58.740> you

00:06:58.879 --> 00:06:58.889 
makes it quite a bit easier because you

00:06:58.889 --> 00:06:59.989 
makes it quite a bit easier because you
don't<00:06:59.039> need<00:06:59.129> a<00:06:59.189> lantern<00:06:59.520> which<00:06:59.729> is<00:06:59.819> a<00:06:59.849> good

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:02.089 
thing because we can't use it right now

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:04.519 
thing because we can't use it right now
however<00:07:03.089> you'll<00:07:03.360> if<00:07:03.569> you<00:07:03.749> use<00:07:04.020> your<00:07:04.169> senses
