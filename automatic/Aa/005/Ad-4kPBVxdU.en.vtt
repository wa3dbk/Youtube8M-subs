00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.379
 continuity of this action and the account 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.629

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.359
 will be unlawful according to 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.989
 Mr. Schneider who sends him the 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.149
 Red card 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.429
 all in all logically for this fault 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.780
 on roman hamouma month of a minute from 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.370
 game and the Lorientais are going to have 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.620
 evolve to ten against eleven 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.780
 the exit of bourgueil the return of 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.070
 florent chaigneau who must immediately 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.080
 put to work with this free-kick 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.630
 left foot of pierre-yves paulo ma 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.880
 holder the young paul homa who was 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.370
 lent to laval last season in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.260
 left lateral 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.170
 a first opportunity a second 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.630
 now with the old hake kevin 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.760
 monnet-package florent chaigneau has 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.980
 work in this first period 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.740
 and it is true that men of sylvain 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.200
 ripoll protected loïc féry are in 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.350
 suffering and suffer assaults 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.360
 Stephane Kévin Theophile-Catherine and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.850
 for monnet package the withdrawal for 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.860
 Roman hamouma and a third time 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.860
 florent chaigneau must intervene 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.540
 the not used to be tenured there 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.430
 played only 15 league games 1 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.610
 during the last five seasons 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.830
 and well yet it allows the break to 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.960
 lorient to maintain this point of the match 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.750
 no one except the guy who is is worried 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.460
 because these men get opportunities 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.840
 but fail to find the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.479
 Fault can be here with 60 of Roman 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.369
 hamouma to nolan roux who 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.060
 unbelievably miss the bib they were at 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.100
 five meters from the red nolan goal that had 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.350
 constantly move on the bottom of 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.270
 attack without experiencing success does not 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.560
 find her to give up her place ani the word 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.040
 peace a few moments later it is 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.840
 finds 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.959
 neil baup is also a rookie 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.239
 stéphanoise also from 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.360
 nice word peace that finds at the point of 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.450
 Roman hamouma penalty in the 87th minute 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.480
 it's cruel for the Lorient people who have 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.670
 held until then but which must 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.820
 bow on yet another blow 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.480
 Saint-Etienne Roman hamouma the man 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.840
 providential greens already scorer in 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.549
 mid-week in europa league 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.209
 second realization for roman hamouma 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.870
 after the one inscribed against bordeaux 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.269
 last Saturday 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.959
 he is caught up against blooming foot 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:02.989
 chaigneau and this will be the final score 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.030
 to the forceps to wear Saint-Etienne finished 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.980
 to crack the ten Lorientes 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.940
 first victory for the first green 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.940
 setback for hakes
