00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
minutes almost like tub and it would

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.320 
minutes almost like tub and it would
taste<00:03:45.819> and<00:03:46.269> see<00:03:46.660> sort<00:03:47.290> of<00:03:48.090> whether<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.299> needs

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
taste and see sort of whether it needs

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.780 
taste and see sort of whether it needs
to<00:03:49.540> be<00:03:49.660> salt<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.080> into<00:03:50.560> any<00:03:50.920> sweetness<00:03:51.519> and

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.990 
to be salt and into any sweetness and
into<00:03:52.090> it<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.959> always<00:03:53.260> find<00:03:53.590> these<00:03:54.160> pre-made

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
into it and I always find these pre-made

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.430 
into it and I always find these pre-made
spices<00:03:55.959> can<00:03:56.890> be<00:03:57.220> quite<00:03:57.549> bitter<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:59.049> always

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
spices can be quite bitter and I always

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:33.770 
spices can be quite bitter and I always
like<00:04:00.069> to<00:04:00.099> add<00:04:00.430> some<00:04:00.730> sweetness<00:04:01.000> to<00:04:01.360> it

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.420 

so<00:04:34.780> if<00:04:35.080> you<00:04:35.230> were<00:04:35.380> cooking<00:04:35.950> these<00:04:36.040> to

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
so if you were cooking these to

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.150 
so if you were cooking these to
refrigerate<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.540> or<00:04:37.810> freeze<00:04:38.140> it<00:04:38.380> this<00:04:38.710> would

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
refrigerate it or freeze it this would

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.620 
refrigerate it or freeze it this would
be<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.400> point<00:04:39.580> that<00:04:39.760> is<00:04:40.030> ready

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
be the point that is ready

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.930 
be the point that is ready
you<00:04:41.200> don't<00:04:41.410> want<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:41.590> add<00:04:41.710> yogurt<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:42.730> and

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
you don't want to add yogurt to it and

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.030 
you don't want to add yogurt to it and
then<00:04:43.210> either<00:04:43.660> chair<00:04:44.050> down<00:04:44.260> freeze<00:04:44.680> it<00:04:44.890> and

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.550 
then either chair down freeze it and
have<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.220> reheat<00:04:45.760> it<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.930> yogurt<00:04:47.200> needs<00:04:47.440> to

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
have to reheat it so the yogurt needs to

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.580
