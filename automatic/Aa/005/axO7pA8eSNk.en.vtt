you just put it into the hybrid base and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.870 
you just put it into the hybrid base and
then<00:01:10.080> use<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> windows<00:01:11.100> 7<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> create

then use it as a windows 7 to create

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.359 
then use it as a windows 7 to create
content<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.960> next<00:01:13.290> question<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.189> can

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
content the next question is when we can

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.230 
content the next question is when we can
have<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.659> rest<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.439> world

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
have this in the rest of the world

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.149 
have this in the rest of the world
and<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.869> way<00:01:17.990> we're<00:01:18.170> answering<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:18.950> that

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
and the way we're answering that is that

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.219 
and the way we're answering that is that
right<00:01:19.369> now<00:01:19.520> we<00:01:19.579> want<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.939> make<00:01:20.060> sure<00:01:20.090> that<00:01:21.079> we

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
right now we want to make sure that we

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.830 
right now we want to make sure that we
develop<00:01:21.799> a<00:01:21.979> good<00:01:22.460> echo<00:01:22.700> system<00:01:22.939> in<00:01:23.240> China<00:01:23.540> we

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
develop a good echo system in China we

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.690 
develop a good echo system in China we
have<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.140> consumer<00:01:24.680> presence<00:01:25.159> there<00:01:25.430> and

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
have the consumer presence there and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.420 
have the consumer presence there and
make<00:01:26.360> it<00:01:26.390> successful<00:01:26.659> lunch<00:01:27.380> in<00:01:27.710> China<00:01:28.070> and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
make it successful lunch in China and

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.789 
make it successful lunch in China and
then<00:01:28.939> as<00:01:29.030> we<00:01:29.210> develop<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.259> learn<00:01:30.770> from

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
then as we develop that and learn from

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.100 
then as we develop that and learn from
that<00:01:31.220> then<00:01:31.610> we<00:01:31.789> can<00:01:31.970> then<00:01:32.180> figure<00:01:32.600> out<00:01:32.659> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
that then we can then figure out the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.630 
that then we can then figure out the
customer<00:01:33.560> requirements<00:01:34.159> in<00:01:34.250> each<00:01:34.369> of<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
customer requirements in each of the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.800 
customer requirements in each of the
regions<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.360> then<00:01:35.720> how<00:01:35.899> we<00:01:35.960> then<00:01:36.470> fan<00:01:37.250> out<00:01:37.280> and

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
regions and then how we then fan out and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.060 
regions and then how we then fan out and
provide<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.049> products<00:01:39.500> in<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.649> rest<00:01:39.830> of<00:01:39.950> the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
provide the products in the rest of the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.639 
provide the products in the rest of the
world<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.939> key<00:01:41.179> is<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:41.479> Lenovo<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.200> going<00:01:42.500> to
