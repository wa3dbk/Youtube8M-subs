00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
and I feel like I'm not wearing any

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.490 
and I feel like I'm not wearing any
foundation<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:29.149> and<00:01:29.570> it's<00:01:29.960> very<00:01:30.170> moisturizing

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
foundation on and it's very moisturizing

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.830 
foundation on and it's very moisturizing
I<00:01:31.280> have<00:01:31.670> combination<00:01:32.210> skin<00:01:32.240> but<00:01:32.689> it's

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
I have combination skin but it's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.389 
I have combination skin but it's
definitely<00:01:33.140> more<00:01:33.439> toward<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:33.979> dry<00:01:34.159> side

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
definitely more toward to the dry side

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.880 
definitely more toward to the dry side
and<00:01:34.909> it's<00:01:35.090> not<00:01:35.149> because<00:01:35.329> I'm<00:01:35.570> lacking<00:01:35.810> oil<00:01:36.229> but

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
and it's not because I'm lacking oil but

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.530 
and it's not because I'm lacking oil but
it's<00:01:37.009> because<00:01:37.340> I'm<00:01:37.490> lacking<00:01:37.670> moisture<00:01:38.060> so

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
it's because I'm lacking moisture so

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.690 
it's because I'm lacking moisture so
this<00:01:38.659> one<00:01:38.810> really<00:01:39.020> moisturizes<00:01:39.649> my<00:01:39.799> skin<00:01:40.130> it

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
this one really moisturizes my skin it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.420 
this one really moisturizes my skin it
fits<00:01:41.030> my<00:01:41.210> nilla<00:01:41.450> skin<00:01:41.780> tone<00:01:41.930> perfectly<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:42.979> it

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.340 
eyebrow game because my eyebrows looked
like<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:52.610> was<00:01:52.640> drawing<00:01:52.969> it<00:01:53.180> on<00:01:53.240> with<00:01:53.719> markers

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
like I was drawing it on with markers

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.679 
like I was drawing it on with markers
and<00:01:54.740> then<00:01:55.130> just<00:01:55.369> setting<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.759> with<00:01:55.969> a<00:01:56.149> Crayola

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
and then just setting it with a Crayola

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.260 
and then just setting it with a Crayola
crayon<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.350> just<00:01:57.829> couldn't<00:01:58.250> do<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.399> anymore<00:01:58.549> so

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
crayon I just couldn't do it anymore so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.440 
crayon I just couldn't do it anymore so
I<00:01:59.930> went<00:02:00.140> over<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.380> sephora<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.070> i<00:02:01.610> got<00:02:02.210> the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.529 
I went over to sephora and i got the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
chip thing i've actually had this for a

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.029 
chip thing i've actually had this for a
while<00:02:07.640> i<00:02:07.880> think<00:02:08.119> i<00:02:08.149> got<00:02:08.300> it<00:02:08.360> back<00:02:08.630> in<00:02:08.860> was<00:02:09.860> it

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
while i think i got it back in was it

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.720 
while i think i got it back in was it
like<00:02:10.220> februari<00:02:10.970> or<00:02:11.390> march<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.730> wasn't

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
like februari or march and I wasn't

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.430 
like februari or march and I wasn't
quite<00:02:13.910> sure<00:02:14.060> how<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.720> use<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.110> at<00:02:15.230> first

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
quite sure how to use it at first

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.130 
quite sure how to use it at first
because<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.920> typically<00:02:16.280> use<00:02:16.400> powder<00:02:17.019> which<00:02:18.019> is

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
because I typically use powder which is

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.300 
because I typically use powder which is
all<00:02:18.260> easier<00:02:18.620> for<00:02:18.830> me<00:02:18.950> but<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.670> gel<00:02:20.239> so

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
all easier for me but this is gel so

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.640 
all easier for me but this is gel so
you<00:02:21.610> only<00:02:21.790> really<00:02:22.180> need<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.540> little<00:02:22.900> bit<00:02:23.080> at<00:02:23.319> a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
you only really need a little bit at a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.589 
you only really need a little bit at a
time<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:24.220> fill<00:02:24.430> in<00:02:24.550> your<00:02:24.670> brows<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.450> was

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
time to fill in your brows and I was

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.360 
time to fill in your brows and I was
just<00:02:25.750> taking<00:02:26.050> chunks<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.800> looked<00:02:26.950> like<00:02:27.069> I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
just taking chunks and it looked like I

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.360 
just taking chunks and it looked like I
was<00:02:27.400> trying<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:28.060> do<00:02:28.420> water<00:02:28.750> painting<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.530> my

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
was trying to do water painting on my

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.979 
was trying to do water painting on my
eyebrows<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.300> wasn't<00:02:31.540> working<00:02:31.599> but<00:02:31.930> I

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
eyebrows so that wasn't working but I

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.089 
eyebrows so that wasn't working but I
finally<00:02:32.200> know<00:02:32.380> how<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.560> do<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:32.800> just<00:02:32.950> take<00:02:33.069> a

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
finally know how to do it just take a

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.559 
finally know how to do it just take a
little<00:02:33.220> bit<00:02:33.370> at<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.550> time<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.970> just<00:02:34.000> do<00:02:34.209> strokes

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
little bit at a time and just do strokes

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.360 
little bit at a time and just do strokes
and<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.020> I<00:02:35.050> use<00:02:35.380> this<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.980> fill<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.250> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
and so I use this just to fill in the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.120 
and so I use this just to fill in the
main<00:02:36.520> parts<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.880> my<00:02:36.940> eyebrows<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.660> then<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.769> go

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
main parts of my eyebrows and then I go

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.089 
main parts of my eyebrows and then I go
over<00:02:39.580> with<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.599> Anastasia<00:02:41.050> brow<00:02:41.500> Wiz<00:02:41.530> and

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
over with the Anastasia brow Wiz and

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.839 
over with the Anastasia brow Wiz and
this<00:02:42.880> one<00:02:43.150> is<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.890> Granite<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.220> really<00:02:45.400> sharpen

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
this one is in Granite to really sharpen

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.910 
this one is in Granite to really sharpen
off<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.090> edges<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.660> fill<00:02:46.870> in<00:02:47.019> some<00:02:47.769> of<00:02:47.830> those

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
off the edges and fill in some of those

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.380 
off the edges and fill in some of those
spaces<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.640> need<00:02:48.849> to<00:02:48.970> look<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> little<00:02:49.239> bit

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
spaces that need to look a little bit

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.880 
spaces that need to look a little bit
darker<00:02:49.599> to<00:02:50.080> give<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> little<00:02:50.410> bit<00:02:50.500> more<00:02:50.620> depth

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
darker to give a little bit more depth

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.180 
darker to give a little bit more depth
