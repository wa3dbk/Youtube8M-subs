00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.229

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.650
 lie in the back seat and cover yourself 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.220
 with this apple 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.980

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.880
 this maelstrom that you have created in 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.790
 members of your staff I think they have 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.500
 been exposed to situations of risk 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.490
