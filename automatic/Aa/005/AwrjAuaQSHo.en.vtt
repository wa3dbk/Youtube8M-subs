fracturing our community is dumb so you
know<00:03:07.470> basically<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.490> am<00:03:09.270> wondering<00:03:09.960> if<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:11.130> is

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
know basically I am wondering if this is

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.060 
know basically I am wondering if this is
an<00:03:11.460> opportunity<00:03:11.790> with<00:03:12.330> ultimate<00:03:12.840> edition<00:03:13.290> for

an opportunity with ultimate edition for

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.500 
an opportunity with ultimate edition for
the<00:03:14.880> coalition<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.780> actually<00:03:16.410> test<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:17.100> new<00:03:17.760> DLC

the coalition to actually test a new DLC

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.660 
the coalition to actually test a new DLC

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
model that does not include maps I don't

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.010 
model that does not include maps I don't
even<00:03:20.760> know<00:03:20.940> if<00:03:21.090> they're<00:03:21.210> going<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.900> know

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
even know if they're going to you know

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.640 
even know if they're going to you know
make<00:03:22.290> or<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.700> would<00:03:24.030> say<00:03:24.150> put<00:03:24.330> resources<00:03:25.320> into

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
make or I would say put resources into

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.500 
make or I would say put resources into
Ultimate<00:03:26.490> Edition<00:03:26.820> long<00:03:27.000> term<00:03:27.210> because<00:03:27.390> this

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
Ultimate Edition long term because this

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.360 
Ultimate Edition long term because this
game<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.900> really<00:03:28.230> just<00:03:28.620> placeholder<00:03:29.250> until

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
game is really just placeholder until

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.440 
game is really just placeholder until
years<00:03:29.820> war<00:03:30.090> for<00:03:30.330> comes<00:03:30.600> out<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:32.420> knowing<00:03:33.420> that

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
years war for comes out and knowing that

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.330 
years war for comes out and knowing that
I<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:34.110> there's<00:03:34.260> an<00:03:34.380> opportunity<00:03:34.470> for<00:03:34.980> them

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
I think there's an opportunity for them

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.750 
I think there's an opportunity for them
to<00:03:35.370> say<00:03:35.670> okay<00:03:36.180> well<00:03:36.900> let's<00:03:37.560> make<00:03:37.770> three<00:03:38.160> maps<00:03:38.400> 5

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
to say okay well let's make three maps 5

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.710 
to say okay well let's make three maps 5
maps<00:03:39.060> Tim<00:03:39.750> maps<00:03:39.990> however<00:03:40.380> many<00:03:40.500> they<00:03:40.710> can<00:03:40.980> and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
maps Tim maps however many they can and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.090 
maps Tim maps however many they can and
let's<00:03:42.720> give<00:03:42.900> them<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.560> community<00:03:43.950> for

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
let's give them to the community for

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.340 
let's give them to the community for
free<00:03:44.430> but<00:03:45.180> while<00:03:45.420> we<00:03:45.600> do<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:45.840> we<00:03:46.170> should

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
probably test if we made some custom

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.680 
probably test if we made some custom
characters<00:03:49.740> or<00:03:50.010> if<00:03:50.220> we<00:03:50.340> made<00:03:50.550> some<00:03:50.820> some

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
map route I'm definitely going to lay

into them

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.620 
into them
because<00:04:26.860> I<00:04:26.890> think<00:04:27.070> that's<00:04:27.400> like<00:04:28.300> I've<00:04:28.480> said

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
because I think that's like I've said

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.840 
because I think that's like I've said
before<00:04:28.690> dumb<00:04:29.260> so<00:04:29.620> this<00:04:30.310> is<00:04:30.460> an<00:04:30.580> opportunity

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
before dumb so this is an opportunity

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.880 
before dumb so this is an opportunity
for<00:04:31.180> them<00:04:31.420> that<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:32.020> really<00:04:32.200> test<00:04:32.500> and<00:04:32.740> see

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
for them that to really test and see

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.070 
for them that to really test and see
what<00:04:33.070> works<00:04:33.340> I<00:04:33.580> think<00:04:33.610> with<00:04:34.030> this<00:04:34.270> audience<00:04:34.510> of

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
what works I think with this audience of

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.760 
what works I think with this audience of
players<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.390> would<00:04:37.780> be<00:04:38.110> jumping<00:04:38.530> at<00:04:38.650> the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
players and I I would be jumping at the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.650 
players and I I would be jumping at the
bit<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:38.980> you<00:04:39.460> know<00:04:39.580> on<00:04:39.820> this<00:04:39.940> game<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.480> see<00:04:40.630> if

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
bit to you know on this game to see if

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.290 
bit to you know on this game to see if
it's<00:04:40.900> something<00:04:41.020> that's<00:04:41.320> feasible<00:04:42.300> versus

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
it's something that's feasible versus

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.270 
it's something that's feasible versus
waiting<00:04:43.900> until<00:04:44.200> Gears<00:04:44.410> of<00:04:44.470> War<00:04:44.590> for<00:04:44.920> and<00:04:45.160> then

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
waiting until Gears of War for and then

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.620 
waiting until Gears of War for and then
saying<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:45.550> don't<00:04:46.000> know<00:04:46.150> what<00:04:46.330> we're<00:04:46.450> going<00:04:46.540> to

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
saying I don't know what we're going to

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.840 
saying I don't know what we're going to
do<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.410> I'm<00:04:47.590> sure<00:04:47.770> they<00:04:47.890> probably<00:04:48.130> have<00:04:48.490> some

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
do and I'm sure they probably have some

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.570 
do and I'm sure they probably have some
type<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.120> general<00:04:49.720> plan<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:51.010> I<00:04:51.130> would<00:04:51.280> assume

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
type of general plan and I would assume

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.450 
type of general plan and I would assume
that<00:04:51.640> dlc<00:04:52.270> if<00:04:52.720> it's<00:04:53.290> going<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.710> be<00:04:53.890> a<00:04:53.920> thing<00:04:54.190> for

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
that dlc if it's going to be a thing for

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.340 
that dlc if it's going to be a thing for
ultimate<00:04:54.820> edition<00:04:55.120> has<00:04:55.330> already<00:04:55.690> began<00:04:56.140> and

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
ultimate edition has already began and

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.260 
ultimate edition has already began and
probably<00:04:56.710> began<00:04:57.130> probably<00:04:57.640> like<00:04:57.790> a<00:04:57.820> month<00:04:57.940> ago

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
probably began probably like a month ago

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.150 
probably began probably like a month ago
or<00:04:58.600> so<00:04:59.220> just<00:05:00.220> knowing<00:05:00.370> typical<00:05:01.150> game<00:05:01.390> design

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
or so just knowing typical game design

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.260 
or so just knowing typical game design
but<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.190> probably<00:05:03.460> even<00:05:03.700> started<00:05:04.090> way<00:05:04.210> before

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
but I probably even started way before

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.650 
but I probably even started way before
that<00:05:04.570> but<00:05:05.290> knowing<00:05:05.470> the<00:05:05.620> process<00:05:06.280> for

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
that but knowing the process for

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.110 
that but knowing the process for
building<00:05:07.660> a<00:05:07.840> game<00:05:08.520> very<00:05:09.520> interested<00:05:10.000> to<00:05:10.060> hear
