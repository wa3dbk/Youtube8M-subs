00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.140
 and very good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.710
 Welcome to a new video sale 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.259
 english welcome to patch number 4.8 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.169
 we have been in the 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.809
 season 4 and have had a few 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.869
 patches since it balances in this game 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.240
 really lately they are crowning 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.769
 the patches starting with one that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.349
 they made a pantheon that we will go to see 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.640
 later the general changes that 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.189
 have introduced in this country have been 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.019
 related to the agro of the towers 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.210
 because many times this does not work 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.370
 well and did really weird things 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.960
 as for example add characters that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.690
 they were in an invulnerable state as 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.000
 it can be fish on top of its trident or 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.420
 to use flash offensively or 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.360
 any kind of let's say out 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.940
 defensive made us create the tower 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.190
 in principle that style of books does not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.559
 they must be present 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.800
 leaving aside the general aspect of 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.850
 the change of this patch 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.410
 let's focus on the champions is a 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.640
 small patch in regard to 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.180
 books inelfe os is rather a pair 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.860
 focuses on one character and little else 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.210
 but good we started with brice kan that 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.410
 is the one that we have here in front bleeckere 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.940
 It's a character which was very 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.220
 punished in his day for being 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.080
 excessively offensive and very very 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.820
 decisive with its hooks that's why it 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.950
 punished both in the asses and in the 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.229
 mana cost so much that nor is played 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.000
 so that if there is so much of his bearing 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.190
 tremendously better than him that only 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.410
 I had the CV and little else they have done 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.690
 puppies for attempt to try 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.970
 to play again so reduce spending 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.530
 of mana both from zhouqu and from up to 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.570
 all levels to a total of 100 or 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.070
 will spend 100 mana for each of 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.020
 these skills will therefore return to 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.640
 rent up semac sears in the q because 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.890
 will spend the same both at level 1 and 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.649
 maximum level for me is a change 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.649
 really poor and I do not think we'll change 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.960
 to see it too total if they are 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.869
 seeing the brown beasts that is like their 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.869
 because as morgana as brawn as 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.610
 3 really scram will have to make a 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.410
 couple of changes more so that it is again 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.660
 seen in the competitive one if you are 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.759
 he sees those other champions who have 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.530
 received a dull exchange the only thing that 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.390
 have done is that it increases the range and it 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.760
 reduce the animation time of your 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.680
 ultimate really crashes is a character 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.930
 not right now 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.170
 no room for the current goal I think 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.969
 that this change will not mean 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.469
 really nothing for me to do l so 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.569
 let's wait for more changes for this 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.569
 character that I like in my character 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.189
 the future and we will see it more often 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.260
 small group that they put a caciques 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.000
 very punished by nerves due to 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.739
 its high versatility that it has in the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.560
 game in fact you have given all your 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.120
 skills except her that there's no 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.819
 way of how to do it so you do not 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.439
 play and that the only change is broken 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.599
 what they have done to him this time is that 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.760
 that you see is subnormal has less cool 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.620
 down that its evolved so what 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.939
 only have done has been to balance both 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.879
 skills so you have the same 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:57.189
 worship really is a small change and 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.989
 let's hope that here six receives some 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.329
 small rolling so it does not mean 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.709
 So we find it not so difficult 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.709
 balance to roy that does not come out broken 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.959
 a metal in predominantly 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.060
 very killer means very easily 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.160
 to clean the lines with a lot 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.900
 mobility to zahar has no gap in 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.430
 this goal and will not have it with the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.540
 change with the introduction this patch 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.370
 that the only thing they have done that has been 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.620
 reduce its mana cost PSUV 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.600
 total total which does not solve 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.400
 none of his problems that was the 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.110
 maximum cost this does reduce a 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.790
 little bit but mobility still has 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.040
 null so I think that although this 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.660
 change come for good we will not see this 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.910
 character in the competed during a 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.310
 weather 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.810
 we are in front of the greatest shame of 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.700
 the history of league of legends 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.680
 at least what I remember and is the 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.200
 ugly nerd to pantheon not notified in the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.480
 4.7 you know that in the previous patch to 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.690
 pantheon I got here very pretty with 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.240
 of dragonslayer but in turn 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.520
 introduced an ugly nerd in which he 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.650
 it came out in the patch note and they had 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.960
 that be the same users that saw 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.120
 as his favorite champion did not work 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.440
 as they were used to it that has 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.540
 made rivers because the only thing he has done is 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.790
 say okay I do not put it in 4.7 what 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.010
 we put in 4.8 although this is based on 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.740
 the ugly the only thing they have done is that 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.240
 the animation of the ultimate you can not 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.940
 throw any skill until 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.370
 pantheon does not fall on the ground so 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.670
 so much what is your 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.310
 potential when it comes to winning and the factor 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.020
 surprise is totally left to a 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.880
 side on the other hand to compensate what 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.990
 they say host since the animation already 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.610
 that we do well the animation that 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.610
 agree well with the fall of the damage not 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.760
 that well had jerryd very good work yes 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.130
 Sir 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.250
 the biggest ugly nerd in this patch goes 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.160
 related to short here and a very mid 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.230
 versatile of this in this last this 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.210
 last one is playing me quite powerful in 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.700
 the mid with a skillful very tank and very 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.860
 oriented to the utility with very few 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.590
 counter with a lot of hardness with 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.660
 quite hurt to really tell you really 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.210
 he was a total character and with many 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.920
 variations so I what the only thing that 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.440
 has done has been in the fear les zhouqu 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.930
 is well the most oriented skills 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.360
 to harm and utility in the sense 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.980
 offensive so the first thing that has 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.020
 fact has been to reduce the damage of zhouqu 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.760
 quite fairly beast 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.770
 that you have a zhouqu idea in the 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.620
 last level previously had 200 of 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.940
 damage now has 140 to compensate what 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.130
 that has made river is that the reduction of 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.080
 cool down when hitting the enemies pass a 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.360
 10 to a 17 meaning it has less damage 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.730
 but his ass reduction looks very 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.070
 increased so you can pay more and 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:36.100
 on the other hand they make it go up cost that 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.760
 cost 50 mana for each time 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.130
 we hit the enemies 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.230
 this I do not know if it will mean the end of 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.690
 Soracá Toba points out that, above all, 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.090
 works mit because I abused a lot of 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.770
 many things but still his faculty of 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.540
 hitler is still very present so 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.540
 both its role and support I think that 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.490
 It is still as viable or even 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.900
 in some compositions like mit me 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.670
 I think that even if you reduce your 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.430
 damage I think it got stung more for its 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.210
 faculty of tam that hitler that for another 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.890
 thing 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.050
 we will see we will see I think they are a couple 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.630
 of weeks that we see the changes in 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.670
 action we can not decide one thing u 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.710
 another although everything points although it goes a 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.800
 way a bit negative I think that 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.680
 deserved the nerve without a doubt 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.900
 Last but not least have 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.460
 introduced a small visual change in 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.400
 sink that the only thing they have done is 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.650
 introduce an indicator on your stand to 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.509
 let's see the duration in which that 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.400
 character or that minion will not be returned to 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.960
 have studied a little circle in 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.000
 the feet of each character so that 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.069
 let's control a little bit the time that 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.289
 We shall soon return to study anything 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.690
 more is just a visual aid 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.580
 for all those players not beaten 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.069
 in the character or that are not 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.960
 accustomed to playing together may know 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:53.289
 if you can study or not 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.210
 this is patch 4.8 really a 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:57.550
 patch a little bit and its use beyond 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.430
 the nerves is now here and the rest 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.130
 They are small bufos or small nerves 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.050
 more oriented to minimally balance 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.870
 that change big things in the metal and 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.699
 current but in action introduced 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.099
 also minor changes like for example 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:14.979
 they have fixed a ship in the ditch the 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:17.259
 which interrupted skills which 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:18.940
 should not interrupt as for example the 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:21.160
 last and from harvard or the last internal 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:24.220
 to fight and also do juani with the q 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.050
 which the load to the load but not 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.539
 did not cam on enemies with a size 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.729
 very huge as a for example a 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:33.490
 collides with six charges oncca or a pack 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.560
 not much life to the non cab apart 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.169
 of it will also introduce throughout 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.030
 of this the new one for the mirror mode 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:42.190
 match is to say the all with the same 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.020
 champion but this time all 10 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.090
 players with the same champion either 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.280

 penta kill icon although there is not much 

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:55.990
 information about him I think he's 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.810
