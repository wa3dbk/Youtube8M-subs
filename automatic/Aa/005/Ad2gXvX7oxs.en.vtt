00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.010
 hi friends my name is khan i am a student 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.990
 by juan domínguez and I'm from chile 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.480
 Starting a business is like submitting to 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.030
 a great physical effort to what is 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.490
 called an exercise at high intervals 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.230
 intensity is sure there is a lot of pain 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.420
 As the times you lose is the money 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.520
 that you invested, there is a desire to give up 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.130
 like when customers and the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.320
 opportunity does not appear and when training 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.350
 in front of other people there is fear of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.930
 embarrassment of failing they also work 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.420
 many hours and well is the contact and the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.160
 admiration of his family but if the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.320
 person is constant with this 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.470
 training is going to look and it's going to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.329
 feel stronger more secure will have 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.730
 self-confidence and much more 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.480
 energy then the one that is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.220
 committed can be your own boss 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.649
 will win the constant challenges that 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.420
 exist when undertaking and will enjoy together 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.700

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.390

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.250
 and effective to invest in the stock 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.280
 values ​​I started searching the internet 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.170
 technical stock exchange analysis and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.690
 I found several that offered formats 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.760
 face-to-face and online the one that called me the 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.940
 attention was the page of Juan Domínguez 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.040

 superior to everything I had found 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.429
 that were more classic systems then I 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.410
 I decided to take the Juan course 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.869
