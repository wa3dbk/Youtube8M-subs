00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
these are the results from the CT please

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.070 
these are the results from the CT please
take<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.099> look<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.580> number<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.269> aneurysms<00:00:09.929> have

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
take a look a number of aneurysms have

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.440 
take a look a number of aneurysms have
been<00:00:10.230> detected<00:00:10.580> some<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.820> blood<00:00:12.030> vessels

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
been detected some of the blood vessels

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.850 
been detected some of the blood vessels
have<00:00:12.540> already<00:00:12.900> burst<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.440> are<00:00:13.530> hemorrhaging

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
have already burst and are hemorrhaging

have already burst and are hemorrhaging
heavily<00:00:14.490> inside<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.000> brain<00:00:15.320> first<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:16.890> must

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
heavily inside the brain first we must

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.070 
heavily inside the brain first we must
clear<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.520> excess<00:00:18.060> blood<00:00:18.359> from<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> area

then<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.130> need<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.310> treat<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.699> aneurysms

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
then we need to treat the aneurysms

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.070 
then we need to treat the aneurysms
