00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
my Furies I'm just throwing them out

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.490 
my Furies I'm just throwing them out
there<00:01:41.130> okay<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:42.479> thing<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.840> feel<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
there okay one thing I feel like the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.990 
there okay one thing I feel like the
gana<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.920> most<00:01:44.130> likely<00:01:44.310> either<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.610> human

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
gana is most likely either a human

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.609 
gana is most likely either a human
experimentation<00:01:45.630> they<00:01:45.960> experimented<00:01:46.560> on

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
experimentation they experimented on

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950 
experimentation they experimented on
human<00:01:46.799> informed<00:01:47.399> Agana<00:01:47.700> there<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.450> couple

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
human informed Agana there are couple

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.600 
human informed Agana there are couple
sent<00:01:49.259> us<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:49.799> reason<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.189> remember

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
sent us for some reason if I remember

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.889 
sent us for some reason if I remember
correctly<00:01:50.820> placentas<00:01:51.390> are<00:01:51.509> supposed<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.810> be

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
correctly placentas are supposed to be

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
correctly placentas are supposed to be
in<00:01:51.990> mothers<00:01:52.350> okay<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.950> these<00:01:53.369> ganas<00:01:53.729> take<00:01:53.909> on

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
in mothers okay and these ganas take on

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.030 
in mothers okay and these ganas take on
human<00:01:54.240> force<00:01:54.509> when<00:01:54.689> they<00:01:54.780> exorbitant

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
human force when they exorbitant

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.039 
human force when they exorbitant
so<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.640> really<00:01:56.969> weird<00:01:57.149> most<00:01:57.540> likely<00:01:57.869> either

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
so it's really weird most likely either

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.810 
so it's really weird most likely either
it's<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.439> some<00:01:58.799> form<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.070> organism<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.790> a

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
it's just some form of organism like a

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.459 
it's just some form of organism like a
virus<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.420> parasite<00:02:00.840> something<00:02:01.140> gets<00:02:01.259> inside

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
virus a parasite something gets inside

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.050 
virus a parasite something gets inside
of<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> person<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.040> expanded<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.610> first<00:02:02.880> time

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
mystery a lot and that's what's dragging

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.679 
mystery a lot and that's what's dragging
me<00:03:11.739> in<00:03:11.980> into<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.400> universe<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.939> Cydonia<00:03:13.269> and

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
me in into this universe of Cydonia and

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.690 
me in into this universe of Cydonia and
that's<00:03:14.139> just<00:03:14.590> really<00:03:14.889> unique<00:03:15.310> oh<00:03:15.459> yeah

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
that's just really unique oh yeah

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.789 
that's just really unique oh yeah
speaking<00:03:15.909> of<00:03:16.299> Cydonia<00:03:16.689> we<00:03:17.199> find<00:03:17.470> out<00:03:17.650> that

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
speaking of Cydonia we find out that

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.460 
speaking of Cydonia we find out that
there's<00:03:18.120> 500<00:03:19.120> other<00:03:19.299> colonies<00:03:19.989> like<00:03:20.109> ships

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
there's 500 other colonies like ships

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.259 
there's 500 other colonies like ships
like<00:03:20.650> Cydonia<00:03:21.099> I<00:03:21.280> thought<00:03:21.609> this<00:03:21.790> entire

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
like Cydonia I thought this entire

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.819 
like Cydonia I thought this entire
series<00:03:22.449> could<00:03:22.690> just<00:03:22.900> wrap<00:03:23.079> around<00:03:23.139> one<00:03:23.530> ship

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
series could just wrap around one ship

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.059 
series could just wrap around one ship
but<00:03:24.280> there<00:03:24.400> was<00:03:24.519> other<00:03:24.669> survivors<00:03:25.239> another

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
but there was other survivors another

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.710 
but there was other survivors another
499<00:03:27.069> ships<00:03:27.489> that<00:03:27.879> are<00:03:27.940> floating<00:03:28.479> out<00:03:28.540> in<00:03:28.689> space

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
499 ships that are floating out in space

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.539 
499 ships that are floating out in space
somewhere<00:03:29.199> probably<00:03:29.680> fought<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.189> gone<00:03:30.340> are

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
somewhere probably fought and gone are

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:31.649 
somewhere probably fought and gone are
probably<00:03:30.879> dead<00:03:31.090> we<00:03:31.299> don't<00:03:31.449> know<00:03:31.540> what

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
probably dead we don't know what

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.240 
probably dead we don't know what
happened<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.079> them<00:03:32.169> but<00:03:32.530> there's<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.769> total<00:03:33.159> of
