00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.620 
it's it's an absolute myth that men
don't<00:03:33.490> want<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.880> talk<00:03:34.090> about<00:03:34.120> their<00:03:34.600> feelings

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
don't want to talk about their feelings

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.450 
don't want to talk about their feelings
I<00:03:35.310> think<00:03:36.310> when<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.610> man<00:03:36.850> feels<00:03:37.210> safe<00:03:38.250> like<00:03:39.250> when

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
I think when a man feels safe like when

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.900 
I think when a man feels safe like when
a<00:03:39.670> man<00:03:39.910> knows<00:03:40.300> that<00:03:40.930> he<00:03:41.740> can<00:03:41.980> risk<00:03:42.340> saying

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
a man knows that he can risk saying

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.620 
a man knows that he can risk saying
what's<00:03:43.240> true<00:03:43.540> for<00:03:43.780> him<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.140> not<00:03:44.380> be<00:03:44.410> judged

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
what's true for him and not be judged

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.970 
what's true for him and not be judged
men<00:03:46.630> will<00:03:46.810> open<00:03:47.110> up<00:03:47.230> they'll<00:03:47.470> talk<00:03:47.740> about

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
men will open up they'll talk about

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.700 
men will open up they'll talk about
anything<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.720> discover<00:03:49.720> they're<00:03:50.140> not<00:03:50.380> alone

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
anything and discover they're not alone

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.980 
anything and discover they're not alone
that<00:03:51.010> there<00:03:51.490> are<00:03:51.970> other<00:03:52.090> men<00:03:52.330> who<00:03:52.660> have<00:03:52.960> the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
that there are other men who have the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.640 
that there are other men who have the
same<00:03:53.380> kind<00:03:53.800> of<00:03:53.980> experiences<00:03:54.670> as<00:03:54.820> them<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.650> can

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
same kind of experiences as them and can

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.730 
same kind of experiences as them and can
actually<00:03:56.830> learn<00:03:57.520> from<00:03:57.550> other<00:03:57.970> men<00:03:58.240> in

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
actually learn from other men in

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:19.240 
actually learn from other men in
powerful<00:03:59.740> ways

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.330 

when<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.489> man<00:04:20.820> knows<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.870> he's<00:04:22.440> fully<00:04:22.919> loved

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
when a man knows that he's fully loved

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.500 
when a man knows that he's fully loved
by<00:04:23.729> another<00:04:24.000> man

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.930 
by another man
I<00:04:24.540> mean<00:04:24.900> accepted<00:04:25.530> what<00:04:26.070> I<00:04:26.130> mean<00:04:26.280> by<00:04:26.430> love<00:04:26.669> like
