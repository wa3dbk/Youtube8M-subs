00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.610
 new video of greatness hour 5 online the 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.160
 today I am going to bring you a new 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.900
 glitch with the update 1.0 point 6 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.850
 of the big bom pack that many of you 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.130
 they were not asking for yesterday 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.710
 I climbed them saw how to duplicate the cars 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.390
 but now they want to know how to have 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.609
 infinite money how to get money 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.529
 free and well this is very easy here 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.779
 As you can see it brings a very beautiful car 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.640
 we are going to have to get a car 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.899
 stolen, I recommend you steal it 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.789
 because it 's the easiest for what 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.859
 spend money I got tired here for a 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.539
 measured of franklin in the campaign and 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.070
 robben be any car of these that 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.100
 see that obviously look good 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.230
 robinson the gauntlet an elephant buffalo 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.789
 of franklin obviously one that seems 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.250
 as the core of concord see as the 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.410
 camaro see the clear ground you can 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.850
 buying another way is buying the for 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.980
 I recommend that you buy the 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.980
 engraved gauntlet or cars that cost 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.170
 less than 50 thousand dollars or gas now 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.519
 they see it different here because the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.829
 internet page I saw it from the mode of 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.890
 eye campaign have to buy cars 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.300
 that cost less than 50 thousand dollars with 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.700
 it costs 50 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.320
 3.1 cents can no longer do the 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.120
 cliché the only thing they will have to do 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.580
 now it is to take it to the saints 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.020
 costs closest to your favorite and how 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.990
 You can see here at the beginning of the video 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.820
 they give me 14 thousand miserable dollars for 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.250
 this vehicle what we are going to have to 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.640
 do is configure this car to the maximum 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.650
 horn shield painted wheels lights all 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.290
 everything I try to buy the most expensive 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.060
 I told them that they were doing it with a 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.740
 car less than 50 thousand because of what 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.440
 otherwise it will not let us sell the 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.760
 vehicle once they run out 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.610
 also I recommend that you put 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:47.080
 bulletproof tires and all that we're going to see 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.330
 how much gives us for this vehicle 70 thousand 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.370
 965 and that it lacks more armor and 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.560
 other things then it's not so good 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.080
 I do not recommend this buffalo much 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.870
 there are cars that give us 105 thousand 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.150
 it seems to me that the down 3 gives us 115 thousand 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.700
 If you buffalo and buffalo 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.560
 franklin do it with that car you look at the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.590
 franklin buffalo is the best for 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.510
 do this give 125 thousand I think it's 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.489
 the maximum now what is the cliché 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.720
 when we go out we just go to 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.340
 park wherever 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.130
 here he taught that the card version 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.170
 online 1.06 we will appear anywhere 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.730
 not park where it's forgiveness and in the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.620
 place of appearance will be in 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.090
 property the only thing that we will have to 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.460
 do is change it to last location 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.500
 once we have changed we left 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.510
 so that the medium is saved we go to 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.300
 go again to gesta online and we are going to 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.310
 abandon gta online eye do not have to 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.050
 do nothing different from gray and the only thing 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.300
 and more important is that they have to do 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.250
 everything very fast once it enters 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.170
 then after they can squeeze start 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.420
 to go to the pause menu we 're going to 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.130
 go to getafe line play online and in 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.930
 a session ahead 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.640
 eye I do not know if from now it matters but I 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.140
 it seems that from the moment where 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.030
 you are returning to the campaign and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.250
 going back in they have to do everything 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.810
 this fast and when I say all this 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.720
 I just mean things 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.300
 when we put on not to that when 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.190
 we drive and all that 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.900
 once we have entered they go to 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.880
 appear to be driving inside your 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.620
 vehicle can appear here where I 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.390
 I'm on the other side no matter what 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.910
 important is that they appear within your 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.290
 vehicle outside does not matter once either 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.760
 that we enter remember that now that 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.740
 we enter is very important no longer 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.020
 modify anything if we modify things already 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.850
 we will not be able to do anything now after 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.950
 Who does this thing consist of when 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.710
 sell we are going to go to gta online and 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.330
 change character but very very fast is 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.950
 why he shows it right now on camera 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.140
 slow because it might be a bit 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.790
 fast now how can you see now 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.560
 let's give sell and give insurance that 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.240
 wants to sell this vehicle we tighten it 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.800
 there then then we squeeze it to us 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.390
 let's go to be that is online then 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.150
 we are going to change the character and what 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.940
 we will do as quickly as possible 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.010
 may this is the essential part of 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.960
 glitch nicas this works well you 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.760
 they do it fast if they do not do it fast no 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.770
 will work once they enter the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.870
 character screen so much what 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.610
 faster than they can put him if 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.230
 they have many characters, so try 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.600
 that his character is a student or whatever 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.160
 for faster put it to try 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.320
 put on because there are many people that 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.660
 they make a mega fail and delete their 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.960
 character then if you delete it if you 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.440
 I was 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.300
 it is not the fault forgive me something 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.310
 but do not put me try not to put 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.050
 and square for nothing works for xbox 360 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.950
 and for playstation3 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.420
 now as you can see here I have 127 thousand 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.640
 138 dollars that is a quantity 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.700
 exaggerated video if it were true if 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.260
 out of youtube 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.000
 but hey once he's here and what 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.320
 can do as many times as they want now 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.570
 I want you to do this is very important 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.550
 because here I was wrong pointed he quoted and 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.290
 even so the video came out as you can see 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.330
 let's re-enter remember no 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.490
 modify anything of the vehicle simply 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.050
 we're going to go to the sell tab and 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.260
 let's do everything we did other 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.260
 time 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.550
 now as you can see I went to people 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.349
 online and once in gestaron lines I 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.300
 I made a mistake and put him in options for 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:00.520
 change me time I had done it to 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.860
 purpose to eat me time and to 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.530
 show that if they were late, the 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.900
 glitch for my good luck and my bad 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.060
 luck works the cliché I do not know in what 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.220
 it is very good how many seconds there 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.410
 of speed but if you realize here 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.569
 I have again the vehicle there are here about 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.250
 fucking gringos I have to admit it 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.110
 they were spending is the bad part of 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.000
 this saying that if they appear to you 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.039
 imbeciles like these who want them 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.229
 kill is just going to be a bit 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.199
 Castro or try to kill them I killed the 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.819
 damn gringo and it will solve all the 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.190
 problem but how can you see the car 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:35.229
 if it was there again the cliché 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.240
 it worked can do it again how many 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.830
 Sometimes you just want to remember to try 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.409
 to do as fast as possible that 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.389
 can all this even be going to have 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.759
 infinite money how many times do you want 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:47.199
 obviously do not overdo it or gas 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.229
 try to get more than 10 million 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:53.259
 because they do not go and no, I do not hear they're going 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.150
 in but to try not to avoid that 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.009
 you are the first ones do not get 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.550
 more than 10 million dollars with 5 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.500
 millions 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.090
 well once you have had enough 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.880
 to do this is just go to your 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.410
 or ATM cell and 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.850
 enter all your money that you 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.300
 have as you can see I do not dawn 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:12.160
 three times and I got 269 thousand pesos a 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.200
 Once you have done this simply 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.480
 we are going to store the vehicle at 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.980
 garage you want it or we leave 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.020
 the online card game to be 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.640
 saved the progress and that's how easy it is 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.600
 this unit equally gates is more 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.380
 they want to know about this new 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.090
