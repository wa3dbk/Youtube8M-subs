00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
see what sort of horsepower we get out

of that I just love nitrous man so let's

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.420 
of that I just love nitrous man so let's
head<00:04:08.129> into<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.430> engine<00:04:08.669> hood<00:04:08.790> let's<00:04:09.269> go

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.560 

so<00:04:15.430> we're<00:04:15.549> here<00:04:15.700> in<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.090> engine<00:04:16.299> room<00:04:16.329> we

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
so we're here in the engine room we

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.090 
so we're here in the engine room we
finally<00:04:16.870> got<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.079> engine<00:04:17.199> fired<00:04:17.590> up<00:04:17.799> thanks

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
finally got the engine fired up thanks

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.319 
finally got the engine fired up thanks
to<00:04:18.130> Steve<00:04:18.459> who<00:04:18.639> has<00:04:18.729> done<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:18.880> wonderful<00:04:18.940> job

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.569 
to Steve who has done a wonderful job
now<00:04:19.630> we've<00:04:19.780> got<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:19.989> moderate<00:04:20.709> camshaft<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.430> a

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
now we've got a moderate camshaft and a

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.219 
now we've got a moderate camshaft and a
conservative<00:04:22.150> compression<00:04:22.630> ratio<00:04:22.930> so<00:04:23.110> we're

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
conservative compression ratio so we're

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.409 
conservative compression ratio so we're
expecting<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.740> high<00:04:23.979> 400<00:04:24.669> horsepower<00:04:25.000> mark

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
a hydraulic roller set up so let's take

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:49.610 
a hydraulic roller set up so let's take
a<00:04:32.080> look

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.010 

the<00:04:50.550> engine<00:04:50.760> sounds<00:04:50.790> great<00:04:51.270> Steve<00:04:51.570> that's<00:04:51.900> a

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
the engine sounds great Steve that's a

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.110 
the engine sounds great Steve that's a
start<00:04:52.290> but<00:04:52.860> looking<00:04:53.580> at<00:04:53.639> the<00:04:53.729> numbers<00:04:54.000> here

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
start but looking at the numbers here

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.510 
start but looking at the numbers here
that's<00:04:54.330> moving<00:04:54.930> more<00:04:55.169> than<00:04:55.260> we<00:04:55.320> expected<00:04:55.770> you

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
that's moving more than we expected you

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.680 
that's moving more than we expected you
know<00:04:56.610> it<00:04:56.669> wasn't<00:04:56.820> for<00:04:57.000> just<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.210> few<00:04:57.330> years<00:04:57.510> ago

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
know it wasn't for just a few years ago

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.030 
know it wasn't for just a few years ago
we're<00:04:57.870> 500<00:04:58.050> horsepower<00:04:58.560> was<00:04:58.830> a<00:04:58.860> real

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
we're 500 horsepower was a real

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.530 
we're 500 horsepower was a real
benchmark<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.699> then<00:04:59.820> took<00:04:59.940> a<00:05:00.090> custom-built

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
benchmark and then took a custom-built

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.290 
benchmark and then took a custom-built
engine<00:05:00.990> now<00:05:01.500> we<00:05:01.560> can<00:05:01.770> order<00:05:01.949> this<00:05:02.100> stuff

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
engine now we can order this stuff

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.420 
engine now we can order this stuff
bolted<00:05:03.300> together<00:05:03.419> and<00:05:03.840> make<00:05:03.960> 520<00:05:04.800> through<00:05:05.010> 24

horsepower<00:05:05.610> pretty<00:05:06.330> impressive<00:05:06.419> that's<00:05:07.020> very

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
horsepower pretty impressive that's very

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.510 
horsepower pretty impressive that's very
impressive<00:05:07.440> so<00:05:07.800> I<00:05:07.830> guess<00:05:08.010> it's<00:05:08.190> time<00:05:08.310> now<00:05:08.490> to

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
impressive so I guess it's time now to

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.570 
impressive so I guess it's time now to

thinking<00:05:29.699> that<00:05:29.789> with<00:05:29.910> 150<00:05:30.690> we<00:05:30.780> should<00:05:30.930> be<00:05:31.020> able

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
thinking that with 150 we should be able

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:43.540 
thinking that with 150 we should be able
to<00:05:31.199> make<00:05:31.289> 150<00:05:31.889> all<00:05:32.310> right<00:05:32.430> let's<00:05:32.669> do<00:05:32.820> it

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.480 

our<00:05:44.480> first<00:05:44.750> run<00:05:45.020> was<00:05:45.140> pretty<00:05:45.290> stout<00:05:45.770> but<00:05:46.340> for

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
our first run was pretty stout but for

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.070 
our first run was pretty stout but for
consistency<00:05:47.120> we<00:05:47.240> made<00:05:47.390> a<00:05:47.420> total<00:05:47.690> of<00:05:47.870> two

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
consistency we made a total of two

00:05:48.080 --> 00:06:00.080 
consistency we made a total of two
nitrous<00:05:48.530> runs

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.580 

sigh<00:06:01.090> we've<00:06:01.360> completed<00:06:01.719> a<00:06:01.870> to<00:06:02.050> not<00:06:02.229> just<00:06:02.409> run

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
sigh we've completed a to not just run

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:03.899 
sigh we've completed a to not just run
Steve<00:06:02.919> what<00:06:03.099> were<00:06:03.189> the<00:06:03.280> numbers<00:06:03.370> in<00:06:03.669> the<00:06:03.789> end

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
Steve what were the numbers in the end

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.600 
Steve what were the numbers in the end
well<00:06:04.900> in<00:06:05.020> 150<00:06:05.740> horshack<00:06:06.129> we<00:06:06.310> were<00:06:06.400> able<00:06:06.490> to

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
well in 150 horshack we were able to

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.369 
well in 150 horshack we were able to
make<00:06:06.789> an<00:06:06.969> additional<00:06:07.629> hundred<00:06:07.719> and<00:06:07.990> forty-six

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:08.379 
make an additional hundred and forty-six

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:10.379 
make an additional hundred and forty-six
horsepower<00:06:08.919> but<00:06:09.580> after<00:06:09.699> looking<00:06:09.909> at<00:06:10.090> the<00:06:10.210> data

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
horsepower but after looking at the data

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.450 
horsepower but after looking at the data
I<00:06:10.569> saw<00:06:10.810> that<00:06:10.930> we<00:06:11.050> were<00:06:11.080> actually<00:06:11.289> really<00:06:12.159> very

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
I saw that we were actually really very

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.279 
I saw that we were actually really very
conservative<00:06:13.090> on<00:06:13.180> the<00:06:13.270> air<00:06:13.389> fuel<00:06:13.569> ratio<00:06:13.719> so<00:06:14.259> I

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
conservative on the air fuel ratio so I

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.439 
conservative on the air fuel ratio so I
felt<00:06:14.590> like<00:06:14.680> we<00:06:14.860> could<00:06:14.979> maybe<00:06:15.189> quote<00:06:16.060> cheat<00:06:16.330> the

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
felt like we could maybe quote cheat the

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.330 
felt like we could maybe quote cheat the
system<00:06:16.629> a<00:06:16.870> little<00:06:16.900> bit<00:06:17.199> if<00:06:17.289> you<00:06:17.379> will<00:06:17.529> so<00:06:18.159> went

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
system a little bit if you will so went

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.529 
system a little bit if you will so went
out<00:06:18.400> and<00:06:18.520> warm<00:06:18.669> the<00:06:18.789> bottle<00:06:19.090> up<00:06:19.180> and<00:06:19.330> added

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.539 
out and warm the bottle up and added

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:21.420 
out and warm the bottle up and added
another<00:06:19.749> 100<00:06:20.080> psi<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:20.620> it<00:06:20.919> left<00:06:21.099> the<00:06:21.189> fuel

another 100 psi to it left the fuel

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.339 
another 100 psi to it left the fuel

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:23.349 
pressure where it was and we were

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.070 
pressure where it was and we were
rewarded<00:06:24.009> with<00:06:24.340> a<00:06:24.400> 702<00:06:25.389> horse<00:06:25.569> power<00:06:25.810> pole
