00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
to set that to true and so that they can

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.540 
to set that to true and so that they can
only<00:02:28.880> travel<00:02:29.300> from<00:02:29.570> stations<00:02:30.019> you<00:02:30.170> need<00:02:30.320> to

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
set that to true and coverage when I go

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.900 
set that to true and coverage when I go
that<00:02:33.140> later<00:02:33.350> in<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.560> bit<00:02:33.709> but<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.640> create<00:02:34.850> a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
that later in a bit but to create a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.310 
that later in a bit but to create a
station<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.420> dt<00:02:35.750> stepped<00:02:36.820> duty<00:02:37.820> sets<00:02:38.540> down<00:02:38.660> and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
station is dt stepped duty sets down and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.560 
station is dt stepped duty sets down and
in<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.530> name<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.709> station<00:02:40.420> remove<00:02:41.420> the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
in the name of station remove the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.830 
in the name of station remove the
station<00:02:42.080> by<00:02:42.200> doing<00:02:42.500> dt<00:02:42.890> r<00:02:43.130> n<00:02:43.370> steps<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.510> then

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
station by doing dt r n steps and then

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.150 
station by doing dt r n steps and then
the<00:02:45.320> name<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.890> station<00:02:46.040> again<00:02:46.690> ok<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.230> we

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
the name of the station again ok so we

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.860 
the name of the station again ok so we
also<00:02:49.310> want<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.790> set<00:02:49.970> destination<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.750> now

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
also want to set destination so now

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.539 
also want to set destination so now
we've<00:02:51.019> got<00:02:51.140> our<00:02:53.650> station<00:02:54.650> we<00:02:55.220> want<00:02:55.430> the

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
we've got our station we want the

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.699 
we've got our station we want the
destinations<00:02:56.060> for<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:56.330> station<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.200> go<00:02:57.350> so

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
destinations for this station to go so

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.810 
destinations for this station to go so
let's<00:02:57.940> create<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.090> station<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:01.400> creates<00:03:01.730> it

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
let's create a station this creates it

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.630 
let's create a station this creates it
over<00:03:02.060> here<00:03:02.269> on<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.540> tree

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
over here on this tree

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.710 
over here on this tree
so<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:06.050> know<00:03:06.110> type<00:03:06.319> dt<00:03:06.800> space<00:03:07.220> set<00:03:07.610> desk<00:03:08.180> and

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
so you know type dt space set desk and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.300 
so you know type dt space set desk and
then<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.170> name<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.560> destination<00:03:10.040> finesse

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
then the name of the destination finesse

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.870 
then the name of the destination finesse
a<00:03:10.430> tree<00:03:11.470> okay<00:03:12.550> so<00:03:13.550> now<00:03:14.380> if<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.620> was<00:03:15.830> mounting<00:03:16.280> on

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
a tree okay so now if I was mounting on

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.990 
a tree okay so now if I was mounting on
a<00:03:17.120> dragon<00:03:17.680> I'll<00:03:18.680> be<00:03:18.860> able<00:03:19.040> to<00:03:19.130> go<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.670> tree

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
a dragon I'll be able to go to that tree

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.270 
a dragon I'll be able to go to that tree
location<00:03:20.450> so<00:03:20.750> let's<00:03:21.350> just<00:03:21.560> mount<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.130> drag

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
location so let's just mount and drag

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.360 
location so let's just mount and drag
them<00:03:22.340> from<00:03:22.520> here<00:03:22.990> now<00:03:23.990> I've<00:03:24.320> set<00:03:24.590> stations<00:03:25.190> to

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
them from here now I've set stations to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.100 
them from here now I've set stations to
fell<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:25.850> don't<00:03:26.060> have<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.270> be<00:03:26.540> in<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.720> station

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
fell so I don't have to be in a station

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.930 
fell so I don't have to be in a station
but<00:03:27.650> if<00:03:27.740> you<00:03:27.890> were<00:03:28.100> to<00:03:28.160> set<00:03:28.490> the<00:03:28.670> true<00:03:28.910> you

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
but if you were to set the true you

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.000 
but if you were to set the true you
would<00:03:29.270> have<00:03:29.300> to<00:03:29.630> be<00:03:30.170> in<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.320> station<00:03:30.709> I'm<00:03:30.890> gonna

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
would have to be in a station I'm gonna

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.780 
would have to be in a station I'm gonna
do<00:03:31.160> dl<00:03:31.570> mount<00:03:34.060> duty<00:03:35.060> mounts<00:03:35.690> apologies<00:03:36.790> there

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
do dl mount duty mounts apologies there

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.790 
do dl mount duty mounts apologies there
are<00:03:37.820> time<00:03:38.090> on<00:03:38.239> my<00:03:38.330> dragon<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:38.870> I'm<00:03:39.080> ludi<00:03:39.560> team

are time on my dragon and I'm ludi team

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.590 
are time on my dragon and I'm ludi team
travel<00:03:41.290> trick<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.700> now<00:03:43.850> it's<00:03:44.030> traveling<00:03:44.390> some

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
travel trick and now it's traveling some

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.080 
travel trick and now it's traveling some
tree<00:03:44.780> location<00:03:45.230> which<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:45.410> just<00:03:45.620> defined<00:03:46.090> I've

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
tree location which I just defined I've

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.670 
tree location which I just defined I've
actually<00:03:47.239> lost<00:03:47.480> on<00:03:47.750> there<00:03:47.870> is<00:03:47.989> there<00:03:50.680> going

actually lost on there is there going

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.479 
actually lost on there is there going
inside<00:03:52.070> a<00:03:53.110> mountain<00:03:54.110> they<00:03:54.769> got<00:03:55.010> now<00:03:55.220> I'm<00:03:55.370> at

inside a mountain they got now I'm at

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.729 
inside a mountain they got now I'm at
the<00:03:55.550> tree<00:03:55.730> location<00:03:56.090> which<00:03:56.180> trying<00:03:56.330> to<00:03:56.390> find

release<00:04:08.480> playing<00:04:09.489> okay<00:04:10.690> and<00:04:11.690> just<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.290> few<00:04:12.320> more

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
release playing okay and just a few more

things<00:04:13.190> dt<00:04:13.730> list<00:04:14.079> shows<00:04:15.079> all<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.380> locations

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
things dt list shows all the locations

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.520 
things dt list shows all the locations
we<00:04:16.669> can<00:04:16.790> travel<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:18.200> there's<00:04:18.380> the

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
we can travel to so there's the

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.130 
we can travel to so there's the
docklands<00:04:18.979> like<00:04:19.130> driving<00:04:19.489> away<00:04:19.640> in<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.850> tree

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
docklands like driving away in the tree

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.130 
docklands like driving away in the tree
and<00:04:21.140> we<00:04:21.320> can<00:04:21.440> also<00:04:21.530> do<00:04:21.739> dtc<00:04:22.700> travel<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:25.490> sea

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
and we can also do dtc travel so the sea

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.750 
and we can also do dtc travel so the sea
mounts<00:04:28.240> dtc<00:04:29.240> travels<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.440> let's<00:04:30.620> go<00:04:30.800> 2000

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
mounts dtc travels and let's go 2000

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.600 
mounts dtc travels and let's go 2000
it's<00:04:31.970> just<00:04:32.120> got<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.270> be<00:04:32.330> terrible<00:04:32.900> let's<00:04:33.050> go

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
it's just got to be terrible let's go

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.340 
it's just got to be terrible let's go
now<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:34.790> travels<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.360> coordinates<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.169> that

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
now it travels to coordinates and that

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.290 
now it travels to coordinates and that
because<00:04:36.500> you<00:04:36.620> use<00:04:36.830> sea<00:04:37.070> travel<00:04:37.310> an<00:04:37.610> X<00:04:37.910> Y<00:04:38.270> and

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
because you use sea travel an X Y and

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.780 
because you use sea travel an X Y and
then<00:04:38.570> Z<00:04:38.860> now<00:04:39.860> don't<00:04:40.010> actually<00:04:40.310> know<00:04:40.400> this<00:04:40.580> is

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790

you have icon replugging install val and

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.910 
you have icon replugging install val and
then<00:06:18.340> set<00:06:18.520> this<00:06:18.610> is<00:06:18.730> the<00:06:18.820> true<00:06:19.030> and<00:06:19.380> then<00:06:20.380> Kozma

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
then set this is the true and then Kozma

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.740 
then set this is the true and then Kozma
fly<00:06:21.100> this<00:06:21.160> is<00:06:21.400> how<00:06:21.490> much<00:06:21.610> your<00:06:21.790> cost<00:06:22.060> for

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
fly this is how much your cost for

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.600 
fly this is how much your cost for
someone<00:06:23.020> to<00:06:23.200> go<00:06:23.380> around<00:06:23.950> the<00:06:24.100> dragon<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:24.520> then

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
someone to go around the dragon and then

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.010 
someone to go around the dragon and then
fly<00:06:24.790> to<00:06:24.820> a<00:06:25.000> destination<00:06:25.180> so<00:06:25.720> at<00:06:25.810> the<00:06:25.870> moment

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
fly to a destination so at the moment

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.860 
fly to a destination so at the moment
one<00:06:26.590> can<00:06:27.220> change<00:06:27.250> that's<00:06:27.580> what<00:06:27.760> you<00:06:27.850> like<00:06:28.000> but

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
one can change that's what you like but

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.150 
one can change that's what you like but
you<00:06:28.990> must<00:06:29.230> have<00:06:29.380> that<00:06:29.590> come<00:06:29.770> with<00:06:29.920> system

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
you must have that come with system

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.530 
you must have that come with system
installed<00:06:31.350> the<00:06:32.350> travel<00:06:32.680> height<00:06:33.180> so<00:06:34.180> this<00:06:34.390> is

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
installed the travel height so this is

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.690 
installed the travel height so this is
how<00:06:34.750> high<00:06:35.080> the<00:06:35.140> dragonflies<00:06:35.800> during<00:06:36.310> a<00:06:36.340> travel

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
how high the dragonflies during a travel

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.340 
how high the dragonflies during a travel
so<00:06:37.510> you<00:06:37.600> can<00:06:37.690> set<00:06:37.840> it<00:06:37.870> to<00:06:37.990> higher<00:06:38.200> or<00:06:38.320> lower

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
so you can set it to higher or lower

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.200 
so you can set it to higher or lower
depending<00:06:38.740> on<00:06:39.100> what<00:06:39.460> your<00:06:39.610> preferences<00:06:40.680> and

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
depending on what your preferences and

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.400 
depending on what your preferences and
then<00:06:43.210> you've<00:06:43.360> got<00:06:43.450> the<00:06:43.570> use<00:06:43.750> station<00:06:44.170> which<00:06:44.290> I

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
then you've got the use station which I

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.130 
then you've got the use station which I
was<00:06:44.500> going<00:06:44.680> about<00:06:44.950> earlier<00:06:45.730> so<00:06:46.150> if<00:06:46.780> this<00:06:46.960> is

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
was going about earlier so if this is

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.240 
was going about earlier so if this is
true<00:06:47.610> users<00:06:48.610> can<00:06:48.790> only<00:06:48.970> mouth<00:06:49.240> in<00:06:49.390> the<00:06:49.420> station

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
true users can only mouth in the station

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.160 
true users can only mouth in the station
if<00:06:51.250> it's<00:06:51.670> a<00:06:52.030> will<00:06:52.210> dig<00:06:52.390> amount<00:06:52.690> from<00:06:52.840> anywhere

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
if it's a will dig amount from anywhere

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.260 
if it's a will dig amount from anywhere
ok<00:06:54.420> this<00:06:55.420> is<00:06:55.570> the<00:06:55.600> distance<00:06:56.020> to<00:06:56.380> station<00:06:56.920> so

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
ok this is the distance to station so

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.090 
ok this is the distance to station so
just<00:06:58.270> like<00:06:58.510> a<00:06:58.540> if<00:06:58.960> you<00:06:59.140> think<00:06:59.380> of<00:06:59.470> a<00:06:59.560> point<00:06:59.770> as<00:07:00.040> a

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.100 
just like a if you think of a point as a

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.150 
just like a if you think of a point as a
station<00:07:00.670> this<00:07:01.390> is<00:07:01.600> the<00:07:01.780> radius<00:07:02.200> almost<00:07:02.710> around

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
station this is the radius almost around

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.020 
station this is the radius almost around
that<00:07:03.970> point<00:07:04.350> that<00:07:05.350> the<00:07:05.590> user<00:07:06.340> come<00:07:06.550> out<00:07:06.730> from

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
that point that the user come out from

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.880 
that point that the user come out from
so<00:07:07.480> for<00:07:08.020> instance<00:07:08.080> if<00:07:08.320> you<00:07:08.410> have<00:07:08.500> quite<00:07:08.680> big

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:08.890 
so for instance if you have quite big

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.390 
so for instance if you have quite big
station<00:07:09.100> I<00:07:09.280> want<00:07:09.550> to<00:07:09.610> increase<00:07:09.880> that<00:07:10.090> limit<00:07:11.400> to

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
station I want to increase that limit to

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.490 
station I want to increase that limit to
something<00:07:12.640> higher<00:07:12.820> or<00:07:13.690> even<00:07:13.870> a<00:07:13.900> small<00:07:14.110> station

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500 
something higher or even a small station

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.350 
something higher or even a small station
might<00:07:14.680> want<00:07:14.830> to<00:07:14.890> decrease<00:07:15.310> that<00:07:15.400> other

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 
might want to decrease that other

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.110 
might want to decrease that other
moments<00:07:16.720> 5<00:07:16.930> and<00:07:17.400> then<00:07:18.400> you've<00:07:18.640> got<00:07:18.670> these<00:07:18.880> two

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 
moments 5 and then you've got these two

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.540 
moments 5 and then you've got these two
things<00:07:19.330> here<00:07:19.570> so<00:07:19.900> a<00:07:20.170> degree<00:07:20.950> for<00:07:21.130> dragons

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
things here so a degree for dragons

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.360 
things here so a degree for dragons
dragons<00:07:22.540> if<00:07:23.200> you<00:07:23.410> don't<00:07:23.560> know<00:07:23.710> they<00:07:23.980> create

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
dragons if you don't know they create

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.140 
dragons if you don't know they create
massive<00:07:24.520> holes<00:07:24.880> and<00:07:25.240> tear<00:07:26.110> up<00:07:26.230> loads<00:07:26.440> of<00:07:26.560> stuff

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
massive holes and tear up loads of stuff

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.820 
massive holes and tear up loads of stuff
defo<00:07:28.150> just<00:07:28.420> random<00:07:28.810> dragons

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:29.830 
defo just random dragons

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.740 
defo just random dragons
you<00:07:30.400> can<00:07:30.550> set<00:07:30.790> that<00:07:30.880> to<00:07:31.030> a<00:07:31.060> degree<00:07:31.210> so<00:07:31.480> they

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750 
you can set that to a degree so they

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.960 
you can set that to a degree so they
don't<00:07:31.930> do<00:07:32.020> this<00:07:32.140> and<00:07:32.380> then<00:07:33.100> the<00:07:33.490> dragon<00:07:33.670> the

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970 
don't do this and then the dragon the

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.280 
don't do this and then the dragon the
actual<00:07:34.300> traveling<00:07:34.750> dragons<00:07:35.080> that<00:07:35.170> you're

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.290 
actual traveling dragons that you're

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.940 
actual traveling dragons that you're
flying<00:07:35.560> on<00:07:35.680> and<00:07:36.990> they<00:07:37.990> would<00:07:38.320> originally

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:38.950 
flying on and they would originally

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.530 
flying on and they would originally
destroy<00:07:39.430> the<00:07:39.670> world<00:07:39.850> you<00:07:40.120> know<00:07:40.240> as<00:07:40.390> you're

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:40.540 
destroy the world you know as you're

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.620 
destroy the world you know as you're
flying<00:07:40.840> but<00:07:41.530> you<00:07:41.620> can<00:07:41.770> set<00:07:41.980> that<00:07:42.160> to<00:07:42.400> true<00:07:42.760> so

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:43.630 
flying but you can set that to true so

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.480 
flying but you can set that to true so
they<00:07:43.750> don't<00:07:43.990> destroy<00:07:44.380> it<00:07:44.410> as<00:07:44.830> you<00:07:45.010> can<00:07:45.100> see<00:07:45.280> he

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.490 
they don't destroy it as you can see he

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.100 
they don't destroy it as you can see he
felt<00:07:45.760> by<00:07:45.880> tree<00:07:46.120> and<00:07:46.330> that's<00:07:46.600> why<00:07:46.780> I<00:07:46.810> didn't

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.110 
felt by tree and that's why I didn't

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.390 
felt by tree and that's why I didn't
destroy<00:07:47.410> the<00:07:47.500> mountains<00:07:47.890> when<00:07:48.130> I<00:07:48.220> went

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 
destroy the mountains when I went

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.550 
destroy the mountains when I went
through<00:07:48.520> them<00:07:48.700> they<00:07:49.630> said<00:07:49.930> that's<00:07:50.020> a<00:07:50.200> false<00:07:50.380> if

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 
through them they said that's a false if

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.390 
through them they said that's a false if
you<00:07:50.680> want<00:07:51.240> but<00:07:52.240> that<00:07:52.300> goes<00:07:52.570> over<00:07:52.780> the<00:07:52.870> country

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 
you want but that goes over the country

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.010 
you want but that goes over the country
