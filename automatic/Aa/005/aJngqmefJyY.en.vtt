00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
to numb it up so it's a lot easier

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.100 
to numb it up so it's a lot easier
because<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.210> use<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.659> office<00:01:34.020> I

couldn't agree more
ok<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
ok so what we want to do this is a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.789 
ok so what we want to do this is a
little<00:01:38.009> refresher<00:01:38.700> course<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.270> suturing<00:01:40.140> 101

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
little refresher course in suturing 101

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.859 
little refresher course in suturing 101
we<00:01:41.250> take<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> deep<00:01:41.820> bite<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.329> goes<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
we take a deep bite that goes all the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.950 
we take a deep bite that goes all the
way<00:01:43.079> through<00:01:43.229> dermis<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.759> make<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> bite<00:01:45.720> so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
way through dermis we make a bite so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480 
way through dermis we make a bite so
that<00:01:46.110> we're<00:01:46.259> trying<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.829> get<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.189> we<00:01:47.310> call
