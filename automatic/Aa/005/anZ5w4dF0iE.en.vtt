00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.250 
diamond and I have been doing a project
since<00:00:31.800> 2006<00:00:32.730> called<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.120> human<00:00:33.450> body<00:00:33.660> project

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
since 2006 called the human body project

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.580 
since 2006 called the human body project
and<00:00:35.510> it<00:00:36.510> started<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:38.809> like<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> call<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.530> a

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and it started out of like I call it a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.220 
and it started out of like I call it a
calling<00:00:41.040> some<00:00:41.940> people<00:00:42.210> use<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.390> word<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.110> it

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
calling some people use that word and it

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
calling some people use that word and it
makes<00:00:43.680> sense<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.160> me<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.239> had

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
makes sense for me I really just had

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.090 
makes sense for me I really just had
this<00:00:45.719> feeling<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.230> had<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:46.710> whatever<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
this feeling that I had to do whatever I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.000 
this feeling that I had to do whatever I
could<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.579> make<00:00:48.170> understand<00:00:49.170> how

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
could do to make understand how

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.340 
could do to make understand how
vulnerable<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.610> all<00:00:50.910> are<00:00:51.149> because<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.809> had<00:00:52.050> such

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
vulnerable we all are because I had such

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.689 
vulnerable we all are because I had such
a<00:00:53.210> kind<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.239> mind-blowing<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.260> body<00:00:56.100> blowing

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
a kind of mind-blowing and body blowing

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.849 
a kind of mind-blowing and body blowing
experience<00:00:57.090> having<00:00:57.629> kids<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.530> really

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
experience having kids and just really

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.880 
experience having kids and just really
woke<00:00:59.070> me<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.309> to<00:01:00.469> things<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.680> wasn't

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
woke me up to things that I wasn't

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.210 
woke me up to things that I wasn't
really<00:01:02.129> awake<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.760> before<00:01:03.350> anyway<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.619> started

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
really awake to before anyway I started

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.080 
really awake to before anyway I started
this<00:01:05.400> project<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:07.640> felt<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.850> if

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
this project because I felt like if

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.609 
this project because I felt like if
there's<00:01:09.299> any<00:01:09.479> way<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:09.930> move<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
there's any way that I can move the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
there's any way that I can move the
world<00:01:10.650> forward<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.030> my<00:01:12.180> way<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
world forward then this is my way that I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.160 
world forward then this is my way that I
could<00:01:12.810> do<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:14.509> what<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:18.110> sort<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
could do it and what I do is I sort of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.580 
could do it and what I do is I sort of
it's<00:01:19.850> hard<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.000> explain<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.780> words<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.439> I'll

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it's hard to explain in words but I'll

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.500 
it's hard to explain in words but I'll
try<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.890> explain<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> show<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.659> naked

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
naked part difficult and some people

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.110 
naked part difficult and some people
find<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.710> unscripted<00:01:30.160> part<00:01:30.520> difficult<00:01:31.000> which

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
find the unscripted part difficult which

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.670 
find the unscripted part difficult which
is<00:01:31.270> quite<00:01:31.510> interesting<00:01:31.660> now<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.290> naked

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
is quite interesting now the naked

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.410 
is quite interesting now the naked
purpose<00:01:33.040> some<00:01:33.190> people<00:01:33.520> isn't<00:01:33.730> a<00:01:33.790> big<00:01:33.940> deal<00:01:34.120> but

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
purpose some people isn't a big deal but

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.570 
purpose some people isn't a big deal but
the<00:01:35.170> fact<00:01:35.410> that<00:01:35.500> I<00:01:35.590> don't<00:01:35.680> come<00:01:36.160> there<00:01:36.370> with

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
the fact that I don't come there with

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.190 
the fact that I don't come there with
like<00:01:36.910> something<00:01:37.450> prepared

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
like something prepared

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.130 
like something prepared
yeah<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:38.980> the<00:01:39.970> reason<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.330> do<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.630> is<00:01:40.840> because

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
yeah and the reason I do that is because

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.440 
yeah and the reason I do that is because
it<00:01:41.920> makes<00:01:42.130> me<00:01:42.280> feel<00:01:42.430> really<00:01:42.730> vulnerable<00:01:42.970> but

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
it makes me feel really vulnerable but

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.750 
it makes me feel really vulnerable but
also<00:01:43.780> I<00:01:44.350> do<00:01:44.470> that<00:01:44.830> because<00:01:45.010> it's<00:01:45.280> kind<00:01:45.550> of<00:01:45.580> like

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
also I do that because it's kind of like

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.240 
also I do that because it's kind of like
a<00:01:45.790> way<00:01:46.030> of<00:01:46.060> being<00:01:46.450> in<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.840> moment<00:01:46.930> and<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:48.100> way

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
a way of being in the moment and a way

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.740 
a way of being in the moment and a way
of<00:01:48.280> being<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:49.780> real<00:01:50.200> person<00:01:50.680> in<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.980> real<00:01:51.130> body

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
of being this real person in a real body

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.610 
of being this real person in a real body
so<00:01:53.190> it's<00:01:54.190> sort<00:01:54.610> of<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.910> complete<00:01:55.720> opposite<00:01:56.440> of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
so it's sort of the complete opposite of

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.280 
so it's sort of the complete opposite of
this<00:01:56.890> culture<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:57.700> we<00:01:57.850> live<00:01:58.000> in<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.420> the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
this culture that we live in and the

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.710 
this culture that we live in and the
complete<00:01:59.620> opposite<00:02:00.010> of<00:02:00.100> art<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:00.820> theater<00:02:01.690> in

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
complete opposite of art and theater in

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.400 
complete opposite of art and theater in
lots<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.170> ways

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
lots of ways

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.090 
lots of ways
so<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.840> love<00:02:05.229> it<00:02:05.260> already

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
so I love it already

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.639 
so I love it already
some<00:02:06.550> women<00:02:06.850> have<00:02:07.030> children<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.900> feel<00:02:08.530> like

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
some women have children and feel like

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.469 
some women have children and feel like
they<00:02:08.770> lose<00:02:08.890> their<00:02:09.100> sexuality<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:09.850> become<00:02:10.300> for

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
they lose their sexuality and become for

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.040 
they lose their sexuality and become for
less<00:02:10.630> divas<00:02:11.250> other<00:02:12.250> women<00:02:12.790> get<00:02:13.210> naked<00:02:13.570> and

then<00:04:02.230> whatever<00:04:02.560> one<00:04:02.740> gets<00:04:02.890> a<00:04:02.950> chance<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.310> speak

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
then whatever one gets a chance to speak

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.360 
then whatever one gets a chance to speak
but<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.270> think<00:04:04.990> there's<00:04:05.440> tears<00:04:05.800> steering's

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
but I think there's tears steering's

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.140 
but I think there's tears steering's
streaming<00:04:07.120> down<00:04:07.240> their<00:04:07.300> faces<00:04:07.630> some<00:04:08.080> done<00:04:08.320> I

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
streaming down their faces some done I

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.700 
streaming down their faces some done I
like<00:04:10.150> for<00:04:10.450> me<00:04:10.570> I<00:04:10.600> think<00:04:10.900> one<00:04:11.320> of<00:04:11.350> the<00:04:11.440> reasons

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
like for me I think one of the reasons

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.080 
like for me I think one of the reasons
that<00:04:11.740> I<00:04:11.830> do<00:04:11.950> is<00:04:12.250> because<00:04:12.430> I<00:04:12.580> don't<00:04:12.730> really<00:04:12.910> feel

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
that I do is because I don't really feel

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.030 
that I do is because I don't really feel
like<00:04:13.150> I'm<00:04:13.450> desperate<00:04:13.870> for<00:04:14.380> an<00:04:14.500> opportunity<00:04:14.950> to

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
like I'm desperate for an opportunity to

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.130 
like I'm desperate for an opportunity to
be<00:04:15.250> authentic<00:04:15.820> that's<00:04:16.360> part<00:04:16.660> of<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.840> reason

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
be authentic that's part of the reason

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.020 
be authentic that's part of the reason
that<00:04:17.170> I<00:04:17.320> do<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.489> feel<00:04:18.790> like<00:04:18.940> these

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
that I do it and I feel like these

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.729 
that I do it and I feel like these
people<00:04:19.420> like<00:04:19.600> finally<00:04:20.080> have<00:04:20.290> you<00:04:20.500> know<00:04:20.590> that

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
people like finally have you know that

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.170 
people like finally have you know that
moment<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.220> their<00:04:21.340> lives<00:04:21.489> or<00:04:21.790> they<00:04:21.880> could<00:04:22.030> just

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
moment in their lives or they could just

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.260 
moment in their lives or they could just
be<00:04:22.810> who<00:04:23.320> they<00:04:23.560> are<00:04:23.590> with<00:04:24.400> other<00:04:24.670> people<00:04:25.150> like

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
be who they are with other people like

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.730 
be who they are with other people like
of<00:04:25.390> course<00:04:25.420> you<00:04:25.690> have<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:25.930> moment<00:04:26.170> maybe

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
of course you have that moment maybe

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.740 
of course you have that moment maybe
with<00:04:26.980> your<00:04:27.100> partner<00:04:27.550> or<00:04:27.790> maybe<00:04:28.330> with<00:04:28.570> good

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
with your partner or maybe with good

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.320 
with your partner or maybe with good
friends<00:04:29.020> or<00:04:29.200> whatever<00:04:29.470> but<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:29.680> mean<00:04:30.330> publicly

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
friends or whatever but I mean publicly

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.120 
friends or whatever but I mean publicly
in<00:04:31.540> our<00:04:31.870> culture<00:04:32.320> it<00:04:32.440> doesn't<00:04:32.770> really<00:04:32.890> exist

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
in our culture it doesn't really exist

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.120 
in our culture it doesn't really exist
and<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.150> think<00:04:34.420> that's<00:04:35.290> very<00:04:35.380> transformative

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
and I think that's very transformative

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.280 
and I think that's very transformative
for<00:04:36.430> people<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:37.000> either<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.330> witness<00:04:37.720> or<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.200> be

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
for people to either to witness or to be

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.760 
for people to either to witness or to be
part

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
part

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.890 
part
and<00:04:38.949> I<00:04:39.069> think<00:04:39.160> that's<00:04:39.460> why<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:40.330> project<00:04:40.750> has

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
and I think that's why the project has

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.629 
and I think that's why the project has
been<00:04:40.930> quite<00:04:41.319> transformative<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:42.280> healing

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
been quite transformative and healing

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.850 
been quite transformative and healing
Ruth<00:04:42.849> oh<00:04:43.090> there's<00:04:43.690> more<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:43.930> could<00:04:44.169> say<00:04:44.349> but<00:04:44.380> I
