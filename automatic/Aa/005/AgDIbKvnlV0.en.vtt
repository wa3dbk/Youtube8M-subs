00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.780 

I<00:00:14.360> think<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> game<00:00:15.600> is<00:00:15.780> gone<00:00:15.960> now<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.760> we<00:00:17.760> have

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:17.790 
I think the game is gone now so we have

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.630 
I think the game is gone now so we have
to<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.300> concentrate<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> next<00:00:19.350> one

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
to just concentrate it on the next one

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.519 
to just concentrate it on the next one
every<00:00:20.640> game<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.210> lose<00:00:21.360> is<00:00:21.660> hard<00:00:22.140> especially

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
every game you lose is hard especially

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.220 
every game you lose is hard especially
in<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> World<00:00:23.340> Cups<00:00:23.610> and<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.750> need<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.080> win

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
in the World Cups and you need to win

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.620 
in the World Cups and you need to win
the<00:00:25.380> games<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:28.340> don't<00:00:29.340> know<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.240> happening

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the games I don't know this is happening

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.869 
the games I don't know this is happening
you<00:00:30.960> can't<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.440> anything<00:00:31.710> about<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.640> I

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
you can't do anything about that so I

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.570 
you can't do anything about that so I
think<00:00:33.270> they<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.600> playing<00:00:33.900> well<00:00:34.370> today<00:00:35.370> they

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
think they are playing well today they

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.220 
think they are playing well today they
were<00:00:35.730> thoroughly<00:00:36.059> professional<00:00:36.809> performance

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
were thoroughly professional performance

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.259 
were thoroughly professional performance
by<00:00:37.350> then<00:00:37.559> they've<00:00:37.800> added<00:00:37.890> well<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:38.640> they

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
by then they've added well and then they

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.780 
by then they've added well and then they
really<00:00:39.570> bode<00:00:39.750> well<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.260> full<00:00:41.129> credit<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.610> them

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
really bode well so full credit to them

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.770 
really bode well so full credit to them
I<00:00:44.660> think<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> might<00:00:46.019> be<00:00:46.250> as<00:00:47.570> everybody<00:00:48.570> know

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
I think it might be as everybody know

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.290 
I think it might be as everybody know
that<00:00:48.809> Sheikh<00:00:49.530> Adama<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.399> we're<00:00:50.640> art<00:00:50.820> Kohli

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that Sheikh Adama and we're art Kohli

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.810 
that Sheikh Adama and we're art Kohli
they're<00:00:51.989> all<00:00:52.140> Suresh<00:00:53.040> Rana<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:53.640> are

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
they're all Suresh Rana and there are

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.990 
they're all Suresh Rana and there are
very<00:00:54.690> good<00:00:54.989> batsmen<00:00:55.829> some<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:56.790> top

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
very good batsmen some of the top

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
very good batsmen some of the top
batsmen<00:00:57.450> in<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> world<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:58.800> that

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
batsmen in the world so I think that

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.569 
batsmen in the world so I think that
they<00:00:59.760> really<00:00:59.789> played<00:01:00.210> well<00:01:00.450> today<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.579> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
they really played well today and the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.760 
they really played well today and the
kind<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.969> quality<00:01:03.360> they<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:04.350> showed<00:01:04.589> it

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
kind of quality they have they showed it

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.330 
kind of quality they have they showed it
today<00:01:04.940> I<00:01:05.940> think<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:07.289> could<00:01:07.470> not<00:01:07.649> really<00:01:07.860> manage

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
today I think we could not really manage

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.430 
today I think we could not really manage
to<00:01:08.490> score<00:01:08.759> that<00:01:09.000> Talib<00:01:09.479> batsman<00:01:09.899> he<00:01:10.050> could<00:01:10.289> not

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
to score that Talib batsman he could not

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.440 
to score that Talib batsman he could not
convert<00:01:10.860> their<00:01:11.220> starts<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.910> some<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.300> them

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
convert their starts and some of them

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.930 
convert their starts and some of them
just<00:01:12.660> got<00:01:13.640> got<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.759> early<00:01:14.789> so<00:01:16.280> we<00:01:17.280> need<00:01:17.520> we

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
just got got out early so we need we

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.750 
just got got out early so we need we
need<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.270> learn<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:19.070> good<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.490> good

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
need to learn that good like good

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.240 
need to learn that good like good
players<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.360> need<00:01:21.510> to<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:21.840> carry<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.260> go

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
players we need to just carry on go

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.880 
players we need to just carry on go
there<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.760> just<00:01:23.939> try<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.170> job<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
there and just try to do the job for the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.149 
there and just try to do the job for the
team<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.420> moment<00:01:27.810> even<00:01:28.350> today<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.650> think

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
team at the moment even today I think

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.520 
team at the moment even today I think
the<00:01:29.610> guys<00:01:29.790> we're<00:01:30.060> doing<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> before<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the guys we're doing it before in the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
the guys we're doing it before in the
practice<00:01:31.890> games<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.310> today<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.580> think<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:33.119> just

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
practice games but today I think we just

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.679 
practice games but today I think we just
lost<00:01:33.710> three<00:01:34.820> quick<00:01:35.820> wickets<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> middle

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
lost three quick wickets in the middle

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.510 
lost three quick wickets in the middle
and<00:01:36.840> that's<00:01:36.990> from<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.189> lost<00:01:38.700> today

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.480 

I<00:01:41.990> think<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.290> all<00:01:43.590> about<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.100> taking

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
I think it's all about just taking

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.249 
I think it's all about just taking
wickets<00:01:44.640> we<00:01:44.939> could<00:01:45.119> not<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.570> managed<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
wickets we could not just managed to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.200 
wickets we could not just managed to
take<00:01:46.470> wickets<00:01:46.890> even<00:01:47.280> at<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.520> top<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.000> then

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
take wickets even at the top and then

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.960 
take wickets even at the top and then
even<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> middle<00:01:49.140> oh<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.159> when<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.850> are

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
even in the middle oh and when you are

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.120 
even in the middle oh and when you are
not<00:01:51.090> taking<00:01:51.330> wickets<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:52.340> serial<00:01:53.340> difficult<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
not taking wickets a serial difficult to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.410 
not taking wickets a serial difficult to
restrict<00:01:56.130> opposition<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:56.880> still<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> think

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
restrict opposition but still I think

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.440 
restrict opposition but still I think
Wallace<00:01:57.899> did<00:01:58.200> very<00:01:58.409> well<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.920> last

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
Wallace did very well in the last

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.210 
Wallace did very well in the last
session<00:02:00.450> especially<00:02:01.170> last<00:02:01.380> 10-15<00:02:01.830> you<00:02:02.100> know

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
session especially last 10-15 you know

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.160 
session especially last 10-15 you know
was<00:02:02.369> they<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.759> bold<00:02:02.970> well<00:02:03.240> pulled<00:02:03.960> them

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
was they really bold well pulled them

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.929 
was they really bold well pulled them
back<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.619> was<00:02:04.770> looking<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.520> they<00:02:05.759> got<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
back it was looking that they they got a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.910 
back it was looking that they they got a
score<00:02:06.270> three<00:02:06.830> 340<00:02:07.830> 350<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.899> then<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.560> think

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
score three 340 350 but and then I think

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.339 
score three 340 350 but and then I think
they<00:02:11.250> pulled<00:02:11.550> them<00:02:11.760> really<00:02:12.090> back<00:02:12.269> 300<00:02:13.170> was

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
they pulled them really back 300 was

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.410 
they pulled them really back 300 was
pretty<00:02:13.650> much<00:02:13.830> terrible<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.850> kind<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.209> pitch

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
pretty much terrible the kind of pitch

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.240 
pretty much terrible the kind of pitch
it<00:02:15.569> was<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.049> ball<00:02:16.230> was<00:02:16.440> really<00:02:16.739> coming<00:02:16.920> well

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
it was the ball was really coming well

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.150 
it was the ball was really coming well
on<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.330> bat<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.170> think<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.980> all

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
on the bat but I think it's it's all

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.280 
on the bat but I think it's it's all
about<00:02:20.430> just<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:21.540> there<00:02:21.870> making

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
about just going there making

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.110 
about just going there making
partnerships<00:02:22.769> and<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.610> finishing<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
partnerships and just finishing the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.020 
partnerships and just finishing the
games<00:02:24.299> but<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.900> lost<00:02:25.910> wickets<00:02:26.910> on

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
games but we just lost wickets on

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.479 
games but we just lost wickets on
regular<00:02:27.390> basis<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.959> three<00:02:28.860> wickets<00:02:29.250> went

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
regular basis and three wickets went

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.720 
regular basis and three wickets went
just<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.720> six<00:02:31.080> seven<00:02:31.410> volts<00:02:31.739> that<00:02:32.280> really

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
just like in six seven volts that really

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.479 
just like in six seven volts that really
hurt<00:02:32.910> us<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:35.959> think<00:02:36.959> it's<00:02:37.140> important<00:02:37.769> for<00:02:37.830> us<00:02:38.010> to

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
hurt us I think it's important for us to

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.809 
hurt us I think it's important for us to
just<00:02:38.519> concentrate<00:02:39.920> on<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.340> games<00:02:41.549> which

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
just concentrate on the games which

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.240 
just concentrate on the games which
which<00:02:42.180> are<00:02:42.330> coming<00:02:42.720> which<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.590> we<00:02:43.769> are<00:02:43.980> going

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
which are coming which is we are going

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.270 
which are coming which is we are going
to<00:02:44.370> play<00:02:44.580> because<00:02:44.849> if<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.140> keep<00:02:47.040> on

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
to play because if you just keep on

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.569 
to play because if you just keep on
thinking<00:02:47.579> about<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.239> game<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.810> gone<00:02:49.049> now

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
thinking about the game that is gone now

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.280 
thinking about the game that is gone now
then<00:02:50.579> it's<00:02:51.150> really<00:02:51.359> difficult<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.140> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
then it's really difficult for you to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.640 
then it's really difficult for you to
just<00:02:52.579> perform<00:02:53.579> well<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.359> think<00:02:54.780> we<00:02:55.049> need<00:02:55.380> to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
just perform well so I think we need to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.699 
just perform well so I think we need to
win<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.459> coming<00:02:56.790> game<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.299> perform<00:02:57.840> well<00:02:58.049> and

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
win the coming game and perform well and

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.170 
win the coming game and perform well and
that's<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.070> only<00:02:59.370> way<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.549> stay<00:02:59.880> in<00:03:00.120> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
that's the only way to stay in the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.590 
that's the only way to stay in the
tournament

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
tournament

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.280 
tournament
you<00:03:03.600> spoke<00:03:03.930> about<00:03:03.989> losing<00:03:04.500> wickets

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.349
