in<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.290> homemade<00:00:13.590> camera<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:14.970> you<00:00:15.090> get<00:00:15.270> is

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
in a homemade camera and what you get is

in a homemade camera and what you get is
a<00:00:15.450> negative<00:00:15.900> print<00:00:16.310> you<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.429> reverse<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.759> to<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
a negative print you can reverse it to a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.300 
a negative print you can reverse it to a
positive<00:00:18.330> in<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.779> darkroom<00:00:19.080> or<00:00:19.589> by<00:00:19.980> scanning

and then inverting the image when the
camera<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.140> designed<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.829> paper<00:00:26.039> is

camera is designed so the paper is
curved<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.820> may<00:00:27.150> see<00:00:27.210> some<00:00:27.480> beautiful

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:27.659 
curved you may see some beautiful

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.349 
curved you may see some beautiful
distortions<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.560> straight<00:00:28.800> lines<00:00:29.070> if<00:00:29.490> the

distortions of straight lines if the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.330 
distortions of straight lines if the
film<00:00:30.570> or<00:00:30.720> paper<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.140> flat<00:00:31.409> then<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> image

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
film or paper is flat then the image

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.380 
film or paper is flat then the image
looks<00:00:32.550> fairly<00:00:32.880> normal

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
looks fairly normal

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
looks fairly normal
although<00:00:33.750> pinhole<00:00:34.170> images<00:00:34.590> do<00:00:34.740> have<00:00:34.920> two

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
although pinhole images do have two

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.510 
although pinhole images do have two
special<00:00:35.730> properties<00:00:36.500> one<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.280> since

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
special properties one is that since

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.040 
special properties one is that since
there's<00:00:38.730> no<00:00:38.880> lens<00:00:39.120> there's<00:00:39.510> an<00:00:39.630> infinite

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
there's no lens there's an infinite

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
there's no lens there's an infinite
depth<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.440> field<00:00:40.710> everything<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.060> focus

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
depth of field everything is in focus

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.980 
depth of field everything is in focus
whether<00:00:43.110> inches<00:00:43.530> away<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> distance

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
whether inches away or in the distance

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.330 
whether inches away or in the distance
the<00:00:45.990> other<00:00:46.020> special<00:00:46.380> property<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.130> that

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
the other special property is that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.490 
the other special property is that
because<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.820> aperture<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.330> so<00:00:48.510> small<00:00:48.900> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
because the aperture is so small the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.140 
because the aperture is so small the
exposure<00:00:49.890> time<00:00:50.160> will<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.370> relatively<00:00:50.850> long

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
exposure time will be relatively long

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.840 
exposure time will be relatively long
compared<00:00:51.630> to<00:00:51.720> a<00:00:51.750> lens<00:00:51.960> camera<00:00:52.580> you<00:00:53.580> wouldn't

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
compared to a lens camera you wouldn't

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.940 
compared to a lens camera you wouldn't
typically<00:00:54.150> take<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> picture<00:00:54.780> indoors<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.320> f-22

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
typically take a picture indoors at f-22

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.600 
typically take a picture indoors at f-22
so<00:00:56.670> imagine<00:00:56.970> working<00:00:57.090> at<00:00:57.270> 138<00:00:58.080> or<00:00:58.230> f-250<00:00:59.190> which

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
so imagine working at 138 or f-250 which

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.660 
so imagine working at 138 or f-250 which
are<00:00:59.790> typical<00:01:00.180> pinhole<00:01:00.570> camera<00:01:00.990> f-numbers<00:01:01.670> and

are typical pinhole camera f-numbers and

are typical pinhole camera f-numbers and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
if you're using photo paper then the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.499 
if you're using photo paper then the
exposure<00:01:04.769> will<00:01:04.979> be<00:01:05.039> even<00:01:05.369> longer<00:01:05.549> since<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
exposure will be even longer since the

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.300 
exposure will be even longer since the
ISO<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.109> photo<00:01:07.320> paper<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:07.920> much<00:01:08.070> slower

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
ISO of photo paper is so much slower

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.120 
ISO of photo paper is so much slower
than<00:01:08.429> film<00:01:08.850> usually<00:01:09.749> about<00:01:10.020> 6<00:01:10.350> or<00:01:10.469> 12<00:01:10.770> rather
