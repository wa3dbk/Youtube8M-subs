reason<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.090> say<00:01:24.360> don't<00:01:24.660> color<00:01:25.020> them<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.410> because

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
reason I say don't color them in because

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.609 
reason I say don't color them in because
this<00:01:26.340> pencil<00:01:27.119> doesn't<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.899> a<00:01:27.930> lot<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.229> liner

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this pencil doesn't have a lot of liner

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.670 
this pencil doesn't have a lot of liner
on<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.880> end<00:01:30.149> up<00:01:30.330> pretty<00:01:30.750> much<00:01:30.869> wasting

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
on it so you end up pretty much wasting

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.950 
on it so you end up pretty much wasting
your<00:01:32.039> whole<00:01:32.250> pencil<00:01:32.640> coloring<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.750> when

your whole pencil coloring it in when
you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.770> use<00:01:34.890> another<00:01:35.190> pencil<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
you know you can use another pencil to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480 
you know you can use another pencil to
color<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.830> like<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.220> pens

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
color it in I just like this pens

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.740
