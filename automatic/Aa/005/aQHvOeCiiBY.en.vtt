00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
of the modern games I'm also very aware

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.690 
of the modern games I'm also very aware
that<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.259> was<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.439> take<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> time<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.520> play

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
that if I was to take the time to play

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.950 
that if I was to take the time to play
them<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> would<00:01:39.270> never<00:01:39.450> get<00:01:39.630> anything<00:01:39.840> done

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
them I would never get anything done

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.749 
them I would never get anything done
because<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.439> can<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.680> see<00:01:40.860> how<00:01:40.979> all-consuming

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
because I can just see how all-consuming

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.370 
because I can just see how all-consuming
they<00:01:41.880> could<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> mean<00:01:42.450> believe<00:01:42.630> me<00:01:42.720> it's

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
they could be I mean believe me it's

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.599 
they could be I mean believe me it's
almost<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.100> almost<00:01:44.729> considered<00:01:45.149> myself

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
almost like I almost considered myself

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.069 
almost like I almost considered myself
like<00:01:47.609> a<00:01:47.640> debt<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.179> alcoholic<00:01:48.780> who<00:01:48.869> knows

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
like a debt like an alcoholic who knows

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.450

that I can't play the games because I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.679

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
hand and like I said yeah I mean those

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.720 
hand and like I said yeah I mean those
8-bit<00:02:16.530> games<00:02:16.799> they're<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.069> little<00:02:17.250> bit<00:02:17.340> simple

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
8-bit games they're a little bit simple

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.550 
8-bit games they're a little bit simple
well<00:02:18.120> certainly<00:02:18.420> very<00:02:18.660> simple<00:02:18.989> by<00:02:19.110> today's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
well certainly very simple by today's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.740 
well certainly very simple by today's
standards<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.069> like<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> said<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.269> my

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
standards but like I said I my

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.720 
standards but like I said I my
creativity<00:02:22.349> would<00:02:22.650> fill<00:02:22.829> in<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> gaps<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:23.640> I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
creativity would fill in the gaps like I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.000 
creativity would fill in the gaps like I
would<00:02:23.910> sort<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:25.260> stimulated<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.980> lot

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
would sort of like it stimulated a lot

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.460 
would sort of like it stimulated a lot
of<00:02:26.519> creativity<00:02:26.880> because<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.079> said<00:02:28.290> they

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
of creativity because like I said they

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.440 
of creativity because like I said they
couldn't<00:02:28.680> always<00:02:28.950> depict<00:02:29.430> everything<00:02:29.970> that

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
couldn't always depict everything that

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.900 
couldn't always depict everything that
they<00:02:30.569> can<00:02:30.780> obviously<00:02:31.290> now<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:32.220> those<00:02:32.549> those

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
they can obviously now in those those

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.850 
they can obviously now in those those
games<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.480> like<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.590> use<00:02:34.680> your

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
games so like you have to use your

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.990 
games so like you have to use your
imagination<00:02:34.920> like<00:02:35.519> you're<00:02:35.670> playing<00:02:35.819> this

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
imagination like you're playing this

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.420 
imagination like you're playing this

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.009 
Legend of Zelda it's it's a pretty
simplistic<00:02:38.610> idea<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.569> have<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.810> kind<00:02:39.989> of

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
simplistic idea so you have to kind of

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.809 
simplistic idea so you have to kind of
like<00:02:40.170> imagine<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:40.829> world<00:02:41.010> much<00:02:41.220> more<00:02:41.250> deluxe

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
like imagine the world much more deluxe

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.819 
like imagine the world much more deluxe

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
than it really was and that was kind of

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.140 
than it really was and that was kind of
fun<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.220> was<00:02:44.250> kind<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.489> neat<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.670> sort<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.000> like

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
