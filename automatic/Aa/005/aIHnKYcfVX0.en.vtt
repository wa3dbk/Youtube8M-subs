try<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.409> feed<00:01:59.590> it<00:01:59.680> once<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.979> day<00:02:00.009> I<00:02:00.190> really

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
try to feed it once a day I really

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.120 
try to feed it once a day I really
wanted<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.790> get<00:02:01.210> bigger<00:02:01.479> I've<00:02:02.229> heard<00:02:02.830> that<00:02:02.979> if

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
wanted to get bigger I've heard that if

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.139 
wanted to get bigger I've heard that if
you<00:02:03.220> feed<00:02:03.460> them<00:02:03.640> once<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.940> day<00:02:03.970> could<00:02:04.360> almost

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
you feed them once a day could almost

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.699 
you feed them once a day could almost
become<00:02:07.149> five<00:02:07.450> times<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.020> size<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:08.619> was

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
become five times the size that it was

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.430 
become five times the size that it was
purchased<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.819> it's<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.390> healthy<00:02:13.780> defeated<00:02:14.319> at

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
purchased but it's a healthy defeated at

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.790 
purchased but it's a healthy defeated at
least<00:02:14.650> three<00:02:15.010> times<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.430> week<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.760> would<00:02:15.819> say<00:02:16.800> but

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
least three times a week I would say but

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.360 
least three times a week I would say but
like<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.040> said<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.280> feed<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.600> almost<00:02:19.600> every<00:02:19.900> day

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
like I said I feed it almost every day

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.440 
like I said I feed it almost every day
so<00:02:21.370> as<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.520> can<00:02:21.610> see<00:02:21.819> now<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.150> almost

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
so as you can see now it's almost

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.890 
so as you can see now it's almost
completely<00:02:22.840> closed<00:02:23.459> taking<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.670> shrimp

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
completely closed taking in the shrimp

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.150 
completely closed taking in the shrimp
so<00:02:25.900> now<00:02:26.019> what<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.200> want<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.440> do<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:26.980> just<00:02:27.010> want

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
so now what I want to do is I just want

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.270 
so now what I want to do is I just want
to<00:02:27.340> lift<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.940> bottle<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.989> release<00:02:29.769> any<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.160> the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280

now all that access shrimp will be

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
now all that access shrimp will be
released<00:02:43.660> into<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.989> tank

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380
