00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 They Mishna gamma for fagers so 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.359
 I would say this is the top Abansky but not 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.719
 less I don't think so 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.620
 many think that all their moba genre is 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.910
 just dota clones but for me this one 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.730
 Separate game with its pluses and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.460
 minus modifications so on first 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.830
 honors is a hero except 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.279
 they are bought for game currency 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.699
 they can improve their skills if 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.830
 dota how many stirrups wore so much she 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.899
 will immediately apply the skill 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.790
 increases in the game is present 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.710
 run system which is also bought for 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.899
 game currency but me this system 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 absolutely not like because the hero 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.620
 also buy for currency 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.629
 I'm interested in buying a new hero 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.640
 try to play them than to spend 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.250
 money to improve your first 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.629
 by run but no less 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.550
 makes it necessary because without them your 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.859
 living with your off the shackles it will all be 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.350
 less and a hero with smart will be easier for you 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.309
 win I don't know why hawass 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.460
 called gru 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.860
 Anime because the schedule is absolutely 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.380
 they donâ€™t have to be nearly hard but here 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.110
 there are no big blue ones 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.299
 personal people and so on all 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.119
 characters are you ready for realistic 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.970
 mundane no of course not everything is there 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.090
 no characters that fell under 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.759
 scope of ordinariness but basically everything 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.829
 habitually the store in the game is very extensive 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.729
 very convenient there are several 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.060
 points of attack defense magic on you, we 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.159
 movement and the end is quite different 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:49.140
 lexer products and so on and jump and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:54.360
 also recommended by law and immediately visible 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:58.320
 that the card is smaller is much smaller probably 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:05.590
 twenty five percent less than 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:09.670
 dota distance from drying to gun too 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:14.560
 will be less and right there are no usual 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.769
 room instead here are made by boss i'm 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.480
 the game is also less than the dota but that's how I 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.370
 say the boss of whom you can get 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.290
 baf is local food skate rub which 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.480
 adds or region or change you 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.340
 the opponent of the second feature is 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.069
 additional abilities that 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.980
 help you your game 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.959
 for example now I do not have enough strength 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.440
 I can brew a monster 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.950
 run away failed but in general the essence 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.549
 understandable and the second boss you can 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.870
 receive 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.530
 Rune igniting's third boss with him 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.390
 every lesson 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.530
 teams will receive 100 90 gold each 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.959
 Of course it is not so much but in general it is 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.410
 very helpful every boss will spawn 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:09.040
 five minutes of deputies here gives less 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.859
 Golda than dota but sings and does abs 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.630
 here they are much more convenient place replacement 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.030
 trees among which to hide a lot 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.190
 these are bushes in them your opponent you not 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.319
 will see until he himself comes down to them well 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.350
 it helps to make ambushes and so on 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.209
 if you are battered by currency or you 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.400
 just put a noise on your base 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.680
 deer but useful ability evil 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.010
 Morokova she helps you transfer to 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.459
 base anywhere on the map 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.459
 that's how it happens 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.379
 when players are strong enough 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.959
 there will be the most powerful boss for which 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.750
 you get a good grandmother efrafe all 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.519
 your characteristics but 20 minutes if 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.400
 things you have in your team went badly 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:58.519
 can offer them to surrender went then 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.930
 Lapshin and offer surrender 2 team 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.239
 decides to go and line 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.099
 The main task of the game is to destroy 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.640
 nexus marriage at destruction it brings 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:10.519
 you win in the end league and flag it 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.260
 not just a conduit is a game that has 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.230
 their pros and cons which 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.109
 it's interesting to play but I'll be honest all 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.729
 retains its would dota 2 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.660
 just because it is closest to me 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.970
 he was Ruslan himself 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.810
 in the imminent meeting put huskies 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.810
