defense points 800 it's not gonna say

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.580 
defense points 800 it's not gonna say
that<00:02:14.269> for<00:02:14.510> every<00:02:14.720> card<00:02:14.900> every<00:02:15.080> card<00:02:15.410> is

position<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:26.300> can<00:02:26.630> attack<00:02:27.019> this<00:02:27.349> card<00:02:27.700> but

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
position it can attack this card but

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.330 
position it can attack this card but
when<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.000> attacks<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.630> its<00:02:30.380> attack<00:02:30.860> points

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
when it attacks it its attack points

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.330 
when it attacks it its attack points
needs<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.209> more<00:02:33.019> than<00:02:33.680> its<00:02:33.920> defense

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
defense position the defense position

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.460 
defense position the defense position
points<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.480> 2000<00:02:42.319> so<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.910> this<00:02:44.630> one<00:02:44.870> only<00:02:45.230> has

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
points is 2000 so that this one only has

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.809

attack<00:02:46.130> points<00:02:46.519> 1200<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.049> if<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:49.130> has<00:02:49.549> less

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
attack points 1200 so if this has less

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.589 
attack points 1200 so if this has less
then<00:02:50.660> that<00:02:50.930> card<00:02:51.200> wins<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:53.030> would<00:02:53.299> go<00:02:53.480> in

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
then that card wins and this would go in

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.780 
then that card wins and this would go in
the<00:02:53.720> graveyard<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:56.680> will<00:02:57.680> know<00:02:57.920> who<00:02:58.130> or<00:02:58.340> when

attack points
this<00:03:41.120> one<00:03:41.299> says<00:03:41.510> 1200<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:43.130> this<00:03:43.430> card<00:03:43.700> would<00:03:43.819> go

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
this one says 1200 so this card would go

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.140 
this one says 1200 so this card would go
to<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.329> graveyard

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
to the graveyard

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.289 
to the graveyard
but<00:03:47.319> since<00:03:48.579> this<00:03:49.579> card<00:03:49.910> has<00:03:50.109> 1200<00:03:51.109> and<00:03:51.410> attacks

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
but since this card has 1200 and attacks

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.949 
but since this card has 1200 and attacks
this<00:03:53.299> car<00:03:53.739> that<00:03:54.739> has<00:03:54.829> 800<00:03:55.459> that's<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.359> 400

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
this car that has 800 that's a 400

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.059 
this car that has 800 that's a 400
difference<00:03:57.380> so<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.760> will<00:03:58.910> ear<00:03:59.590> opponent<00:04:00.590> that

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
difference so you will ear opponent that

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.979 
difference so you will ear opponent that
you<00:04:01.760> attacked<00:04:02.269> would<00:04:03.019> lose<00:04:03.349> 400<00:04:04.160> Life<00:04:04.190> Points

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
you attacked would lose 400 Life Points

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.110 
you attacked would lose 400 Life Points
because<00:04:05.989> that's<00:04:06.950> how<00:04:07.190> well<00:04:07.700> that's<00:04:07.819> the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
because that's how well that's the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.629 
because that's how well that's the
difference<00:04:08.389> of<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.560> two<00:04:09.739> points<00:04:11.919> so<00:04:12.919> that's

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
difference of the two points so that's

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.080 
difference of the two points so that's
all<00:04:14.419> you'll<00:04:14.660> basically<00:04:14.840> need<00:04:15.169> to<00:04:15.380> know

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
all you'll basically need to know

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.990 
all you'll basically need to know
