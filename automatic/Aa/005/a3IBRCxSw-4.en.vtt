necessarily have to but I'm doing this

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.599 
necessarily have to but I'm doing this
for<00:00:18.270> demonstration<00:00:19.050> purposes<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> way

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
for demonstration purposes and the way

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.900 
for demonstration purposes and the way
we<00:00:20.730> actually<00:00:21.090> create<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> crafting<00:00:21.900> recipe<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
we actually create a crafting recipe is

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.820 
we actually create a crafting recipe is
that<00:00:23.910> there's<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.810> single<00:00:25.170> method<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
that there's a single method we have to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.250 
that there's a single method we have to
call<00:00:26.039> inside<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.789> our<00:00:26.910> load<00:00:27.300> method<00:00:27.480> now<00:00:28.109> it

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
call inside of our load method now it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.720 
call inside of our load method now it
doesn't<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:28.830> called<00:00:29.160> inside<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.609> our

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
doesn't have to be called inside of our

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.310 
doesn't have to be called inside of our
load<00:00:29.970> method<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.570> call<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.900> inside<00:00:31.199> of

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
load method we can call it inside of

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.500 
load method we can call it inside of
another<00:00:31.439> method<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.759> then<00:00:32.910> call<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.360> method

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
another method and then call that method

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.389 
another method and then call that method
inside<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> load<00:00:34.380> method<00:00:34.590> which<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.100> like

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
inside of the load method which I like

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.450 
inside of the load method which I like
to<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> sake<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.890> organization<00:00:37.890> so

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
to do for the sake of organization so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.220 
to do for the sake of organization so
I'm<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.910> create<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.450> new<00:00:39.480> method<00:00:40.079> down

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
I'm going to create a new method down

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.490 
I'm going to create a new method down
here<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.590> it'll<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:42.260> private<00:00:43.260> static<00:00:43.820> void

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
here and it'll be private static void

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.860 
here and it'll be private static void
crafting<00:00:46.789> recipes<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:48.600> no<00:00:48.780> parameters<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
crafting recipes with no parameters and

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.240 
crafting recipes with no parameters and
inside<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> our<00:00:52.110> load<00:00:52.379> method<00:00:52.559> i'm<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.070> going

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
inside of our load method i'm just going

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.020 
inside of our load method i'm just going
to<00:00:53.370> say<00:00:53.660> crafting<00:00:54.660> recipes<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.620> now<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.879> can

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to say crafting recipes so now we can

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.700 
to say crafting recipes so now we can
just<00:01:00.239> put<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.660> our<00:01:00.899> crafting<00:01:01.289> recipes

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
just put all of our crafting recipes

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.060 
just put all of our crafting recipes
inside<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.280> method<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.899> it's<00:01:03.899> very<00:01:04.860> good

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
inside of this method and it's very good

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.070 
inside of this method and it's very good
for<00:01:05.129> organization<00:01:05.970> because<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.930> go

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
for organization because I can just go

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.219 
for organization because I can just go
ahead<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.290> minimize<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:09.180> all<00:01:09.360> goes

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
ahead and minimize this and it all goes

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.429 
ahead and minimize this and it all goes
away<00:01:10.409> temporarily<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.780> way<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.080> actually

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
away temporarily so the way we actually

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.010 
away temporarily so the way we actually
create<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> crafting<00:01:14.250> recipe<00:01:14.869> for<00:01:15.869> this

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
create a crafting recipe for this

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.600 
create a crafting recipe for this
example<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.070> creating<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
example I'm going to be creating a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.240 
example I'm going to be creating a
crafting<00:01:18.030> recipe<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.659> our<00:01:18.689> block<00:01:19.680> tutorial

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
crafting recipe for our block tutorial

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.670 
crafting recipe for our block tutorial
using<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.820> item<00:01:21.119> tutorial<00:01:21.600> diamonds<00:01:22.439> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
using the item tutorial diamonds and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.160 
using the item tutorial diamonds and
dirt<00:01:23.310> block<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:24.630> know<00:01:24.720> why<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> chose

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
dirt block I don't know why I chose

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.190 
dirt block I don't know why I chose
those<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.920> did<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.939> we<00:01:27.420> say<00:01:27.630> game<00:01:28.700> registry

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
those I just did if we say game registry

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.179 
those I just did if we say game registry
dot<00:01:31.200> add<00:01:32.450> recipe<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.770> we're<00:01:34.770> going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:34.979> say

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
dot add recipe and we're going to say

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.840 
dot add recipe and we're going to say
new<00:01:35.460> itemstack<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.159> way<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.280> create<00:01:38.670> an

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
new itemstack so the way you create an

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.100 
new itemstack so the way you create an
item<00:01:39.150> stack<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.689> you'll<00:01:40.259> say<00:01:41.119> either<00:01:42.119> an<00:01:42.659> item

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
item stack is you'll say either an item

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.780 
item stack is you'll say either an item
or<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.320> block<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.040> case<00:01:44.280> we're<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
or a block in this case we're going to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.469 
or a block in this case we're going to
say<00:01:45.030> lock<00:01:45.840> tutorial<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.970> define<00:01:48.119> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
say lock tutorial and then you define a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.109 
say lock tutorial and then you define a
number<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.500> item<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.159> block<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:51.000> this

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
number of that item or block in this

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.990 
number of that item or block in this
case<00:01:51.390> we'll<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.810> say<00:01:51.960> four<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.790> we're<00:01:53.790> going

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
case we'll just say four and we're going

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.649 
case we'll just say four and we're going
to<00:01:54.090> put<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.710> semicolon<00:01:55.710> after<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.210> inside

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
to put a semicolon after it but inside

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.510 
to put a semicolon after it but inside
of<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.899> we're<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.890> we<00:01:58.920> did<00:01:59.189> for

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
of it we're going to do what we did for

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.730 
of it we're going to do what we did for
the<00:01:59.719> custom<00:02:00.719> creative<00:02:01.110> tab<00:02:01.290> if<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.590> watch

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the custom creative tab if you watch

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.560 
the custom creative tab if you watch
that<00:02:01.770> tutorial<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.670> we're<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> add

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
that tutorial and we're going to add

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.950 
that tutorial and we're going to add
these<00:02:04.049> braces<00:02:04.649> right<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.430> then<00:02:06.329> we<00:02:06.689> can

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
these braces right here and then we can

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.229 
these braces right here and then we can
go<00:02:07.560> down<00:02:07.740> here<00:02:07.770> now<00:02:08.459> before<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.060> we

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
go down here now before we do that we

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.800 
go down here now before we do that we
actually<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> add<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> comma<00:02:10.319> or<00:02:11.660> yeah<00:02:12.660> a

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
actually have to add a comma or yeah a

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.370 
actually have to add a comma or yeah a
comma

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
comma

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.330 
comma
and<00:02:13.640> say<00:02:14.640> new<00:02:15.290> object<00:02:16.290> with<00:02:16.950> brackets<00:02:17.780> now<00:02:18.780> i

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
and say new object with brackets now i

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.340 
and say new object with brackets now i
already<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.580> itemstack<00:02:21.230> imported<00:02:22.230> you

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
already have itemstack imported you

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.100 
already have itemstack imported you
might<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.860> import<00:02:23.190> items<00:02:23.460> stack<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.600> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
might have to import items stack so the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.630 
might have to import items stack so the
way<00:02:25.200> we<00:02:25.350> actually<00:02:25.740> create<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.100> recipe<00:02:26.490> is

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
way we actually create the recipe is

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.060 
way we actually create the recipe is
we're<00:02:27.210> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.630> create<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.080> series<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.590> three

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
we're going to create a series of three

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.650 
we're going to create a series of three
strings<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:31.130> with<00:02:32.130> commas<00:02:32.970> after<00:02:33.270> all<00:02:33.390> three

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
strings and with commas after all three

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.410 
strings and with commas after all three
now<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:35.130> don't<00:02:35.250> necessarily<00:02:35.460> have<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.240> have

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
now you don't necessarily have to have

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.500 
now you don't necessarily have to have
three<00:02:36.900> strings<00:02:37.200> i<00:02:37.410> will<00:02:38.340> be<00:02:38.490> showing<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.940> sort

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
three strings i will be showing you sort

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.360 
three strings i will be showing you sort
of<00:02:39.630> how<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> customize<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.680> recipe<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.190> make

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
of how to customize the recipe and make

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.330 
of how to customize the recipe and make
it<00:02:41.550> not<00:02:41.850> require<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.300> full<00:02:42.920> three<00:02:43.920> by<00:02:44.070> three

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
it not require a full three by three

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.670 
it not require a full three by three
crafting<00:02:44.760> table<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:46.110> now<00:02:46.140> we're<00:02:46.650> just

crafting table but for now we're just

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.010 
crafting table but for now we're just
going<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.190> do<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.450> way<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.600> want<00:02:48.900> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
going to do this so the way I want the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.310 
going to do this so the way I want the
recipe<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:50.550> want<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.240> have<00:02:51.750> our

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
recipe to be is I want it to have our

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.710 
recipe to be is I want it to have our
item<00:02:53.010> tutorial<00:02:53.490> down<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.850> sides<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:54.600> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
item tutorial down the sides and in the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.690 
item tutorial down the sides and in the
middle<00:02:54.870> with<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.530> diamond<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.490> top

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
middle with the diamond in the top

middle with the diamond in the top
center<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.300> dirt<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.440> bottom<00:02:58.710> center<00:02:59.070> so

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
center and dirt in the bottom center so

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.370 
center and dirt in the bottom center so
the<00:02:59.820> way<00:02:59.940> we're<00:03:00.120> going<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.330> do<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.870> each

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
the way we're going to do this is each

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.250 
the way we're going to do this is each
of<00:03:01.770> these<00:03:02.310> three<00:03:02.370> strings<00:03:03.060> represents<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.900> row

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
of these three strings represents a row

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.450 
of these three strings represents a row
in<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.770> crafting<00:03:05.070> table<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:06.980> we're<00:03:07.980> going<00:03:08.280> to

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
in the crafting table and we're going to

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.530 
in the crafting table and we're going to
define<00:03:08.640> these<00:03:08.940> rows<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.570> I'm<00:03:09.900> going<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.590> with

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
define these rows so I'm going to with

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.360 
define these rows so I'm going to with
letters<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.870> we<00:03:12.990> choose<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.230> represent<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
letters that we choose to represent the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.700 
letters that we choose to represent the
items<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.910> blocks<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.840> i'm<00:03:15.960> going<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.320> say<00:03:16.470> t

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
items and blocks so i'm going to say t

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.490 
items and blocks so i'm going to say t
dt4<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:19.830> top<00:03:20.070> row<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.780> then<00:03:21.930> i'm<00:03:22.170> going<00:03:22.410> to

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
dt4 the top row and then i'm going to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.850 
dt4 the top row and then i'm going to
say<00:03:23.660> TTT<00:03:24.660> for<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.440> middle<00:03:25.680> row<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.070> then<00:03:26.610> t

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
say TTT for the middle row and then t

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.530 
say TTT for the middle row and then t
lowercase<00:03:28.860> t<00:03:29.070> t<00:03:29.610> for<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.480> bottom<00:03:30.750> row<00:03:31.010> now

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
lowercase t t for the bottom row now

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.120 
lowercase t t for the bottom row now
what<00:03:33.540> do<00:03:33.840> these<00:03:33.990> letters<00:03:34.050> me<00:03:34.560> well<00:03:34.860> these

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
what do these letters me well these

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.370 
what do these letters me well these
letters<00:03:35.550> are<00:03:35.700> completely<00:03:36.300> arbitrary<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:37.140> I

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
letters are completely arbitrary and I

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.020 
letters are completely arbitrary and I
just<00:03:37.650> chose<00:03:37.890> them<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.400> represent<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
just chose them to represent the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.370 
just chose them to represent the
different<00:03:39.150> items<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.780> blocks<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:40.200> we're

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
different items and blocks that we're

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.760 
different items and blocks that we're
using<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:41.490> we<00:03:41.610> actually<00:03:41.790> have<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.360> tell

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
using but we actually have to tell

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.000 
using but we actually have to tell
minecraft<00:03:43.770> what<00:03:44.580> these<00:03:45.290> letters<00:03:46.290> represent

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
minecraft what these letters represent

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.970 
minecraft what these letters represent
so<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.700> way<00:03:47.790> we<00:03:47.940> do<00:03:48.090> this<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.300> we<00:03:48.480> use<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.980> char

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
so the way we do this is we use a char

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.570 
so the way we do this is we use a char
value<00:03:50.880> which<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:51.750> using<00:03:52.560> apostrophes<00:03:52.800> instead

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
value which is using apostrophes instead

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.030 
value which is using apostrophes instead
of<00:03:53.670> quotation<00:03:54.209> marks<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.630> we'll<00:03:55.200> say<00:03:55.410> capital

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
of quotation marks and we'll say capital

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.360 
of quotation marks and we'll say capital
T<00:03:56.310> comma<00:03:57.440> this<00:03:58.580> dot<00:04:00.200> well<00:04:01.200> not<00:04:01.680> even<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:02.160> stop

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
T comma this dot well not even this stop

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.270 
T comma this dot well not even this stop
we<00:04:02.490> can<00:04:02.640> just<00:04:02.790> say<00:04:02.970> item<00:04:03.600> tutorial<00:04:04.410> and<00:04:04.590> then

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
we can just say item tutorial and then

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.610 
we can just say item tutorial and then
we<00:04:05.400> add<00:04:05.550> a<00:04:05.580> comma<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.060> what<00:04:06.959> this<00:04:07.110> is<00:04:07.260> doing<00:04:07.410> is

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
we add a comma and what this is doing is

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.440 
we add a comma and what this is doing is
it<00:04:07.800> saying<00:04:08.040> that<00:04:08.310> whenever<00:04:08.700> it<00:04:09.000> encounters<00:04:09.420> a

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
it saying that whenever it encounters a

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.210 
it saying that whenever it encounters a
tea<00:04:09.750> it<00:04:10.020> should<00:04:10.820> be<00:04:11.990> an<00:04:12.990> item<00:04:13.530> tutorial<00:04:14.040> and

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
tea it should be an item tutorial and

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.880 
tea it should be an item tutorial and
now<00:04:14.970> we<00:04:15.030> go<00:04:15.330> below<00:04:15.780> it<00:04:15.959> and<00:04:16.049> we'll<00:04:16.590> add<00:04:16.739> another

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
now we go below it and we'll add another

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.979 
now we go below it and we'll add another
char<00:04:17.580> value<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.120> we'll<00:04:18.270> say<00:04:18.450> capital<00:04:18.989> D<00:04:19.230> and

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
char value and we'll say capital D and

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.300 
char value and we'll say capital D and
we'll<00:04:21.989> say<00:04:22.169> item<00:04:22.560> dot<00:04:22.970> diamond<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.229> then

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
we'll say item dot diamond and then

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.560 
we'll say item dot diamond and then
another<00:04:26.310> chart<00:04:26.729> and<00:04:26.910> we'll<00:04:27.030> say<00:04:27.180> lower

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
another chart and we'll say lower

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.590 
another chart and we'll say lower
tasty<00:04:27.840> note<00:04:28.200> that<00:04:28.500> cap<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.730> capital<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
tasty note that cap that capital and

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.370 
tasty note that cap that capital and
lowercase<00:04:30.780> all<00:04:31.490> are<00:04:32.750> there<00:04:33.750> two<00:04:33.960> different

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
lowercase all are there two different

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.340 
lowercase all are there two different
values<00:04:35.130> and<00:04:35.400> we<00:04:36.150> can<00:04:36.360> say<00:04:36.600> lock<00:04:37.410> dot<00:04:39.050> now<00:04:40.050> if

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
values and we can say lock dot now if

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.550 
values and we can say lock dot now if
you<00:04:40.500> were<00:04:40.650> using<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:41.210> custom<00:04:42.210> block<00:04:42.600> then<00:04:42.990> you

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
you were using a custom block then you

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.430 
you were using a custom block then you
would<00:04:44.280> just<00:04:44.460> do<00:04:44.790> what<00:04:45.030> we<00:04:45.150> did<00:04:45.360> with<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.230> item

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
would just do what we did with this item

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.300 
would just do what we did with this item
tutorial<00:04:47.100> so<00:04:48.290> this<00:04:49.290> is<00:04:49.500> going<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.860> create<00:04:50.160> a

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
tutorial so this is going to create a

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.430 
tutorial so this is going to create a
crafting<00:04:50.820> recipe<00:04:51.240> if<00:04:51.420> I<00:04:51.600> go<00:04:51.780> ahead<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.200> run

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
crafting recipe if I go ahead and run

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.000 
crafting recipe if I go ahead and run
the<00:04:52.620> game<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:54.510> uses<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:55.170> entire<00:04:55.290> three<00:04:55.860> by

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
the game that uses the entire three by

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.900 
the game that uses the entire three by
three<00:04:56.340> crafting<00:04:57.150> grid<00:04:58.190> but<00:04:59.190> sometimes<00:04:59.520> you're

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
three crafting grid but sometimes you're

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.240 
three crafting grid but sometimes you're
not<00:04:59.970> always<00:05:00.330> going<00:05:00.600> to<00:05:00.720> want<00:05:00.900> to<00:05:01.140> do<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:02.040> and

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
not always going to want to do that and

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.650 
not always going to want to do that and
i'm<00:05:02.370> going<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.640> show<00:05:02.790> you<00:05:02.820> in<00:05:03.060> a<00:05:03.150> second<00:05:03.510> after

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
i'm going to show you in a second after

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.310 
i'm going to show you in a second after
i<00:05:04.110> demonstrate<00:05:04.710> this<00:05:04.890> um<00:05:05.570> how<00:05:06.570> you<00:05:06.630> can<00:05:07.140> make

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
i demonstrate this um how you can make

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.050 
i demonstrate this um how you can make
it<00:05:07.530> use<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.130> smaller<00:05:09.020> area<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.740> guess<00:05:13.550> yeah<00:05:14.550> so<00:05:14.850> if

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
it use a smaller area I guess yeah so if

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.240 
it use a smaller area I guess yeah so if
we<00:05:15.980> go<00:05:16.980> ahead<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:18.110> get<00:05:19.110> a<00:05:19.170> crafting<00:05:19.740> table<00:05:19.770> out

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
we go ahead and get a crafting table out

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.130 
we go ahead and get a crafting table out
we<00:05:20.910> need<00:05:21.150> dirt<00:05:22.400> we<00:05:23.400> have<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.700> diamond<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.540> we

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
we need dirt we have the diamond and we

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.420 
we need dirt we have the diamond and we
have<00:05:25.320> plenty<00:05:26.010> of<00:05:26.190> our<00:05:27.350> tutorial<00:05:28.350> items<00:05:28.680> then

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
have plenty of our tutorial items then

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.620 
have plenty of our tutorial items then
we're<00:05:30.090> going<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.530> go<00:05:31.530> ahead<00:05:31.560> and<00:05:31.980> lay<00:05:32.190> out

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
we're going to go ahead and lay out

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
we're going to go ahead and lay out
these<00:05:33.770> with<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.920> diamond<00:05:35.370> and<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:36.470> dirt<00:05:37.470> and

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
these with the diamond and the dirt and

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.260 
these with the diamond and the dirt and
you'll<00:05:38.100> see<00:05:38.280> it's<00:05:38.400> going<00:05:38.520> to<00:05:38.700> give<00:05:38.850> us<00:05:38.880> four

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
you'll see it's going to give us four

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.170 
you'll see it's going to give us four
tutorial<00:05:39.870> blocks<00:05:40.140> which<00:05:40.920> I<00:05:41.310> can<00:05:41.640> go<00:05:41.970> ahead<00:05:42.060> and

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
tutorial blocks which I can go ahead and

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.040 
tutorial blocks which I can go ahead and
place<00:05:42.480> and<00:05:42.810> all<00:05:43.320> of<00:05:43.890> that<00:05:43.920> goodness<00:05:44.310> now<00:05:45.300> if<00:05:45.600> we

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
place and all of that goodness now if we

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
place and all of that goodness now if we
wanted<00:05:46.590> to<00:05:46.650> actually<00:05:46.860> create<00:05:47.370> a<00:05:47.550> smaller<00:05:49.070> area

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
wanted to actually create a smaller area

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.780 
wanted to actually create a smaller area
I<00:05:50.840> guess<00:05:51.840> then<00:05:52.260> we<00:05:52.770> could<00:05:53.010> say<00:05:53.900> completely

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
I guess then we could say completely

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.360 
I guess then we could say completely
eliminate<00:05:56.790> this<00:05:56.940> middle<00:05:57.270> row<00:05:57.420> and<00:05:58.250> what<00:05:59.250> this

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
eliminate this middle row and what this

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.910 
eliminate this middle row and what this
will<00:05:59.580> do<00:05:59.760> is<00:05:59.910> it's<00:06:00.480> going<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.810> tell<00:06:01.140> minecraft

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
will do is it's going to tell minecraft

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.670 
will do is it's going to tell minecraft
okay<00:06:02.280> you<00:06:02.730> only<00:06:02.970> need<00:06:03.300> two<00:06:03.600> out<00:06:03.900> of<00:06:03.930> three<00:06:04.410> rows

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
okay you only need two out of three rows

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.480 
okay you only need two out of three rows
and<00:06:05.390> they're<00:06:06.390> going<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.810> be<00:06:07.050> with<00:06:07.920> the<00:06:08.040> top<00:06:08.250> row

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
and they're going to be with the top row

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.250 
and they're going to be with the top row
being<00:06:08.910> like<00:06:09.120> this<00:06:09.300> and<00:06:09.510> the<00:06:09.630> bottom<00:06:09.900> row<00:06:10.050> being

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
being like this and the bottom row being

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.500 
being like this and the bottom row being
like<00:06:10.470> this<00:06:10.650> now<00:06:11.340> it<00:06:11.460> doesn't<00:06:11.730> matter<00:06:11.760> where<00:06:12.270> in

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
like this now it doesn't matter where in

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.180 
like this now it doesn't matter where in
the<00:06:12.630> crafting<00:06:12.960> table<00:06:13.020> we<00:06:13.380> place<00:06:13.650> those<00:06:13.920> two

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
the crafting table we place those two

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.260 
the crafting table we place those two
rows<00:06:14.460> but<00:06:15.150> they're<00:06:15.750> going<00:06:16.020> to<00:06:16.140> be<00:06:16.230> placed<00:06:17.270> they

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
rows but they're going to be placed they

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.210 
rows but they're going to be placed they
just<00:06:18.510> have<00:06:18.660> to<00:06:18.780> be<00:06:18.900> too<00:06:19.050> rough<00:06:19.290> like<00:06:19.530> that<00:06:19.710> now

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
just have to be too rough like that now

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.400 
just have to be too rough like that now
if<00:06:20.520> we<00:06:20.670> wanted<00:06:20.970> it<00:06:21.090> to<00:06:21.210> be<00:06:21.330> like<00:06:21.600> a<00:06:21.630> two<00:06:22.230> by<00:06:22.380> two

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
if we wanted it to be like a two by two

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.900 
if we wanted it to be like a two by two
we<00:06:22.860> could<00:06:23.070> just<00:06:23.250> do<00:06:24.000> this<00:06:24.210> and<00:06:24.420> any<00:06:25.380> if<00:06:26.310> it's

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
we could just do this and any if it's

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.510 
we could just do this and any if it's
only<00:06:27.090> two<00:06:27.480> values<00:06:28.170> in<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.770> string<00:06:29.070> then<00:06:29.370> it's

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
only two values in the string then it's

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.560 
only two values in the string then it's
only<00:06:29.670> going<00:06:30.030> to<00:06:30.120> require<00:06:30.450> two<00:06:30.750> columns<00:06:31.230> so

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
only going to require two columns so

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.010 
only going to require two columns so
this<00:06:33.570> time<00:06:33.810> it's<00:06:34.110> only<00:06:34.410> going<00:06:34.560> to<00:06:34.650> require<00:06:34.980> a
