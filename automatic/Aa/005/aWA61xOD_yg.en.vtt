00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.330
 we kill early today we are tackling 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.680
 the realization of an open classic that 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.160
 falls well I do not have one yet 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.660
 1000 videos 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.950
 however as I am not very 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.750
 rich we will try to do that for no 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.640
 expensive ie less than 40 euros 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.020
 go we see the plans this 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.190
 realization is not particularly 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.869
 complicated we need first 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.580
 build two dials wooden battens 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.230
 which will articulate with hinges 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.939
 at the beginning I had thought to be one 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.560
 alone but it would have been a bit complicated 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.269
 to carry while there we can 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.949
 fold in half then just fix 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.060
 or pieces of green cloth on it 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.590
 being careful not to do our 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.790
 small because yes it must be well 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.750
 uniform so that the green fund 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.400
 works correctly 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.920
 last remark I chose to use 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.930
 fabric and not painted wood because 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.820
 it was a little over a year budget and 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.980
 especially these witnesses for manufacturing 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.600
 so we need 4 cleats of 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.400
 24 meters long is to make the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.470
 frames we also need a piece 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.910
 of fabric 1 meter ten wide on 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.640
 promises of shade it's 100% 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.020
 polyester and technology 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.610
 we also need brackets 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.270
 davis soon aggravate the sting 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.690
 various 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.220
 the total is 36 euros 44 Ceylon budget 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.020
 let's start DIY right now 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.610
 with the cutting of the cleats to make 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.289
 the frames then nothing very complicated 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.060
 except that you must not go wrong 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.219
 in the measures of course and try 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.689
 to be precise enough so let's go we're going 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:16.689
 do our measurements quietly 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.090
 good step 1 it was the cutting of 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.070
 cleats it was the easy step to 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.780
 step 2 it's a bit more complicated there 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.160
 it's all about life that's all he 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.920
 must together by means of his little 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.240
 metallic luster that I bought from a 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.320
 it's a little less easy than there 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.550
 I'm going to explain why 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.830
 I give you some tips 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.000
 to get there a little better than me already 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.650
 do not hesitate to get help because 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.840
 that seen with the dimensions with which 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.670
 we work it's a bit difficult to 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.410
 hold everything first, second 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.880
 when you live a novice square 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.979
 and that levis who are closest 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.930
 the corner is done with the four squares 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.790
 why are you going to have a 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.220
 frame that is well flat it will have to 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.660
 check that they are well 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.780
 pressing it on a flat surface like 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.209
 a wall or a floor for example and check 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.820
 so everything is decker because 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.770
 otherwise it will have to adjust the case 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.420
 appropriate and if you have everything slipped and 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.610
 you're going to have a hard time here they tell you 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:32.989
 that before finding his stories that 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:34.280
 you do not do stupidity step 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.410
 intermediary I do not have you 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.940
 show i fixed a hinge here a 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.910
 here you do not see one last 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.370
 there I fixed them off camera because 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.100
 that manipulation is a little bit not 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.299
 complicated but we will say difficult because the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.440
 frames are big enough you have to arrive 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.090
 to hold them to one on the other 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.590
 way I did that off camera for 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.360
 to be quiet but nothing good 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.920
 complicated in the end so so smooth at 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.350
 every time so now we 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.459
 can close another I'm going 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.810
 maybe not doing it here because 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.940
 it was not very practical and that the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.170
 camera i'm going to bang them but that's it 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.489
 will be more convenient for transportation 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.019
 will go to the break or moment fabrics 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.120
 to fix the fabric on the frames 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.380
 I use a stapler the operation is 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.269
 a little less easy than there 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.400
 appears because you have to stretch the fabric but 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.170
 not too much to edit lepi you'll notice 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.090
 in passing I use the matt face of the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.380
 fabric to make the background and not its phase 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.850
 brilliant actually I'm upside down 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.230
 why because the other seemed like a 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.040
 little bit are bright and I'm scared 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.040
 to make reflections 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.099
 here I am going to lay the fabric now 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.569
 it's almost done, we're still 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.250
 last thing to do that we do not 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.050
 do not think it's going to take us 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.090
 put small rings notice and in 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.459
 the wood here to just put 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.810
 after us in a cloud like these 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.970
 the goal is to avoid 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.140
 the screen only closes the fund 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.819
 green actually does not close again after 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.380
 when I was asked against the wall because 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.360
 that he has only one desire of course with the 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.870
 hinges these two packs to close again 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.030
 so we'll put it right for the 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.590
 stall and night that it does not move anymore 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.720
 it's official here I do not have any more 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.220
 of fingers to know screw and that's when 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.840
 even badly in the hand good bah of the blow the 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.380
 find is finished walnut that holds 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.430
 well draws well it's good it's perfect 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.319
 I think it can give a result 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.650
 quite rightly that's good we're going to 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.720
 test 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.340
 for now I'm still at home 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.620
 in front of a simple green background with my 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.810
 dark vador t-shirt and disco ball but 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.010
 assembly we can replace its part by 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.970
 near what we want in fact for example 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.350
 at a forest in magic montage 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.120
 or so if we can go in 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.800
 space 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.490
 not bad it against a lack a little 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.750
 little oxygen 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.100
 we will come back to the place a little bit 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.140
 more classic here are the 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.030
 possibilities are to be countered pretty much 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.460
 it was a report from 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.530
 sign mr ti of science now the 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.180
 Lappish Beavers Are They Aphrodite Weapons? 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.169
 it's a Danish team would be on 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.479
 the point of answering this question 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.490
 existential saw this report 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:53.060
 directed by stÃ©phanie pelletier and bruno 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.660
 the show uh uh stop stop stop on 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.030
 will stop there 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.610
 now at work I will be delighted to

 your favorite software a little 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.190
 search on the internet will be sweet dd I
