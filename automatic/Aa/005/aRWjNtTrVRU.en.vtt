and<00:01:26.700> swing<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.420> over<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> motorcycle<00:01:28.229> side

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
and swing it over to the motorcycle side

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.080 
and swing it over to the motorcycle side
of<00:01:28.500> things<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.549> all<00:01:29.670> benefit

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
of things so that we can all benefit

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.520 
of things so that we can all benefit
from<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> things<00:01:31.140> they've<00:01:31.350> learned

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
from some of the things they've learned

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.550 
from some of the things they've learned
in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> off-road<00:01:32.189> world<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.320> first

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
in the off-road world so the first

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.539 
in the off-road world so the first
things<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.890> notice<00:01:35.040> about<00:01:35.220> these<00:01:35.369> things

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
things you notice about these things

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.740 
things you notice about these things
what<00:01:35.670> they're<00:01:35.820> made<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.479> shock

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
what they're made of the the shock

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.740 
what they're made of the the shock
bodies<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.409> these<00:01:37.680> are<00:01:38.460> made<00:01:39.060> from<00:01:39.270> solid

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.480 
bodies on these are made from solid
billets<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.320> aluminum<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.829> went<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.130> saw<00:01:41.310> their

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
billets of aluminum I went and saw their

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.399 
billets of aluminum I went and saw their
machinery<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.329> cannot<00:01:42.750> believe<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
machinery you cannot believe the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.660 
machinery you cannot believe the
machines<00:01:43.710> they're<00:01:43.890> using<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> make<00:01:44.369> these<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
machines they're using to make these and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.249 
machines they're using to make these and
they<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:44.759> master<00:01:45.240> machinists<00:01:45.750> running<00:01:46.140> all

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
they have master machinists running all

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.179 
they have master machinists running all
the<00:01:46.380> machines<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.829> really

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the machines it's really

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.730 
the machines it's really
confidence-inspiring<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.259> addition<00:01:49.530> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
confidence-inspiring so in addition to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.170 
confidence-inspiring so in addition to
these<00:01:50.009> these<00:01:50.369> bodies<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.060> other

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
these these bodies one of the other

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.609 
these these bodies one of the other
things<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.509> think<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.750> super<00:01:52.200> cool<00:01:52.380> ins<00:01:52.560> if

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
things I think that super cool ins if

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.660 
things I think that super cool ins if
you<00:01:52.680> look<00:01:52.799> at<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.920> eyelets<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.399> these<00:01:53.520> these

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
you look at the eyelets on these these

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.209 
you look at the eyelets on these these
aren't<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.149> standard<00:01:54.570> HD<00:01:55.110> rubber<00:01:55.649> eyelets

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
aren't the standard HD rubber eyelets

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.590 
aren't the standard HD rubber eyelets
that<00:01:56.399> wear<00:01:56.549> out<00:01:56.579> everybody's<00:01:57.210> bike<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that wear out everybody's bike and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
that wear out everybody's bike and
eventually<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.049> all<00:01:58.140> sloppy<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.770> goofy<00:01:59.100> they

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
eventually get all sloppy and goofy they

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.490 
eventually get all sloppy and goofy they
actually<00:01:59.850> use<00:01:59.969> spherical<00:02:00.180> rod<00:02:00.840> bearings<00:02:01.290> here

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
actually use spherical rod bearings here

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.350 
actually use spherical rod bearings here
it's<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> fairly<00:02:02.219> expensive<00:02:02.490> piece<00:02:02.939> relative

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it's a fairly expensive piece relative

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.880 
it's a fairly expensive piece relative
to<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> simple<00:02:03.869> rubber<00:02:04.049> bushing<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.740> also

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
to a simple rubber bushing but it's also

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.950 
to a simple rubber bushing but it's also
very<00:02:05.009> very<00:02:05.729> effective<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.299> locks<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.719> shock

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
very very effective it locks the shock

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.570 
very very effective it locks the shock
right<00:02:07.200> into<00:02:07.350> place<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.799> doesn't<00:02:07.950> allow<00:02:08.129> any

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
right into place and doesn't allow any

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.100 
right into place and doesn't allow any
lateral<00:02:09.060> movement<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.539> shouldn't<00:02:09.959> be

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
lateral movement that shouldn't be

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.639 
lateral movement that shouldn't be
happening

it's<00:02:11.039> pretty<00:02:11.250> cool<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:12.599> going<00:02:12.720> back<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.959> those

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
it's pretty cool so going back to those

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
set of rivo a shocks

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.349 
set of rivo a shocks
rivo<00:02:53.010> a's<00:02:53.250> are<00:02:53.519> distinguished<00:02:53.940> by<00:02:54.000> you'll<00:02:54.239> see

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
rivo a's are distinguished by you'll see

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.089 
rivo a's are distinguished by you'll see
this<00:02:54.480> clicker<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.109> and<00:02:55.349> what<00:02:55.680> these<00:02:55.829> allow

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
this clicker here and what these allow

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.250 
this clicker here and what these allow
you<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.310> adjust<00:02:56.549> is<00:02:56.940> rebound<00:02:57.629> damping<00:02:57.930> so

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
you to adjust is rebound damping so

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.099 
you to adjust is rebound damping so
rebound<00:02:58.620> damping<00:02:58.829> is<00:02:59.160> how<00:02:59.370> fast<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.819> shock

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
rebound damping is how fast the shock

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.569 
rebound damping is how fast the shock
extends<00:03:01.109> after<00:03:01.560> it's<00:03:01.680> been<00:03:01.859> compressed<00:03:02.250> after

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
extends after it's been compressed after

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.339 
extends after it's been compressed after
you<00:03:02.670> hit<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.849> bump<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.690> can<00:03:03.840> actually<00:03:04.079> dial

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
you hit a bump so you can actually dial

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.229 
you hit a bump so you can actually dial
in<00:03:04.530> exactly<00:03:04.890> how<00:03:05.099> fast<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.579> shock<00:03:05.760> returns

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
in exactly how fast your shock returns

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.300 
in exactly how fast your shock returns
to<00:03:06.450> its<00:03:06.569> fully<00:03:06.810> extended<00:03:07.440> state<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:08.099> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
to its fully extended state in the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.130 
to its fully extended state in the
positions<00:03:08.730> they<00:03:08.849> have<00:03:09.060> for<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.019> to

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
positions they have for you here to

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.869 
positions they have for you here to
adjust<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.560> again<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.220> totally<00:03:11.340> -<00:03:11.670> let's

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
adjust and again this is totally - let's

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.309 
adjust and again this is totally - let's
just<00:03:12.060> spin<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.420> knob<00:03:12.599> and<00:03:12.840> you're<00:03:13.109> pretty

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
just spin the knob and you're pretty

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.780 
just spin the knob and you're pretty
much<00:03:13.470> set<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.950> fly<00:03:14.099> there's<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.489> lot<00:03:14.670> of

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
much set to fly there's a lot of

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.069 
much set to fly there's a lot of
adjustability<00:03:15.150> in<00:03:15.569> these<00:03:15.810> shocks

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
adjustability in these shocks

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.349 
adjustability in these shocks
considering<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.099> is<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> coil<00:03:17.730> suspension

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
considering this is a coil suspension

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.210 
considering this is a coil suspension
and<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.569> is<00:03:18.750> there<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.709> their<00:03:19.829> you<00:03:20.190> know

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
and this is there this is their you know

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.979 
and this is there this is their you know
I<00:03:20.430> would<00:03:20.609> say<00:03:20.730> their<00:03:20.880> budget<00:03:21.419> line<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.810> things

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
I would say their budget line of things

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.690 
I would say their budget line of things
there's<00:03:22.410> really<00:03:22.590> just<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:23.069> much<00:03:23.220> available

these<00:03:40.950> products<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.430> these<00:03:41.579> are<00:03:41.790> not<00:03:41.970> the

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
these products that these are not the

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.490 
these products that these are not the
prettiest<00:03:42.690> shocks<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.109> world<00:03:43.290> there's

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
prettiest shocks in the world there's

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.110 
prettiest shocks in the world there's
some<00:03:43.650> dingers<00:03:43.980> on<00:03:44.099> these<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.639> reason<00:03:44.819> there's

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
some dingers on these the reason there's

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.699 
some dingers on these the reason there's
there<00:03:45.510> there<00:03:45.840> are<00:03:45.959> dingers<00:03:46.260> on<00:03:46.349> these<00:03:46.560> is

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
there there are dingers on these is

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.140 
there there are dingers on these is
because<00:03:47.010> these<00:03:47.190> are<00:03:47.310> actually<00:03:47.400> used<00:03:47.819> shocks

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
because these are actually used shocks

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.879 
because these are actually used shocks
these<00:03:48.450> came<00:03:48.690> off<00:03:48.840> of<00:03:48.870> our<00:03:49.109> Street<00:03:49.500> Glide

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
these came off of our Street Glide

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.589 
these came off of our Street Glide
so<00:03:50.280> we<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.639> one<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.910> these<00:03:51.060> things<00:03:51.239> here<00:03:51.450> at

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
so we have one of these things here at

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.330 
so we have one of these things here at
RevZilla<00:03:52.109> we<00:03:52.260> have<00:03:52.349> a<00:03:52.380> 13<00:03:52.709> Street<00:03:52.950> Glide<00:03:53.160> and

RevZilla we have a 13 Street Glide and

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.849 
RevZilla we have a 13 Street Glide and
these<00:03:54.180> shocks<00:03:54.540> actually<00:03:55.109> came<00:03:55.380> off<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.769> I

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
these shocks actually came off it I

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.520 
these shocks actually came off it I
actually<00:03:56.069> rode<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.760> Sturgis<00:03:57.329> where<00:03:58.079> we<00:03:58.290> had<00:03:58.500> a

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
actually rode to Sturgis where we had a

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.830 
actually rode to Sturgis where we had a
set<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:58.859> these<00:03:59.010> put<00:03:59.310> on<00:03:59.459> our<00:03:59.639> bike<00:03:59.819> legend<00:04:00.569> put

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
set of these put on our bike legend put

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.150 
set of these put on our bike legend put
a<00:04:00.870> set<00:04:01.109> on<00:04:01.260> there<00:04:01.440> for<00:04:01.650> us<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:01.859> was<00:04:01.980> able<00:04:02.069> to

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
a set on there for us and I was able to

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.530 
a set on there for us and I was able to
ride<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.400> back<00:04:02.639> so<00:04:02.790> I<00:04:02.849> was<00:04:02.970> able<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.150> do<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.269> back
