00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
wonderful day for today's video I

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.080 
wonderful day for today's video I
thought<00:00:07.919> I'd<00:00:07.980> share<00:00:08.340> with<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.490> my<00:00:08.790> first

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
thought I'd share with you my first

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.339 
thought I'd share with you my first
impression<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:10.280> anastasia<00:00:11.280> dipbrow<00:00:11.490> and

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
impression of this anastasia dipbrow and

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.259 
impression of this anastasia dipbrow and
my<00:00:13.349> shade<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.620> chocolate<00:00:14.340> but<00:00:14.820> they<00:00:15.089> have<00:00:15.240> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
my shade is chocolate but they have a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.540 
my shade is chocolate but they have a
range<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.660> different<00:00:15.990> shades<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:17.070> believe

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
range of different shades and I believe

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.400 
range of different shades and I believe
this<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.570> darkest<00:00:18.900> shade<00:00:19.109> there

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
this one was not the darkest shade there

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.140 
this one was not the darkest shade there
were<00:00:19.560> two<00:00:19.920> more<00:00:20.100> darker<00:00:20.520> shades<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.880> believe

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
were two more darker shades I believe

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.970 
were two more darker shades I believe
something<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:22.619> that's<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.890> it's

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
something like that but that's what it's

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.890 
something like that but that's what it's
not<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> darkest<00:00:23.519> shade<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:24.689> has

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
not the darkest shade and this one has

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.040 
not the darkest shade and this one has
more<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.500> red<00:00:25.949> tone<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.510> which<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.689> usually

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
more of a red tone to it which I usually

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.679 
more of a red tone to it which I usually
hate<00:00:28.349> but<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.760> felt<00:00:29.970> like<00:00:30.000> out<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.330> all<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
hate but I just felt like out of all the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.179 
hate but I just felt like out of all the
trees<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:30.990> they<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.859> would<00:00:32.009> be

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
trees that they have this one would be

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.910 
trees that they have this one would be
the<00:00:32.700> best<00:00:32.969> fit<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:33.870> my<00:00:34.020> hair<00:00:34.230> color<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.800> my

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
the best fit for my hair color for my

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.430 
the best fit for my hair color for my
skin<00:00:35.190> tone<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.640> just<00:00:36.390> everything<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:37.079> that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
skin tone and just everything like that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
skin tone and just everything like that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
my brows just kind of upward and as you

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.710 
my brows just kind of upward and as you
can<00:02:58.799> see<00:02:59.130> like<00:02:59.610> right<00:02:59.940> here<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.299> don't<00:03:00.600> really

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
can see like right here I don't really

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.870 
can see like right here I don't really
have<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.959> problem<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.160> front<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.489> my<00:03:02.640> brow

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
have a problem and the front of my brow

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.059 
have a problem and the front of my brow
but<00:03:03.180> my<00:03:03.299> problem<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.930> really<00:03:04.319> back<00:03:04.709> here

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
but my problem is really back here

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.670 
but my problem is really back here
because<00:03:05.610> naturally<00:03:06.420> my<00:03:06.630> brows<00:03:06.930> are<00:03:07.230> actually

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
because naturally my brows are actually

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.970 
because naturally my brows are actually
like<00:03:07.890> down<00:03:08.489> here<00:03:08.540> they<00:03:09.540> go<00:03:09.720> lower<00:03:10.019> but<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.440> did<00:03:10.709> I

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
like down here they go lower but I did I

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.500 
like down here they go lower but I did I
didn't<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.850> just<00:03:11.880> makes<00:03:12.120> my<00:03:12.360> eyes

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
didn't like that it just makes my eyes

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.840 
didn't like that it just makes my eyes
look<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.959> know<00:03:13.140> Jupe<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.650> stuff<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.489> I'm

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
look you know Jupe and stuff so I'm

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.090 
look you know Jupe and stuff so I'm
trying<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.359> shape<00:03:15.570> them<00:03:15.810> now<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.049> go<00:03:16.560> up<00:03:16.799> higher

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
trying to shape them now to go up higher

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.580 
trying to shape them now to go up higher
so<00:03:17.209> this<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.329> what<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.019> far<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.320> would

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
so this is what I have so far I would

at<00:05:20.649> it<00:05:20.769> right<00:05:20.859> now<00:05:21.039> before<00:05:21.249> I<00:05:21.489> brush<00:05:21.789> it<00:05:21.969> out

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:22.059 
at it right now before I brush it out

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:24.809 
at it right now before I brush it out
with<00:05:22.209> this<00:05:22.329> week<00:05:22.719> I<00:05:23.049> feel<00:05:23.979> like<00:05:24.129> this<00:05:24.339> color<00:05:24.609> is

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
with this week I feel like this color is

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.909 
with this week I feel like this color is
actually<00:05:24.969> perfect<00:05:25.659> for<00:05:25.749> my<00:05:26.229> skin<00:05:26.739> tone

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
actually perfect for my skin tone

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.559 
actually perfect for my skin tone
obviously<00:05:27.759> it's<00:05:27.849> a<00:05:27.879> little<00:05:28.089> bit<00:05:28.179> too<00:05:28.359> harsh

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
obviously it's a little bit too harsh

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.779 
obviously it's a little bit too harsh
now<00:05:28.779> before<00:05:29.139> I<00:05:29.169> brush<00:05:29.769> it<00:05:29.799> out<00:05:30.099> so<00:05:30.609> I<00:05:30.669> always
