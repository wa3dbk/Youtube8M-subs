00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.649
 good afternoon decided to make a small 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.150
 rat video not only they are mine 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.650
 impressions of the rat 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.960
 very good very good knife 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.529
 especially considering its price quality and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.270
 the like but there are also disadvantages 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.320
 that is, started about the virtues of sweat and 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.849
 disadvantages dignity it seems 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.740
 ability to open with one hand 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:36.090
 quite powerful powerful shoes very 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.350
 aus 8 quality steel is quite good 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.350
 pen made 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:47.039
 fat decent liner and here it is 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.610
 wins among similar even knives 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.770
 size I have for example the meaning of 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.930
 no smith and wesson c to 70 and there 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.930
 much thinner liner although the dimensions seem to be 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:06.170
 the same type of tactical knife of the minuses 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.170
 note the following first 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.010
 if you can see, yes, I had to finish 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.580
 modifying screws i.e. those screws 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.640
 who are up to 6 little Lena who are inside in 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.939
 screw that hexagon he actually 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.040
 very bad 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.130
 spinning and i even have a screwdriver which i 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.009
 bought on pretty quickly starts us 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.259
 I had to slip through 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.579
 files who are such burrs here 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.570
 it was possible with the help of ordinary 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.619
 swiss knife disassemble it notch 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.899
 this is a very good quality one and 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:50.070
 allows you to keep a good knife 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:54.119
 very comfortable grip 2 minus right here 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.750
 obviously now so sorry camera 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:02.130
 Only bought so not yet accustomed here 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.170
 here these liners inside here these here 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.400
 polished now but in fact they 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.860
 There are such satin pretty 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.800
 not very nice to say that I have them already 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.480
 when I was cleaning the knife, I simply 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.640
 polished here from the minuses that should 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.320
 say but on reception on from minuses i 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.920
 I still think its price is somewhat 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:33.410
 too big for example that is, I bought it 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:35.870
 for 370 hryvnia for 130 hryvnia I was given 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.680
 my children are like that 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:45.740
 toy size real toy it 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:49.760
 boker magnum garden is also one hand and 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.620
 the opening we put next and here we are 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.930
 starting to see what actually 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.840
 same edge although the handle is significantly 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.970
 It is different and what is the essence and the essence is 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.670
 that if we put it like this we 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:10.580
 see that they are almost the same 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:13.040
 although here there is this part she does 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.940
 longer edge but in fact it is not 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.830
 gives a big plus is enough and 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.709
 of both the knife to cut to 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.260
 for example 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:28.130
 a loaf of sweat or a bun loaf of bread 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:32.980
 the thickness is just enough but the difference is 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.660
 This price is 370, and this one is 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.170
 130 hryvnia way can be found for 100 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.739
 120 kopecks and a second big plus 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.610
 let's say this same inexpensive boker and this 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:54.590
 its weight if we take a rat and pay 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:57.519
 I have a ratâ€™s attention without a clip, then we 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.519
 we can here 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:11.220
 then here we take try the weight of the rat 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:16.440
 without clip 137 grams and now for the same 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:19.350
 scale look without poker with a clip 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:26.930
 it's 84 grams 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:31.410
 and this despite the fact that the boker is actually less 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:36.090
 cheaper and much better in your pocket 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.660
 of the cons of booker of course is 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.660
 what is it 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:49.949
 440 steel is not the worst but they are worse 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.250
 still than in rats and the second is here 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:56.610
 the same torque that will have soon 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:02.570
 just do not want to shuffle the camera 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:06.150
 induced because the black color is but 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.820
 considering its price and weight it is now mine 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.220
 choice number one second is that rat 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.210
 is a substitute for a very convenient 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.630
 marching knife which by the way is very 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:26.840
 low weight 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:29.880
 namely 137 grams is mara 2000 outdoor 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:35.720
 why am I saying that this is a very yes replacement 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.720
 we just open one knife 2 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.410
 add up and we see how these knives 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.180
 look alike ie this 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.800
 virtually identical and knives to pluses 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.570
 mary can be attributed firstly price 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.919
 well below the rat 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:56.220
 in the second I had to rat 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:00.449
 work post garden had to 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.910
 clean the broth and for example if the knife 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.570
 everything falls here this place gets clogged 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.300
 a knife is completely covered with dirt 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.490
 completely disassemble the cleaners and the 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.270
 similar if you divide by this knife 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.580
 fish 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.630
 there will be trouble with this already nothing 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.550
 threatens nothing because everything is here 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:27.810
 pressed in 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:30.360
 it's easy to wash and here too 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.870
 stainless steel and by the way one more 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.430
 minus rats is that steel aus 8 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:41.430
 she really is not 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:43.230
 stainless steel and so-called steel with 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:45.870
 high rust resistance 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:49.710
 in other words you can look in 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.780
 There are videos on the Internet where the rat is 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.010
 rust catches the spots these spots need 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.720
 go out and have a few more words about poker 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.690
 boker goes initially here in such 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.700
 box as a gift very 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.890
 I get a good thing there 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.890
 now your things are stored there flash drives and 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:10.850
 so here now 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.850
 a little rat
