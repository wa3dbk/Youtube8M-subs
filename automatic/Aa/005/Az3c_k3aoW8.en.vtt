that<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.490> downloaded<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.360> was<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.750> change<00:02:25.780> my

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
that I downloaded this was to change my

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.820 
that I downloaded this was to change my
field<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.500> view<00:02:26.740> you<00:02:27.660> are<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.930> does<00:02:29.200> let<00:02:29.710> you

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
field of view you are it does let you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.550 
field of view you are it does let you
change<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.400> within<00:02:30.690> battlefield<00:02:31.690> -<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:32.470> think

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
change it within battlefield - I think

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.520 
change it within battlefield - I think
it's<00:02:32.830> up<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.070> 90<00:02:33.490> from<00:02:33.880> 60<00:02:34.450> sort<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.290> something

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
it's up to 90 from 60 sort of something

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.010 
it's up to 90 from 60 sort of something
like<00:02:36.130> that<00:02:36.340> 70<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:37.210> 90<00:02:37.600> or<00:02:37.630> something<00:02:37.960> like

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
like that 70 to 90 or something like

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.280 
like that 70 to 90 or something like
that<00:02:38.110> but<00:02:38.860> within<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:40.150> program<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:41.080> can

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
that but within this program you can

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.200 
that but within this program you can
change<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.100> up<00:02:42.250> -<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:43.150> can<00:02:43.300> go<00:02:43.450> up<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.980> 175

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
change it up - you can go up to 175

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.410 
change it up - you can go up to 175
which<00:02:46.210> is<00:02:46.420> actually<00:02:46.900> crazy<00:02:47.290> then<00:02:48.130> if<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.270> want

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
which is actually crazy then if you want

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.420 
which is actually crazy then if you want
to<00:02:49.480> be<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.840> bit<00:02:50.260> stupid<00:02:50.470> and<00:02:50.800> go<00:02:50.920> for<00:02:51.130> that<00:02:51.250> then

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
to be a bit stupid and go for that then

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.630 
to be a bit stupid and go for that then
fair<00:02:51.940> enough<00:02:52.170> but<00:02:53.170> what<00:02:53.740> I<00:02:53.770> like<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.160> plan<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.610> a

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
fair enough but what I like to plan is a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.770 
fair enough but what I like to plan is a
my<00:02:55.240> field<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.630> view<00:02:55.720> of<00:02:56.070> 115<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:57.610> those<00:02:57.780> 115

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
my field of view of 115 so those 115

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.330 
my field of view of 115 so those 115
obviously<00:02:59.500> and<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:02.500> pretty<00:03:02.800> much<00:03:02.950> that

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
obviously and that's pretty much that

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.610 
obviously and that's pretty much that
all<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.460> used<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.060> for<00:03:04.090> it's<00:03:04.990> just<00:03:05.200> another<00:03:05.410> way

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
