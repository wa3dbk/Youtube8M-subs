00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.400
 hi friends and today is interesting 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.620
 an experiment called on the road and 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.510
 face if anyone is interested then this experience 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.130
 will be able to repeat himself to everyone at home 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.900
 it is natural to observe the elementary 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.790
 safety and so us 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.370
 will need pure hydrogens for this i 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.250
 assembled the simplest will take him powerful 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.419
 electric current model 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.090
 decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.770
 and since we need pure hydrogen then 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.650
 he is endowed with a special separator 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.020
 contributed grew like plastic in yoga further 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.760
 will need a receiver to collect gas is 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.920
 would be the usual rubber heat 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.370
 well, the last detail Nikita empty 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.590
 through-hole chicken and 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.450
 i will substitute that from plastic and 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.580
 during hydrogen evolution and generator 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.530
 also stands out from pardon with prayed 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.970
 so that the water does not fall on the conscience of the game 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.979
 you can use 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:18.560
 water board is now possible 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:18.560
 plug in power supply 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.180
 but here I have collected enough 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.220
 hydrogen to experiment about the essence of the angle 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.590
 what if you set fire to a seasoned egg 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.610
 the roads for some time and give 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.630
 then explode 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.630
 check it 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.489
 close and also to repeat this 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.189
 experiment from even more simple way 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:11.620
 hydrogen production with acids and 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.620
 any metal reacting to them 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.940
 everyone who liked this experiment 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.950
 like do not forget to subscribe 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.950
 but I doubt goodbye to all for a long time
