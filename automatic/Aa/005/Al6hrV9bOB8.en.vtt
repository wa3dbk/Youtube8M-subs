I<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.319> number<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.650> programs<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.250> are

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
I is the number of programs that are

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.630 
I is the number of programs that are
here<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.670> here's<00:02:15.120> HDC<00:02:15.659> calculator<00:02:16.250> HTC<00:02:17.250> album

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
here so here's HDC calculator HTC album

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.520 
here so here's HDC calculator HTC album
it<00:02:17.730> has<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.000> same<00:02:18.209> icon<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:18.900> each<00:02:19.080> thing<00:02:19.349> but
