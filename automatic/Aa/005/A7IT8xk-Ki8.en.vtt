00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:36.929
 This picture 

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.929
 with that inter x 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.999

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.129
 and changing 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.439
 attended his evil whenever he wished 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.509
 in other tests you can 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:04.679
 only I know about me is so kind of low on others too 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.249
 the way I 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.229
 but mine was more modern here 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:11.839
 16 min 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.839

 you end up with people's comments 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.239
 in my case I think this course here 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:34.639
 Good pity that there are few certain jobs that have enough right 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.249
 good games too 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:41.219

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.169
 They also trusted this one. 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.819
 but if you want me to stay down here 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:07.909
 Did you make the right phone call? 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.909
 there the cepac page appears 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:13.799
 this makes it save 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.939

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.080
 she looked like page 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.800
 but put to salvation 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.319

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.689

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.849
 the first fall in the water 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.960
 has fourteen lilia two socks are very and very light 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.330

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.210
 rest made here 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.919
 and I have at least 20 days to eat 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.919
 the right synapses 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.509
 cq vital steel crude in the azores work said

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.689
 two clicks 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.410

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.650
 this zico tac milk 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.650
 the identity of the duo 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.270
 Loading 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.830
 the loading depends a lot on the computer - it was a bit more 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:46.059
 faster reading 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:48.129
 Mind with my here ansa 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.699

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.139
 danette 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.580
 she carried 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.819
 I'm canceling here because this year's attractions 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.860
 There are those near the end. 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.860
 I have to cancel the pens. 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.409
 I hope this year will open 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.969
 smart boys 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:19.710
 here we are option 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.930
 they asked to change again 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.909

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.199
 markus schulz 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.949
 course effects 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.590
 these ones today I could not find out why the year had to be done 

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:52.419
 since you'd think so 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.199
 I think it's really low 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.199
 I want this straw as substitutes. 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.580
 everything is made sound of success 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.080
 the chosen ones 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.409
 Sorrentino 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:10.409
 it makes sense to put anything not only made the alert polanski 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:13.360
 so until the course done 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.520
 the term of the aol 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.809
 anyone who wants 

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:19.180
 but these pains 

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.530
 on the internet 6 thousand so it's better to put more ready here 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.999
 together 

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:30.999
 the 871 billion bid 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.270
 there changes for you drags thing 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.930
 he changed 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.919
 if the couple 

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:40.309
 all of it there 

00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:43.360
 claudio jorge was there a course and more personalized 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.370
 too much 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.279
 any doubt enter my bed 

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:49.719
 I wrote this article 

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.479
 it's there at that level 

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:54.819
 tea pot 

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:56.419
 Henrique 

00:07:56.419 --> 00:07:57.779
 92 

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:59.830
 the tub 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.830
 at this point with 

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:06.539
 its entry into force of the code 

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:08.409
 I already called the staff.
