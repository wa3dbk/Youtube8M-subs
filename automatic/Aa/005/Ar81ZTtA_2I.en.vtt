00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Now, let's make the cake, but we 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.940
 starts with caramel 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.710
 this method is done with a cup of 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.710
 sugar and a half of water 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.660
 We need to mix delicately. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.670
 I always think it's better to do this. 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.510
 mix with the finger, even so we 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.510
 does not stir much sugar with water 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.520
 The secret to this caramel does not burn 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.140
 It's after we turn the fire on 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.060
 stir more over medium heat this gravy takes 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.700
 about 15 minutes to get to the point 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.630

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.630
 in the length direction 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.560
 and when it reaches that point we do 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.560
 for shape 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.860

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.659
