00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
thing we're going to do now is we're

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.320 
thing we're going to do now is we're
going<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.590> actually<00:02:19.709> blend<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:20.970> because<00:02:21.240> it

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
going to actually blend it in because it

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.820 
going to actually blend it in because it
will<00:02:21.420> be<00:02:21.570> very<00:02:21.600> shiny<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.320> top<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.770> it

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
will be very shiny on the top and it

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.160 
will be very shiny on the top and it
will<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:23.070> noticeable<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.930> want<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.110> be

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
will be noticeable you just want to be

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.040 
will be noticeable you just want to be
carefully<00:02:25.560> or<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:25.830> removed<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.370> Apple

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050

engraving and the letters on the bottom

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.280 
engraving and the letters on the bottom
suggest<00:02:29.540> usually<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> couple<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.959> seconds

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
suggest usually a couple of seconds

00:02:31.290 --> 00:03:10.080 
suggest usually a couple of seconds
that's<00:02:31.440> it

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.910 

you<00:03:10.900> can<00:03:11.080> buy<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.290> sheets<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.739> sandpaper
