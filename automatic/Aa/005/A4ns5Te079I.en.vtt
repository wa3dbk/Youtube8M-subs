00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.420
 All beautiful hair of Ghent, can you see him? 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.840

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.030
 I like the garland a lot and the 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.770
 her perfect collective 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.800

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.590

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.550
 I'll leave a photo on the blog, that's better. 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.880
 to see the details and that's it 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.450
 is the meaning of the act because I made a 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.340
 bike katrina online I already told you 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.620
 a little bit of blatche history with 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.200
 What was it made for the kid? 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.680
 but then it was introduced into the world 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.690
 fashion and the staff just graph the galley 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.750
 the world of fashion love fell in love 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.870
 stylists and everything else then she 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.199
 represents for me fashion photography and 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.350
 stayed away because she loves a little sheet 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:46.090
 so that's why bling and there Katrina for 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.020
 who does not know the history of catrina 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.930
 that woman half-type chair 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.990
 Mexican culture is the popular Mexican 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.100
 type a represents for popular culture 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.160
 mexican 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.400
 Good, they took a picture of a 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.090
 socialite so well known already there 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.660
 a long time ago muito rica muito diva 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.449
 and as a satire they painted her 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.630
 skull but with cheerful things like that 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.660
 left her all as a skull and 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.090
 if she were an all-embracing dead woman 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.699
 everything else to say what is not 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.430
 matter if you are rich 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:30.090
 if you poor everyone one day I 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.160
 die every one day goes away 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.409
 so that's why it's one thing 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.840
 I also want to take the rest of the 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.479
 My life is to take everyone in the 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.669
 equality everyone is equal everyone 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.979
 is a human being independent of the condition 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:48.180
 I have financially and that is why I 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:52.630
 I made is the meaning still my armadillo 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.669
 new and the biggest pain of all that I 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.440
 I did something else that I wanted to talk to. 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.900
 that ask me a lipstick that I'm 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.199
 using in the last video they asked me and 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.250
 so I made a very nice mixer 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:10.979
 with the I play in the middle that tone more 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:16.990
 Of course here is daniks is summer love 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:18.669
 617 and I make the sides and a contour 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.979
 and I'll give it another pass so to 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.940
 merge with the royal rose veil lipstick 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.099
 apothecary 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.120
 so this is what I'm using it 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:36.240
 increases the lips and with a color well 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.240
 beautiful and that's it folks had so much new 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.419
 I like and then I want to accomplish many 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.500
 goals 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.510

 people have independent money if the 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.700
 People do not have to smile and go. 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.730
 try to seek to go 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.830
 the best, the good side of life was not 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.280
 This time I did kill everything. 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.280
 end
