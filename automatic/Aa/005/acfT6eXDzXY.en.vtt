00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
fermentation really easily so I'm very

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.480 
fermentation really easily so I'm very
prone<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.439> search<00:01:19.439> for<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:20.220> hyper

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
one of my all-time favorite blushes at

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.119 
one of my all-time favorite blushes at
the<00:02:56.680> moment<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:58.299> is<00:02:58.359> like<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> mix<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.650> NARS

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
the moment it is like a mix of NARS

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.270 
the moment it is like a mix of NARS
madly<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.299> Tarte<00:03:02.169> expose<00:03:02.590> on<00:03:02.829> your<00:03:02.980> cheeks

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
madly and Tarte expose on your cheeks

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.670 
madly and Tarte expose on your cheeks
not<00:03:03.669> necessarily<00:03:04.419> in<00:03:04.689> the<00:03:05.019> pan<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.290> think

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
not necessarily in the pan I think

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.429 
not necessarily in the pan I think
because<00:03:06.040> Tarte<00:03:06.579> exposed<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.329> a<00:03:07.750> lot<00:03:08.200> more

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
because Tarte exposed is a lot more

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.770 
because Tarte exposed is a lot more
plump<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.280> if<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:09.939> doesn't<00:03:10.150> show<00:03:10.480> through

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
plump and if that doesn't show through

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.960 
plump and if that doesn't show through
in<00:03:11.169> the<00:03:11.349> color<00:03:11.590> but<00:03:11.950> when<00:03:12.099> you<00:03:12.189> put<00:03:12.430> it<00:03:12.519> on<00:03:12.609> your

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
in the color but when you put it on your

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.759 
in the color but when you put it on your
cheeks<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.419> really<00:03:13.690> does<00:03:13.900> transfer<00:03:14.379> as<00:03:14.560> that

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
cheeks it really does transfer as that

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.050
