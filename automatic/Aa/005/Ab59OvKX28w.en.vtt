using<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.510> for<00:03:02.720> text<00:03:02.930> battery<00:03:03.230> yeah<00:03:03.950> that

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
using this for text battery yeah that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.949 
using this for text battery yeah that
you<00:03:04.370> can't<00:03:04.670> see<00:03:04.940> how<00:03:05.209> much<00:03:05.360> bet<00:03:05.540> you<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:05.810> have

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
you can't see how much bet you you have

left but on the bright side to that is

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.180 
left but on the bright side to that is
that<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.150> products<00:03:08.570> battery<00:03:08.900> only<00:03:09.080> costs<00:03:09.799> the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
that the products battery only costs the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.050 
that the products battery only costs the
third<00:03:10.940> of<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.269> price<00:03:11.420> here<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.140> costs<00:03:13.000> let<00:03:14.000> me

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
third of the price here it costs let me

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.530 
third of the price here it costs let me
show<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.299> guys<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.510> box<00:03:14.660> is<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.989> cost

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.380 

100<00:03:18.540> ringgit<00:03:18.870> as<00:03:19.050> compared<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.910> original

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
100 ringgit as compared to the original

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.920 
100 ringgit as compared to the original
battery<00:03:21.959> costs<00:03:22.580> 330<00:03:23.580> ringgit<00:03:24.090> which<00:03:24.720> means

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
battery costs 330 ringgit which means

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.390 
battery costs 330 ringgit which means
that<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.080> can<00:03:25.170> technically<00:03:25.620> battery<00:03:26.250> of

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
that you can technically battery of

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.490 
that you can technically battery of
these<00:03:26.580> fellas<00:03:26.970> here<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.330> replace<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:28.050> one

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
these fellas here to replace that one

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.020 
these fellas here to replace that one
battery<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.069> while<00:03:29.250> your<00:03:29.430> battery<00:03:29.670> goes<00:03:29.819> out

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
battery so while your battery goes out

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.759 
battery so while your battery goes out
just<00:03:30.269> flop<00:03:30.599> another<00:03:30.989> one<00:03:31.170> swap<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.530> another

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
just flop another one swap to another

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.710 
just flop another one swap to another
and<00:03:31.920> software<00:03:32.310> another<00:03:32.519> one<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.420> is

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
and software another one and that is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.110 
and software another one and that is
good<00:03:33.959> enough<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.200> come<00:03:34.440> up<00:03:34.500> with<00:03:34.709> your<00:03:35.130> tree

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
good enough to come up with your tree

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.550 
good enough to come up with your tree
batteries<00:03:36.599> there<00:03:36.810> itself<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:39.090> that's<00:03:39.480> all<00:03:40.200> for

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
batteries there itself so that's all for

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.110 
batteries there itself so that's all for
the<00:03:40.739> phottix<00:03:41.099> batteries<00:03:41.550> i<00:03:41.640> think<00:03:41.880> this

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
the phottix batteries i think this

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.199 
the phottix batteries i think this
nothing<00:03:42.660> else<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.870> say<00:03:43.019> about<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:44.209> this

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
nothing else to say about it this

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.820
