00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
let's get underway with the fight I will

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.949 
let's get underway with the fight I will
start<00:02:15.440> off<00:02:15.620> with<00:02:16.129> using<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:17.030> job<00:02:17.629> attack

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
start off with using a job attack

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.220 
start off with using a job attack
because<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.950> think<00:02:19.519> he<00:02:19.970> will<00:02:20.299> use<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.540> hurricane

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
because I think he will use a hurricane

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.759 
because I think he will use a hurricane
and<00:02:21.440> our<00:02:22.540> cyclone<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.690> then<00:02:24.230> he<00:02:24.470> will<00:02:24.620> use<00:02:24.739> a

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
and our cyclone and then he will use a

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.699 
and our cyclone and then he will use a
fly<00:02:25.250> attack<00:02:25.640> so<00:02:26.299> because<00:02:26.989> he's<00:02:27.230> faster<00:02:27.680> i

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
fly attack so because he's faster i

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.039 
fly attack so because he's faster i
might<00:02:28.040> as<00:02:28.129> well<00:02:28.310> get<00:02:28.549> a<00:02:28.700> nice<00:02:29.030> attack<00:02:29.540> off<00:02:29.780> on

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
might as well get a nice attack off on

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.920 
might as well get a nice attack off on
him<00:02:30.260> right<00:02:31.010> there<00:02:31.280> we<00:02:31.430> go<00:02:31.549> told<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.120> cyclone

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.440 
wisp but I like to do as much damage as
I<00:04:23.090> possibly<00:04:23.330> can<00:04:23.900> before<00:04:24.620> moving<00:04:25.280> on<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.580> my

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
I possibly can before moving on to my

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.670 
I possibly can before moving on to my
pet<00:04:26.690> because<00:04:27.730> you<00:04:28.930> your<00:04:29.930> opponent<00:04:30.380> gets<00:04:30.500> an

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
pet because you your opponent gets an

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.700 
pet because you your opponent gets an
extra<00:04:31.010> attack<00:04:31.310> when<00:04:31.910> you<00:04:32.120> saw<00:04:32.360> bite<00:04:32.540> so<00:04:33.260> you

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
extra attack when you saw bite so you

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.740 
extra attack when you saw bite so you
really<00:04:33.950> don't<00:04:34.340> want<00:04:34.640> him<00:04:34.760> doing<00:04:35.180> an<00:04:35.420> extra

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
really don't want him doing an extra

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.200 
really don't want him doing an extra
attack<00:04:36.020> on<00:04:36.230> you<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:37.100> right<00:04:37.340> we<00:04:37.610> are<00:04:37.820> going<00:04:38.090> to

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
start off with a flash attack which will

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.840 
start off with a flash attack which will
lower<00:04:41.690> his<00:04:41.810> accuracy<00:04:42.410> Plus<00:04:42.860> also<00:04:43.070> blind<00:04:43.640> him
