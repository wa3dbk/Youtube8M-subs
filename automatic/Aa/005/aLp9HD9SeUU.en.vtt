detailed there's some screws and allen

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.880 
detailed there's some screws and allen
wrench<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.510> mount<00:00:30.750> itself<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.619> the

Dragonfly and then the ring for the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.420 
Dragonfly and then the ring for the
light<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.469> guess<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.040> would<00:00:38.160> call<00:00:38.190> this

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
light and I guess you would call this

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.319 
light and I guess you would call this
the<00:00:38.640> bar<00:00:38.899> so<00:00:40.399> there<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.640> everything<00:00:42.120> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
the bar so there is everything that

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.940 
the bar so there is everything that
comes<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.440> package<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.950> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
comes in the package right there and it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
comes in the package right there and it
installs<00:00:47.340> I'm<00:00:47.489> gonna<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> take<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> tail

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
installs I'm gonna have to take the tail

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.200 
installs I'm gonna have to take the tail
cap<00:00:48.600> off<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.100> put<00:00:50.280> together<00:00:50.399> but

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.520 
cap off and get it all put together but
I'll<00:00:51.390> show<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.780> what<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:51.989> looks<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.350> get

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
I'll show you what it looks like I get

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.220 
I'll show you what it looks like I get
done<00:00:52.739> all<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> got<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.750> installed

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
done all right so I got it all installed

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.740 
done all right so I got it all installed
here<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.520> I'm<00:00:56.610> doing<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.120> close-up<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
here and I'm doing a little close-up of

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.319 
here and I'm doing a little close-up of
it<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.129> only<00:00:59.309> thing<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.489> don't<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.000> about<00:01:00.090> it

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it the only thing I don't like about it

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.599 
it the only thing I don't like about it
I<00:01:00.449> would<00:01:00.629> say<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.109> wish<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.559> stupid<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
I would say is I wish the stupid but I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.390 
I would say is I wish the stupid but I
wish<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.090> Dragonfly<00:01:03.719> were<00:01:03.930> turned<00:01:04.400> forward

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
wish the Dragonfly were turned forward

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.750 
wish the Dragonfly were turned forward
so<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.390> was<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:07.220> dragonfly<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.549> into

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
so it was like a dragonfly going into

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.690 
so it was like a dragonfly going into
battle<00:01:08.909> versus<00:01:09.360> retreating<00:01:09.840> but<00:01:10.500> there<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> is

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
battle versus retreating but there it is

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.030 
battle versus retreating but there it is
I<00:01:12.000> might<00:01:12.810> move<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.140> back<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.710> little<00:01:13.740> bit

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
I might move it back just a little bit

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.210 
I might move it back just a little bit
and<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.520> quite<00:01:14.729> sure<00:01:14.790> yet<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.380> tried<00:01:17.189> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
and not quite sure yet but I tried it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.130 
and not quite sure yet but I tried it
mounting<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.030> different<00:01:18.180> couple

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
mounting it in a different couple

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.370 
mounting it in a different couple
different<00:01:19.409> configurations<00:01:21.080> tried<00:01:22.080> putting

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
different configurations tried putting

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.499 
different configurations tried putting
it<00:01:22.470> up<00:01:22.590> top<00:01:22.830> here<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.150> would<00:01:24.270> interfere

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
it up top here but it would interfere

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.149 
it up top here but it would interfere
with<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.590> width<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.580> top<00:01:27.060> sight<00:01:28.159> so

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
with the the width of this top sight so

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.840 
with the the width of this top sight so
you<00:01:29.430> know<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.710> see<00:01:31.950> where<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.159> goes

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.660 

and<00:01:35.659> this<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.380> thorne<00:01:36.800> taillight<00:01:37.430> mount

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670
