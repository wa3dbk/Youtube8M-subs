00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.539
 Let's go back to talking about essential component graphics cards as we know for 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.150
 playing at your best on the PC i am the tender are presenting new products with the same 

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:20.669
 a particularly eventful moment the occasion this time the launch of 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.169
 new top of the range family reason dmd the model 69 90 name in 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.410
 antivir code 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.880
 a card equipped with 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.180
 2 very fast 5 graphics of the 6000 series 9 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.670
 which combined with 4 gigabytes of memory give life to performances really has 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.390
 castellari, however, the price is not for you 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.090
 it is called radeon hd 69 90 and of the new top of the range among the graphic cards of 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.940
 amd 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.150
 is a darect x11 compatible card for systems equipped with express slots 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.900
 the particularity 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.229
 the presence on board of two series 6000 graphics chips 9 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.489
 that give this card record performance the numbers speak 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:01.410
 clear 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.360
 2 5 working graphs 800 30 may deals over 3000 parallel processors 192 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.840
 unit of text formatting and 4 gigabytes of ram gddr5 with 5g gauze frequency 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.200
 almost equivalent of two 69 70 radeons operating in cross fair mode 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.000
 not always what I can best exploit the graphic configurations a 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.810
 +5 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.829
 maremmi di has done a good job with the drivers that accompany this anger 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.350
 a 69 90 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.570
 that capable of imposing itself with ease 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.140
 in all the scenarios considered we see the results by playing some games a 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.340
 full hd resolution with maximum details and active anti-aliasing on the system 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.360
 phenom 2 to 6 strings 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.250
 i lost planet 2 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.150
 radio in the 69 90 super ale77 average fps coming to almost double the result 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.620
 recorded by the radio in the 69 70 single-chip and resulting in 20% more 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.010
 fast of a g force &amp; gt x50 leaf 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.759
 in addition on roads itor 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.049
 this 69 90 80% faster than a gtx e5 so much 93% faster 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.000
 of a 69 70 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.899
 the most challenging scenes of 3d mark 11 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:23.219
 trudging on the normal single chip card here fly 60 fps the index 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:30.239
 overall and 40% higher than one gtx and 5 so much and 68% higher than one 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.909
 69 70 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.439
 amd did an extraordinary job optimizing the drivers 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.290
 even the scenarios that undermined the amd hardware I cannot 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.729
 scratch the fluidity of this card 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:46.849
 we think of the vecio brand unigine heaven types bedsteads turn in full hd with 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.199
 maximum details in a perfectly fluid manner 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:54.329
 by activating the white frame grid you can see the amount of detail 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.949
 obtained by screwing it tessellation 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:01.989
 pecorara nation cards with high resolution full hd bulletstorm and wide yard 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.709
 below ground the frame-rate is always anchored on 60 fps 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.349
 another title between college 2 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.470
 here too details the high resolution texture a fluidity 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:17.690
 perfect to date there is no game scenario a test 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.900
 in which this radio 69 90 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.219
 does not emerge winner with hands down 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:27.299
 an exaggerated card in all respects in the performances of the dimensions 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.049
 and in the price to use you will need a spacious crisis for 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:32.910
 host it 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.490
 a powerful CPU that can hold its head 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.359
 and finally about 600 euros for the purchase 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.659
 equivalent of 2 gaming consoles and this is the price to take today to 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.070
 home a product of this level justified however 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.369
 only if you want to play on multiple screens 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:52.629
 to have perfect fluids single screen rates via full hd resolution 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.349
 in fact, the single chip cards will be enough for half the price
