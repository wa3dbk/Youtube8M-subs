00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
 so the breadth of the day biscuit what you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.899
 Kings always the best band in the world 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:18.280
 but it must come more jagged king 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:18.280
 that's not so good for the series 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.689
 to hear so much 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.320
 well, because he can bet without 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.089
 because he had the thick armor he 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.499
 maybe still scrap because too 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.170
 was slow by everyone 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.630
 shot off planes 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.520
 I would say the problem so me 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.579
 would not consider him the best was a good one 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.149
 quality tank but was by no means 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.910
 really the ten best tanks so im 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.219
 second world war the problem and 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.140
 were cheaper now the detail has it 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.840
 made especially for him by his 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.059
 Mass production of this series 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.129
 was not possible as already with the animal 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.109
 before and accordingly could 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.420
 he could not in large numbers 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.040
 be produced quickly and who comes 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.600
 Do not recommend fixing easily if he does 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.000
 had to be towed master and 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.650
 in which workshops are repaired 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.490
 and long term, and maybe 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.020
 back to the factory hall and recognize 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.390
 And not everyone had the plans for it 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.480
 and hardly anyone should be the haider for 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.130
 produce that started so we stop 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.020
 now he is one of those in the camp 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.160
 the company are sitting screen the best 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.920
 tank in the second world war ii 34 is here 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.210
 a little bit better real but lagoon 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.440
 duck for logistics and 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.450
 Production called you drives me 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.860
 also sworn a hit that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.170
 also hits the screen to the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.330
 problem with americans only that sees them 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.910
 be proud of a British cannon 1 coupon 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.740
 who look with the firefly 3 1 sets 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.360
 I can say that is a very good one 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.410
 puncher the cannon was maybe one 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.030
 Bit too expensive and she one 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.090
 mass production but the normal 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.920
 Shielding was without an improved cannon 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.050
 now in tree support vehicle 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.450
 thought and never destroyed as a tank 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.390
 Accordingly, you can do that badly 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.190
 compare with a kingsman good 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.390
 cup 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.319
 why do you want the t 34 as best 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.489
 panzer classified the t 34 could mass 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.260
 he had to be produced 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.490
 innovative research of the time 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.440
 integrated he was fast 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.200
 had a beveled armor 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.220
 which stops them breaking them 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.050
 brecht forces hold up there too 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.120
 so must take the cannon 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.040
 to be better because it was not normal 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.480
 just armor the only dick to be true 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.670
 that a beveled armor the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.470
 Choice practically on all sides of the tub 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.350
 it was beveled accordingly 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.350
 especially hard to hit content and 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.270
 So it has saved material and thus 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.680
 produces more of it and even if 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.480
 of which have remained and 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.400
 She was able to do it relatively quickly in the field 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.090
 they were handy and handy 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.070
 sociable and accordingly could 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.810
 they are produced in mass and 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.910
 had just the innovative techniques 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.600
 currently in the equipment this research it 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.390
 was not the best panzer destroyer 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.180
 But the tank was the best in 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.100
 the second way was interesting 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.900
 The Germans say they won the war 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.740
 et 430 the great in the lost 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.740
 worked as a king 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.209
 that is difficult to say because of the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.250
 German had the problem also the 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.110
 Germans would not have thie 34 in 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.840
 can produce such masses 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.790
 because he believes the resources for it 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.590
 would have missed because quality a tank 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.580
 So on a tiger can 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.220
 for example , you need 20:30 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.250
 but not the bar of 20 34 my tiger 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.920
 For example, it was steel 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.860
 really the bottleneck it was more that 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.200
 fuel and then wall of course 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.250
 also the production sites here all 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.790
 were bombed 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.190
 there it was maybe i say so 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.840
 There were many bottlenecks after metrix 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.090
 course so he quit yes of course 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.620
 no longer protected in good 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.670
 Production hall with the necessary 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.160
 tools and in the the 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.269
 fold forces could be halved 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.000
 okay but keep it firmly under the line 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.019
 So you're a supporter of the t 34 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.810
 armor from the second world war am 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.100
 Regardless of everything here 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.100
 clear, very nice because many thanks
