00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.809
 this case that we propose 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.809
 is a model that is going to have for the first time 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.779
 has one hundred percent natural hair 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.300
 and we want to get 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.840
 four shades above its natural background 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.759
 it becomes necessary 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.349
 the application 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.599
 of the super lightening 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.280
 because as we all know, the dye is only able to clarify two to three tones 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.870
 natural hair 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.320
 then 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.250
 let's see the application 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.250
 in fact it clearly exceeds 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.560
 the model of this first example presents one hundred percent hair 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.560
 natural 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.060
 how we want to get four shades lighter than its natural background 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.600
 we will apply a super lighters initiated its side with oxidizer from 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.600
 forty volumes 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.290
 It has a light chestnut height and a few tips of red by the sun 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.210
 To facilitate a good color application it is convenient to make 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 partitions 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.730
 in this case we divide the head into four parts 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.000
 It is important that the four parts are well defined 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.270
 we begin by applying the coloring cream for the occipital area 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.629
 which is the healthiest of the hair and the one that less heat has 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:20.669
 We extend the dye from means to ends respecting an inch of root 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:24.649
 if you do not do it, the roots would be clearer, is that the rest of the hair 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.399
 we let act 30 minutes 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:16.489
 after the indicated time the dye has already begun to clarify means and 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.979
 tips 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.979
 it's time to apply the dye to the roots 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.999
 this area needs less exposure time since it has more heat and 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.999
 the ones that were hair tubs are softer 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:47.239
 we apply the same clearly exceeds ash but with a milder oxygenate 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.239
 to 30 flights 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.469
 As we have explained previously the bluish ash will prevent the appearance of 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.469
 unwanted coppery reflections 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.919
 we let act 30 more minutes 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.919
 and the color will be on when 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.959
 inn after this exposure time we proceed to wash 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.879
 emotion we will make the coloring to facilitate its withdrawal 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.070
 and then rinse with plenty of warm water 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.330
 h 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.270
 We apply the protective color shampoo 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.430
 since its acidic ph close the hair cuticle fixing the tone and 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.430
 also providing more brightness and softness 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:46.740
 rinse thoroughly to avoid remaining shampoo remains on the subject 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:09.749
 to end 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:15.229
 we apply the conditioner or masque massaging the hair of roots pointed 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.229
 for a few minutes 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:30.399
 Once the work is finished, the hair has a bright and homogeneous color 

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:40.839
 thanks to the application of the ash reflection the blond got is very 

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:43.609
 natural and does not show orange reflections
