strange<00:02:02.430> okay<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.700> seems<00:02:03.910> you<00:02:04.030> have<00:02:04.120> to

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
strange okay so it seems you have to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.640 
strange okay so it seems you have to
place<00:02:04.390> it<00:02:04.420> in<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.690> bottom<00:02:05.020> for<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:05.440> keep

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
place it in the bottom for that so keep

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.930 
place it in the bottom for that so keep
note<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:06.250> don't<00:02:06.640> think<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:06.910> actually

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
note of that I don't think it actually

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.260 
note of that I don't think it actually
matters<00:02:07.480> in<00:02:07.510> an<00:02:07.900> irregular<00:02:08.290> mo<00:02:09.190> recipe<00:02:09.640> but<00:02:10.119> in

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
matters in an irregular mo recipe but in

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.310 
matters in an irregular mo recipe but in
this<00:02:10.360> one<00:02:10.510> you<00:02:10.570> have<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.750> place<00:02:10.990> you<00:02:11.110> add<00:02:11.230> the

this one you have to place you add the

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.210 
this one you have to place you add the
bottom<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:12.190> there<00:02:12.400> we<00:02:12.490> go<00:02:12.670> let's<00:02:13.210> check<00:02:13.600> these

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
bottom so there we go let's check these

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.370 
bottom so there we go let's check these
left

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.860 

looking<00:02:20.380> very<00:02:20.710> pink<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.490> fetching<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.510> might

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
looking very pink and fetching I might

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.690 
looking very pink and fetching I might
say<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.470> we're<00:02:23.620> gonna<00:02:23.710> we're<00:02:24.190> gonna<00:02:24.280> need<00:02:24.520> this

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
because it does add mobs too so we're

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.780 
because it does add mobs too so we're
gonna<00:02:26.440> go<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.740> check<00:02:26.890> those<00:02:27.100> guys<00:02:27.130> out<00:02:27.550> and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
skip a couple here real quick because

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.590 
skip a couple here real quick because
you<00:02:32.170> can<00:02:32.440> use<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.730> block<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:34.120> pigness<00:02:34.480> to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
you can use the the block of pigness to

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.390 
you can use the the block of pigness to
craft<00:02:34.870> some<00:02:35.110> different<00:02:35.740> tools<00:02:35.860> now<00:02:36.130> it's<00:02:36.280> got

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
craft some different tools now it's got

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.860 
craft some different tools now it's got
everything<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.850> except<00:02:37.240> for<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.480> hole<00:02:37.690> in<00:02:37.780> it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
everything it except for the hole in it

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.680 
everything it except for the hole in it
I<00:02:37.960> think<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:39.070> we're<00:02:39.910> gonna<00:02:40.030> actually<00:02:40.390> make

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
I think so we're gonna actually make

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.510 
I think so we're gonna actually make
another<00:02:41.020> sword<00:02:42.630> give<00:02:43.630> me<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.740> we're

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
another sword give me that and we're

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.220 
another sword give me that and we're
gonna<00:02:45.640> make<00:02:45.790> let's<00:02:46.450> make<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.630> full<00:02:46.900> set<00:02:47.140> of

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
gonna make let's make a full set of

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.040 
gonna make let's make a full set of
tools<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.770> take<00:02:48.520> with<00:02:48.760> us<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:49.060> our<00:02:49.330> adventure

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
tools to take with us on our adventure

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.220 
tools to take with us on our adventure
into<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.530> pig<00:02:50.970> dimension<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.180> don't<00:02:52.960> know<00:02:53.080> that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
into the pig dimension I don't know that

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.540 
into the pig dimension I don't know that
we'll<00:02:53.320> need<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.590> spade<00:02:53.980> but<00:02:54.160> we'll<00:02:54.280> take<00:02:54.400> it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
we'll need a spade but we'll take it

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.190 
we'll need a spade but we'll take it
anyway<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:55.000> definitely<00:02:55.600> one<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.840> these<00:02:55.990> we'll

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
anyway and definitely one of these we'll

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.060 
anyway and definitely one of these we'll
come<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.680> second

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
come to that in a second

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.690 
come to that in a second
now<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.630> pig<00:02:58.810> core<00:02:59.230> reactor<00:02:59.800> is<00:02:59.980> not<00:03:00.370> used

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
now the the pig core reactor is not used

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.400 
now the the pig core reactor is not used
for<00:03:00.940> anything<00:03:01.120> in<00:03:01.510> Gammage<00:03:01.930> kind<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.290> looks

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
for anything in Gammage kind of looks

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.840 
for anything in Gammage kind of looks
like<00:03:02.500> that<00:03:02.740> it's<00:03:02.890> got<00:03:03.040> some<00:03:03.190> particles<00:03:03.640> coming

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
like that it's got some particles coming

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.300 
like that it's got some particles coming
off<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.300> but<00:03:04.720> it's<00:03:05.050> just<00:03:05.140> used<00:03:05.680> for<00:03:05.800> recipes

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
off of it but it's just used for recipes

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.840 
off of it but it's just used for recipes
and<00:03:07.050> use<00:03:08.050> it<00:03:08.170> by<00:03:08.320> placing<00:03:08.680> four<00:03:09.160> butts<00:03:09.520> a<00:03:09.640> block

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
and use it by placing four butts a block

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.030 
and use it by placing four butts a block
of<00:03:10.060> pigness<00:03:10.420> like<00:03:11.140> search<00:03:11.410> for<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.680> diamond

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
of pigness like search for the diamond

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.470 
of pigness like search for the diamond
in<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.250> center<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.790> get<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.330> me

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
in the center and you get that and me

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.930 
in the center and you get that and me
this<00:03:13.870> is<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.080> recipe<00:03:14.470> it's<00:03:14.770> used<00:03:15.070> in<00:03:15.220> which<00:03:15.730> is

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
this is the recipe it's used in which is

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.240 
this is the recipe it's used in which is
the<00:03:16.120> Swank<00:03:16.570> and<00:03:16.989> this<00:03:17.410> thing<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:17.770> a<00:03:17.800> bunch<00:03:18.070> of

the Swank and this thing is a bunch of
fun<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.640> it's<00:03:19.060> crafted<00:03:19.480> just<00:03:19.630> by<00:03:19.810> putting<00:03:20.050> the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
fun and it's crafted just by putting the

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.350 
fun and it's crafted just by putting the
pig<00:03:20.290> core<00:03:20.470> reactor<00:03:20.800> in<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.070> center<00:03:21.459> with<00:03:22.000> some

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
pig core reactor in the center with some

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.020 
pig core reactor in the center with some
iron<00:03:22.870> ingots<00:03:23.260> around<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.830> top<00:03:24.550> of<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.820> side

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
the pole but we're gonna show how to

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.790 
the pole but we're gonna show how to
make<00:03:42.610> it<00:03:42.760> real<00:03:42.910> quick<00:03:43.090> now<00:03:43.600> you<00:03:43.660> place<00:03:44.140> just

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
make it real quick now you place just

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.150 
make it real quick now you place just
like<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:44.950> normal<00:03:45.160> pole<00:03:46.050> here

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.260 

and<00:03:49.760> then<00:03:50.540> well<00:03:50.930> maybe<00:03:51.530> not<00:03:52.090> forgotten<00:03:53.090> how<00:03:53.210> to

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
and then well maybe not forgotten how to

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.690 
and then well maybe not forgotten how to
make<00:03:53.480> a<00:03:53.510> pool<00:03:53.830> now<00:03:54.830> you<00:03:54.890> just<00:03:55.160> place<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.520> block

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
make a pool now you just place the block

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.080 
make a pool now you just place the block
in<00:03:55.880> there<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.950> will<00:03:58.130> activate<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.880> pool

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
in there and it will activate the pool

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.640 
in there and it will activate the pool
as<00:03:59.360> such<00:03:59.690> then<00:03:59.870> we're<00:03:59.960> gonna<00:04:00.050> jump<00:04:00.320> on<00:04:00.440> through

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
as such then we're gonna jump on through

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.840 
as such then we're gonna jump on through
this<00:04:00.830> one<00:04:01.070> because<00:04:01.280> they've<00:04:01.430> already<00:04:01.580> made

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
this one because they've already made

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.600 
this one because they've already made
one<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:03.200> already<00:04:03.470> activated<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.190> gone<00:04:04.340> in<00:04:04.460> so

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
one and already activated and gone in so

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.890 
one and already activated and gone in so
we're<00:04:04.730> gonna<00:04:04.820> go<00:04:05.030> through<00:04:05.060> actually

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
we're gonna go through actually

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.550 
we're gonna go through actually
disappear<00:04:06.770> if<00:04:06.860> you<00:04:06.920> break<00:04:07.130> those<00:04:07.340> yes<00:04:07.610> it<00:04:07.760> does

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
disappear if you break those yes it does

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.720 
disappear if you break those yes it does
there<00:04:09.560> we<00:04:09.620> go<00:04:09.740> here<00:04:09.950> head<00:04:10.160> through<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:10.490> one

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
there we go here head through this one

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.040 
there we go here head through this one
we've<00:04:11.090> got<00:04:11.240> enough<00:04:11.450> block<00:04:11.630> so<00:04:11.720> we<00:04:11.750> can<00:04:11.900> get

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
we've got enough block so we can get

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.840 
we've got enough block so we can get
back<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.950> let's<00:04:13.190> go<00:04:13.250> and<00:04:13.370> check<00:04:13.520> out<00:04:13.700> this

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
back and let's go and check out this

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.840 
back and let's go and check out this
biome<00:04:14.600> as<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:14.990> can<00:04:15.110> see<00:04:15.290> it's<00:04:15.980> adds<00:04:16.580> to<00:04:16.760> these

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
biome as you can see it's adds to these

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.120 
biome as you can see it's adds to these
blocks<00:04:17.180> as<00:04:17.330> well<00:04:17.510> which<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.959> the<00:04:18.170> peak<00:04:18.860> site

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
blocks as well which is the peak site

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.330 
blocks as well which is the peak site
this<00:04:19.640> couple<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:21.440> gives<00:04:21.590> like<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.799> pink<00:04:22.010> tinge

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
this couple it gives like a pink tinge

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.530 
this couple it gives like a pink tinge
color<00:04:22.580> to<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:22.820> water<00:04:23.000> as<00:04:23.120> well<00:04:23.300> we're<00:04:23.420> gonna

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
color to the water as well we're gonna

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.840 
color to the water as well we're gonna
see<00:04:23.720> if<00:04:23.780> we<00:04:23.840> can<00:04:24.020> go<00:04:24.140> and<00:04:24.260> fly<00:04:24.980> around<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.520> find

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
see if we can go and fly around and find

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.520 
see if we can go and fly around and find
some<00:04:26.090> mobs<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.660> answer<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.080> adds<00:04:27.200> a<00:04:27.350> bunch

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
some mobs so the answer it adds a bunch

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.440 
some mobs so the answer it adds a bunch
of<00:04:27.680> pigs<00:04:27.920> obviously<00:04:28.400> but<00:04:28.910> let's<00:04:29.060> check<00:04:29.300> out

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
of pigs obviously but let's check out

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.030 
of pigs obviously but let's check out
this<00:04:29.570> cannon<00:04:29.960> real<00:04:30.110> quickly<00:04:30.320> before<00:04:30.560> we<00:04:30.800> find

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
this cannon real quickly before we find

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.890 
this cannon real quickly before we find
the<00:04:31.130> other<00:04:31.280> mobs<00:04:31.460> on<00:04:31.670> these<00:04:32.240> guys<00:04:32.480> now<00:04:32.660> this<00:04:32.750> is

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
the other mobs on these guys now this is

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.510 
the other mobs on these guys now this is
pretty<00:04:33.020> cool

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
pretty cool

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.390 
pretty cool
it<00:04:34.520> actually<00:04:34.670> shoots<00:04:35.090> pig<00:04:35.390> heads<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:37.250> it

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
it actually shoots pig heads and it

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.250 
it actually shoots pig heads and it
gives<00:04:37.580> an<00:04:37.670> explosion<00:04:38.210> on<00:04:38.420> impact<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.960> doesn't

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
gives an explosion on impact it doesn't

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.690 
gives an explosion on impact it doesn't
actually<00:04:39.380> damage<00:04:39.890> blocks<00:04:41.830> boom<00:04:42.830> we're<00:04:43.610> gonna

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
actually damage blocks boom we're gonna

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.550 
actually damage blocks boom we're gonna
test<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.120> now<00:04:44.480> it's<00:04:44.630> fully<00:04:44.840> automatic<00:04:45.200> so<00:04:45.500> if

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
test it now it's fully automatic so if

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.010 
test it now it's fully automatic so if
you<00:04:45.650> hold<00:04:45.890> down<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.220> right<00:04:46.370> mouse<00:04:46.430> button<00:04:47.020> you

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
you hold down the right mouse button you

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.990 
you hold down the right mouse button you
can<00:04:48.200> just<00:04:48.380> fire<00:04:48.620> -<00:04:48.890> yeah<00:04:48.980> I<00:04:49.130> had<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.520> content

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
can just fire - yeah I had to content

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.730 
can just fire - yeah I had to content
and<00:04:50.210> you<00:04:50.600> can<00:04:50.750> actually<00:04:50.870> use<00:04:51.200> this<00:04:51.380> because

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
and you can actually use this because

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.530 
and you can actually use this because
the<00:04:51.920> doesn't<00:04:52.250> explode<00:04:52.790> and<00:04:53.120> damage<00:04:53.360> any

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
the doesn't explode and damage any

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.120 
the doesn't explode and damage any
blocks<00:04:53.780> you<00:04:54.140> can<00:04:54.290> actually<00:04:54.440> use<00:04:54.740> this<00:04:54.920> to

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
blocks you can actually use this to

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.830 
blocks you can actually use this to
rocket<00:04:55.430> jump<00:04:55.640> which<00:04:55.940> is<00:04:55.970> pretty<00:04:56.300> cool<00:04:56.540> rip<00:04:57.520> and

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
rocket jump which is pretty cool rip and

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.180 
rocket jump which is pretty cool rip and
this<00:04:59.840> likewise<00:05:00.410> if<00:05:00.560> you<00:05:00.650> just<00:05:00.800> hold<00:05:00.980> it<00:05:01.160> down

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
this likewise if you just hold it down

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.740 
this likewise if you just hold it down
you<00:05:01.460> get<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.670> quite<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:01.940> bit<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.210> distance<00:05:02.540> and

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
you get a quite a bit of distance and

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.370 
you get a quite a bit of distance and
height<00:05:02.870> on<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:04.780> we're<00:05:05.780> gonna<00:05:05.900> go<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.140> test

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
height on it we're gonna go and test

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.930 
height on it we're gonna go and test
this<00:05:06.560> on<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:06.770> couple<00:05:07.130> of<00:05:07.160> these<00:05:07.280> other<00:05:07.550> mobs<00:05:07.760> and

this on a couple of these other mobs and

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.520 
this on a couple of these other mobs and
see<00:05:08.180> if<00:05:08.270> we<00:05:08.360> can't<00:05:08.600> find<00:05:08.900> any<00:05:09.080> more<00:05:10.270> okay<00:05:11.530> so

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
see if we can't find any more okay so

see if we can't find any more okay so
here's<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.860> few<00:05:13.040> mobs<00:05:13.310> that<00:05:13.490> add<00:05:13.700> to<00:05:13.910> add<00:05:14.030> pigs

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.750 
here's a few mobs that add to add pigs
it<00:05:14.840> seems<00:05:15.080> that<00:05:15.230> pigs<00:05:15.500> do<00:05:15.770> actually<00:05:16.190> fly<00:05:16.490> and
