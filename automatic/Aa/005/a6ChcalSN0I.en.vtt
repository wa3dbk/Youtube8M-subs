show you when I load it but once you get
it<00:00:37.500> up<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.739> there

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
it up in there

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.580 
it up in there
the<00:00:38.850> boat<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.210> secured<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.320> strap<00:00:40.559> it

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the boat is secured so when you strap it

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.200 
the boat is secured so when you strap it
down<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.340> slip<00:00:41.520> away<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:42.150> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
down it's not going to slip away as a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.700 
down it's not going to slip away as a
stacker<00:00:42.629> made<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.199> have<00:00:43.320> cut<00:00:43.500> out<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
stacker made you you have cut out the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.750 
stacker made you you have cut out the
whole<00:00:43.920> boat<00:00:44.159> up<00:00:44.280> when<00:00:44.400> you're<00:00:44.519> doing<00:00:44.699> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
whole boat up when you're doing a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.549 
whole boat up when you're doing a
stacker<00:00:45.030> whereas<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.690> J<00:00:45.839> cradle<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.409> lot

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
stacker whereas the J cradle it's a lot

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.009 
stacker whereas the J cradle it's a lot
easier<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.890> load<00:00:47.129> or<00:00:47.430> strapped<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:47.970> and<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
easier to load or strapped down and the

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.600 
easier to load or strapped down and the
other<00:00:49.140> nice<00:00:49.320> thing<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.010> takes<00:00:50.339> up

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
other nice thing is that it takes up

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.600 
other nice thing is that it takes up
less<00:00:51.589> crossbar<00:00:52.589> space<00:00:52.920> than<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.400> you<00:00:53.489> were<00:00:53.550> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
less crossbar space than if you were to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.840 
less crossbar space than if you were to
lay<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.879> boat<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.269> its<00:00:55.050> bottom<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.820> a

crossbars

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
crossbars

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.350 
crossbars
I<00:01:04.949> could<00:01:05.309> probably<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.640> another<00:01:05.790> bike<00:01:06.120> tray

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
I could probably get another bike tray

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.480 
I could probably get another bike tray
behind<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.560> cradle<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.400> carry

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
behind the cradle here so I can carry

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.940 
behind the cradle here so I can carry
two<00:01:08.729> bikes<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.659> boat<00:01:09.840> yeah

two bikes and a boat yeah

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.490 
two bikes and a boat yeah
beauty<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.700> J<00:01:11.850> cradle<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.330> want<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> show<00:01:13.440> you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
beauty of a J cradle I want to show you

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
beauty of a J cradle I want to show you
how<00:01:13.770> easy<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.490> take<00:01:14.640> these<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.150> off

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
how easy it is to take these on and off

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.929 
how easy it is to take these on and off
these<00:01:15.990> are<00:01:16.020> sort<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.710> basic<00:01:17.100> J<00:01:17.579> cradles

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
these are sort of just a basic J cradles

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.639 
these are sort of just a basic J cradles
so<00:01:18.060> they<00:01:18.149> don't<00:01:18.299> fold<00:01:18.539> down<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.289> when<00:01:19.560> you're

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
so they don't fold down so when you're

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.980 
so they don't fold down so when you're
not<00:01:19.740> using<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:20.250> they<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.299> removed<00:01:21.450> very

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
not using them they can be removed very

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.990 
not using them they can be removed very
very<00:01:22.200> easily<00:01:22.380> first<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.399> all<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.579> clamping

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
very easily first of all the clamping

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.230 
very easily first of all the clamping
hardware<00:01:25.219> you'll<00:01:26.219> see<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.670> designed<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
hardware you'll see is designed to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.840 
hardware you'll see is designed to
accommodate<00:01:27.570> not<00:01:28.320> only<00:01:28.649> Yakima<00:01:29.130> Julie<00:01:29.609> and

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
accommodate not only Yakima Julie and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.690 
accommodate not only Yakima Julie and
inno<00:01:30.090> crossbars<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.320> virtually<00:01:31.740> all<00:01:31.920> factory

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
inno crossbars but virtually all factory

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.569 
inno crossbars but virtually all factory
crossbars<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:33.899> your<00:01:34.079> vehicle<00:01:34.680> has<00:01:34.859> you

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
crossbars so if your vehicle has you

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.389 
crossbars so if your vehicle has you
know<00:01:35.670> factory<00:01:36.090> cross<00:01:36.359> bars<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.840> are<00:01:37.399> wide

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
know factory cross bars which are wide

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.090 
know factory cross bars which are wide
elliptical<00:01:39.000> shaped<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.600> arrow<00:01:40.020> shaped<00:01:40.500> this

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
elliptical shaped or arrow shaped this

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.760 
elliptical shaped or arrow shaped this
will<00:01:41.670> probably<00:01:41.909> attach<00:01:42.329> right<00:01:42.719> on<00:01:42.899> there

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
will probably attach right on there

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.639 
will probably attach right on there
directly<00:01:44.219> and<00:01:44.929> you<00:01:45.929> can<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.229> how<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.500> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
directly and you can see how this is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.310 
directly and you can see how this is
going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.829> work<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:48.570> install<00:01:48.990> it's<00:01:49.170> this

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
going to work so to install it's this

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.590 
going to work so to install it's this
simple<00:01:49.530> basically<00:01:50.159> drop<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.359> bar<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
simple basically drop it on the bar you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
simple basically drop it on the bar you
swing<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.320> clamp<00:01:52.649> over<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:53.219> and<00:01:53.399> then<00:01:53.759> you

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
swing that clamp over there and then you

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.709 
swing that clamp over there and then you
