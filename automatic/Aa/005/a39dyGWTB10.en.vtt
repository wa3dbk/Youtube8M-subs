00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
was really good

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.900 
was really good
coming<00:03:30.420> into<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:31.110> team<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:31.830> we<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:32.730> didn't

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
coming into the team so we just didn't

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.040 
coming into the team so we just didn't
want<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.090> underestimate<00:03:33.300> them<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:33.840> that's<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
want to underestimate them so that's the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.600 
want to underestimate them so that's the
pretty<00:03:34.200> much<00:03:34.380> our<00:03:34.530> game<00:03:34.650> plan<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:34.950> just<00:03:34.980> go

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
pretty much our game plan is just go

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.040 
pretty much our game plan is just go
hard<00:03:35.880> you<00:03:36.210> know<00:03:36.330> play<00:03:36.540> them<00:03:36.660> like<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.870> was<00:03:36.960> the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
hard you know play them like it was the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.230 
hard you know play them like it was the
best<00:03:37.230> deal<00:03:37.380> they're<00:03:37.620> our<00:03:38.160> best<00:03:38.280> team<00:03:38.520> yeah<00:03:39.180> I

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
best deal they're our best team yeah I

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.580 
best deal they're our best team yeah I
thought<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.570> guys<00:03:39.810> hung<00:03:40.020> in<00:03:40.140> really<00:03:40.380> well<00:03:40.560> I

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
thought I guys hung in really well I

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.610 
thought I guys hung in really well I
think<00:03:41.120> obviously<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.360> we<00:03:42.720> weren't<00:03:43.290> as<00:03:43.410> tight

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
think obviously we we weren't as tight

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.220 
think obviously we we weren't as tight
as<00:03:43.770> I'd<00:03:43.890> like<00:03:44.100> us<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.280> have<00:03:44.490> been<00:03:44.930> we<00:03:45.930> gave<00:03:46.080> away

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
as I'd like us to have been we gave away

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.490 
as I'd like us to have been we gave away
a<00:03:46.350> few<00:03:46.650> easy<00:03:47.640> options<00:03:48.180> if<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:48.450> like<00:03:48.630> but<00:03:49.470> I

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
a few easy options if you like but I

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.870 
a few easy options if you like but I
think<00:03:49.770> that<00:03:49.890> comes<00:03:50.160> from<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.430> fact<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.700> we

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
think that comes from the fact that we

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.730 
think that comes from the fact that we
played<00:03:51.120> together<00:03:51.540> once<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:52.020> year<00:03:52.050> effectively

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
played together once a year effectively

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.100 
played together once a year effectively
in<00:03:52.890> this<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.430> tournament<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.000> we<00:03:54.840> have<00:03:54.960> to

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
in this in this tournament so we have to

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.990 
in this in this tournament so we have to
look<00:03:55.230> at<00:03:55.410> how<00:03:55.530> what<00:03:56.100> we<00:03:56.220> can<00:03:56.370> do<00:03:56.520> about<00:03:56.610> that

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
look at how what we can do about that

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.580 
look at how what we can do about that
and<00:03:57.180> how<00:03:57.270> we<00:03:57.300> can<00:03:57.540> get<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.200> bit<00:03:58.470> more

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
and how we can get of it a bit more

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.590 
and how we can get of it a bit more
together<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:59.400> difference<00:03:59.760> was<00:03:59.910> that<00:03:59.940> I<00:04:00.300> just

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
together the difference was that I just

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.960 
together the difference was that I just
said<00:04:00.780> -<00:04:01.080> our<00:04:01.500> timing<00:04:01.800> together<00:04:02.190> we<00:04:02.580> spend<00:04:02.850> of<00:04:02.910> a

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
said - our timing together we spend of a

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.250 
said - our timing together we spend of a
period<00:04:03.270> of<00:04:03.330> time<00:04:03.480> together<00:04:03.690> cuz<00:04:03.960> we're<00:04:04.110> on<00:04:04.200> a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
period of time together cuz we're on a

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.470 
period of time together cuz we're on a
small<00:04:04.380> island<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:05.160> there<00:04:05.700> are<00:04:05.760> combinations

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
small island and there are combinations

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.640 
small island and there are combinations
and<00:04:06.600> particularly<00:04:07.260> in<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.380> second<00:04:07.620> half

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
and particularly in the second half

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.290 
and particularly in the second half
we've<00:04:07.980> decided<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.430> pull<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.700> in<00:04:08.820> tighter<00:04:09.060> and

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
we've decided to pull it in tighter and

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.480 
we've decided to pull it in tighter and
put<00:04:09.900> pressure<00:04:10.050> on<00:04:10.350> in<00:04:10.500> scrum<00:04:10.800> time<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.340> use

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
put pressure on in scrum time and use

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.940 
put pressure on in scrum time and use
our<00:04:11.670> set<00:04:11.880> piece<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.750> I<00:04:13.260> know<00:04:13.320> it's<00:04:13.530> happened

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
our set piece and I know it's happened

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.220 
our set piece and I know it's happened
and<00:04:14.100> easier<00:04:14.340> because<00:04:14.490> they<00:04:14.790> had<00:04:15.109> had<00:04:16.109> their

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
and easier because they had had their

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.479 
and easier because they had had their
players<00:04:16.530> coming<00:04:16.770> from<00:04:16.890> all<00:04:17.160> over<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.400> island

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
players coming from all over the island

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.570 
players coming from all over the island
so<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.960> know<00:04:19.080> good<00:04:19.739> great<00:04:20.040> credit<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.460> them

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
so you know good great credit to them

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.360 
so you know good great credit to them
they<00:04:20.730> pushed<00:04:21.210> us<00:04:21.330> all<00:04:21.540> away<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.870> then<00:04:22.370> the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
they pushed us all away and then the

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.830 
they pushed us all away and then the
score<00:04:23.640> doesn't<00:04:23.790> reflect<00:04:24.180> our<00:04:24.420> closest

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
score doesn't reflect our closest

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.800 
score doesn't reflect our closest
networks

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810
