00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000

00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:18.386
I dive to the west

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.560
You may already know Brittany...

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.600
...through the famous
footpath of the customs officers.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.360
It runs along the coast
and makes you discover the riches...

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.600
...of an uncommon natural
and cultural heritage.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.550
And the journey continues
under water:

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.760
With the continuation of
the continent under water...

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.020
...Many dive sites are accessible
at shallow depths.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.240
At the end of this world,
at the tip of Brittany...

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.680
...You can choose between
the Channel or the Atlantic:

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.080
Two different seas
with their own characteristics.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.440
Depending on your liking, different
landscapes parade before your fins...

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.360
The clear waters invite you
to meet...

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.520
...a rich and unusual biodiversity.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.320
Wether you're a novice
or a certified diver...

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.400
...in Brittany, you will find
ideal diving conditions...

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.960
...that are adapted to your level...
and your desires.

00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:23.458
My first fin strokes!

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.869
Snorkeling
Audierne Plongée

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.779
Breathe through your nose!

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.640
Here it is!
It's good!

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.920
When jumping from the boat, don't
put the snorkel in your mouth...

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.680
...otherwise it will fill with water.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.760
Hold the front of your mask...

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.640
...and hold the strap as well.

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.789
First dive
Sellor nautisme

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.160
Great!

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.720
What did you see?

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.200
Plenty of fish.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.190
Large fish, small fish...

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.480
...and beautiful seaweeds.
It was great!

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.280
You're happy!
It's good!

00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.885
My passion for depths

00:04:27.886 --> 00:04:32.686
Exploration - Training
CAP Trebeurden

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.280
The diving is done facing the anchorage.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.270
Swim along the chain.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.800
If you follow the chain,
you will find the anchor.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.150
The anchor is 17.5 cm of a fracture.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.800
The rock face will be located
approximately at a depth of 18m.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.480
And there it drops sharply
down to 37m.

00:05:31.484 --> 00:05:36.284
Exploration - technical diving
St Malo Plongée Emeraude

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.700
These two wrecks sank
the same night, in June 1944.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.640
However, the Heinrich was found
by chance by a diver...

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.060
...who thought he was diving
on the Walter.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.440
Then, he noticed it was not
the same wreck.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.240
...sea bass, crabs,
lobsters, wrasses...

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.080
...plenty of lobsters...
I have not counted the congers.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.560
...guns...
There was also a beautiful skate.
