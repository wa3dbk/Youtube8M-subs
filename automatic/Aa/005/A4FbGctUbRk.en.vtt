they<00:00:36.780> removed<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.680> eye<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.280> I've<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:39.329> an

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
they removed the eye so I've got an

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.100 
they removed the eye so I've got an
artificial<00:00:39.809> eye<00:00:40.079> now<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.670> was<00:00:41.790> 16<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:42.540> so

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
artificial eye now and I was 16 then so

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.830 
artificial eye now and I was 16 then so
I<00:00:43.170> managed<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.610> me<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.510> quite

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
I managed with the one on me but quite

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.260 
I managed with the one on me but quite
well<00:00:48.410> till<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.559> was<00:00:49.770> 40<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.940> had<00:00:51.120> some

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
well till I was 40 and then I had some

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.090 
well till I was 40 and then I had some
operations<00:00:51.930> on<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.940> although<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.719> was<00:00:55.320> about

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
operations on that although I was about

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.160 
operations on that although I was about
47<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:58.399> it's<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.940> know<00:01:00.090> just<00:01:00.420> started<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
47 I think it's you know just started to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.939 
47 I think it's you know just started to
get<00:01:01.379> worse<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.760> after<00:01:03.239> some<00:01:04.080> more<00:01:04.260> operations

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
get worse and after some more operations

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.120 
get worse and after some more operations
they<00:01:05.339> can't<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:05.790> any<00:01:05.909> more<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.650> the<00:01:07.650> rule<00:01:07.860> coma

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
they can't do any more and the rule coma

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.850 
they can't do any more and the rule coma
robbed<00:01:08.909> me<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> vision<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.290> did<00:01:10.590> have

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
robbed me of the vision that I did have

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.719 
robbed me of the vision that I did have
and<00:01:11.159> there's<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> cataract<00:01:12.689> also<00:01:13.310> which<00:01:14.310> they

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
and there's a cataract also which they

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.179 
and there's a cataract also which they
couldn't<00:01:15.119> remove<00:01:15.299> all<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.439> removed<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
couldn't remove all of it just removed a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.280 
couldn't remove all of it just removed a
little<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.850> because<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.720> basically

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
little bit because it's basically

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.920 
little bit because it's basically
holding<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:19.979> together<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.900> very

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
holding it all together and so it's very

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.179 
holding it all together and so it's very
compromised

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
compromised

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.560 
compromised
I<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.590> gradually<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.830> suppose<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.420> get

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I and gradually I suppose as we get

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.300 
I and gradually I suppose as we get
older<00:01:28.070> it's<00:01:29.070> got<00:01:29.369> much<00:01:29.610> much<00:01:30.060> worse<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:31.619> I

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
older it's got much much worse and I

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.690 
older it's got much much worse and I
can't<00:01:32.780> see<00:01:33.780> very<00:01:34.079> much<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.490> see<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
can't see very much now if I see a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.149 
can't see very much now if I see a
little<00:01:35.880> bit<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.659> very<00:01:36.960> very<00:01:37.320> blurry<00:01:37.650> very

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
little bit it's very very blurry very

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.260 
little bit it's very very blurry very
foggy<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:39.900> moved<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.259> Clapton<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.270> I

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
foggy and we moved to Clapton and I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.410 
foggy and we moved to Clapton and I
always<00:01:43.079> went<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.250> my<00:01:44.399> own<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.939> wife<00:01:45.149> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
always went out on my own and wife I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.740 
always went out on my own and wife I
found<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.670> for<00:01:47.670> some<00:01:47.729> unknown<00:01:48.030> reason<00:01:48.630> I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
found that for some unknown reason I

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.499 
found that for some unknown reason I
couldn't<00:01:48.990> walk<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.710> straight<00:01:49.890> line<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.790> I

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
couldn't walk in a straight line and I

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.510 
couldn't walk in a straight line and I
used<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.930> bump<00:01:52.170> into<00:01:52.380> people<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.250> shops

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
used to bump into people in the shops

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.580 
used to bump into people in the shops
and<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.450> came<00:01:54.720> home<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.290> said<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
and that and I came home and said to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.010 
and that and I came home and said to
hubby<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.329> don't<00:01:57.329> know<00:01:57.390> what's<00:01:57.600> wrong<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:57.899> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
hubby I don't know what's wrong with the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.800 
hubby I don't know what's wrong with the
people<00:01:58.229> interacting<00:01:59.100> okay<00:01:59.579> walking<00:01:59.880> into<00:02:00.210> me

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
people interacting okay walking into me

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.359 
people interacting okay walking into me
he's<00:02:01.290> similar<00:02:01.740> actually<00:02:02.329> easier<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:04.369> just

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
he's similar actually easier I just

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.870 
he's similar actually easier I just
can't<00:02:05.670> believe<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
can't believe it

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.480 
can't believe it
so<00:02:07.600> I<00:02:07.990> saw<00:02:08.440> something<00:02:08.920> with<00:02:09.069> one<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.399> those

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
so I saw something with one of those

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.040 
so I saw something with one of those
shopping<00:02:09.789> trolleys<00:02:10.270> that<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.509> push<00:02:10.750> along

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.449 
shopping trolleys that you push along
and<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.990> decided<00:02:13.990> I<00:02:14.230> try<00:02:14.470> one<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:14.740> these<00:02:14.980> and

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
and I decided I try one of these and

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.750 
and I decided I try one of these and
push<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.850> an<00:02:15.970> all-new<00:02:16.300> front<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.550> imagine

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
push it an all-new front you can imagine
