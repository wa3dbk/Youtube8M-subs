of<00:02:57.410> very<00:02:57.830> dynamic<00:02:58.550> you<00:02:58.760> know<00:02:58.940> if<00:02:59.750> you<00:02:59.930> keep<00:03:00.140> on

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
of very dynamic you know if you keep on

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.970 
of very dynamic you know if you keep on
for<00:03:00.650> short<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.340> just<00:03:02.060> extreme<00:03:02.600> Posey's<00:03:03.230> turn

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980
