00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
ripoff when when we or when in Tendo has

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.250 
ripoff when when we or when in Tendo has
their<00:03:50.849> console<00:03:51.359> music<00:03:52.049> but<00:03:52.609> so<00:03:53.609> we<00:03:53.729> put<00:03:53.909> in<00:03:54.060> a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260

music sounds the same but this guy's
gameplay<00:05:39.510> just<00:05:39.840> blew<00:05:40.380> me<00:05:40.530> away<00:05:40.560> so<00:05:41.130> I<00:05:41.160> asked

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
gameplay just blew me away so I asked

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.480 
gameplay just blew me away so I asked
him<00:05:41.760> for<00:05:42.090> a<00:05:42.440> file<00:05:43.440> front<00:05:43.770> link<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.310> raw

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
him for a file front link to the raw

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.150 
him for a file front link to the raw
footage<00:05:44.550> of<00:05:44.970> his<00:05:45.060> clips<00:05:45.890> so<00:05:46.890> I'm<00:05:47.010> actually

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
footage of his clips so I'm actually

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.130 
footage of his clips so I'm actually
going<00:05:47.400> to<00:05:47.580> cut<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.120> montage<00:05:48.600> here<00:05:48.840> in<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:48.990> next

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.870 
going to cut a montage here in the next
few<00:05:49.320> days<00:05:49.500> using<00:05:49.860> his<00:05:50.190> clips<00:05:50.520> because<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.760> have

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
few days using his clips because I have

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.219 
few days using his clips because I have
this<00:05:51.000> idea<00:05:51.180> in<00:05:51.419> my<00:05:51.539> head<00:05:51.570> that<00:05:51.720> I<00:05:51.900> don't<00:05:52.080> want

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
this idea in my head that I don't want

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.840 
this idea in my head that I don't want
to<00:05:52.289> tell<00:05:52.470> you<00:05:52.950> guys<00:05:52.979> are<00:05:53.310> anyone<00:05:53.580> else<00:05:53.700> about

to start recording it yet because

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.219 
to start recording it yet because
there's<00:06:14.580> some<00:06:14.729> kind<00:06:14.940> of<00:06:15.030> I<00:06:15.300> don't<00:06:15.960> know<00:06:16.169> I

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
there's some kind of I don't know I

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.500 
there's some kind of I don't know I
tried<00:06:16.860> plugging<00:06:17.100> it<00:06:17.370> into<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.729> to<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.120> roxio

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
tried plugging it into the to the roxio

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.469 
tried plugging it into the to the roxio
and<00:06:18.900> it<00:06:18.990> wasn't<00:06:19.740> giving<00:06:20.130> me<00:06:20.250> a<00:06:20.280> I<00:06:20.669> have<00:06:21.210> to<00:06:21.330> fool

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
and it wasn't giving me a I have to fool

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:22.700 
and it wasn't giving me a I have to fool
with<00:06:21.539> it<00:06:21.690> but<00:06:21.930> once<00:06:22.110> I<00:06:22.200> figure<00:06:22.440> out<00:06:22.470> how<00:06:22.650> to

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
with it but once I figure out how to

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.740 
with it but once I figure out how to
capture<00:06:22.919> this<00:06:23.130> kind<00:06:23.310> of<00:06:23.340> game<00:06:23.460> play<00:06:23.700> then<00:06:23.940> I

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
capture this kind of game play then I

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.140 
capture this kind of game play then I
think<00:06:25.260> we<00:06:25.380> could<00:06:25.470> have<00:06:25.530> a<00:06:25.650> lot<00:06:25.979> of<00:06:26.010> fun<00:06:26.370> to<00:06:27.030> in

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
think we could have a lot of fun to in

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.029 
think we could have a lot of fun to in
like<00:06:27.300> Mario<00:06:28.110> videos<00:06:28.440> where<00:06:28.620> I'm<00:06:28.710> trying<00:06:28.950> to

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
like Mario videos where I'm trying to

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:30.020 
like Mario videos where I'm trying to
fuck<00:06:29.190> with<00:06:29.220> her<00:06:29.400> the<00:06:29.520> whole<00:06:29.550> time<00:06:29.789> or

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
fuck with her the whole time or

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.980 
fuck with her the whole time or
something<00:06:30.330> but

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
something but

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.780 
something but
