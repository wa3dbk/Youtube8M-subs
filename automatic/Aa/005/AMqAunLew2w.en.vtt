aged in a 53 gallon barrel or even
larger<00:00:56.000> when<00:00:56.989> you<00:00:57.080> get<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.410> smaller

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
larger when you get that a smaller

barrel<00:00:58.010> sizes<00:00:58.519> your<00:00:58.699> surface<00:00:59.180> area<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.690> volume

barrel sizes your surface area to volume
ratio<00:01:00.589> increases<00:01:01.190> meaning<00:01:01.910> that<00:01:02.000> there's

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
ratio increases meaning that there's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.930 
ratio increases meaning that there's
more<00:01:02.330> wood<00:01:02.600> touching<00:01:03.110> whisky<00:01:03.440> so<00:01:04.160> if<00:01:04.670> you<00:01:04.820> have

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
more wood touching whisky so if you have

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.760 
more wood touching whisky so if you have
a<00:01:04.970> normal<00:01:05.330> 53<00:01:05.840> gallon<00:01:06.110> barrel<00:01:06.320> with<00:01:06.410> a<00:01:06.440> one<00:01:06.680> to

or five times the amount of wood in
contact<00:01:17.600> with<00:01:17.720> whisky<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.200> being<00:01:18.980> that

contact with whisky and being that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.380 
contact with whisky and being that
there's<00:01:19.220> so<00:01:19.340> much<00:01:19.460> more<00:01:19.520> wooden<00:01:19.880> contact<00:01:20.270> with

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
there's so much more wooden contact with

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.399 
there's so much more wooden contact with
whisky<00:01:20.659> things<00:01:20.870> are<00:01:21.020> dramatically

closes<00:02:05.970> either<00:02:06.180> go<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> side<00:02:07.580> either<00:02:08.580> side

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
closes either go to the side either side

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.970 
closes either go to the side either side
and<00:02:09.090> we<00:02:09.179> are<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.380> put<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> funnel<00:02:10.770> in

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
and we are going to put the funnel in

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.870 
and we are going to put the funnel in
and<00:02:12.050> right<00:02:13.050> here<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.320> have<00:02:13.500> hot<00:02:13.830> water<00:02:13.880> tap

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
and right here I just have hot water tap

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.360 
and right here I just have hot water tap
water<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.270> fine<00:02:15.510> for<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.290> phase<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.890> so

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
water is fine for this phase of it so

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.730 
water is fine for this phase of it so
just<00:02:17.550> hot<00:02:18.030> tap<00:02:18.270> water<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:19.320> are<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.620> to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
just hot tap water and we are going to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.270 
just hot tap water and we are going to
build<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.760> barrel

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.400 

okay<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.600> reason<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.930> we<00:02:27.050> filled<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
okay the reason that we filled the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.530 
okay the reason that we filled the
barrel<00:02:27.680> with<00:02:27.830> water<00:02:28.070> is<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:28.670> we<00:02:28.790> can<00:02:28.910> swell<00:02:29.360> it

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
barrel with water is so we can swell it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.080 
barrel with water is so we can swell it
and<00:02:29.690> have<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.560> watertight<00:02:30.920> before<00:02:31.520> we<00:02:31.670> put

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
and have a watertight before we put

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.550 
and have a watertight before we put
whiskey<00:02:32.240> in<00:02:32.480> there<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:33.110> might<00:02:33.260> take<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.470> few

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
whiskey in there that might take a few

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.350 
whiskey in there that might take a few
hours<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.280> might<00:02:34.520> take<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.730> few<00:02:34.820> days

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
hours it might take a few days

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.960 
hours it might take a few days
it<00:02:35.570> might<00:02:35.840> not<00:02:36.110> leak<00:02:36.320> at<00:02:36.440> all<00:02:36.730> once<00:02:37.730> you've

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
it might not leak at all once you've

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.570 
it might not leak at all once you've
noticed<00:02:38.150> it's<00:02:38.420> done<00:02:38.600> leaking<00:02:39.220> then<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.400> will

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
noticed it's done leaking then you will

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.310 
noticed it's done leaking then you will
dump<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.030> back<00:02:41.180> out<00:02:41.390> make<00:02:41.630> sure<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:41.930> store<00:02:42.170> it

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
dump it back out make sure you store it

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.170 
dump it back out make sure you store it
in<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.470> sink<00:02:42.770> or<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.010> your<00:02:43.160> bathtub<00:02:43.340> or<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:43.880> the

and continually - may wait for a couple
days<00:02:49.280> once<00:02:49.910> you<00:02:49.970> notice<00:02:50.120> it's<00:02:50.390> done<00:02:50.570> leaking

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
days once you notice it's done leaking

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.510 
days once you notice it's done leaking
you're<00:02:51.560> just<00:02:51.680> going<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.860> take<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.130> water<00:02:52.250> and

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
you're just going to take the water and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.790 
you're just going to take the water and
dump<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.090> back<00:02:53.120> out

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800

okay now for the fun part we have two
bottles<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:04.060> 110<00:03:05.060> proof<00:03:05.270> very<00:03:05.570> high<00:03:05.690> proof<00:03:05.930> on

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
bottles of 110 proof very high proof on

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.540 
bottles of 110 proof very high proof on
aged<00:03:06.260> whiskey<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:07.070> we're<00:03:07.190> going<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.340> pour

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
aged whiskey that we're going to pour

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.010 
aged whiskey that we're going to pour
into<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.880> barrel

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.820 

okay<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.160> now<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:14.400> have<00:03:14.730> our<00:03:15.000> two<00:03:15.330> bottles

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
okay so now we have our two bottles

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.240 
okay so now we have our two bottles
which<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.120> 1.5<00:03:18.120> liters<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:19.230> unaged<00:03:19.530> whiskey<00:03:19.620> in

our<00:03:20.610> barrel<00:03:20.910> now<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.180> barrel<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.420> about<00:03:21.600> two

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
our barrel now this barrel is about two

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.960 
our barrel now this barrel is about two
liters<00:03:21.990> which<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> half<00:03:22.650> gallon<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.820> we're

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
liters which is a half gallon and we're

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.450 
liters which is a half gallon and we're
going<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.180> take<00:03:24.390> filtered<00:03:25.290> water<00:03:25.500> now<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.070> top

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
going to take filtered water now and top

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.220 
going to take filtered water now and top
the<00:03:26.640> barrel<00:03:26.910> off<00:03:27.030> what<00:03:27.810> that's<00:03:27.960> going<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.140> do

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the barrel off what that's going to do

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.270 
the barrel off what that's going to do
is<00:03:28.320> we<00:03:28.410> want<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.560> have<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.740> barrel<00:03:28.950> completely

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
is we want to have the barrel completely

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.010 
is we want to have the barrel completely
folder<00:03:29.580> in<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.730> asian<00:03:29.940> process<00:03:30.360> but<00:03:30.900> it's

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
folder in the asian process but it's

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.120 
folder in the asian process but it's
also<00:03:31.140> going<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.410> take<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.650> proof<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:32.040> the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
also going to take the proof of the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.620 
also going to take the proof of the
whiskey<00:03:32.460> down<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.790> more<00:03:32.880> palatable<00:03:33.210> drinking

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
whiskey down and more palatable drinking

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
proof

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.910 
proof
it's<00:03:36.480> an<00:03:36.540> optimal<00:03:36.900> proof<00:03:37.110> Dage<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.590> whiskey

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
it's an optimal proof Dage the whiskey

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.070 
it's an optimal proof Dage the whiskey
at<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.280> it'll<00:03:39.150> be<00:03:39.240> all<00:03:39.330> ready<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.630> drink<00:03:39.840> once

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
at and it'll be all ready to drink once

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.780 
at and it'll be all ready to drink once
it's<00:03:40.200> mature<00:03:40.500> okay<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.160> we've<00:03:41.370> got<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.610> barrel

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
it's mature okay so we've got the barrel

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.110 
it's mature okay so we've got the barrel
topped<00:03:42.540> off<00:03:42.780> with<00:03:43.080> water<00:03:43.590> we're<00:03:44.400> full<00:03:44.670> you

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
topped off with water we're full you

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.220 
topped off with water we're full you
want<00:03:45.210> to<00:03:45.330> make<00:03:45.420> sure<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.840> bung<00:03:46.020> is

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
want to make sure that the bung is

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.870 
want to make sure that the bung is
completely<00:03:46.890> sealed<00:03:47.190> in<00:03:47.400> there<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.730> there's
