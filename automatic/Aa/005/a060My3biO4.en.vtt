 hello everyone I hope you are spending a 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.239
 nice weekend and we're 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.090
 ending the month of August and here is the 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.970
 season of cold passion or fruit 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.890
 of passion in other countries is called 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.980
 maracuyÃ¡ march or chinese la so like 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.800
 know her 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.500
 with the camera to pick up I have here in 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.280
 my garden and many fall without being 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.350
 mature 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.379
 then you have to let them mature 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.350
 little more the ripe and sweeter are 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.720
 those that are already very soft and that are 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.390
 wrinkled and that's what we want to 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.110
 use and how all fruits contain 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.229
 many antioxidants this fruit many 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.970
 vitamins and minerals that in general you 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:14.600
 help the bones throughout your body to 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.390
 hair and also help you strengthen 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.180
 your immune system to fight 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.420
 diseases also if you're in a 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.030
 You can eat slimming diet 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.440
 for its fiber and because it's easy to 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.500
 to digest 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.070
 and another very peculiar thing about peace and 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.610
 fruit of the passion fruit is that it helps 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.730
 nervousness and anxiety and who does not 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.830
 need help for that good we're going to 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.860
 prepare this water that can be a 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.430
 substitute for the refresh then 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.880
 you need two cups of water and it's the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.730
 recipe nothing else said 3 3 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.640
 passion fruit but I will use 5 to 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.750
 that is more concentrated only you 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.230
 you're going to eat inside let's put it 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.230
 in the blender 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.370
 and for easy nothing else puts the two 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:16.549
 cups of water 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.549
 and we are going to put the fruit 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:26.510
 It is very rich and has a good smell 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.510
 sweet let's see 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.930
 now nothing else is necessary that we 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.930
 let's move everything ready truth 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.770
 and I'm going to put a little stevia 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.830
 so that it is a little bit more 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.570
 or you can do it without stevia but 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.910
 how are you going to put ice then 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.910
 he also needs a little bit of sweeter 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.770
 ah 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.020
 and now we are going to have to strain 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.710
 so it's very quick to do the 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:20.819
 you can do for your meals or in the 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:24.590

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.140
