within the school environment in very

the right ways in each school to do that

so our initial look at the data is

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.040 
so our initial look at the data is
suggesting<00:04:11.520> that<00:04:11.910> we<00:04:12.120> can<00:04:12.450> measure<00:04:12.780> an

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
suggesting that we can measure an

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.620 
suggesting that we can measure an
increase<00:04:13.590> in<00:04:13.830> musical<00:04:14.250> engagement<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:15.030> what

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
increase in musical engagement and what

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.120 
increase in musical engagement and what
we're<00:04:15.750> hoping<00:04:16.290> we'll<00:04:16.500> see<00:04:16.650> with<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:16.859> next

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
we're hoping we'll see with the next

we're hoping we'll see with the next
round<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.430> analysis<00:04:18.030> is<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.299> that

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
round of analysis is that that

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.150 
round of analysis is that that
engagement<00:04:18.750> then<00:04:19.200> spread<00:04:19.560> out<00:04:19.590> into<00:04:20.040> the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
engagement then spread out into the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.240 
engagement then spread out into the
