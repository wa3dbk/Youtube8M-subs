still by today's standards you can see
the<00:00:38.910> specs<00:00:39.239> right<00:00:39.600> now<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.170> compare<00:00:40.590> it

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the specs right now you can compare it

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.100 
the specs right now you can compare it
to<00:00:40.950> whatever<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.820> want<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> compare<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.510> it's

to whatever you want to compare it it's

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.020 
to whatever you want to compare it it's
not<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.559> best<00:00:43.770> pc<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.550> obviously<00:00:44.940> not

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
not the best pc but it's obviously not

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
not the best pc but it's obviously not
the<00:00:45.360> worst<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.050> might<00:00:46.620> need<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.890> upgraded<00:00:47.340> in

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the worst I might need you upgraded in

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.450 
the worst I might need you upgraded in
the<00:00:47.610> future<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.300> yeah<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.200> next<00:00:49.590> year<00:00:49.950> year

the future but yeah for next year year
and<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.700> half<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.360> pretty<00:00:51.570> good<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:51.989> pretty

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and a half it's pretty good it's pretty

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
and a half it's pretty good it's pretty
solid<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.640> let's<00:00:53.910> move<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.239> my

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
solid and now let's move on to my

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.610 
solid and now let's move on to my
monitor<00:00:55.020> which<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:56.329> also<00:00:57.329> kind<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.170> an<00:00:58.289> older

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
monitor which is also kind of an older

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.130 
monitor which is also kind of an older
monitor<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.280> LCD<00:00:59.789> monitor<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.390> not<00:01:00.570> LED<00:01:01.020> or

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
monitor it's LCD monitor it's not LED or

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.560 
monitor it's LCD monitor it's not LED or
anything<00:01:01.649> because<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.520> bought<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.030> three

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
anything because I bought it like three

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.219 
anything because I bought it like three
years<00:01:03.750> ago<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> LCD<00:01:06.510> were<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
years ago I think when the LCD were the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.500 
years ago I think when the LCD were the
lcds<00:01:07.619> work<00:01:07.860> Hannah<00:01:08.100> cheaper<00:01:08.880> i<00:01:08.909> guess<00:01:09.210> but

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
lcds work Hannah cheaper i guess but

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.390 
lcds work Hannah cheaper i guess but
right<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.020> can't<00:01:10.320> even<00:01:10.560> find<00:01:10.860> an<00:01:11.070> LCD

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
right now you can't even find an LCD

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.700 
right now you can't even find an LCD
monitor<00:01:11.850> actually<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.630> find<00:01:12.930> but<00:01:13.080> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
monitor actually you can find but you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
monitor actually you can find but you
wouldn't<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.100> buy<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.640> right<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.150> then

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
wouldn't really buy one right and then

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
wouldn't really buy one right and then
you<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> specs<00:01:16.830> right<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.299> know

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you can see the specs right now you know

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420 
you can see the specs right now you know
pretty<00:01:18.630> solid<00:01:19.049> monitor<00:01:19.470> full<00:01:19.920> HD<00:01:20.400> resolution

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
pretty solid monitor full HD resolution

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.969 
pretty solid monitor full HD resolution
you<00:01:21.360> know<00:01:21.509> maybe<00:01:22.049> not<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> best<00:01:22.500> for

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you know maybe not the best for

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.219 
you know maybe not the best for
competitive<00:01:23.700> gaming<00:01:23.939> most<00:01:24.299> gamers<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.020> think

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
competitive gaming most gamers I think

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.410 
competitive gaming most gamers I think
use<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.830> millisecond<00:01:26.549> response<00:01:26.700> time<00:01:27.240> or

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
use to millisecond response time or

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
use to millisecond response time or
something<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.590> right

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
something like that or one and right

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
something like that or one and right
here<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.759> my<00:01:30.030> surround<00:01:30.450> sound<00:01:30.750> system
