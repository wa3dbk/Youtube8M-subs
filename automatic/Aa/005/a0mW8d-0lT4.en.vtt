00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
mean I think I did it last year I think

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.270 
mean I think I did it last year I think
I<00:02:20.269> could<00:02:20.510> uh<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:21.439> know<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.590> committed<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.159> most

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
I could uh you know I committed the most

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.670 
I could uh you know I committed the most
thousand<00:02:22.909> and<00:02:23.120> what<00:02:23.299> and<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:24.349> know<00:02:24.379> got<00:02:24.650> to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
thousand and what and you know got to

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.559 
thousand and what and you know got to
the<00:02:24.860> line<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.099> lot<00:02:25.370> last<00:02:25.700> year<00:02:25.879> too<00:02:26.150> i<00:02:26.180> think<00:02:26.480> i

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
the line a lot last year too i think i

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.270 
the line a lot last year too i think i
led<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.049> league<00:02:27.200> in<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:27.709> i<00:02:27.739> think<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.250> know

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
led the league in a so i think you know

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.160 
led the league in a so i think you know
I<00:02:28.400> think<00:02:28.489> it's<00:02:28.790> always<00:02:29.030> good<00:02:29.209> to<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:29.870> lead<00:02:30.019> the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
I think it's always good to to lead the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.410 
I think it's always good to to lead the
league<00:02:30.290> at<00:02:30.500> something<00:02:30.890> like<00:02:30.980> minus<00:02:31.640> when<00:02:32.329> he

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
league at something like minus when he

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.339 
league at something like minus when he
doesn't<00:02:32.629> have<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.840> do<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:32.989> turnover<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:35.349> wasn't

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
doesn't have to do a turnover it wasn't

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.050 
doesn't have to do a turnover it wasn't
necessarily<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.890> strong<00:02:37.250> point<00:02:37.519> for<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.849> Kings

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
necessarily a strong point for the Kings

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.149 
necessarily a strong point for the Kings
last<00:02:38.329> season<00:02:38.750> how<00:02:39.200> do<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.379> think<00:02:39.859> that<00:02:40.010> it's

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
last season how do you think that it's

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.530 
last season how do you think that it's
going<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.340> change<00:02:40.430> going<00:02:40.849> to<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.209> season

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
going to change going to this season

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.420 
going to change going to this season
just<00:02:41.689> from<00:02:41.870> what<00:02:42.019> you've<00:02:42.170> seen<00:02:42.379> a<00:02:42.439> glance<00:02:43.190> at

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
just from what you've seen a glance at

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.309 
just from what you've seen a glance at
at<00:02:43.579> being<00:02:43.819> around<00:02:44.060> coach<00:02:44.269> Westfall<00:02:44.690> well<00:02:45.109> just

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
at being around coach Westfall well just

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.410 
at being around coach Westfall well just
knowing<00:02:45.620> our<00:02:45.799> coach<00:02:46.159> West<00:02:46.879> father<00:02:47.120> knowing

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
knowing our coach West father knowing

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.750 
knowing our coach West father knowing
the<00:02:47.569> system<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.139> he<00:02:48.260> wants<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.560> do<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:49.459> run

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
the system that he wants to do to run

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.250 
the system that he wants to do to run
you're<00:02:50.120> gonna<00:02:50.269> have<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.540> get<00:02:50.629> stops<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.109> mean

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
you're gonna have to get stops I mean

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.390 
you're gonna have to get stops I mean
you're<00:02:51.409> not<00:02:51.500> going<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.769> be<00:02:51.829> able<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:52.010> run<00:02:52.190> when

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
you're not going to be able to run when

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.039 
you're not going to be able to run when
you<00:02:52.519> keep<00:02:52.730> taking<00:02:52.909> the<00:02:53.120> ball<00:02:53.299> out<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.510> basket

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
you keep taking the ball out the basket

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.160 
you keep taking the ball out the basket
so<00:02:54.470> obviously<00:02:55.099> defense<00:02:55.459> is<00:02:55.579> going<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.790> be<00:02:55.939> a

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
so obviously defense is going to be a

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.800 
so obviously defense is going to be a
emphasis<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.379> you<00:02:58.370> know<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.420> know<00:02:59.569> it's

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
emphasis and you know it you know it's

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.210 
emphasis and you know it you know it's
exciting<00:03:00.109> when<00:03:00.290> you<00:03:00.500> when<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.739> get<00:03:00.980> easy

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
the court I do think sometimes people

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.039 
the court I do think sometimes people
forget<00:03:15.949> that<00:03:16.340> really<00:03:16.669> it's<00:03:16.879> easier<00:03:17.239> for<00:03:17.269> the

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
forget that really it's easier for the

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.199 
forget that really it's easier for the
big<00:03:18.260> guys<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:19.310> be<00:03:19.430> more<00:03:19.639> vocal<00:03:19.790> on<00:03:20.090> the

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
big guys to be more vocal on the

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.300 
big guys to be more vocal on the
defensive<00:03:20.720> end<00:03:20.810> because<00:03:21.169> it's<00:03:21.799> all<00:03:21.980> in<00:03:22.129> front

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
defensive end because it's all in front

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.979 
defensive end because it's all in front
of<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:22.609> you<00:03:23.120> know<00:03:23.150> as<00:03:23.329> opposed<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
of you you know as opposed to the

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.930 
of you you know as opposed to the
opposite<00:03:24.379> end<00:03:24.470> on<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.799> offense<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.400> where

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
opposite end on the offense and where

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.879 
opposite end on the offense and where
the<00:03:26.030> point<00:03:26.209> guard<00:03:26.480> has<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.139> offense<00:03:27.530> in<00:03:27.680> front

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
the point guard has the offense in front

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:29.170 
the point guard has the offense in front
of<00:03:27.980> them<00:03:28.069> so<00:03:28.220> I<00:03:28.250> think<00:03:28.340> that's<00:03:28.639> something

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
of them so I think that's something

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.319 
of them so I think that's something
obviously<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:30.079> know<00:03:30.230> your<00:03:30.470> you'll<00:03:30.889> be<00:03:31.069> more
