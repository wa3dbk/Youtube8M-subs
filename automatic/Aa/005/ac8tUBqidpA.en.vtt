year<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:19.610> only<00:02:19.819> difference<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.360> we're

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
year the only difference is that we're

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.410 
year the only difference is that we're
trying<00:02:20.870> out<00:02:21.290> outpost<00:02:21.950> siege<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:23.090> think

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
trying out outpost siege and I think

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.809 
trying out outpost siege and I think
that<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.660> card<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.310> probably<00:02:25.310> like<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
that this card is probably like the

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.220 
that this card is probably like the
second<00:02:26.180> best<00:02:26.300> card<00:02:26.540> out<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.750> Khan's<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.200> tarkir

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.690 
second best card out of Khan's of tarkir
for<00:02:27.769> standard<00:02:28.180> my<00:02:29.180> best<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.750> don't<00:02:30.709> know<00:02:30.920> but<00:02:31.190> I

for standard my best I don't know but I

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.430 
for standard my best I don't know but I
don't<00:02:31.760> think<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.540> best<00:02:32.780> Tasker<00:02:33.319> is

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.130 
don't think this is the best Tasker is
close<00:02:33.769> but<00:02:34.099> we<00:02:34.940> have<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.120> few<00:02:35.390> new<00:02:35.569> goodies<00:02:35.840> we

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
of the way and so far Grandmaster is

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
going to trigger it and with Jess guys

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.000 
going to trigger it and with Jess guys
tendency<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.150> gets<00:03:59.359> way<00:04:00.079> way<00:04:00.590> out<00:04:00.620> of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
tendency it just gets way way out of

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.759 
tendency it just gets way way out of
control<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.609> I<00:04:02.000> we<00:04:02.930> played<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.319> a<00:04:03.410> little<00:04:03.530> bit

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
control and I we played it a little bit

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.559 
control and I we played it a little bit
in<00:04:03.950> our<00:04:04.400> versus<00:04:04.760> videos<00:04:05.060> but<00:04:05.299> we<00:04:05.420> haven't

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
in our versus videos but we haven't

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.349 
in our versus videos but we haven't
really<00:04:05.810> played<00:04:06.109> it<00:04:06.290> in<00:04:06.700> any<00:04:07.700> tournaments<00:04:08.209> yet

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
really played it in any tournaments yet

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.479 
really played it in any tournaments yet
and<00:04:08.569> that's<00:04:09.139> one<00:04:09.380> of<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.500> reasons<00:04:09.709> why<00:04:09.829> i'm

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
and that's one of the reasons why i'm

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.379 
and that's one of the reasons why i'm
using<00:04:11.299> this<00:04:11.690> video<00:04:12.079> is<00:04:12.350> like<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.530> test<00:04:13.069> for<00:04:13.400> this

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
using this video is like a test for this

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.420 
using this video is like a test for this
weekend<00:04:14.780> in<00:04:14.900> memphis<00:04:15.290> or<00:04:15.500> last<00:04:16.100> week<00:04:16.310> in

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
weekend in memphis or last week in

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.069 
weekend in memphis or last week in
tomatoes<00:04:16.820> but<00:04:17.389> hopefully<00:04:18.109> it<00:04:18.229> should<00:04:18.470> be

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
tomatoes but hopefully it should be

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.599 
tomatoes but hopefully it should be
pretty<00:04:19.199> good<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.919> only<00:04:20.099> thing<00:04:20.220> I'm<00:04:20.340> worried

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
pretty good the only thing I'm worried

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.179 
pretty good the only thing I'm worried
about<00:04:20.669> is<00:04:20.849> my<00:04:21.060> mana<00:04:21.599> base<00:04:21.919> specifically<00:04:22.919> I'm

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:23.189 
about is my mana base specifically I'm

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:24.860 
about is my mana base specifically I'm
trying<00:04:23.550> out<00:04:23.699> for<00:04:23.729> footage<00:04:24.330> strand<00:04:24.629> with<00:04:24.840> the

trying out for footage strand with the

trying out for footage strand with the
three<00:04:25.860> planes<00:04:26.129> and<00:04:26.370> an<00:04:26.699> island<00:04:27.120> as<00:04:27.719> opposed<00:04:28.050> to

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
three planes and an island as opposed to

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.749 
three planes and an island as opposed to
the<00:04:28.289> normal<00:04:28.469> three<00:04:28.919> photo<00:04:29.129> strand<00:04:29.430> with<00:04:29.580> two

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
the normal three photo strand with two

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.300 
the normal three photo strand with two
planes<00:04:29.969> in<00:04:30.120> an<00:04:30.210> island<00:04:30.539> because<00:04:31.439> I<00:04:31.469> do<00:04:31.710> want<00:04:32.250> to

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
planes in an island because I do want to

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.890 
planes in an island because I do want to
have<00:04:32.550> as<00:04:32.699> many<00:04:32.849> fetch<00:04:33.090> lands<00:04:33.389> for<00:04:33.689> treasure

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
have as many fetch lands for treasure

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.110 
have as many fetch lands for treasure
crews<00:04:34.199> as<00:04:34.319> possible<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:34.979> we're<00:04:35.639> stretching

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
crews as possible and we're stretching

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.920 
crews as possible and we're stretching
it<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.479> little<00:04:36.719> bit<00:04:36.990> but<00:04:37.680> other<00:04:38.159> than<00:04:38.460> that

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
it a little bit but other than that

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.209 
it a little bit but other than that
everything's<00:04:39.930> mostly<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.409> same<00:04:40.439> wild<00:04:40.889> slash

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
everything's mostly the same wild slash

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:42.950 
everything's mostly the same wild slash
is<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> pretty<00:04:41.849> sweet<00:04:42.120> removal<00:04:42.539> spell<00:04:42.780> right

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
is a pretty sweet removal spell right

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.689 
is a pretty sweet removal spell right
now<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.139> think<00:04:43.349> all<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.830> red-white<00:04:44.189> decks<00:04:44.430> play

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
now I think all the red-white decks play

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.179 
now I think all the red-white decks play
secret<00:04:45.060> of<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.180> way<00:04:45.330> and<00:04:45.979> goblin<00:04:46.979> drama

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
secret of the way and goblin drama

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:48.469 
secret of the way and goblin drama
master<00:04:47.550> is<00:04:47.759> going<00:04:47.939> to<00:04:48.000> help<00:04:48.150> out<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.330> lot

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
master is going to help out a lot

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.390 
master is going to help out a lot
against<00:04:48.750> them<00:04:48.930> not<00:04:49.439> going<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.710> be<00:04:49.800> great<00:04:50.039> here

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
against them not going to be great here

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.640 
against them not going to be great here
but<00:04:50.479> for<00:04:51.479> the<00:04:51.569> most<00:04:51.690> part<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:51.960> think<00:04:51.990> Walt<00:04:52.289> /<00:04:52.500> is

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
but for the most part I think Walt / is

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.490 
but for the most part I think Walt / is
going<00:04:52.860> to<00:04:52.919> be<00:04:53.009> phenomenal<00:04:53.550> in<00:04:54.289> against<00:04:55.289> most

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
going to be phenomenal in against most

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.959 
going to be phenomenal in against most
decks<00:04:55.740> yeah<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.370> only<00:04:56.460> thing<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.819> I<00:04:56.849> would

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:56.969 
decks yeah the only thing that I would

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.029 
decks yeah the only thing that I would
like<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.210> see<00:04:57.419> different<00:04:57.569> about<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.259> this

00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 
like to see different about the this

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:01.550 
like to see different about the this
iteration<00:04:59.340> is<00:04:59.580> uh<00:04:59.729> I<00:05:00.539> think<00:05:00.750> wild<00:05:01.259> slash<00:05:01.409> is

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
iteration is uh I think wild slash is

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.490 
iteration is uh I think wild slash is
very<00:05:02.009> important<00:05:02.430> to<00:05:02.490> this<00:05:02.810> strategy<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:03.990> I

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
very important to this strategy and I

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.959 
very important to this strategy and I
would<00:05:04.650> almost<00:05:04.889> want<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.190> see<00:05:05.340> just<00:05:05.580> like<00:05:05.699> this

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:05.969 
would almost want to see just like this

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.809 
would almost want to see just like this
yeah<00:05:06.569> actually<00:05:07.039> it's<00:05:08.039> really<00:05:08.370> funny<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:08.669> you

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
yeah actually it's really funny that you

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.129 
yeah actually it's really funny that you
say<00:05:08.969> that<00:05:09.000> because<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.479> last<00:05:09.750> night<00:05:09.960> when<00:05:10.080> I

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
say that because the last night when I

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:11.300 
say that because the last night when I
was<00:05:10.229> actually<00:05:10.529> building<00:05:10.800> this<00:05:10.919> deck<00:05:11.099> and<00:05:11.279> I

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
was actually building this deck and I

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.499 
was actually building this deck and I
was<00:05:11.430> writing<00:05:11.639> my<00:05:11.729> article<00:05:11.789> about<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.300> and

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
was writing my article about it and

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.200 
was writing my article about it and
stuff<00:05:12.690> like<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:12.870> I<00:05:13.169> was<00:05:13.529> considering

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
stuff like that I was considering

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.670 
stuff like that I was considering
playing<00:05:15.210> for<00:05:15.509> wild<00:05:15.810> slash<00:05:15.990> and<00:05:16.289> only<00:05:16.500> to

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
playing for wild slash and only to

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.499 
playing for wild slash and only to
lightning<00:05:16.979> strike<00:05:17.279> because<00:05:18.000> we<00:05:18.150> have<00:05:18.270> so<00:05:18.419> many

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
lightning strike because we have so many

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:19.760 
lightning strike because we have so many
lands<00:05:18.779> that<00:05:18.900> come<00:05:19.020> into<00:05:19.139> play<00:05:19.229> tapped<00:05:19.500> it's

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
lands that come into play tapped it's

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.040 
lands that come into play tapped it's
really<00:05:20.159> important<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.639> go<00:05:20.789> like<00:05:21.000> Taplin<00:05:21.659> into

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
really important to go like Taplin into

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.680 
really important to go like Taplin into
Taplin<00:05:22.919> wild<00:05:23.400> slash<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.849> or<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.240> drop<00:05:24.479> or

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
Taplin wild slash you or to drop or

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.740 
Taplin wild slash you or to drop or
three<00:05:24.960> drop<00:05:25.169> and<00:05:26.060> you<00:05:27.060> know<00:05:27.150> lightning<00:05:27.479> strike

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
three drop and you know lightning strike

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.930 
three drop and you know lightning strike
does<00:05:28.440> kill<00:05:28.740> a<00:05:28.770> few<00:05:29.009> more<00:05:29.190> things<00:05:29.490> than<00:05:29.669> wild

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
does kill a few more things than wild

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.580 
does kill a few more things than wild
slash<00:05:30.150> but<00:05:30.360> mostly<00:05:30.690> something<00:05:31.110> like<00:05:31.259> against

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
slash but mostly something like against

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.779 
slash but mostly something like against
things<00:05:31.740> like<00:05:31.830> cedar<00:05:32.099> on<00:05:32.250> earth<00:05:32.340> is<00:05:32.490> actually

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
things like cedar on earth is actually

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.180 
things like cedar on earth is actually
combo<00:05:33.120> killed<00:05:33.409> but<00:05:34.409> when<00:05:34.680> we're<00:05:34.800> trying<00:05:34.919> to<00:05:35.069> do

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
combo killed but when we're trying to do

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.649 
combo killed but when we're trying to do
the<00:05:35.310> last<00:05:35.490> few<00:05:35.699> points<00:05:35.969> of<00:05:36.060> damage<00:05:36.210> I<00:05:36.449> think

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
the last few points of damage I think

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.450 
the last few points of damage I think
having<00:05:36.839> for<00:05:37.500> lighting<00:05:37.800> strikes<00:05:38.069> is<00:05:38.250> better

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
having for lighting strikes is better

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.459 
having for lighting strikes is better
and<00:05:38.759> in<00:05:39.330> a<00:05:39.419> deck<00:05:39.599> like<00:05:39.629> this<00:05:39.990> that<00:05:40.199> is

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
and in a deck like this that is

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.529 
and in a deck like this that is
occasionally<00:05:41.430> going<00:05:41.639> to<00:05:41.759> be<00:05:41.879> relevant<00:05:42.060> so

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 
occasionally going to be relevant so

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.570 
occasionally going to be relevant so
sure<00:05:42.750> anyway<00:05:43.440> guys<00:05:43.589> that<00:05:44.069> is<00:05:44.190> the<00:05:44.310> main<00:05:44.430> deck

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
sure anyway guys that is the main deck

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.219 
sure anyway guys that is the main deck
for<00:05:44.729> just<00:05:44.909> guy<00:05:45.029> tokens<00:05:45.449> let's<00:05:45.900> go<00:05:45.990> and<00:05:46.110> take<00:05:46.169> a

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
for just guy tokens let's go and take a

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.809 
for just guy tokens let's go and take a
look<00:05:46.409> at<00:05:46.560> the<00:05:46.650> sideboard<00:05:47.069> and<00:05:47.219> then<00:05:47.460> see<00:05:47.699> how

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:47.819 
look at the sideboard and then see how

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.909 
look at the sideboard and then see how
the<00:05:47.879> matchup<00:05:48.240> plays<00:05:48.419> out<00:05:48.599> alright<00:05:49.589> so<00:05:49.740> the

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
the matchup plays out alright so the

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.939 
the matchup plays out alright so the
sideboard<00:05:50.370> here<00:05:50.729> for<00:05:51.419> Jess<00:05:51.690> guy<00:05:51.839> tokens<00:05:52.349> no

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
sideboard here for Jess guy tokens no

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.550 
sideboard here for Jess guy tokens no
blue<00:05:53.250> cards<00:05:53.639> and<00:05:53.759> I<00:05:53.940> think<00:05:54.180> that<00:05:54.360> is<00:05:54.569> mainly

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
blue cards and I think that is mainly

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.409 
blue cards and I think that is mainly
due<00:05:55.710> the<00:05:55.979> fact<00:05:56.129> that<00:05:56.279> we<00:05:56.639> have<00:05:56.819> outpost<00:05:57.240> siege

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
due the fact that we have outpost siege

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.170 
due the fact that we have outpost siege
we<00:05:57.659> don't<00:05:57.839> really<00:05:58.139> want<00:05:58.379> a<00:05:59.099> disdainful<00:05:59.699> stroke

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
we don't really want a disdainful stroke

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.999 
we don't really want a disdainful stroke
negate<00:06:00.750> things<00:06:01.050> like<00:06:01.229> that<00:06:01.379> because<00:06:01.620> we<00:06:01.800> want

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
negate things like that because we want

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:04.279 
negate things like that because we want
to<00:06:02.039> make<00:06:02.099> sure<00:06:02.190> that<00:06:02.580> we're<00:06:03.029> very<00:06:03.300> proactive

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
to make sure that we're very proactive

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.480 
to make sure that we're very proactive
against<00:06:04.500> the<00:06:04.620> control<00:06:04.949> decks<00:06:05.159> and<00:06:05.339> we<00:06:05.400> don't

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
against the control decks and we don't

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.920 
against the control decks and we don't
really<00:06:05.789> want<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.060> try<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.270> rely<00:06:06.599> on<00:06:06.750> having

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
really want to try to rely on having

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.290 
really want to try to rely on having
counter<00:06:07.319> spells<00:06:07.789> additionally<00:06:08.789> against

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
counter spells additionally against

things like abs and mid-range or just

black decks in general they're going to

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.809

is not always going to be something that
you<00:06:21.029> can<00:06:21.210> reliably<00:06:21.539> do<00:06:21.960> so<00:06:22.379> that's<00:06:22.889> why<00:06:23.039> we

you can reliably do so that's why we

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:23.980 
you can reliably do so that's why we
