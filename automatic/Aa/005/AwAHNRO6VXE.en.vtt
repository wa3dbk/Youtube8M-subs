and<00:00:32.689> we've<00:00:32.809> been<00:00:32.899> playing<00:00:33.110> series<00:00:33.500> all<00:00:33.649> season

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270

and we've been playing series all season
this<00:00:35.270> is<00:00:35.420> obviously<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.930> one<00:00:36.050> that's<00:00:36.230> most

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
this is obviously the one that's most

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.660 
this is obviously the one that's most
important<00:00:36.860> so<00:00:36.980> far<00:00:39.130> just<00:00:40.130> can't<00:00:40.340> seem<00:00:40.489> to<00:00:40.520> get

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
important so far just can't seem to get

our<00:00:56.750> own<00:00:56.780> field<00:00:57.770> that<00:00:58.040> would<00:00:58.130> be<00:00:58.310> just

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
our own field that would be just

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.080 
our own field that would be just
terrible

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.090 

unfortunately<00:01:02.380> it<00:01:03.380> doesn't<00:01:03.650> seem<00:01:03.770> like<00:01:03.950> we

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
unfortunately it doesn't seem like we

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.999 
unfortunately it doesn't seem like we
have<00:01:04.129> much<00:01:04.369> of<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.549> choice

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009

drives<00:01:26.330> there<00:01:26.900> I<00:01:27.850> guess<00:01:28.850> there<00:01:29.120> situations

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
drives there I guess there situations

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
a good jump out of the box and I'm just

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.649 
a good jump out of the box and I'm just
not<00:01:47.960> playing<00:01:48.350> well<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:49.119> might<00:01:50.119> have<00:01:50.270> helped<00:01:50.510> us

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
not playing well I might have helped us

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
but all I'm doing right now is hurting

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.260 
but all I'm doing right now is hurting
us<00:01:56.140> I'm<00:01:57.140> barely<00:01:57.470> making<00:01:57.770> contact<00:01:58.340> I'm

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
us I'm barely making contact I'm

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.450 
us I'm barely making contact I'm
striking<00:01:59.630> out<00:01:59.930> more<00:02:00.229> than<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:00.439> do<00:02:00.560> ever<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:03.460> at

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
striking out more than I do ever and at

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.700 
striking out more than I do ever and at
least<00:02:04.610> I'm<00:02:04.850> doing<00:02:04.880> somewhat<00:02:05.509> helpful<00:02:06.290> things

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
least I'm doing somewhat helpful things

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.770 
least I'm doing somewhat helpful things
on<00:02:06.890> defense

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
on defense

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.539 
on defense
but<00:02:08.780> for<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.929> most<00:02:09.080> part<00:02:09.200> I'm<00:02:09.739> really<00:02:09.799> just

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
but for the most part I'm really just

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.460 
but for the most part I'm really just
not<00:02:12.040> contributing<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.129> way<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.250> want<00:02:13.610> to

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.170 

not<00:02:17.470> double<00:02:17.800> play<00:02:17.980> but<00:02:18.310> another<00:02:18.760> soft

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
not double play but another soft

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.820 
not double play but another soft
grounder<00:02:20.910> I'm<00:02:21.910> getting<00:02:22.480> on<00:02:22.570> base<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.200> my

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
grounder I'm getting on base and my

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.470 
grounder I'm getting on base and my
speed<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.160> enough<00:02:24.490> that<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:24.910> get<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.270> off<00:02:25.450> of

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
speed is enough that I can get in off of

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.380 
speed is enough that I can get in off of
that<00:02:25.870> which<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.530> kind<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.830> impressive<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:30.390> we

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
that which is kind of impressive but we
