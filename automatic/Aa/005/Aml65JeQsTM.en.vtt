00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.740
 and hello again to all of Voronezh friends 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.139
 the day has come and it means you can 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.040
 work out cooking and cook 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.520
 something delicious 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.180
 this time I will cook pickled 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.650
 mackerel but it will not be a simple recipe 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.880
 pickled mackerel 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.269
 a little bit unusual as a result of this 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.600
 recipe we have to get mackerel 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:35.730
 a little golden color imitation 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.170
 smoking means for this recipe to us 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.390
 need mackerel this mackerel already 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.520
 cleaned the entrails and hit the gills 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.570
 this is not a requirement 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.180
 but highly desirable and if not removed 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.710
 internals and gills scrape 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.899
 get a little bit bitter 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.990
 Well, even this may slightly 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.050
 to grow thin brine in our case 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.660
 racial transparency is not critical because 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.790
 that we will have it shaded once but 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.360
 bitterness and don't want to get in 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.720
 finished fish yet for this recipe we 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.500
 need onion peel 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:21.300
 tea leaves of black tea on 3 liters of brine I 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.990
 took 7 teaspoons usual zavarkin 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.460
 black tea is not flavored also 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.800
 4 leaves of laurel is required 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.860
 a small handful of peppers 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.650
 a small handful of black pepper 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.540
 2 cloves and 5 allspice of allspice 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.460
 also on the pickle will require for salt and 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.560
 sugar 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.570
 Pickle principle can be prepared by 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.300

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:11.900

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:15.680
