00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
shines on a clean Channel and so that's

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:35.730

let's keep the seconds of Sam and see
how<00:02:56.480> much<00:02:56.659> gain<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.019> is<00:02:57.560> with<00:02:57.680> full<00:02:57.920> gain<00:02:58.189> and

stream it does have a lot more gain than

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:47.720 
stream it does have a lot more gain than
the<00:03:01.969> standard

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.980 

and<00:03:48.730> also<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.090> pedal<00:03:49.420> gets<00:03:49.570> very<00:03:49.870> very

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
and also this pedal gets very very

I<00:03:55.240> tend<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.780> have<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.080> turn<00:03:56.260> almost<00:03:56.650> all<00:03:57.010> the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
I tend to have the turn almost all the

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.860 
I tend to have the turn almost all the
way<00:03:57.160> off<00:03:57.250> nearly<00:03:57.550> all<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.760> way<00:03:57.880> but<00:03:58.540> here<00:03:58.690> is

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
way off nearly all the way but here is

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.590 
way off nearly all the way but here is
3/4<00:03:59.470> of<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> way<00:03:59.770> up<00:03:59.860> for<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.070> kind<00:04:00.340> of<00:04:00.600> typical

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
3/4 of the way up for a kind of typical

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
British Brian Mayer kind of sound I

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:29.660 
British Brian Mayer kind of sound I
guess

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.490 

personally<00:04:30.670> I've<00:04:30.790> no<00:04:31.000> use<00:04:31.030> for<00:04:31.240> that<00:04:31.510> but<00:04:31.750> will

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
personally I've no use for that but will

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.140 
personally I've no use for that but will
they<00:04:32.620> go<00:04:32.800> there<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:33.130> it<00:04:33.460> will<00:04:33.550> certainly<00:04:33.760> cut

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
they go there and it will certainly cut

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.060 
they go there and it will certainly cut
through<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:34.660> mix<00:04:34.870> live<00:04:35.140> very<00:04:35.620> very<00:04:35.890> easily
