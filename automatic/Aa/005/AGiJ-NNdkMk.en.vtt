00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.930
 today for a video on a sneak 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.180
 peek there just out on clash of 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.680
 clan and so I'm in the company of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.680
 nick 69 hello guy 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.970
 yeah thank you so no worries so at the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.619
 thank you for accepting 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.059
 the invitation there to talk about this 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.860
 little update there by the way I'm 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.390
 in your clan there you just created 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.680
 temporarily hopscotch history 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.040
 had envy huh is that a little clan 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.040
 or youtube 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.229
 I thought why not here so 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.729
 we went with bruno to see a little bit 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.809
 nicli you do I'm going to talk I 'll 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.400
 ask if he wanted to make a 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.470
 video about this update 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.150
 so as you see on the screen 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.190
 currently so on the different 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.309
 social networks they posted a message 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.040
 so in English one necessarily but who 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.339
 mark so he marks from the walls 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.650
 level 6 we can op with gold 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.270
 or lexie will reconsider the choice so 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.760
 what do you think about it? 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:17.550
 blood ben hears that we small farmer 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.200
 who plays the new is this link by 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.820
 against for those who already have walls 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.000
 levels 6 and up it's going to make them 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.130
 to moan because we feel really low 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.610
 wrong in the sense that they had to form 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.870
 really a lot of gold for example the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.230
 crazy the elixir what once you have 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.780
 does the herds max so you're at 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.920
 each time speared the shots and that's it 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.170
 that's the problem is that it's going to do 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.790
 to moan a lot of people but that's true 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.330
 that's good it's going to help the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.330
 community 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.000
 max and the walls faster here is 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.610
 because she needed more 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.120
 now just the time the ex really 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.350
 train both at the same time what 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.240
 we can see on the image we can 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.310
 either ep directly with gold or 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.210
 to elixir so it's true that excuse me 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.640
 a little technical problem so it's 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.140
 true that there are still a lot of 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.280
 players who have a lot more elixir 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.750
 that every time it's the same 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.130
 problem we often find ourselves trampled 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.090
 the icsi finally after I do not know you because 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.380
 that it's always the same you 're a 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.300
 quite high level so maybe that 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.860
 it's a dispute for you but we 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.850
 in my clan anyway there is 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.810
 a lot of players complaining 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.020
 often to have a lot a lot 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.750
 of elixir for lack of voice of two lighthouses 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.190
 but at least less well 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.360
 does it so it's true that it can when 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.040
 even helped but it will be necessary to pay attention 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.810
 because if we still want the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.140
 labo turn will have to do the share of 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:38.120
 things I think I do not know that because 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.160
 there is still a crime by putting 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.660
 up to date there was going to be 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.760
 frankly not everyone really 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.640
 just go with the exile and the 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.840
 problem as you said it is that 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.310
 do not forget that the elixir 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.050
 is very important if you do not have 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.600
 still max and all your troops elixir 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.700
 so it's very important to keep it 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.330
 so really in common is good of the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.160
 say 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.780
 previously 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.480
 be sure now to make good use of it 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.990
 and to share things well you 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.820
 organize 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.700
 and what you think you it will 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.470
 the hardest hit now there 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.970
 will have an extra difficulty when 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.560
 we will attack because precisely the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.630
 walls have a better level or crate 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.190
 how do you think that's going to happen I 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.690
 think people are already going that the 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.070
 community clash yeah that's okay 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.690
 I think it's still ok 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.580
 greatly increased the difficulty 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.230
 if everyone gets on the walls 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.630
 finally after I know that there are a lot of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.960
 compositions that it does not bother the walls 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.210
 but it slows down considerably what 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.350
 so it's true we risk finding 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.710
 villages still a lot more 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.600
 max and at the walls so the 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.030
 difficulty will be a little bit increased 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:46.040
 but it's not bad it's not bad it's 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.540
 sure with the end of yeah here 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.980
 that's it so I need it I think this 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.600
 will really need to improve its 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.190
 breaks brick to the max level because one 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.860
 risk of ending up with villages 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.570
 really with good bases so 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.190
 we will keep you informed of the next 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.450
 sneak peek i do not know if i would have would 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.950
 again with nick but I 'll try to 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.890
 you make a little video at each 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.540
 time he will have one coming out and so 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.350
 there was the end also of wizards so 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.420
 there are plenty of things going 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.650
 chaining down the wizards that had been 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.360
 decreased in cost and time 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.220
 training so it's over 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.840
 now we're on the walls and we're going 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.430
 see soon what will come out so 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.720
 do not hesitate to tell us in the 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.160
 comments what do you think of this 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.310
 update is what you think that 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.350
 the difficulty will be increased and if you 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.150
 have ideas for the next ones 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.560
