00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.269
 in my previous tutorial it happened to me 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.840
 put how to make faces in three 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.110
 rooms and such an end so this is a 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.200
 Annex to this the previous tutorial as well 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.200
 what 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.800
 as I mentioned in the tutorial 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.470
 earlier here I am doing the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.489
 circles that are the basis and I will put 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.619
 the guide lines for example is going to be the 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.400
 middle line for the opposite face 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.140
 and I'm going to do it 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.920
 the days for which the mind of the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.940
 circle and then where are the eyebrows going 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.890
 is where the eyes go 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.890
 the same is circle and a half to 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.160
 I put the base of the first circle 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.400
 is the part that is a little bit more 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:05.680
 difficult at least for me that are the 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:09.280
 sides to practice 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.230
 better is the mouth between what is the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.350
 nose and chin of the mouth 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.170
 now dry and as I mentioned the 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.650
 separation between eyes has to be the 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.190
 same measure of one 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:29.450
 ears and nose 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:32.329
 now the profile equal circle 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.759
 I started by the eyebrows being down to the 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:39.540
 same line that I did ear a while ago 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.850
 I put it a little bit apart from the line 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.230
 the nose like this is not washing the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.940
 base of the circle 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.940
 in the same line 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.980
 here I put what the side looks for 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.640
 lower and there I do 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.050
 chin 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.460
 I rely on 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.460
 speak with two lines 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.930
 menthol a little bit with thiago 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.230
 for faces in three quarters is done 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.950
 a line like that curves when I'm 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.450
 putting on this at this time and of 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.450
 there they all provide there I put 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.040
 I imagine how I go 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.459
 and turning the face creeper of the first 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.730
 for example in the eye the right eye what 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.769
 I'm doing the right game and what 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.189
 I put a little smaller than 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.189
 what not 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.569
 and so it seems that if it is 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.870
 who is flipping 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:47.999
 here you can notice that the side side 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.400
 face right is almost the same as the 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.620
 side the right side of the face that is 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.930
 at 20 the only thing that would change would be the side 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.829
 on the side of the ear even if I change a 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.829
 little measure and so it seems that is 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.829
 proportional 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.490
 well I think that's all I hope that 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.670
 they liked that they have been served 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.860
 somehow 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.770
 they liked this video subscribe if not what 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.450
 they have made comments 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.230
 and then we'll see you with the next video 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.230
 good
