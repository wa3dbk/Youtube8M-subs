00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
only it has been as processed it hasn't

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.490 
only it has been as processed it hasn't
been<00:00:44.489> bleached<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.690> got<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> bit<00:00:46.200> thicker

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
been bleached and it's got a bit thicker

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.840 
been bleached and it's got a bit thicker
grain<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.039> if<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.219> making<00:00:47.460> something<00:00:47.640> like

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
grain so if you're making something like

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029 
grain so if you're making something like
a<00:00:47.879> rustic<00:00:48.300> tart<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.379> nice<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> use

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
because it Browns it really nicely and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.910 
because it Browns it really nicely and
it<00:00:53.250> gives<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.550> great<00:00:53.940> nutty<00:00:54.480> flavor<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.199> okay
