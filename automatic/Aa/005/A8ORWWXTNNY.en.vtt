00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:11.970
 Hello everyone, I want to play again today 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.590
 lasts a little on mine for the clinic under 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.110
 record hope again that you 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.760
 fun to watch the video for hours with 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.490
 master fide rival enough 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.160
 strong here and play their favorite 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 countries child protection if yes 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.630
 and the option itself is obtained by convenience 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.390
 same 4 where 1 with an finding black this 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.540
 the fight for point 4 position is very difficult 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.400
 in terms of strategy here I am far away 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.290
 I do not remember everything if I honestly remember that 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.920
 somewhere you need somehow need 4 gilds 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.860
 probably now then play horse c6 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.750
 yes on d5 horse to 4 now now now 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.890
 this one is forgotten second 4 or somehow 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.040
 another way nt4 or not have another idea 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.839
 just different so again I don't even know 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.489
 what idea apply on let's horse d4 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.229
 I have already started it once 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.240
 she will play with lonely tree either c5 or e5 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.270
 how blue is hard to say even e5 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.710
 stronger to be honest 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.890
 gave peter wants to change his bad 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.840
 an elephant 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.630
 but I don’t have to change yet 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.729
 now so maybe I have somewhere there 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.450
 will be 54 he has a move then to him 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.890
 6 per move usually in such positions is bad 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.869
 in this situation seems to me quite 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.970
 possible so yes he can now 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.800
 change already on the field and 6 on the principle 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.800
 I will like my structure because 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.290
 that there is no weakness in principle 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.659
 that's why the movie just doesn't change 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.240
 now probably will play in 4 to f4 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.369
 and then what followed me 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.759
 there is another idea is all the same to 11 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:54.170
 5 translate 1 of 2 what it is 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.750
 the big question is f5 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.610
 it is clear that there will be kunyanets again in 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.720
 principle ended again, too, is possible 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.970
 again, you probably don’t need a move at 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.649
 case 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.479
 that there was no progress on the 4 but have yet 4 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.619
 until no so some sleep play 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.619
 dowtham is exchanged and 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.250
 let's change here I will play again all 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.890
 again a useful move anyway 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.750
 he move you by the way this is a knight on 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.920
 b3 it all can play somehow of course 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.920
 b3 a3 and then charge try there 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 move forward 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.220
 so what a fader 4 I like the move 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.680
 so juicy forged can be nikon 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.660
 d5 is true the answer is up to 5 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.280
 Of course a little bit did not take it into account 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.700
 gave bout to 5 she plays on strong 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:56.760
 the rival cannot tell me yet 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.470
 get along 8 walk ugly make a move in 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.690
 principle a glass is not a question any especially 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.620
 I do not have one of the ideas it can be 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.110
 it is even to move 5 I do not know what it is for me 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.560
 will give the truth 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:13.060
 and part of the idea for her to play 6 strengthen 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.290
 walk c7 bye get rid of the queen 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.300
 university does he then go about empty 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.870
 and yet the way there Hotz 6 somewhere else 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.900
 will be c6 there 3 in 4 yes let's do it and 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.040
 played but he anticipates vanity 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:32.660
 chasing me away that sacrificing is useless 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.560
 probably let's leave while he too 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.160
 for the project pawn on 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.130
 the field is happiness 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:47.690
 scary summer or can it somehow 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.959
 donate or much choice not even 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.959
 there 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.960
 for up to 85 let's water up to 8 show us 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.520
 eat on foot there how do not be quiet 5 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:04.070
 maybe try something 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:06.290
 come up with such a c5 queen e5 can 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.020
 be a fire up to 3 something like that 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.560
 some kind of game true queen will be again 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:15.530
 maybe horse 4 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.940
 somewhere I don’t know very difficult position so 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.720
 I can not immediately evaluate the whole table 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.720
 little time 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:39.030
 gives them to offer to exchange queens well 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:43.230
 Apparently I have to change due to the work that hurts 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:46.460
 beatley now what the question is probably not 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.200
 it's worth to beat him a pawn is still weak 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.270
 pawn on field 4 I mean and let's 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.630
 Then I will play on the dune thought more 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.450
 in 3 you need to change the idea she has there 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.150
 moan hangs by the way on the water to 8 to oil 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:05.310
 the gap will not drag your katana 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:08.529
 issue but they have a three-course 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.649
 of course f3 horse 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:12.639
 I may have the extra quality will remain 

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:14.139
 Now it takes me to be unnecessary 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.299
 qualities and spiers but it won 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.099
 position so I understand that without end 4 

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:19.179
 is lost 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:23.649
 there is and everything should be fine here 

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:26.259
 win as we walk now not only 

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:29.769
 pawn give yes so I would play 5 I gave 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:34.799
 Would play 5 shows while she trilogy 

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:38.819
 d3 will fleet will now be king run 

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:41.889
 century a king or a4 become there is an idea 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:44.679
 a4 then 4 go even more 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.859
 so I do not read c5 

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:51.819
 where you don’t have to eat ate and 

00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:55.509
 ran so too need to eat there after all 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:06:00.069
 it was just a panda move 3 maybe 6 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:02.219
 so I will play gave here already more game goes 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.219
 for a while 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.759
 but the position must also be won 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.379
 by the way how here after horse h6 blood for 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:12.589
 seven more and lost his horse 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:14.569
 but it was interesting this kind of not 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:16.610
 most of all there is no interest there in that 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.739
 It was also when they claim 6 and often 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.629
 back even with the engine I want to see 

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:22.749
 it seems to me too heavy home 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:22.749
 situation 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.979
 connection to 6 for example not even 50 what 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.810
 pires wanted to play a horse on c5 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.819
 finally again just bad because of the queen 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.729
 e5 vodka or six good boat he would 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.949
 6 versions of a3 and it turns out after the end of 4 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:43.680
 pawn played an active and powerful figure 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:46.569
 he played f5 exchange of queens was on 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.580
 give water up to 6 error yes because 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:50.979
 the fact that the icon in 3 is not 5 apparently 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.190
 also gave the campaign wins the material in 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:55.919
 I end up with external qualities 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.509
 will give positions already technically winning 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.430
 Well pretty interesting game 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:02.380
 I hope that you still liked me 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.750
 it was nice to win in the master of sports 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.860
 Thank you all for your attention and see you soon 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.860
 meeting new videos
