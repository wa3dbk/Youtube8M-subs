00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
and the newspapers and I think this is

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.510 
and the newspapers and I think this is
important<00:00:42.540> especially<00:00:42.739> Game<00:00:43.739> three<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.219> is

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
important especially Game three that is

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
important especially Game three that is
the<00:00:44.730> most<00:00:44.850> important<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.690> opinion<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
the most important one in my opinion and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.200 
the most important one in my opinion and
Game<00:00:46.980> two<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> fairly<00:00:47.579> important<00:00:48.090> also

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
Game two is fairly important also

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
Game two is fairly important also
everybody<00:00:48.750> has<00:00:48.899> four<00:00:49.200> preseason<00:00:49.739> games<00:00:50.190> a

everybody has four preseason games a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.549 
everybody has four preseason games a
game<00:00:51.480> three<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> most<00:00:52.079> important<00:00:52.469> because

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559

high as the 18th player overall and you

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.679 
high as the 18th player overall and you
know<00:01:53.220> he's<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> rookie<00:01:53.640> who<00:01:53.909> hasn't<00:01:54.270> really

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
know he's a rookie who hasn't really

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.080 
know he's a rookie who hasn't really
done<00:01:54.840> anything<00:01:54.899> yet<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:56.250> I've<00:01:56.399> also<00:01:56.579> seen<00:01:56.880> him

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
done anything yet but I've also seen him

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.289 
done anything yet but I've also seen him
ranked<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.479> low<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> high<00:01:58.350> 30s<00:01:58.380> so

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
ranked as low as in the high 30s so

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.969 
ranked as low as in the high 30s so
again<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.600> strongly<00:02:00.990> suggest<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.500> use<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
again I strongly suggest you use it as a

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.550 
again I strongly suggest you use it as a
guide<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.119> follow<00:02:04.020> what's<00:02:04.439> going

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
guide and that you follow what's going

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.760 
guide and that you follow what's going
on<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.549> watch<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.479> preseason<00:02:06.960> games<00:02:07.409> and

more fun to draft players like that and

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.319 
more fun to draft players like that and
and<00:02:34.889> hopefully<00:02:35.400> watch<00:02:35.579> them<00:02:35.760> grow<00:02:35.909> as<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
and hopefully watch them grow as the

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.979 
and hopefully watch them grow as the
season<00:02:36.659> goes<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:38.459> other<00:02:38.639> point<00:02:39.329> my<00:02:39.780> third

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
season goes on the other point my third

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.319 
season goes on the other point my third
point<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:41.129> really<00:02:41.370> do<00:02:41.609> a<00:02:41.639> lot<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.909> research

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
point is to really do a lot of research

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.440 
point is to really do a lot of research
of<00:02:42.540> all<00:02:42.719> the<00:02:42.900> rookies<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.409> are<00:02:43.530> playing<00:02:43.769> and

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
of all the rookies that are playing and

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.479 
of all the rookies that are playing and
to<00:02:45.450> watch<00:02:45.840> again<00:02:46.169> watch<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.829> games<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.340> see

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
to watch again watch the games to see

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.949 
to watch again watch the games to see
how<00:02:47.639> much<00:02:47.760> playing<00:02:48.060> time<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.510> rookies<00:02:48.810> are

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
how much playing time the rookies are

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.500 
how much playing time the rookies are
getting<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.829> I<00:02:50.280> strongly<00:02:50.579> suggest<00:02:51.180> that

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
getting and I strongly suggest that

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.289 
getting and I strongly suggest that
simply<00:02:51.900> because<00:02:52.290> in<00:02:52.769> my<00:02:53.310> opinion<00:02:53.459> there's<00:02:54.180> at

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
simply because in my opinion there's at

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.819 
simply because in my opinion there's at
least<00:02:54.329> three<00:02:54.569> or<00:02:54.870> four<00:02:55.049> possibly<00:02:55.530> more

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
least three or four possibly more

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.039 
least three or four possibly more
rookies<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.370> will<00:02:56.669> pick<00:02:56.849> this<00:02:57.030> year<00:02:57.090> who<00:02:57.900> in

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
rookies that will pick this year who in

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.020 
rookies that will pick this year who in
my<00:02:58.200> opinion<00:02:58.230> will<00:02:58.859> be<00:02:59.040> starting<00:02:59.579> for<00:02:59.879> their

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
my opinion will be starting for their

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.899 
my opinion will be starting for their
team<00:03:00.769> just<00:03:01.769> real<00:03:01.950> quick<00:03:01.980> rundown<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.790> I

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
team just real quick rundown and I

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.879 
team just real quick rundown and I
really<00:03:03.209> strongly<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.900> know<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.319> Matt<00:03:04.650> Ryan

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
really strongly I know that Matt Ryan

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.140 
really strongly I know that Matt Ryan
will<00:03:05.159> most<00:03:05.310> likely<00:03:05.489> be<00:03:05.639> starting<00:03:06.090> a

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
will most likely be starting a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.659 
will most likely be starting a
quarterback<00:03:06.629> for<00:03:07.109> Atlanta<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.889> there<00:03:08.579> are

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
Jonathan Steele for Carolina I think all

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.259 
Jonathan Steele for Carolina I think all
of<00:03:25.290> these<00:03:25.560> running<00:03:25.889> backs<00:03:26.069> will<00:03:26.669> either<00:03:26.940> be

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
of these running backs will either be

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.569 
of these running backs will either be
starting<00:03:27.780> or<00:03:27.959> will<00:03:28.470> be<00:03:28.620> getting<00:03:28.919> significant

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
starting or will be getting significant

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.599 
starting or will be getting significant
playing<00:03:29.849> time<00:03:30.709> sometime<00:03:31.709> during<00:03:31.919> the<00:03:32.099> season

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
playing time sometime during the season

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.539 
playing time sometime during the season
so<00:03:33.419> I<00:03:33.840> think<00:03:34.139> that<00:03:34.409> you<00:03:34.739> should<00:03:34.769> definitely<00:03:35.250> do

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
so I think that you should definitely do

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.610 
so I think that you should definitely do
the<00:03:35.699> research<00:03:36.030> on<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.359> rookies<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.019> see<00:03:37.470> what

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
the research on the rookies and see what

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.559 
the research on the rookies and see what
kind<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:38.040> playing<00:03:38.729> time<00:03:38.790> they<00:03:39.090> get<00:03:39.239> during<00:03:39.479> the

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
kind of playing time they get during the

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.449 
kind of playing time they get during the
preseason<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:40.229> try<00:03:40.409> to<00:03:40.470> gauge<00:03:40.769> which<00:03:41.099> ones<00:03:41.340> you

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
preseason to try to gauge which ones you

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.819 
preseason to try to gauge which ones you
might<00:03:41.579> want<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.879> put<00:03:42.030> on<00:03:42.120> your<00:03:42.269> roster<00:03:42.829> the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
might want to put on your roster the

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.830 
might want to put on your roster the

preseason injuries that's
self-explanatory<00:03:48.180> as<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.900> why<00:03:48.989> that's

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
self-explanatory as to why that's

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.229 
self-explanatory as to why that's
important<00:03:49.769> simply<00:03:50.669> because<00:03:50.759> you<00:03:50.939> really

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
important simply because you really

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.399 
important simply because you really
don't<00:03:51.359> want<00:03:51.479> to<00:03:51.569> draft<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.870> player<00:03:52.049> who's

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
period of time the only thing that I do

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.589
