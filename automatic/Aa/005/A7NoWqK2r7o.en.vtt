cm<00:00:11.509> GPU<00:00:17.330> there<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.420> go<00:00:20.449> alright<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.660> can

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
cm GPU there we go alright as you can

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.200 
cm GPU there we go alright as you can
see<00:00:22.050> we're<00:00:22.230> getting<00:00:22.439> about<00:00:22.529> high<00:00:23.220> 60<00:00:23.820> s<00:00:23.850> frame

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
see we're getting about high 60 s frame

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.679 
see we're getting about high 60 s frame
rates<00:00:24.510> per<00:00:24.689> second<00:00:25.279> reaching<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.550> 81<00:00:27.000> but

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
rates per second reaching up to 81 but

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.330 
rates per second reaching up to 81 but
during<00:00:28.140> combat<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:29.880> steady<00:00:30.179> 60-plus<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:32.099> this

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
during combat to steady 60-plus so this

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.420 
during combat to steady 60-plus so this
is<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> really<00:00:32.700> good<00:00:33.059> frame<00:00:33.780> rate<00:00:34.430> considering

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
is a really good frame rate considering

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.709 
is a really good frame rate considering
the<00:00:35.579> game<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.030> set<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.480> ultra<00:00:36.930> settings<00:00:37.219> and

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
the game is set on ultra settings and

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.119 
the game is set on ultra settings and
just<00:00:39.719> keep<00:00:39.870> an<00:00:39.989> eye<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> frame<00:00:40.559> rates<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
just keep an eye on the frame rates and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.610 
just keep an eye on the frame rates and
I'm<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> try<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> get<00:00:42.719> into<00:00:42.960> combat<00:00:43.350> here

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I'm going to try to get into combat here

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
can see 65 frame rates 50 goes up to

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.170 
can see 65 frame rates 50 goes up to
even<00:02:48.760> 70<00:02:49.180> plus<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:52.860> very<00:02:53.860> playable<00:02:54.310> it's<00:02:54.909> very

Battlefield 3 hopefully you got a good

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.540 
Battlefield 3 hopefully you got a good
idea<00:03:31.489> of<00:03:31.760> how<00:03:32.270> well<00:03:32.510> this<00:03:32.830> 13-inch<00:03:33.830> laptop<00:03:33.920> can

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
idea of how well this 13-inch laptop can

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.440 
idea of how well this 13-inch laptop can
run<00:03:34.730> it<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:36.230> all<00:03:37.160> right<00:03:37.310> let<00:03:37.790> me<00:03:37.819> show<00:03:38.060> you<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
run it and all right let me show you the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.090 
run it and all right let me show you the
video<00:03:38.870> settings<00:03:39.260> here<00:03:39.410> everything<00:03:39.890> is<00:03:39.980> on

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
video settings here everything is on

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.610 
video settings here everything is on
ultra<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:40.970> did<00:03:41.750> turn<00:03:42.020> off<00:03:42.880> anti-aliasing<00:03:43.880> and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
ultra I did turn off anti-aliasing and

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.040 
ultra I did turn off anti-aliasing and
vertical<00:03:45.620> sing<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:47.390> that<00:03:47.690> should<00:03:48.020> help

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
vertical sing so that should help

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.940 
vertical sing so that should help
maximize<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.040> frame<00:03:49.250> rates<00:03:49.519> and<00:03:50.769> that<00:03:51.769> should

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
maximize the frame rates and that should

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.790 
maximize the frame rates and that should
do<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.069> for<00:03:52.160> this<00:03:52.370> video<00:03:52.580> thanks<00:03:52.970> for<00:03:53.390> watching

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
do it for this video thanks for watching

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.690 
do it for this video thanks for watching
stick<00:03:54.800> around<00:03:54.920> for<00:03:55.130> more<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.910> see<00:03:56.540> ya
