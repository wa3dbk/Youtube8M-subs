00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello and welcome to this roulette 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.189
 the recipe of the day is the millefeuille 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.679
 for 6 people it takes 3 dough 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.530
 puff pastry for custard 4.1 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.599
 liters of milk 200 g of sugar 140 g of 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.000
 flour and a vanilla pod and for 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.140
 icing 500 g icing sugar and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.910
 coffee or chocolate extract 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 first step i liked fouras 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.080
 preheated to 180 ° then I take 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.300
 the three puff pastry and gillet puts 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.380
 one on the other to cut out 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.380
 rectangles of the same size 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.030
 and I now have them put to cook 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.510
 each on a plate one above 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.940
 others 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.520
 with a weight to prevent the dough from 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.260
 inflates tron ​​and jean supplies for about 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.580
 20 to 25 minutes of cooking 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.739
 a girl anyway because time 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.720
 cooking varies according to the ovens 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.170
 sometimes it can take up to 35 to 40 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.330
 minutes 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.129
 I am the vanilla to recover the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.690
 seeds that is inside 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.600
 I put the heat in the pan 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.670
 with vanilla pod and peels game 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.070
 but the whole eggs in a salad bowl 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.360
 with the sugar and I'm going to whip 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.360
 all by gradually adding 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.649
 flour 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.030
 when the milk comes to a boil I 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.240
 play it slowly all the time 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.220
 stir 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.259
 I pour the preparation into the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.670
 pan and then I'm going to cook 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.310
 over low heat without stirring until 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.600
 what cream and thickened the cream to 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.759
 well and b if i'm going to put her in a 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.280
 salad bowl it to put to cool 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.540
 I will contact filmo and then 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.180
 would put in the fridge 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.710
 when the portages are cooked I love it 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.149
 to cool because it is necessary that all 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.000
 elements are well cold before going up 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.040
 millefeuille I put a first paste 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.750
 on the bottom I generously release the 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.130
 pastry cream on it I cover 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.930
 another puff pastry I 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.760
 repeat the same operation with the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.100
 cream and I finish with the last 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.850
 dough and I really put the most 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.380
 the flatter on the top to achieve 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.750
 gaza I'll mix the icing sugar 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.720
 with a little bit of water this up 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:07.090
 getting a homogeneous glaze my 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.130
 icing is homogeneous I will take it 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.850
 a small part for the color with 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.850
 the coffee extract 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.270
 the idea of ​​making a very thin frosting 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.300
 sleuths the coffee icing in a 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.590
 piece of parchment paper to make 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:41.590
 like emile louis and I will trace it 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:43.620
 traits and now let's 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.360
 take in the refrigerator before serving 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.060
 the yarrow is finally ready this 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.260
 is not that complicated 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.850
 me besides if you want you can also 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.709
 make salty millefeuilles like the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:59.650
