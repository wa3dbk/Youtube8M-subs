00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.600
 hello greetings to all of us here we are 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.289
 new with a new video tutorial this 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.470
 time it's about how we can release the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.660
 internal memory or clean memory 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.030
 internal of our device 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.940
 blackberry many times we go to 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.850
 browsing we are going to save history of 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.789
 navigation let's go installing 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.800
 uninstalling applications and this affects 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.989
 very much to what is the memory of the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.410
 phone to the point that if you do not 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.260
 we do maintenance we do not clean it of 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.500
 all those waste that are appearing to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.170
 as we are doing all these 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.989
 tasks as the phone starts to give 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.329
 problems every time we execute 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.149
 some application takes a long time in 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.820
 open the application be it play or be 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.329
 any application to the same 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.309
 Internet browser costs a lot 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.869
 very much to open all this is because 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.079
 the internet memory of the phone 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.360
 Blackberry is fine and chasm then 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.550
 It is always better 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.000
 clean the memory in having the phone 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.690
 so you leave space and in memory 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.520
 internal and you also let what the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.640
 operating system of your blackberry and 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.700
 works with better fluency and with more 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.610
 quickly and the trick is very simple there 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.160
 several various ways to access it 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.650
 but the most easy thing is simply 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.630
 put where is the search engine we are going to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.600
 put the different options but the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.100
 easier to simply put in where 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.909
 is what is the search engine 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.670
 as you can see here 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.409
 simply to create the term memory 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.409
 let's put memory 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.840
 memory or I died in English what 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.890
 they want depends on what language they 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.140
 have on your blackberry device 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.380
 can accept in options and how can 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.990
 see here it comes out what to clean 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.490
 Internal memory memory cleanings 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.120
 here is also the storage 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.440
 although I'm working on a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.180
 virtual blackberry here does not appear 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.860
 because I do not have of course there is not this 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.620
 but here they can also clean in case 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.580
 that they have insert inserted what 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.910
 it's the card, the card, not the card 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.739
 sim but the external memory card 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.150
 which can also save your 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.070
 files either images that also 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.110
 can in case you do not have inserted 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.209
 from here you can also clean it but 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.360
 in this one lived trial what we are going to do 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.280
 to teach is the case of how we can 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.739
 clean the internal memory 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.500
 we just click and here you have to 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.959
 activate the option and activate it after 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.820
 clean when in the case that already 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.370
 you can already configure clean 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.890
 when active waiting time 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.930
 active now you can 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.730
 set it up every 30 minutes each 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.620
 hour depends on time every one minute 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.780
 It depends on how long you are 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.390
 considered that you have already talked 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:18.549
 have done various tasks on your mobile 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.870
 so you can do what starts you 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.120
 here there is also a very option 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.920
 important that here so that you do not 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.350
 you forget because not always one 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.900
 has to be on top of things for 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.000
 here for example so that you can 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.480
 see it can for example put a 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.860
 direct access of this what is the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.630
 internal memory cleaner 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.610
 phone can put a shortcut 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.050
 on the screen so that you every time 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.750
 that access what is the screen 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.600
 of your blackberry can see the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.390
 icon and you can click it to click 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.910
 over it and automatically what 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.430
 will clean all the options that are 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.930
 you have configured from this options 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.630
 as you can see here memory for 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.490
 clean here clean the cache all 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.650
 these options encrypted messages what 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.660
 clipboard as if it were a one 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.180
 kind of recycling bin all 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.400
 this is search everything we have done 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.100
 in what the internet browser all 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.140
 these options if we do not clean 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.930
 she also thinks about the problems already 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.690
 you know the error is that the phone is 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.240
 It becomes very heavy when it comes to adjusting 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.470
 the applications and all this then what 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.900
 more advisable is to always make a 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.140
 cleaning internal memory of your blog 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.460
 but once you have configured 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.760
 remember they have to save the changes 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.560
 If not, it will not be saved. 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.889
 activates memory cleanup when that 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.199
 Lock starts the phone 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.789
 we leave everything remember that also 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.979
 this is an option they just came 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.629
 those in the search engine and put memory 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.639
 but we can also support going to the 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.289
 menu all to access what is the 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.139
 cleaning the memory in having the 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.599
 phone is very easy you are simply going to 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.539
 often maximize then you go to the option 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.990
 where the tool icon says 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:07.779
 options and then you go where this 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.749
 security the security option and then 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:13.120
 you go down in the part where it says 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:15.129
 Advanced security settings and 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.199
 within this advanced security is going to 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:21.169
 go what memory cleanup and how 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:24.590
 can see the same result already appears 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.050
 what we have done the previous time 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.020
 write the memory and this appears 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.029
 screen where we can do the 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.569
 Configuration us to be clean 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:37.550
 all then the cache all the what 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.529
 is what we do from the browser all 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.680
 those options all the waste that is 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:46.289
 they are now at the time of navigating 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.050
 and installing them by installing applications 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.460
 do any task in our 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.039
 device this is the other method 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.650
 although I think that the first method of 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.530
 writing the memory is easier is a 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.750
 easier access instead of going to all 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.870
 these options instead of going to this 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.820
 method that we have taught you 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.160
 lately I hope you like this 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.350
 video tutorial on everything that is of 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.960
 utility do not forget subscribe give
