hardest<00:03:27.120> part<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.480> entire<00:03:27.810> nightfall<00:03:28.290> is

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
hardest part of this entire nightfall is

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.850 
hardest part of this entire nightfall is
either<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.220> waves<00:03:29.610> or<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:31.320> section<00:03:31.709> right

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
either the waves or the section right

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.410 
either the waves or the section right
before<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.340> Archon<00:03:32.610> priest<00:03:32.880> comes<00:03:33.120> out<00:03:33.269> where

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
before the Archon priest comes out where

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.790 
before the Archon priest comes out where
you<00:03:33.510> got<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.660> kill<00:03:33.870> everybody<00:03:34.140> dodge<00:03:34.590> the
