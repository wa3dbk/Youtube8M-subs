00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.190
 amine and amines and 2 w o of the team 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.720
 who broke it's good it's good it's 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.390
 it's brand new it 's new 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.070
 pdp faction action p2p wiki 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.710
 is available on the forum you have 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.450
 all necessary information low 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.920
 relate it must prefer action precisely 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.150
 so all of this happens in the 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.010
 description on the forum you know 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.360
 the procedure at that level so we're going 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.250
 make a pretty fast video so 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.419
 firstly you have to know that the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.640
 trailer so I first of all you talk about the 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.870
 trailer it was done finally that was it 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.820
 been made on purpose that it is enough 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.340
 fuzzy and that one that is quite ambiguous 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.600
 so no it will not be two factions the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.100
 against each other because we are 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.360
 against forcing players to 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.519
 play with players who do not have 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.570
 they do not know or who with 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.460
 who do not want to play necessarily 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.140
 so no it will not be that it will not be 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.299
 not a server that will last 48 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.769
 hours or two hours for depending on what 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:56.330
 I saw a little bit on the forums 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.650
 it will not be that at all, so if we have 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.879
 leave a little mystery 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.769
 around this trailer it was mostly 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.140
 also for to keep you surprised 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.299
 until the end and avoid spoil so 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.369
 pvp faction already firstly big 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.390
 roasted dedication that gets lost action there 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.320
 could never have come out since it's 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.119
 him who gave us the idea 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.800
 yet it was before our eyes but 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.790
 why did not anyone have the idea to 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.340
 share him so it's really the post 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.140
 daily that really makes the best 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.450
 so the action pdp on what he's going 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.850
 so rest the p2p faction is called the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.410
 pp faction the faction time out so time 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.970
 out why because it's precisely 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.710
 directly inspired from the film time out 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.460
 for those who know so for those 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.720
 who do not know I invite you 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.160
 really to pause on this video 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.260
 now right now and go 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.600
 hit google on youtube sorry 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.430
 trailer time out 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.570
 so the movie like that you finally have the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.370
 trailer that's enough we should you 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.780
 understand right away the concept and 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.190
 then to go read the topic is to 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.880
 finish this video for precisely 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.860
 understand then we have the hong anh 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.770
 so it's based on the time out so and 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.870
 time management namely knowing 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.490
 who will now have a time that each 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.300
 nobody will have a definite time that will 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.520
 have to manage 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.720
 in the beginning it will be all alone because for 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.280
 the moment we did not put all the 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.750
 features seen as I have you 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.370
 said it's a beta and we did not 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.690
 want one hand too much load you 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.149
 with everything finally all the news 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.920
 we added we want to add 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.090
 that to the count drops because ben as 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.260
 that you can you can 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.120
 get used to gently 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.319
 to features etc rather than all 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.760
 give you a shot and you're 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.049
 completely drowned lost with the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.560
 news talk about all these 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.700
 novelties then also on the one hand 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.739
 on the other hand for the bugs 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.060
 because down there are going to be bugs to 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.079
 correct necessarily and therefore every time 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.519
 we want to add a feature 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.510
 there will be its share of bugs etc 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:35.329
 so we go it's also a way of 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.120
 manage the bugs pretty well so that's it 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.319
 for the faction faction all the rest finally 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.209
