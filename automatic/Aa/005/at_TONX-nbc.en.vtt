the level that you have some way of

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.490 
the level that you have some way of
using<00:00:14.519> an<00:00:14.610> EMP<00:00:15.089> because<00:00:15.540> there's<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.320> really

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
using an EMP because there's this really

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.790 
using an EMP because there's this really
tricky<00:00:16.859> part<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.160> two<00:00:17.279> cameras<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.800> firstly

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
tricky part with two cameras and firstly

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.380 
tricky part with two cameras and firstly
knock<00:00:19.980> everyone<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.400> then<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.000> take<00:00:21.180> out<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
knock everyone out then you take out the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.320 
knock everyone out then you take out the
cameras<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.230> an<00:00:23.039> EMP<00:00:23.609> obviously<00:00:24.150> really

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
cameras and an EMP obviously really

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.109 
cameras and an EMP obviously really
helps<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:25.279> also<00:00:26.279> some<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.880> may<00:00:27.090> be

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
helps with that also some of you may be

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
thinking that this is a ballsy reckless

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.749
