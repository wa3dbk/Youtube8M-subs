00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 Clear 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.330
 that some toucan eggs mexico writes 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.869
 we are here bringing is another achievement more 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.660
 of mac you stop the mold release 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.060
 and good guys, the one we can be is the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.359
 acid drop that tells us that mod of 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.039
 ted let's convert a weapon with a good kit 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.650
 kids basically the only weapon that 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.140
 we can convert with the serial kit 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.660
 they talk about the cap so for us 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.390
 we can improve first that builds the 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.390
 kit the kit house consists of three pieces 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.320
 which it is the case of the case in the case 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.890
 English the other piece that is 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.580
 conformed is like a little motorcito 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.729
 a good basically tubes are tubes that 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.860
 they are connected to the briefcase 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.500
 and the last piece we need is the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.449
 acid kids and good kids to be able 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.299
 start the first piece normally what 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.090
 we will find at the beginning of each 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.460
 starting a fairly simple piece of 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.500
 find that is the chaves briefcase like 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.600
 can see the briefcase can have two 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.680
 locations with respect to what I've 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.530
 played I found him 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.270
 two locations to the briefcase the first is 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.380
 when we bought the initial door that 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.729
 they cost us a thousand points 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.100
 usually forgive yourself for repeating this 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.560
 part so that they realize well is in 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.909
 front there's a metal table in this 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.979
 we found a briefcase this is the 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.350
 briefcase is part of the kit when 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.630
 we grab in fact no kit comes out of asicom 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.119
 so this is the first piece 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.590
 that we are going to find out however if 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.780
 you are not lucky that you 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.819
 Find there, then, just look at 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.610
 this area is in the area of this letter of 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.229
 michigan in this area in the part of the 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.630
 staircase at the bottom can 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.659
 find also the briefcase thrown 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.549
 next to that bag that table agreed 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.599
 that small desk good guys 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.280
 now we are going to continue with the 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.039
 next piece the next piece 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.409
 Austin a more familiar location is in 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.959
 where are the traps in shape 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.360
 the propeller cutting strokes 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.090
 zombies is by the fireplace that is 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.670
 covered with woods something weird that in this 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.670
 stage of wood and you do not have wood 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.170
 but good guys and we will continue 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.370
 quickly with the last location the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.010
 last location is the one I'm going to put 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.900
 complete how to arrive so that you do not 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.760
 miss the coming out rope 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.270
 immediately from the fourth are the 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.990
 stretches 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.450
 let's get entangled is the vault something like that 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.530
 let's go to the cafeteria and at the door 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.150
 of the nursing report and we will go up 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.740
 we buy all doors 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.630
 buy chau we had bought them 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.760
 however, we are going to follow this path 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.110
 so that we find on this table the 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.870
 acid to complete the kit from 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.450
 Now, what's right is to build 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.400
 the kit the kit we can build it in 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.680
 any of the tables that 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.940
 find around map according the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.490
 They can build on that table 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.220
 find behind the electric chair fish and 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.640
 can build it in the dow that is in 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.070
 the port in the port basically or in 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.050
 this is the same cafeteria but 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.270
 I built it there because then there 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.690
 there was the box and it made me faster 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.580
 so start doing this and why do I say 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.950
 this from the kids box the reason is 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.830
 because the gap plan is only 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.510
 sustainable through the good box up 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.060
 Now we have seen that the only way 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.340
 to get it is through the box like this 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.930
 that it is a little luck a little 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.269
 get enough points 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.519
 the first one came out so it's already said 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.920
 that I even started jumping out of emotion 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.140
 another of the all enrique was 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.959
 excited but good guys now yes 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.579
 we go to what follows the achievement the only thing 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.680
 what we have to do is take the 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:56.859
 flag to the kit and put it by pressing x of 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.709
 agreement so is something simple does not have 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:02.950
 price is so it's free to do this 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.170
 agree because then we already the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.689
 we raffled so to speak, getting the 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.919
 kit and the only thing we have to do is 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.989
 grab the soft something that I already with 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.780
 nothing Varela sector and now 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.639
 we have the achievement acid drop kids like 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.470
 come is a very simple achievement of 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.229
 I hope I have served you 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.840
 This guide for you to know how to 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:25.180
 get is the gold that could be a 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.800
 bit confusing for some kids here 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.250
 I leave you this if you see until then 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.250
 bye
