00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
triple-a and I don't know about you but

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.000 
triple-a and I don't know about you but
I<00:00:48.710> end<00:00:49.070> up<00:00:49.219> with<00:00:49.399> a<00:00:49.750> bunch<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:51.489> alka<00:00:52.489> lines<00:00:52.699> that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
I end up with a bunch of alka lines that

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.500 
I end up with a bunch of alka lines that
just<00:00:55.010> about<00:00:55.219> to<00:00:55.370> throw<00:00:55.640> away<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.059> I<00:00:56.120> get<00:00:56.300> sick

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
just about to throw away and I get sick

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.060 
just about to throw away and I get sick
of<00:00:56.660> paying<00:00:56.840> for<00:00:57.170> them<00:00:57.289> so<00:00:57.500> I<00:00:57.530> figured<00:00:57.649> out<00:00:58.010> a

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
of paying for them so I figured out a

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.110 
of paying for them so I figured out a
way<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.370> recharge<00:00:59.210> them<00:00:59.500> and<00:01:00.500> get<00:01:00.879> no<00:01:01.879> no<00:01:01.940> no

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
way to recharge them and get no no no

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.540 
way to recharge them and get no no no
maybe<00:01:02.359> out<00:01:02.539> ten<00:01:02.840> more<00:01:03.109> life<00:01:03.649> cycles<00:01:04.220> out<00:01:04.370> of

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
maybe out ten more life cycles out of

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.110 
maybe out ten more life cycles out of
them<00:01:04.840> so<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:06.650> know<00:01:06.740> I<00:01:06.770> have<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:06.980> catch<00:01:07.610> bin<00:01:07.940> down

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
them so you know I have a catch bin down

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.640 
them so you know I have a catch bin down
in<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.360> basement<00:01:08.780> that<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.080> family<00:01:09.440> throws

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
in the basement that the family throws

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.360 
in the basement that the family throws
their<00:01:10.330> used<00:01:11.330> batteries<00:01:11.900> in<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.440> then<00:01:12.770> dad

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
their used batteries in and then dad

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.430 
their used batteries in and then dad
figures<00:01:13.820> out<00:01:14.030> how<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.630> bring<00:01:15.050> them<00:01:15.140> back<00:01:15.200> to

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
figures out how to bring them back to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.170 
figures out how to bring them back to
life<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.830> put<00:01:16.100> them<00:01:16.280> back<00:01:16.430> in<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:16.730> good<00:01:16.880> the

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
life and put them back in the good the

life and put them back in the good the
good<00:01:17.540> bucket<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.810> primary<00:01:21.229> thing<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.680> use<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:22.610> a

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
good bucket the primary thing I use is a

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.460 
good bucket the primary thing I use is a
for<00:01:24.110> most<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.710> my<00:01:24.740> recharging<00:01:25.670> is<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:26.470> device

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
for most of my recharging is a device

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.819 
for most of my recharging is a device
called<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.860> battery<00:01:28.189> extender<00:01:29.079> it's<00:01:30.079> it<00:01:30.649> can

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
called the battery extender it's it can

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.910 
called the battery extender it's it can
do<00:01:31.040> most<00:01:31.280> rechargeable<00:01:32.119> batteries<00:01:32.600> but<00:01:33.079> it's

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
do most rechargeable batteries but it's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.940 
do most rechargeable batteries but it's
really<00:01:34.130> not<00:01:34.310> set<00:01:34.610> up<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.850> do<00:01:35.950> alkaline

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
really not set up to do alkaline

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.550 
really not set up to do alkaline
batteries<00:01:37.490> now<00:01:38.210> if<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:38.420> look<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.899> actually

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
batteries now if you look I actually

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.740 
batteries now if you look I actually
measured<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:42.520> current<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.240> charger

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
measured the current that the charger

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.520 
measured the current that the charger
uses<00:01:45.579> or<00:01:46.579> double-a<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.090> triple-a<00:01:47.689> batteries

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
uses or double-a and triple-a batteries

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.039 
uses or double-a and triple-a batteries
that<00:01:48.680> uses<00:01:50.020> four<00:01:51.020> double-a<00:01:51.380> 50<00:01:51.829> milliamps<00:01:52.159> and

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
that uses four double-a 50 milliamps and

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.300 
that uses four double-a 50 milliamps and
four<00:01:54.049> triple-a<00:01:54.740> 17<00:01:55.369> milliamps<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.210> charge<00:01:56.570> and

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
four triple-a 17 milliamps of charge and

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.929 
four triple-a 17 milliamps of charge and
then<00:01:58.310> when<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.299> put<00:01:59.509> it<00:01:59.630> in<00:01:59.780> there<00:02:00.340> it'll<00:02:01.340> turn

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
then when you put it in there it'll turn

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.279 
then when you put it in there it'll turn
red<00:02:02.299> if<00:02:03.219> you<00:02:04.219> have<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:05.140> battery<00:02:06.140> and

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
red if you have the battery and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.230 
red if you have the battery and
backwards<00:02:06.710> yellow<00:02:07.340> means<00:02:07.549> it's<00:02:07.759> on<00:02:07.880> normal

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
backwards yellow means it's on normal

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.990 
backwards yellow means it's on normal
charge<00:02:08.570> and<00:02:08.930> green<00:02:09.920> means<00:02:10.250> it's<00:02:10.520> fully

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
charge and green means it's fully

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.600

them come with this charger it's

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.830 
them come with this charger it's
actually<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> pretty<00:03:00.770> nice<00:03:00.950> charger<00:03:01.660> one<00:03:02.660> nice

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
actually a pretty nice charger one nice

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.080 
actually a pretty nice charger one nice
thing<00:03:03.050> about<00:03:03.080> it<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.920> just<00:03:04.250> gives<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:04.730> straight

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
thing about it it just gives a straight

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.920 
thing about it it just gives a straight
current<00:03:06.370> through<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.400> with<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.330> on<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.540> time

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
current through it with it on a time

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
current through it with it on a time
cycle<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.160> will<00:03:13.750> basically<00:03:14.750> put<00:03:15.200> charge

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
cycle so it will basically put charge

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.980 
cycle so it will basically put charge
into<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.310> longer<00:03:16.610> time<00:03:16.970> now<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:18.190> standard

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
into a longer time now a standard

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.530 
into a longer time now a standard
alkaline<00:03:20.990> battery<00:03:21.550> they<00:03:22.550> really<00:03:22.910> designed<00:03:23.360> it

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
alkaline battery they really designed it

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.950 
alkaline battery they really designed it
so<00:03:23.750> it's<00:03:23.900> not<00:03:24.050> rechargeable<00:03:25.270> but<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.780> only

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
so it's not rechargeable but the only

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.360 
so it's not rechargeable but the only
reason<00:03:27.230> that's<00:03:27.380> stopping<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:27.980> from<00:03:28.010> being

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
reason that's stopping it from being

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.580 
reason that's stopping it from being
recharged<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:29.920> when<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.150> run<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.209> voltage<00:03:32.840> back

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
recharged is when you run a voltage back

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.820 
recharged is when you run a voltage back
through<00:03:33.860> it<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.970> put<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.270> charge<00:03:35.540> back<00:03:35.840> in<00:03:36.110> the

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
through it to put the charge back in the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.720 
through it to put the charge back in the
seal<00:03:37.280> on<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.870> two<00:03:39.260> ends<00:03:39.500> it's<00:03:40.220> just<00:03:40.490> not

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
seal on the two ends it's just not

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.110 
seal on the two ends it's just not
designed<00:03:40.970> very<00:03:41.540> strong<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.260> they<00:03:43.160> will<00:03:43.370> leak

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
designed very strong and they will leak

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.180 
designed very strong and they will leak
out<00:03:44.330> very<00:03:45.320> quickly<00:03:45.850> when<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:47.060> internal

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
out very quickly when the internal

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.250 
out very quickly when the internal
material<00:03:49.190> heats<00:03:49.820> up<00:03:50.320> so<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:52.340> trick<00:03:52.610> is<00:03:52.640> to

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
material heats up so the trick is to

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.170 
material heats up so the trick is to
don't<00:03:54.260> let<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.560> heat<00:03:54.709> up<00:03:54.740> and<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.850> way<00:03:56.000> I've

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
don't let it heat up and the way I've

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.979 
don't let it heat up and the way I've
done<00:03:56.209> it<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:57.010> I'll<00:03:58.010> use<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.550> regular<00:03:58.790> my<00:03:59.570> regular

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
done it is I'll use a regular my regular

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.020 
done it is I'll use a regular my regular
charger<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:01.100> I'll<00:04:01.880> put<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.239> on<00:04:02.360> a<00:04:02.560> timer<00:04:04.030> so

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
charger and I'll put it on a timer so

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.890 
charger and I'll put it on a timer so
one<00:04:05.360> of<00:04:05.390> these<00:04:07.180> timers<00:04:08.180> that<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.480> can<00:04:08.660> put<00:04:08.810> the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
one of these timers that you can put the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.570 
one of these timers that you can put the
tabs<00:04:09.170> in<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:10.270> I<00:04:11.270> just<00:04:11.420> have<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:11.989> set<00:04:12.200> up<00:04:12.350> for

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
tabs in and I just have it set up for

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:21.039 
tabs in and I just have it set up for
about<00:04:13.580> an<00:04:13.940> hour<00:04:14.180> per<00:04:14.690> day<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:19.330> will<00:04:20.330> give

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
about an hour per day and that will give

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.350 
about an hour per day and that will give
it<00:04:21.080> a<00:04:21.260> few<00:04:21.410> days<00:04:21.470> it<00:04:21.950> will<00:04:21.980> recharge<00:04:22.700> them<00:04:23.030> you

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
it a few days it will recharge them you

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.800 
it a few days it will recharge them you
could<00:04:23.630> buy<00:04:23.930> another<00:04:23.960> one<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.830> these<00:04:25.810> wall

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
could buy another one of these wall

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.040 
could buy another one of these wall
chargers<00:04:27.380> or<00:04:27.620> wall<00:04:28.460> timers<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.419> put<00:04:29.660> maybe

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
chargers or wall timers and put maybe

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.310 
chargers or wall timers and put maybe
have<00:04:30.320> a<00:04:30.350> charge<00:04:31.060> one<00:04:32.060> hour<00:04:32.270> every<00:04:32.780> out<00:04:33.110> of

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
have a charge one hour every out of

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.440 
have a charge one hour every out of
every<00:04:33.590> six<00:04:33.860> hours<00:04:34.040> so<00:04:34.880> you'll<00:04:35.090> be<00:04:35.210> able<00:04:35.300> to

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
every six hours so you'll be able to

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.200 
every six hours so you'll be able to
recharge<00:04:35.900> your<00:04:36.310> your<00:04:37.310> alkaline<00:04:37.880> is<00:04:38.000> a<00:04:38.060> little

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
recharge your your alkaline is a little

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.719 
recharge your your alkaline is a little
bit<00:04:38.330> quicker

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
bit quicker

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.209 
bit quicker
but<00:04:40.599> the<00:04:40.779> basic<00:04:41.110> idea<00:04:41.229> is<00:04:41.529> you<00:04:41.559> know<00:04:41.830> what<00:04:42.009> one

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
but the basic idea is you know what one

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.429 
but the basic idea is you know what one
hour<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.729> doesn't<00:04:43.180> allow<00:04:43.419> it<00:04:43.449> to<00:04:43.689> heat<00:04:44.080> up<00:04:44.110> so

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:44.439 
hour it doesn't allow it to heat up so

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.459 
hour it doesn't allow it to heat up so
much<00:04:44.620> that<00:04:44.860> it's<00:04:45.009> going<00:04:45.189> to<00:04:45.249> vent<00:04:45.550> its

00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:46.469 
much that it's going to vent its

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:49.739 
much that it's going to vent its
chemicals<00:04:47.469> and<00:04:47.740> then<00:04:48.370> if<00:04:48.669> you<00:04:48.819> give<00:04:48.999> it<00:04:49.150> in

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:49.749 
chemicals and then if you give it in

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:53.010 
chemicals and then if you give it in
that<00:04:49.930> case<00:04:50.229> about<00:04:50.499> six<00:04:50.770> hours<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:51.509> cool<00:04:52.509> off<00:04:52.719> or

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
that case about six hours to cool off or

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.659 
that case about six hours to cool off or
five<00:04:53.199> hours<00:04:53.559> to<00:04:53.680> cool<00:04:53.889> off<00:04:54.099> and<00:04:54.339> then<00:04:54.400> do<00:04:54.639> it

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
five hours to cool off and then do it

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.119 
five hours to cool off and then do it
again<00:04:54.819> you'll<00:04:55.330> probably<00:04:55.360> be<00:04:55.719> able<00:04:55.779> to<00:04:56.129> get

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
again you'll probably be able to get

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:58.529 
again you'll probably be able to get
through<00:04:57.309> the<00:04:57.430> charge<00:04:57.669> cycle<00:04:58.059> quicker<00:04:58.240> but<00:04:58.509> I

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
through the charge cycle quicker but I

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:00.390 
through the charge cycle quicker but I
leave<00:04:58.809> this<00:04:58.930> plugged<00:04:59.229> in<00:04:59.439> and<00:04:59.680> I<00:04:59.919> just<00:04:59.949> pop

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
leave this plugged in and I just pop

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.450 
leave this plugged in and I just pop
into<00:05:00.849> any<00:05:01.569> of<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.020> elk<00:05:02.710> alliance<00:05:03.129> that<00:05:03.189> show

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
into any of the elk alliance that show

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.670 
into any of the elk alliance that show
up<00:05:03.639> in<00:05:03.789> my<00:05:05.759> my<00:05:06.759> box<00:05:07.029> here<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.539> then<00:05:08.139> put<00:05:08.589> it

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
up in my my box here and then put it

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.439 
up in my my box here and then put it
back<00:05:08.710> in<00:05:09.009> the<00:05:09.099> good<00:05:09.279> bin<00:05:09.460> one<00:05:09.669> when<00:05:10.089> I'm<00:05:10.240> done

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
back in the good bin one when I'm done

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.219 
back in the good bin one when I'm done
and<00:05:10.889> so<00:05:11.889> far<00:05:12.249> the<00:05:13.210> system<00:05:13.599> has<00:05:13.779> worked<00:05:13.809> out

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
and so far the system has worked out

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.119 
and so far the system has worked out
well<00:05:14.409> and<00:05:14.439> we<00:05:14.710> haven't<00:05:15.009> had<00:05:15.129> to<00:05:15.279> buy<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.520> new

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
well and we haven't had to buy a new

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:21.540 
well and we haven't had to buy a new
alkaline<00:05:18.129> batteries<00:05:18.490> for<00:05:18.699> a<00:05:18.729> while<00:05:20.309> hope<00:05:21.309> that

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
alkaline batteries for a while hope that

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.849 
alkaline batteries for a while hope that
helps
