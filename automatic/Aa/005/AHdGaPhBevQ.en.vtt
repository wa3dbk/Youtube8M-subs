00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
something like that within an

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.979 
something like that within an
application<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.450> multiple

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
windows open so the way that you do that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.400 
windows open so the way that you do that
