epiphytes<00:01:45.850> or<00:01:46.800> airplanes<00:01:47.880> they<00:01:48.880> just<00:01:49.540> need

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
epiphytes or airplanes they just need

epiphytes or airplanes they just need
more<00:01:50.860> sunlight<00:01:51.250> then<00:01:51.760> all<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.540> plants<00:01:52.990> need

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
and they do not have any way to grow as

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.670 
and they do not have any way to grow as
big<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:57.670> they<00:01:58.030> are<00:01:58.770> brought<00:01:59.770> by<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.100> bird<00:02:00.490> and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
way they feed it is not parasite in the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.190 
way they feed it is not parasite in the
tree<00:02:21.310> itself<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:21.940> feeding<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.870> little
