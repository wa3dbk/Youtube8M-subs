00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730 

now<00:00:00.120> the<00:00:00.210> problem<00:00:00.480> that's<00:00:00.930> going<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.319> occur<00:00:01.410> is

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
now the problem that's going to occur is

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.309 
now the problem that's going to occur is
this<00:00:02.010> right<00:00:02.790> now<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.330> no<00:00:03.959> way<00:00:04.170> of

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
this right now is no way of

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.280 
this right now is no way of
distinguishing<00:00:04.740> me<00:00:05.430> from<00:00:06.330> anything<00:00:06.600> else<00:00:06.870> on

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
distinguishing me from anything else on

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.820 
distinguishing me from anything else on
the<00:00:07.410> scene<00:00:08.210> all<00:00:09.210> right<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.900> means<00:00:10.200> if<00:00:10.620> i

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
the scene all right and that means if i

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.440 
the scene all right and that means if i
want<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.250> put<00:00:11.400> another<00:00:11.639> cube<00:00:12.090> here<00:00:13.670> and<00:00:14.670> put<00:00:15.360> it

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
want to put another cube here and put it

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.769 
want to put another cube here and put it
let's<00:00:16.199> see<00:00:16.410> right<00:00:16.800> about<00:00:17.070> here<00:00:17.880> let's<00:00:18.150> say<00:00:18.510> I

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
let's see right about here let's say I

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.800 
let's see right about here let's say I
think<00:00:19.650> that's<00:00:19.859> about<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:23.240> and<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.330> make<00:00:24.570> that

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
think that's about right and I make that

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
think that's about right and I make that
into<00:00:25.880> physics<00:00:26.880> rigid<00:00:27.480> body<00:00:28.160> if<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.310> hit<00:00:29.490> play

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
into physics rigid body if I hit play

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:41.550 
into physics rigid body if I hit play
play<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.040> oh<00:00:32.360> let's<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:33.960> bit

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.620 

a<00:00:41.590> little<00:00:42.100> bit<00:00:42.190> closer<00:00:42.460> right<00:00:42.760> there<00:00:43.030> let's

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
a little bit closer right there let's

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:56.740 
a little bit closer right there let's
try<00:00:43.780> that

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.970 

can<00:00:57.680> I<00:00:57.710> get<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.070> right<00:00:58.310> in<00:00:58.460> front<00:00:59.680> there<00:01:00.680> we<00:01:00.830> go

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
can I get it right in front there we go

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.229 
can I get it right in front there we go
now<00:01:01.940> even<00:01:02.570> though<00:01:02.780> I<00:01:03.080> am<00:01:03.830> standing<00:01:04.580> order<00:01:04.940> here

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
now even though I am standing order here

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.070 
now even though I am standing order here
and<00:01:05.390> i<00:01:06.320> am<00:01:06.350> forward<00:01:07.030> it's<00:01:08.030> drawing<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.540> line<00:01:08.750> to

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
and i am forward it's drawing a line to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.860 
and i am forward it's drawing a line to
me<00:01:09.229> even<00:01:09.590> though<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:10.700> box<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.330> on<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.720> left

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
me even though the box is on the left

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.370 
me even though the box is on the left
hand<00:01:12.050> side<00:01:12.200> or<00:01:13.210> right<00:01:14.210> hand<00:01:14.450> side<00:01:14.630> yep<00:01:15.050> right

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
hand side or right hand side yep right

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.400 
hand side or right hand side yep right
hand<00:01:15.590> side<00:01:15.800> so<00:01:16.400> it's<00:01:16.610> detecting<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.390> box<00:01:17.630> not

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
hand side so it's detecting the box not

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.800 
hand side so it's detecting the box not
me<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:18.920> in<00:01:19.400> fact<00:01:19.610> I<00:01:19.970> could<00:01:20.270> run<00:01:20.540> all<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.780> way

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
me and in fact I could run all the way

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.219 
me and in fact I could run all the way
around<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.700> it<00:01:22.700> detects<00:01:23.090> me<00:01:23.300> over<00:01:24.050> on<00:01:24.140> the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
around and it detects me over on the

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.660 
around and it detects me over on the
left<00:01:24.440> hand<00:01:24.619> side<00:01:24.710> but<00:01:25.070> only<00:01:25.280> for<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.520> brief

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
left hand side but only for a brief

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.780 
left hand side but only for a brief
second<00:01:26.180> because<00:01:26.450> its<00:01:26.990> focus<00:01:27.650> goes<00:01:28.280> right<00:01:28.580> back

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
second because its focus goes right back

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.630 
second because its focus goes right back
on<00:01:29.030> this<00:01:29.240> box<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.750> stationary<00:01:30.350> in<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.399> this

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
on this box a stationary in it so this

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.630 
on this box a stationary in it so this
is<00:01:31.820> where<00:01:32.119> we<00:01:32.570> turn<00:01:33.020> on<00:01:33.580> masking<00:01:34.720> okay<00:01:35.720> and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
is where we turn on masking okay and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.490 
is where we turn on masking okay and
masking<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:37.850> very<00:01:38.420> very<00:01:38.690> cool<00:01:39.020> feature<00:01:39.080> that

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
masking is a very very cool feature that

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.990 
masking is a very very cool feature that
I<00:01:39.710> could<00:01:39.979> just<00:01:40.160> kind<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.430> been<00:01:40.580> poking<00:01:40.940> around

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
I could just kind of been poking around

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.410 
I could just kind of been poking around
with<00:01:41.360> lately<00:01:42.160> so<00:01:43.160> if<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.910> go<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.300> here<00:01:46.420> to

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
with lately so if you go in here to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.710 
with lately so if you go in here to
start<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.869> mask<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.770> very<00:01:48.920> simple<00:01:49.340> we<00:01:50.300> have<00:01:50.570> to

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
start a mask it's very simple we have to

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.850 
start a mask it's very simple we have to
declare<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.740> veritable<00:01:52.149> inside<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.330> function

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
declare a veritable inside the function

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.680 
declare a veritable inside the function
it's<00:01:56.259> what<00:01:57.259> it's<00:01:57.380> called<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.690> doesn't

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
it's what it's called is on doesn't

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.950 
it's what it's called is on doesn't
matter<00:01:59.840> I<00:02:00.080> can<00:02:00.320> only<00:02:00.440> call<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.890> layer<00:02:01.100> mask<00:02:01.430> and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
matter I can only call it layer mask and

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.729 
matter I can only call it layer mask and
is<00:02:02.960> equal<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.890> one<00:02:05.619> less<00:02:06.619> than<00:02:06.979> eight<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.739> then

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
is equal to one less than eight and then

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:21.820 
is equal to one less than eight and then
absolutely<00:02:09.979> less<00:02:10.880> than<00:02:16.030> K<00:02:18.790> now<00:02:20.560> what<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.590> could

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
absolutely less than K now what I could

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.410 
absolutely less than K now what I could
do<00:02:21.980> here<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.519> now<00:02:23.090> put<00:02:23.570> this<00:02:24.549> layer<00:02:25.549> mask<00:02:25.910> into

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
do here is now put this layer mask into

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:39.350 
do here is now put this layer mask into
effect<00:02:27.310> right<00:02:28.310> here<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:33.140> right<00:02:33.170> here

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.400 

and<00:02:39.450> how's<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.410> work<00:02:40.760> well<00:02:41.760> anytime<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.960> need

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
and how's this work well anytime I need

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.740 
and how's this work well anytime I need
something<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.460> interact<00:02:45.030> with<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.510> player

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
something to interact with the player

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.820 
something to interact with the player
but<00:02:46.590> not<00:02:46.950> all<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:48.240> scene<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:49.080> this<00:02:49.320> smart

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
but not all the scene like this smart

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.030 
but not all the scene like this smart
cube<00:02:50.190> for<00:02:50.550> example<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.930> smart<00:02:52.200> cube<00:02:52.560> is

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
cube for example so the smart cube is

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.490 
cube for example so the smart cube is
seeing<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.670> object<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.600> object<00:02:54.660> becomes

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
seeing this object this object becomes

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.280 
seeing this object this object becomes
obsolete<00:02:55.770> I<00:02:56.400> need<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.210> go<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.510> here<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.750> make<00:02:58.080> a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
obsolete I need to go in here and make a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.940 
obsolete I need to go in here and make a
new<00:02:58.770> layer<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.550> the<00:03:00.540> layer<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.960> on<00:03:01.170> eight<00:03:01.350> so

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
new layer and the layer is on eight so

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.470 
new layer and the layer is on eight so
there's<00:03:02.160> where<00:03:02.370> your<00:03:02.550> eight<00:03:02.730> comes<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:05.480> and

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
there's where your eight comes in and

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.960 
there's where your eight comes in and
this<00:03:06.690> one's<00:03:06.959> going<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.380> called<00:03:07.830> how<00:03:08.820> about

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
this one's going to be called how about

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
call this it's on the eighth layer but

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.100 
call this it's on the eighth layer but
what<00:03:16.709> happens<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.400> here's<00:03:17.970> my<00:03:18.150> smart<00:03:18.510> cube<00:03:18.870> I

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
what happens is here's my smart cube I

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.690 
what happens is here's my smart cube I
need<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:22.620> need<00:03:22.800> my<00:03:22.980> first<00:03:23.250> person

need it and I need my first person
controller<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.390> be<00:03:24.959> on<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.350> layer<00:03:25.880> now

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
controller to be on that layer now

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.880 
controller to be on that layer now
anything<00:03:27.209> that's<00:03:27.570> not<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.989> layer<00:03:28.290> will

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
anything that's not on the layer will

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.600 
anything that's not on the layer will
not<00:03:29.250> interact<00:03:29.610> with<00:03:29.970> each<00:03:30.000> other<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:31.459> there<00:03:32.459> we

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
not interact with each other so there we

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.740 
not interact with each other so there we
go<00:03:32.640> oops<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.640> asking<00:03:39.060> me<00:03:39.180> do<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.420> want<00:03:39.690> to

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
go oops this is asking me do I want to

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.650 
go oops this is asking me do I want to
add<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.050> children<00:03:40.530> yes<00:03:41.040> change<00:03:41.430> children<00:03:42.000> so

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
add the children yes change children so

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.330 
add the children yes change children so
all<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.930> children<00:03:43.320> are<00:03:43.530> part<00:03:43.799> of<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.100> layer

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
all the children are part of that layer

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.670 
all the children are part of that layer
2<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:45.209> now<00:03:45.360> i<00:03:45.390> have<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.630> smart<00:03:46.019> cube<00:03:46.290> unlit

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
2 so now i have a smart cube unlit

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.280 
2 so now i have a smart cube unlit
player<00:03:47.010> i<00:03:47.280> have<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.970> on<00:03:48.180> player<00:03:48.450> but<00:03:49.080> this

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
player i have this on player but this

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.620 
player i have this on player but this
one<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.709> on<00:03:49.950> default<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:50.970> if<00:03:51.150> I<00:03:51.269> hit<00:03:51.420> play

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
one is on default so if I hit play

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.320 
one is on default so if I hit play
what's<00:03:52.440> going<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.650> happen<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.190> my<00:03:53.519> test<00:03:53.850> stays

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
what's going to happen is my test stays

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.180 
what's going to happen is my test stays
true<00:03:54.690> i<00:03:54.900> have<00:03:55.650> this<00:03:56.130> cube<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:57.450> does<00:03:58.019> not<00:03:58.190> see

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
true i have this cube that does not see

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.180 
true i have this cube that does not see
me<00:03:59.370> yet<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.750> when<00:04:00.930> i<00:04:00.959> get<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.560> left<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.070> it

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
me yet and when i get to the left of it

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:12.680 
me yet and when i get to the left of it
yes<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.850> does<00:04:03.000> see<00:04:03.209> me<00:04:03.390> or<00:04:03.630> right<00:04:10.489> perfect<00:04:11.690> so

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
yes it does see me or right perfect so

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.729 
yes it does see me or right perfect so
that<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:14.060> very<00:04:15.060> important<00:04:15.630> because<00:04:15.810> if<00:04:16.200> i<00:04:16.470> put

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
that is very important because if i put

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.640 
that is very important because if i put
a<00:04:16.769> door<00:04:17.280> on<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.729> building<00:04:18.299> the<00:04:19.049> building<00:04:19.470> has

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
a door on a building the building has

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.920 
a door on a building the building has
some<00:04:19.859> substance<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.850> if<00:04:21.060> i<00:04:21.150> had<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.330> substance

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
some substance so if i had the substance

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.659 
some substance so if i had the substance
there<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.440> know<00:04:22.560> like<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.919> other<00:04:23.070> walls<00:04:23.430> of

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
there you know like the other walls of

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.120 
there you know like the other walls of
the<00:04:23.760> building<00:04:23.880> mind<00:04:24.540> you<00:04:24.690> now<00:04:25.530> it's<00:04:25.770> not<00:04:25.919> going

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
the building mind you now it's not going

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.980 
the building mind you now it's not going
to<00:04:26.310> detect<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.850> other<00:04:27.030> walls<00:04:27.360> it's<00:04:27.660> only

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
to detect the other walls it's only

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.860 
to detect the other walls it's only
again<00:04:28.350> detect<00:04:28.860> me<00:04:29.100> as<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.520> player<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:30.690> now

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
again detect me as the player so now

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.890 
again detect me as the player so now
that<00:04:30.900> we<00:04:31.169> have<00:04:31.200> this<00:04:31.530> very<00:04:31.860> complex<00:04:32.550> code<00:04:33.000> set

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
that we have this very complex code set

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.620 
that we have this very complex code set
up<00:04:34.080> which<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.590> not<00:04:34.740> complex<00:04:35.130> at<00:04:35.340> all<00:04:35.490> but<00:04:35.790> now

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
up which is not complex at all but now

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.440 
up which is not complex at all but now
that<00:04:36.840> we<00:04:36.960> have<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.229> set<00:04:37.470> up<00:04:37.669> let's<00:04:38.669> use<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.270> in

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
that we have it set up let's use it in

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.590 
that we have it set up let's use it in
the<00:04:39.630> next<00:04:39.900> example<00:04:40.490> now<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:41.729> next<00:04:42.030> example

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
the next example now this next example

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.550 
the next example now this next example
is<00:04:42.960> going<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.560> take<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.919> very<00:04:44.880> very<00:04:45.500> long<00:04:46.500> time

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
is going to take a very very long time

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.740 
is going to take a very very long time
to<00:04:46.979> kind<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.250> put<00:04:47.460> in<00:04:47.640> together<00:04:47.760> because<00:04:48.450> we

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
to kind of put in together because we

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.240 
to kind of put in together because we
still<00:04:48.990> have<00:04:49.140> to<00:04:49.260> make<00:04:49.440> something<00:04:49.770> we<00:04:50.039> have<00:04:50.130> to

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
still have to make something we have to

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.150 
still have to make something we have to
make<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.430> cell<00:04:51.169> we<00:04:52.169> have<00:04:52.289> to<00:04:52.380> make<00:04:52.500> a<00:04:52.560> door

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
make a cell we have to make a door

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.120 
make a cell we have to make a door
and<00:04:53.460> then<00:04:54.090> bring<00:04:54.420> it<00:04:54.540> into<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:55.020> scene<00:04:55.290> so

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
and then bring it into the scene so

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.450 
and then bring it into the scene so
right<00:04:56.460> here<00:04:57.230> I'm<00:04:58.230> going<00:04:58.470> to<00:04:58.590> say<00:04:58.950> this<00:04:58.980> is

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
right here I'm going to say this is

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.340 
right here I'm going to say this is
probably<00:04:59.640> going<00:05:00.000> to<00:05:00.180> be<00:05:00.300> enough<00:05:00.630> for<00:05:00.930> somebody

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
probably going to be enough for somebody

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.820 
probably going to be enough for somebody
to<00:05:01.410> type<00:05:01.740> in<00:05:01.950> a<00:05:02.040> small<00:05:02.310> class<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:03.690> gotta<00:05:04.440> rely<00:05:04.800> on

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
to type in a small class I gotta rely on

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.370 
to type in a small class I gotta rely on
some<00:05:05.250> students<00:05:06.000> can't<00:05:06.480> type<00:05:06.720> as<00:05:06.900> fast<00:05:06.930> as

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
some students can't type as fast as

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.650 
some students can't type as fast as
other<00:05:07.650> students<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:08.670> I<00:05:09.000> definitely<00:05:09.390> want

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
other students and I definitely want

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.240 
other students and I definitely want
them<00:05:09.780> to<00:05:09.870> get<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.140> concept<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.860> this<00:05:12.140> so<00:05:13.250> this

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
them to get the concept of this so this

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.760 
them to get the concept of this so this
is<00:05:14.640> going<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.180> be<00:05:15.330> Carl<00:05:15.600> project<00:05:16.080> for<00:05:16.320> and<00:05:16.650> it's

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
is going to be Carl project for and it's

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.560 
is going to be Carl project for and it's
going<00:05:16.920> to<00:05:17.010> be<00:05:17.100> called<00:05:17.250> ray<00:05:17.490> casting<00:05:18.000> example

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
going to be called ray casting example

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.000 
going to be called ray casting example
and<00:05:20.450> now<00:05:21.450> after<00:05:21.690> this<00:05:22.080> we're<00:05:22.740> going<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.920> have

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
and now after this we're going to have
