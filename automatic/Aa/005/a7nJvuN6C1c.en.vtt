00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.649 
they get hit with the ball and again you
can<00:02:02.399> shoot<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.790> ball<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.420> see<00:02:03.570> you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
can shoot the ball and you can see you

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.090 
can shoot the ball and you can see you
get<00:02:03.780> points<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.439> they<00:02:04.560> will<00:02:04.740> disintegrate

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
get points and they will disintegrate

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.700 
get points and they will disintegrate
the<00:02:05.909> jellyfish<00:02:06.450> also<00:02:06.960> take<00:02:07.229> out<00:02:07.439> other

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the jellyfish also take out other

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.550 
the jellyfish also take out other
jellyfish<00:02:08.550> which<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.060> quite<00:02:09.840> important

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
jellyfish which is quite important

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.800 
jellyfish which is quite important
because<00:02:10.709> that's<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.580> be<00:02:11.790> how<00:02:12.000> well<00:02:12.660> it's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
because that's going to be how well it's

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.770 
because that's going to be how well it's
going<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.959> be<00:02:13.020> kind<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
going to be kind of the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.440 
going to be kind of the
your<00:02:14.080> success<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:15.280> barrel<00:02:15.760> will<00:02:15.910> help<00:02:16.150> take

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
your success the barrel will help take

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.670 
your success the barrel will help take
them<00:02:16.600> out<00:02:16.750> as<00:02:16.930> well<00:02:18.810> when<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:19.900> missed<00:02:20.200> there<00:02:20.440> so

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
them out as well when we missed there so

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.220 
them out as well when we missed there so
we've<00:02:20.830> only<00:02:21.010> got<00:02:21.280> two<00:02:21.550> shots<00:02:21.910> left<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.660> what

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
we've only got two shots left and what

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.530 
we've only got two shots left and what
happens<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.800> if<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.160> don't<00:02:24.610> take<00:02:25.000> out<00:02:25.240> the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
happens is if you don't take out the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.380 
happens is if you don't take out the
jellyfish<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.830> was<00:02:27.069> a<00:02:27.100> bunk<00:02:27.459> shot<00:02:27.819> totally

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
jellyfish that was a bunk shot totally

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.780 
jellyfish that was a bunk shot totally
missed<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.720> all<00:02:28.840> together<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.530> let's<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.400> go

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
missed it all together so let's just go

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.910 
missed it all together so let's just go
with<00:02:30.819> this<00:02:31.120> one<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.720> then<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.319> hope<00:02:32.590> for<00:02:32.830> the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
with this one and then this hope for the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.180 
with this one and then this hope for the
best

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.800 

let's<00:02:36.190> hope<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.640> jellyfish<00:02:37.239> there<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.660> gonna

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
let's hope that jellyfish there is gonna

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.220 
let's hope that jellyfish there is gonna
make<00:02:38.110> it<00:02:38.380> is<00:02:38.560> he<00:02:38.770> oh<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.910> so<00:02:40.090> close<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:41.080> now

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
make it is he oh it's so close so now

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.930 
make it is he oh it's so close so now
when<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.530> don't<00:02:41.739> take<00:02:42.010> out<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.370> jellyfish

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
when you don't take out the jellyfish

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.720 
when you don't take out the jellyfish
Sponge<00:02:43.750> Bob<00:02:43.870> gets<00:02:44.380> all<00:02:44.620> stung<00:02:45.040> up<00:02:45.250> but<00:02:45.459> we<00:02:45.550> can

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
Sponge Bob gets all stung up but we can

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.360 
Sponge Bob gets all stung up but we can
replay<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:47.140> when<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.380> replay<00:02:47.739> this<00:02:48.070> one

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
replay that and when you replay this one

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.850 
replay that and when you replay this one
tap<00:02:49.209> on<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.600> right<00:02:49.810> up<00:02:49.989> there<00:02:50.260> go<00:02:50.650> get<00:02:50.800> a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
tap on the right up there go get a

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.030 
tap on the right up there go get a
powerup<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.550> have<00:02:51.670> 38<00:02:52.269> coins<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.890> know

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
powerup we have 38 coins so you know

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.280 
powerup we have 38 coins so you know
there's<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.430> variety<00:02:54.580> of<00:02:55.030> different<00:02:55.330> power-ups

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
there's a variety of different power-ups

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.800 
there's a variety of different power-ups
I<00:02:56.320> like<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.100> multi<00:02:57.459> ball<00:02:57.730> but<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.209> can't<00:02:58.630> afford

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
I like the multi ball but I can't afford

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.500 
I like the multi ball but I can't afford
that<00:02:59.350> this<00:02:59.890> time<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.880> we'll<00:03:01.000> go<00:03:01.209> for<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
that this time so we'll go for the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.870 
that this time so we'll go for the
Powerball<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.500> then<00:03:02.950> we'll<00:03:03.130> see<00:03:03.310> if<00:03:03.430> we<00:03:03.580> can't

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
Powerball and then we'll see if we can't

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.630 
Powerball and then we'll see if we can't
do<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.780> little<00:03:05.019> bit<00:03:05.170> better<00:03:05.380> this<00:03:05.590> time<00:03:05.650> shoot

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
do a little bit better this time shoot

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.300 
do a little bit better this time shoot
that<00:03:06.910> one<00:03:07.180> whoops<00:03:07.569> take<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.680> one<00:03:08.890> out<00:03:08.920> and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
that one whoops take that one out and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.460 
that one whoops take that one out and
maybe<00:03:09.880> just<00:03:10.450> maybe<00:03:10.720> it'll<00:03:11.080> help<00:03:11.350> us<00:03:11.530> out<00:03:11.769> you

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
maybe just maybe it'll help us out you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.290 
maybe just maybe it'll help us out you
get<00:03:14.470> points<00:03:14.860> as<00:03:14.980> well<00:03:15.190> for<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.910> more<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.239> the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
get points as well for the more of the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.330 
get points as well for the more of the
platform<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.500> take<00:03:17.739> out<00:03:17.920> that<00:03:18.130> worked

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
platform that you take out that worked

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.520 
platform that you take out that worked
out<00:03:18.489> fairly<00:03:18.880> well<00:03:19.000> again<00:03:19.480> tap<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.959> coins<00:03:20.260> and

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
out fairly well again tap the coins and

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.680 
out fairly well again tap the coins and
get<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.769> coins<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.820> helpful<00:03:22.329> for<00:03:22.360> you

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
get the coins that is helpful for you

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.390 
get the coins that is helpful for you
and<00:03:25.690> since<00:03:26.140> we<00:03:26.260> have<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> couple<00:03:26.769> extra<00:03:26.980> we<00:03:27.250> can

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
and since we have a couple extra we can

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.000 
and since we have a couple extra we can
just<00:03:27.610> do<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:28.000> clear<00:03:28.750> out<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.140> board<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.860> you

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
just do that clear out the board and you

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.970 
just do that clear out the board and you
go<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.430> now<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.180> keep<00:03:31.510> on<00:03:31.750> going<00:03:32.230> again<00:03:32.680> one

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
go on now you keep on going again one

go on now you keep on going again one
star<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.549> can<00:03:33.700> replay<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.150> level<00:03:34.630> if<00:03:34.720> you

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
star you can replay the level if you

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.009 
star you can replay the level if you
don't<00:03:34.989> like<00:03:35.200> what<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.590> did<00:03:35.970> that's<00:03:36.970> it<00:03:37.329> for
