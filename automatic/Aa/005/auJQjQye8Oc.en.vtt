would if you have the 2.4 gigahertz or

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.630 
would if you have the 2.4 gigahertz or
5.8<00:01:06.240> gigahertz<00:01:06.720> transmitter<00:01:07.430> we<00:01:08.430> plug

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
5.8 gigahertz transmitter we plug

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.490 
5.8 gigahertz transmitter we plug
directly<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> back<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> transmitter

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
directly to the back of the transmitter

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.710 
directly to the back of the transmitter
as<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.640> which<00:01:12.360> makes

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
as you can see right there which makes

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.570 
as you can see right there which makes
it<00:01:12.869> plug<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.409> play<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:13.979> easy<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.430> use

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
it plug and play and really easy to use

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.480 
it plug and play and really easy to use
however<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.900> one<00:01:16.290> point<00:01:16.530> three<00:01:16.590> gigahertz<00:01:17.070> as

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
however the one point three gigahertz as

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.820 
however the one point three gigahertz as
you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.790> see<00:01:17.939> has<00:01:18.299> no<00:01:18.630> plug<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.740> you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you can see has no plug for it so you

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.240 
you can see has no plug for it so you
have<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.700> make<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:21.000> own<00:01:22.009> basically<00:01:23.009> when<00:01:23.159> you

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
have to make your own basically when you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
have to make your own basically when you
cut<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.759> half<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.180> don't<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> bunch

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
cut this in half you don't see a bunch

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.410 
cut this in half you don't see a bunch
of<00:01:25.229> wires<00:01:25.610> poking<00:01:26.610> out<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.090> don't<00:01:27.270> know

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
of wires poking out that you don't know

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.590 
of wires poking out that you don't know
what<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.259> what<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.490> i'm<00:01:29.820> gonna<00:01:30.000> show<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.270> real

here you're going to have the two
multicolored<00:01:54.060> waters<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.470> your

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
multicolored waters and that is your

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.550 
multicolored waters and that is your
positive<00:01:56.490> virus<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.030> then<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> very<00:01:58.079> left

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
positive virus and then on the very left

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.289 
positive virus and then on the very left
you're<00:01:58.799> going<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.070> two<00:01:59.280> more<00:01:59.520> bars<00:01:59.790> which

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
you're going to have two more bars which

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.899 
you're going to have two more bars which
is<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.840> red<00:02:01.320> wire<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.100> cup<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.369> water<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
is a red wire and a cup of water and

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.410 
is a red wire and a cup of water and
these<00:02:03.689> go<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.439> video<00:02:05.689> output<00:02:07.069> so

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
these go to the video output so

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.300 
these go to the video output so
basically<00:02:09.420> i<00:02:09.569> did<00:02:09.780> after<00:02:09.929> i<00:02:10.110> cut<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.560> i<00:02:10.890> got

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
basically i did after i cut this i got

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.510 
basically i did after i cut this i got
my<00:02:11.340> wires<00:02:11.610> together

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
my wires together

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.610 
my wires together
and<00:02:12.580> then<00:02:12.730> wired<00:02:13.360> them<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.810> my<00:02:13.960> transmitter

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
and then wired them to my transmitter

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.910 
and then wired them to my transmitter
and<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.210> plugged<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.050> up<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.740> power

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
and then I plugged it up to the power

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.800 
and then I plugged it up to the power
source<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.520> nothing<00:02:19.030> was<00:02:19.120> happening<00:02:19.330> I

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
source and nothing was happening I

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.960 
source and nothing was happening I
cannot<00:02:20.140> get<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:20.530> plug<00:02:21.190> right<00:02:21.430> here<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.790> work

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
cannot get this plug right here to work

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.790 
cannot get this plug right here to work
with<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.540> camera<00:02:22.960> on<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.110> transmitter<00:02:23.590> at

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
with the camera on the transmitter at

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.790 
with the camera on the transmitter at
all<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.640> I<00:02:24.970> don't<00:02:25.270> know<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.320> could<00:02:26.500> not<00:02:26.620> get

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
all so I don't know but I could not get

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.560 
all so I don't know but I could not get
it<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:26.920> work<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.460> I<00:02:27.490> basically<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:27.970> do<00:02:28.390> this

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
it to work so I basically just do this

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.330 
it to work so I basically just do this
out<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.520> what<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.550> did<00:02:30.880> was<00:02:31.530> take<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.740> case

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
out and what I did was take this case

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.610 
out and what I did was take this case
off<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.730> back<00:02:33.970> not<00:02:34.390> soldered<00:02:34.630> wires<00:02:34.900> directly

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
off the back not soldered wires directly

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.920 
off the back not soldered wires directly
into<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.490> prongs<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.270> are<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.690> back<00:02:37.840> of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
into the prongs that are in the back of

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.500 
into the prongs that are in the back of
this<00:02:37.990> camera<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:39.820> made<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.060> little<00:02:40.240> diagram

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
this camera and I made a little diagram

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.660 
this camera and I made a little diagram
right<00:02:40.870> here<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.200> show<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.440> which<00:02:42.010> prong<00:02:42.400> is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
right here to show you which prong is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.050 
right here to show you which prong is
which<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.530> if<00:02:44.530> we<00:02:44.770> start<00:02:45.160> at<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.610> very<00:02:45.640> right

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
which and if we start at the very right

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.820 
which and if we start at the very right
with<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.540> plug<00:02:46.960> in<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.230> bottom<00:02:47.590> right-hand

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
with the plug in the bottom right-hand

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.250 
with the plug in the bottom right-hand
corner<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:49.060> first<00:02:49.390> prong<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:49.840> your<00:02:49.990> video

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
corner the first prong is your video

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.590 
corner the first prong is your video
then<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.100> second<00:02:51.640> prong<00:02:51.880> is<00:02:52.150> going<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.450> be

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
then the second prong is going to be

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.050 
then the second prong is going to be
your<00:02:52.810> negative<00:02:53.650> lead<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.030> third

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
your negative lead and then the third

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.990 
your negative lead and then the third
prong<00:02:55.600> is<00:02:55.900> going<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.260> be<00:02:56.440> your<00:02:56.800> positive<00:02:57.550> for

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
prong is going to be your positive for

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.240 
prong is going to be your positive for
your<00:02:58.120> power<00:02:58.330> source<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.770> as<00:02:59.860> you<00:02:59.980> can<00:03:00.040> see

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
your power source so as you can see

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.570 
your power source so as you can see
right<00:03:00.280> here<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.880> have<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:02.010> black<00:03:03.010> wire<00:03:03.280> well

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
right here I have a black wire well

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.070 
right here I have a black wire well
don't<00:03:04.030> pay<00:03:04.240> attention<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.600> these<00:03:04.690> colors

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
don't pay attention to these colors

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.140 
don't pay attention to these colors
because<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.800> colors<00:03:06.100> are<00:03:06.280> wrong<00:03:06.550> if<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:06.850> look

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
because the colors are wrong if you look

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.910 
because the colors are wrong if you look
at<00:03:07.300> it<00:03:07.330> these<00:03:07.960> are<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.170> only<00:03:08.260> wires<00:03:08.500> i<00:03:08.680> had<00:03:08.890> i

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
at it these are the only wires i had i

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.650 
at it these are the only wires i had i
need<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.250> go<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.610> store<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.150> buy<00:03:10.390> some

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
need to go to the store and buy some

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.330 
need to go to the store and buy some
more<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:11.320> was<00:03:11.500> just<00:03:11.710> for<00:03:11.770> demonstration

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
more this was just for demonstration

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.330 
more this was just for demonstration
purpose<00:03:13.240> and<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.480> make<00:03:13.630> sure<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.900> was<00:03:14.020> working

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
purpose and to make sure it was working

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.360 
purpose and to make sure it was working
so<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:16.450> problem<00:03:17.290> very<00:03:17.650> right<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:18.040> my<00:03:18.160> video

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
so the problem very right is my video

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.880 
so the problem very right is my video
which<00:03:19.030> is<00:03:19.330> this<00:03:19.660> black<00:03:19.930> wire<00:03:20.170> that's<00:03:20.440> hooking

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
which is this black wire that's hooking

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.980 
which is this black wire that's hooking
up<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.820> yellow<00:03:22.060> wire<00:03:22.300> that<00:03:22.570> goes<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.959> my

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
up to the yellow wire that goes to my

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.650 
up to the yellow wire that goes to my
transmitter<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.770> then<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:25.060> second<00:03:25.450> from<00:03:25.630> the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
transmitter and then the second from the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.260 
transmitter and then the second from the
right<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:26.200> my<00:03:26.590> negative<00:03:27.490> wire<00:03:27.730> which<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.150> your

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
right is my negative wire which is your

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.110 
right is my negative wire which is your
ground<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.020> that<00:03:29.050> hooks<00:03:29.770> up<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.400> black

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
ground and that hooks up to this black

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.080 
ground and that hooks up to this black
wire<00:03:31.450> on<00:03:31.750> your<00:03:32.020> transmitter<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:32.860> then<00:03:33.700> the

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
wire on your transmitter and then the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.270 
wire on your transmitter and then the
third<00:03:34.120> from<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.780> right<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:35.260> your<00:03:35.560> positive

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
third from the right is your positive

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.920 
third from the right is your positive
and<00:03:36.580> that's<00:03:36.820> going<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.000> hook<00:03:37.120> up<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.600> red

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
and that's going to hook up to the red

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.110 
and that's going to hook up to the red
wire<00:03:38.200> on<00:03:38.530> your<00:03:38.920> transmitter<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.730> can<00:03:39.970> have

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
wire on your transmitter so you can have

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.290 
wire on your transmitter so you can have
power<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.750> i<00:03:41.680> plan<00:03:41.920> on<00:03:42.180> extending<00:03:43.180> these

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
power and i plan on extending these

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.040 
power and i plan on extending these
wires<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:44.020> plug<00:03:44.440> in<00:03:44.620> New<00:03:45.510> use<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.540> new<00:03:46.750> plugs

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
wires and plug in New use a new plugs

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.949 
wires and plug in New use a new plugs
for<00:03:47.350> it<00:03:47.500> when<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:47.860> have<00:03:48.250> my<00:03:48.430> final<00:03:48.670> set<00:03:49.090> up<00:03:49.209> so

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
for it when I have my final set up so

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.830 
for it when I have my final set up so
and<00:03:50.320> then<00:03:50.860> this<00:03:51.220> white<00:03:51.880> wire<00:03:52.240> you<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:52.630> see

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.690 
and then this white wire you can see
right<00:03:52.870> here<00:03:53.320> is<00:03:53.560> for<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:53.860> microphone<00:03:54.370> which

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
right here is for a microphone which

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.640 
right here is for a microphone which
this<00:03:55.120> camera<00:03:55.660> does<00:03:55.840> not<00:03:55.990> have<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.230> microphone
