 [Music] 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.519
 I understand this situation since 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.710
 many months pointing to the ombudsman 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.980
 to the congress the public network that have a 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.539
 problem the mayor of Lima record no longer 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.550
 take an interview that has given the face 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.390
 about this matter and the rector of the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:37.389

 [Music] 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.519
 ranches go out and protest and not 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.519
 They stopped us the kids that 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.210
 everything started when the march of 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.800
 protest that the students wanted 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.810
 make up the congress this morning 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.790
 they do nothing before they get to the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.590
 first block the students did not have 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.659
 permission to leave and the mood 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.729
 they warmed up these images give account of 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.590
 how it all starts a small pile to 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.119
 the police and students the first 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.979
 coup on the part of the forces of order 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.420
 the students raise their hands and they are 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.369
 peace but the police have to 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.950
 repress and there comes the first stone 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.550
 from the other side what came next was 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.550
 the pandemonium 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.850

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.860

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.569
 [Applause]

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.800
 inside 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.050
 and it seemed finished to a new 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.069
 confrontation occurred this time with 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.069
 Detainees included 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.319

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.960
 the tear gas and I left a while 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.530

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.950
 doors 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.689
 They have doubled and have continued pulling is 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.329
 can throw tear gas bombs like 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.790
 these sitting in the living rooms in plenas 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.579
 classes as well as this tear gas bomb 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.729
 already activated have been found 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:22.190
 average of 25 to 30 pumps and separate 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.560
 are missing more this pump has been 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.919
 found in a classroom where there have been 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.650
 fellow students doing classes 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.180
 these are different this different 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.210
 projectiles that have been found in 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.160
 them in the areas br on the tracks that 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.979
 has been this proof that the cops 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.110
 they entered and threw them even some 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.060
 they went to the ceiling and some went to the body 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.490
 according to the municipality of Lima works 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.620
 continue despite protests without 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.150
 However at the end of this note a rumor 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.889
 strong ran through the corridors of the 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.289
 university the imminent take 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.759
 cloister by the police the 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:01.240
 solution to this problem has the 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:01.240
 Same dimensions as the police 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.940
 but for the fuss 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:06:05.390
