00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
very organized very well laid out so

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.599 
very organized very well laid out so
we've<00:04:16.960> got<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:17.500> skip<00:04:17.950> button<00:04:18.280> here<00:04:18.580> that

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
we've got a skip button here that

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.150 
we've got a skip button here that
operates<00:04:19.120> separately<00:04:19.479> and<00:04:20.260> then<00:04:20.799> we've<00:04:21.010> got

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
operates separately and then we've got

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.000 
operates separately and then we've got
looks<00:04:21.489> like<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.850> power<00:04:22.780> button<00:04:23.229> and<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.710> foam

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
looks like a power button and a foam

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.070 
looks like a power button and a foam
button<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:24.700> imagine<00:04:25.210> this<00:04:25.570> looks<00:04:25.840> like<00:04:25.960> it

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
button and imagine this looks like it

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.290 
button and imagine this looks like it
might<00:04:26.229> be<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.410> light-up<00:04:26.740> LED<00:04:27.370> thing<00:04:27.610> so<00:04:28.150> we'll

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
might be a light-up LED thing so we'll

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.500 
might be a light-up LED thing so we'll
find<00:04:28.570> out<00:04:28.660> what<00:04:28.810> more<00:04:29.020> about<00:04:29.350> that<00:04:29.590> that<00:04:29.950> is

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
find out what more about that that is

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.840 
find out what more about that that is
looks<00:04:31.510> like<00:04:31.690> we're<00:04:32.470> turning<00:04:33.130> it<00:04:33.190> on<00:04:33.310> there<00:04:33.610> and

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
looks like we're turning it on there and

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.600 
looks like we're turning it on there and
we<00:04:34.210> saw<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.570> beep<00:04:35.020> flash<00:04:35.380> a<00:04:35.800> blue<00:04:36.010> flash<00:04:36.340> of<00:04:36.580> the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
we saw a beep flash a blue flash of the

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.060 
we saw a beep flash a blue flash of the
of<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.600> Bluetooth<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.440> that<00:04:38.830> would<00:04:38.950> probably

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
of the Bluetooth so that would probably

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.830 
of the Bluetooth so that would probably
be<00:04:39.310> more<00:04:39.490> active<00:04:39.880> what<00:04:40.419> we're<00:04:40.510> gonna<00:04:40.600> do<00:04:40.750> is

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
be more active what we're gonna do is

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.719 
be more active what we're gonna do is
