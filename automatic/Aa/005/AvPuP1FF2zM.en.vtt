00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
that's a great idea in theory but what

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.949 
that's a great idea in theory but what
you<00:02:40.819> don't<00:02:40.940> understand<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.569> beginning<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
you don't understand in beginning the

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.960 
you don't understand in beginning the
game<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.470> things<00:02:42.800> get<00:02:43.010> very<00:02:43.220> weird<00:02:43.610> very

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
game is that things get very weird very

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.760 
game is that things get very weird very
quickly<00:02:44.300> that<00:02:44.629> the<00:02:44.750> father<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.230> not<00:02:45.410> exactly

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
quickly that the father is not exactly

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.020 
quickly that the father is not exactly
who<00:02:45.920> he<00:02:46.010> says<00:02:46.190> he<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.550> maybe<00:02:46.670> even<00:02:46.879> the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
who he says he is and maybe even the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.839 
who he says he is and maybe even the
girl<00:02:47.209> isn't<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:48.440> gets<00:02:48.680> really<00:02:49.610> sort<00:02:49.819> of

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 
girl isn't it gets really sort of

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.720 
girl isn't it gets really sort of
supernatural<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.870> out<00:02:51.260> there<00:02:51.590> it's<00:02:52.160> pretty

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
supernatural and out there it's pretty

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.690 
supernatural and out there it's pretty
interesting

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.770 

so<00:02:57.700> first<00:02:57.910> up<00:02:58.120> let<00:02:58.300> me<00:02:58.360> talk<00:02:58.510> about<00:02:58.540> the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
so first up let me talk about the

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.930 
so first up let me talk about the
controls<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.470> this<00:02:59.710> is<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.890> great<00:03:00.250> example<00:03:00.400> of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
controls and this is a great example of

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.180 
controls and this is a great example of
why<00:03:01.270> they<00:03:01.480> drive<00:03:01.690> me<00:03:01.870> frickin<00:03:02.410> crazy<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:03.040> that

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
why they drive me frickin crazy and that

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.890 
why they drive me frickin crazy and that
is<00:03:03.340> because<00:03:03.700> they're<00:03:04.000> very<00:03:04.180> similar<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.750> the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
is because they're very similar to the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.620 
is because they're very similar to the
classic<00:03:05.470> sort<00:03:05.710> of<00:03:05.890> Resident<00:03:06.460> Evil<00:03:06.790> style<00:03:07.210> of

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
classic sort of Resident Evil style of

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.460 
classic sort of Resident Evil style of
tank<00:03:08.110> controls<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:09.360> they<00:03:10.360> are<00:03:10.750> maddening<00:03:11.350> at

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
tank controls and they are maddening at

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.560 
tank controls and they are maddening at
first<00:03:11.740> you<00:03:12.550> will<00:03:12.670> see<00:03:12.820> me<00:03:13.000> sort<00:03:13.240> of<00:03:13.300> running

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
first you will see me sort of running

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.510 
first you will see me sort of running
around<00:03:13.660> in<00:03:13.900> circles<00:03:14.350> barely<00:03:14.770> trying<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.250> you

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
around in circles barely trying to you

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.550 
around in circles barely trying to you
know<00:03:15.550> get<00:03:15.820> up<00:03:15.940> this<00:03:16.060> ladder<00:03:16.330> here<00:03:16.810> dying

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
know get up this ladder here dying

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.070 
know get up this ladder here dying
repeatedly<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.550> that's<00:03:18.790> because<00:03:19.150> back<00:03:19.900> in

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
repeatedly and that's because back in

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.470 
repeatedly and that's because back in
the<00:03:20.140> day<00:03:20.320> a<00:03:20.620> lot<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.520> games<00:03:21.730> had<00:03:22.000> these<00:03:22.150> sort<00:03:22.420> of

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
the day a lot of games had these sort of

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.390 
the day a lot of games had these sort of
controls<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.080> it's<00:03:23.260> been<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:23.680> long<00:03:23.950> since<00:03:24.010> I

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
controls and it's been so long since I

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.770 
controls and it's been so long since I
played<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.670> game<00:03:24.880> like<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.240> that<00:03:25.420> it's<00:03:25.540> sort

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
played a game like that that it's sort

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.870 
played a game like that that it's sort
of<00:03:25.870> weird<00:03:26.110> to<00:03:26.320> have<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.560> go<00:03:26.680> back<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:27.160> would<00:03:27.760> say

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
of weird to have to go back I would say

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.490 
of weird to have to go back I would say
that's<00:03:28.060> really<00:03:28.390> it's<00:03:28.540> only<00:03:28.840> sort<00:03:29.230> of<00:03:29.290> knock

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
that's really it's only sort of knock

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.200 
that's really it's only sort of knock
other<00:03:29.830> than<00:03:30.010> maybe<00:03:30.160> difficulty<00:03:30.820> in<00:03:30.910> this<00:03:31.030> game

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
other than maybe difficulty in this game

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.470 
other than maybe difficulty in this game
just<00:03:31.990> sort<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.230> getting<00:03:32.410> used<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:33.390> what<00:03:34.390> is

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
just sort of getting used to what is

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.750 
just sort of getting used to what is
typically<00:03:35.080> called<00:03:35.380> tank<00:03:35.890> controls<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:39.400> if

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
typically called tank controls but if

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.780 
typically called tank controls but if
you<00:03:39.940> give<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.180> enough<00:03:40.390> time<00:03:41.430> just<00:03:42.430> like<00:03:42.580> back

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
you give it enough time just like back

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.790 
you give it enough time just like back
you<00:03:43.090> know<00:03:43.210> in<00:03:43.360> 2000<00:03:43.930> you<00:03:44.380> can<00:03:44.410> get<00:03:44.650> through

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
you know in 2000 you can get through

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.500 
you know in 2000 you can get through
this<00:03:44.860> game<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.190> have<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.340> lot<00:03:45.460> of<00:03:45.490> fun

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.910 

so<00:03:53.510> when<00:03:53.690> fear<00:03:53.960> effect<00:03:54.230> was<00:03:54.470> released

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
so when fear effect was released

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.940 
so when fear effect was released
originally<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.790> was<00:03:55.970> most<00:03:56.450> notable<00:03:57.290> for<00:03:57.680> its

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
originally it was most notable for its

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.520 
originally it was most notable for its
visual<00:03:58.460> style<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.000> what<00:03:59.720> it's<00:03:59.840> doing<00:04:00.200> here<00:04:00.230> is

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
visual style and what it's doing here is

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.010 
visual style and what it's doing here is
basically<00:04:00.890> it<00:04:01.340> has<00:04:01.490> 3d<00:04:02.270> rendered<00:04:02.780> backgrounds

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
basically it has 3d rendered backgrounds

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.140 
basically it has 3d rendered backgrounds
just<00:04:03.860> kind<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.070> like<00:04:04.190> Resident<00:04:04.610> Evil<00:04:04.880> but<00:04:05.060> the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
just kind of like Resident Evil but the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.870 
just kind of like Resident Evil but the
difference<00:04:05.480> is<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:05.690> it's<00:04:06.650> actually<00:04:06.920> a<00:04:07.220> movie

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
difference is that it's actually a movie

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.670 
difference is that it's actually a movie
that's<00:04:08.060> looping<00:04:08.600> in<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.990> background<00:04:09.440> so

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
that's looping in the background so

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.380 
that's looping in the background so
that's<00:04:10.040> why<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:10.220> get<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.520> fire<00:04:10.790> that's<00:04:11.240> why

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
that's why you get the fire that's why

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.990 
that's why you get the fire that's why
you<00:04:11.450> get<00:04:11.750> sort<00:04:12.530> of<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:13.310> different<00:04:13.640> lighting

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
you get sort of the different lighting

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.449 
you get sort of the different lighting
effects<00:04:14.330> on<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.570> barrel<00:04:14.900> right<00:04:15.080> there

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
effects on the barrel right there

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.479 
effects on the barrel right there
there's<00:04:16.459> another<00:04:16.550> scene<00:04:17.000> where<00:04:17.980> you<00:04:18.980> are<00:04:19.160> in<00:04:19.400> a

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
there's another scene where you are in a

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.400 
there's another scene where you are in a
cityscape<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.060> you're<00:04:20.390> looking<00:04:20.989> down<00:04:21.170> on

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
cityscape and you're looking down on

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.650 
cityscape and you're looking down on
traffic<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:22.130> this<00:04:22.970> is<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.300> know<00:04:23.420> your

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
traffic and this is you know your

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.660 
traffic and this is you know your
character<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.170> a<00:04:24.260> polygon<00:04:24.770> that's<00:04:25.070> in<00:04:25.250> that

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
character is a polygon that's in that

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.840 
character is a polygon that's in that
scene<00:04:26.510> but<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.860> looping<00:04:28.220> background<00:04:28.700> really

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
scene but the looping background really

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.790 
scene but the looping background really
adds<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.450> lot<00:04:29.480> of<00:04:29.660> sort<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.080> depth<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.620> realism

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
adds a lot of sort of depth and realism

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.650 
adds a lot of sort of depth and realism
to<00:04:31.280> it<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.520> just<00:04:31.730> wasn't<00:04:31.910> possible<00:04:32.060> at<00:04:32.570> the

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
to it that just wasn't possible at the

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.290 
to it that just wasn't possible at the
time<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:34.400> know<00:04:34.520> it's<00:04:34.790> really<00:04:35.000> low

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
time and you know it's really low

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.690 
time and you know it's really low
resolution<00:04:36.020> now<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.560> looks<00:04:37.070> kind<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.310> dated

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
resolution now and looks kind of dated

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.790 
resolution now and looks kind of dated
but<00:04:37.880> it's<00:04:38.750> still<00:04:38.990> it's<00:04:39.350> still<00:04:39.620> pretty

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
but it's still it's still pretty

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.950 
but it's still it's still pretty
cool-looking<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.700> definitely<00:04:41.360> has<00:04:41.540> a<00:04:41.570> style

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
cool-looking it definitely has a style

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:50.760 
cool-looking it definitely has a style
to<00:04:42.170> it

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.780

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.200 

okay<00:05:05.980> now<00:05:06.100> how<00:05:06.220> many<00:05:06.280> games<00:05:06.610> do<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:07.000> know

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
okay now how many games do you know

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.510 
okay now how many games do you know
we're<00:05:07.750> using<00:05:08.020> your<00:05:08.320> towels<00:05:08.590> strategically

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
we're using your towels strategically

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.540 
we're using your towels strategically
progresses<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.330> story<00:05:10.690> huh<00:05:10.960> not<00:05:11.890> nearly<00:05:12.160> enough

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
progresses a story huh not nearly enough

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.120 
progresses a story huh not nearly enough
what<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.270> got<00:05:13.420> a<00:05:13.450> military<00:05:14.410> supply<00:05:14.770> train

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
what you got a military supply train

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.450 
what you got a military supply train
probably<00:05:15.910> loaded<00:05:16.300> with<00:05:16.330> weapons<00:05:16.570> but<00:05:17.460> closer

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
probably loaded with weapons but closer

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.850 
probably loaded with weapons but closer
look<00:05:18.700> that<00:05:18.910> meant<00:05:19.690> the<00:05:19.870> train<00:05:20.200> that<00:05:20.470> is

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.649 

so<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:25.979> story<00:05:26.280> starts<00:05:26.669> off<00:05:26.819> pretty<00:05:27.270> simple

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
so the story starts off pretty simple

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.480 
so the story starts off pretty simple
man<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.169> gets<00:05:28.379> really<00:05:28.710> weird<00:05:28.860> really<00:05:29.370> quick

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
man it gets really weird really quick

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.429 
man it gets really weird really quick
and<00:05:29.969> what<00:05:30.210> I<00:05:30.270> mean<00:05:30.509> by<00:05:30.689> that<00:05:30.719> is<00:05:31.110> so<00:05:31.319> that

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:31.439 
and what I mean by that is so that

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.600 
and what I mean by that is so that
actually<00:05:31.919> the<00:05:32.069> last<00:05:32.659> disc<00:05:33.659> of<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:33.960> game<00:05:34.169> is

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
actually the last disc of the game is

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.040 
actually the last disc of the game is
and<00:05:35.610> I<00:05:35.879> know<00:05:36.000> this<00:05:36.090> is<00:05:36.240> kind<00:05:36.419> of<00:05:36.449> a<00:05:36.509> spoiler<00:05:36.930> but

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
and I know this is kind of a spoiler but

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.689 
and I know this is kind of a spoiler but
man<00:05:37.259> it<00:05:37.590> actually<00:05:37.620> ends<00:05:38.219> up<00:05:38.280> in<00:05:38.460> hell

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699

literally you actually go to hell and
fight<00:05:42.840> the<00:05:43.050> devil<00:05:44.210> and<00:05:45.379> you<00:05:46.379> know<00:05:46.469> again<00:05:46.740> I

don't<00:05:46.979> want<00:05:47.099> to<00:05:47.189> give<00:05:47.520> too<00:05:47.550> much<00:05:47.729> away<00:05:47.879> but

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
don't want to give too much away but

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.089 
don't want to give too much away but
like<00:05:48.840> some<00:05:49.229> of<00:05:49.319> the<00:05:49.379> characters<00:05:49.800> in<00:05:49.919> this<00:05:50.009> game

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
like some of the characters in this game

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.909 
like some of the characters in this game
actually<00:05:50.759> end<00:05:51.090> up<00:05:51.300> down<00:05:51.539> there<00:05:51.569> and<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.259> meet

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.390 
actually end up down there and you meet
them<00:05:53.159> it's<00:05:53.430> really<00:05:53.909> actually<00:05:54.780> pretty<00:05:54.960> wild<00:05:55.590> so

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
them it's really actually pretty wild so

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.070 
them it's really actually pretty wild so
I<00:05:56.430> don't<00:05:56.819> want<00:05:56.969> to<00:05:57.060> give<00:05:57.360> away<00:05:57.509> too<00:05:57.689> many

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
I don't want to give away too many

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.050 
I don't want to give away too many
spoilers<00:05:58.409> here<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:58.860> chose<00:05:59.460> not<00:05:59.699> to<00:05:59.759> show

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
spoilers here and I chose not to show

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.689 
spoilers here and I chose not to show
that<00:06:00.270> stuff<00:06:00.599> but<00:06:01.409> if<00:06:01.830> you<00:06:02.009> like<00:06:02.250> that<00:06:02.460> sort<00:06:02.610> of

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
that stuff but if you like that sort of

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.159 
that stuff but if you like that sort of
thing<00:06:02.759> you<00:06:03.479> should<00:06:03.629> definitely<00:06:03.689> check<00:06:03.960> this

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
thing you should definitely check this

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.760 
thing you should definitely check this
out

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.480 

so<00:06:09.770> let's<00:06:09.920> talk<00:06:10.040> about<00:06:10.100> some<00:06:10.340> of<00:06:10.400> the

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
so let's talk about some of the

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.160 
so let's talk about some of the
negatives<00:06:10.820> at<00:06:10.880> the<00:06:10.970> game<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:11.690> first<00:06:11.840> one<00:06:12.050> is

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
negatives at the game the first one is

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.510 
negatives at the game the first one is
that<00:06:12.230> it's<00:06:12.440> actually<00:06:12.770> pretty<00:06:12.950> short

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
that it's actually pretty short

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.280 
that it's actually pretty short
you<00:06:14.330> can<00:06:14.480> probably<00:06:14.570> finish<00:06:14.840> this<00:06:15.050> game<00:06:15.230> in

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
you can probably finish this game in

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.200 
you can probably finish this game in
about<00:06:15.530> five<00:06:16.100> or<00:06:16.130> six<00:06:16.430> hours<00:06:16.730> and<00:06:16.910> your<00:06:17.000> first

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
about five or six hours and your first

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.960 
about five or six hours and your first
playthrough<00:06:17.920> but<00:06:18.920> the<00:06:19.130> second<00:06:19.550> negative<00:06:19.670> is

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
playthrough but the second negative is

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.730 
playthrough but the second negative is
is<00:06:20.180> that<00:06:20.330> the<00:06:20.480> reason<00:06:20.840> why<00:06:20.990> it<00:06:21.020> takes<00:06:21.500> a<00:06:21.620> little

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
is that the reason why it takes a little

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.200 
is that the reason why it takes a little
bit<00:06:21.890> longer<00:06:22.100> even<00:06:22.400> is<00:06:22.670> that<00:06:22.820> it's<00:06:22.970> so

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
bit longer even is that it's so

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.850 
bit longer even is that it's so
difficult<00:06:23.750> I<00:06:24.020> mean<00:06:24.200> there<00:06:24.380> are<00:06:24.410> parts<00:06:24.770> this

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
trying to be stealthy and make it past

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.420 
trying to be stealthy and make it past
these<00:06:31.910> cooks<00:06:32.240> and<00:06:32.740> you<00:06:33.740> can't<00:06:33.980> fire<00:06:34.190> a<00:06:34.220> weapon

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
and you have to sort of you know figure

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.920 
and you have to sort of you know figure
out<00:06:36.800> the<00:06:36.950> timing<00:06:37.190> I<00:06:37.490> probably<00:06:38.240> played<00:06:38.540> through

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
out the timing I probably played through

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.630

that no kidding

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.150

maybe<00:06:41.030> 30<00:06:41.420> or<00:06:41.660> 40<00:06:42.080> times<00:06:42.110> just<00:06:42.860> to<00:06:42.950> get<00:06:43.070> the

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
maybe 30 or 40 times just to get the

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.270 
maybe 30 or 40 times just to get the
timing<00:06:43.430> down<00:06:44.620> it's<00:06:45.620> brutally<00:06:46.160> difficult

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
timing down it's brutally difficult

a walkthrough and part of that is due to

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.260 
a walkthrough and part of that is due to
