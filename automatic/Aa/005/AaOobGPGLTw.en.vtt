actually shy how to make a pandora
battery<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:11.099> obviously<00:00:12.000> first<00:00:12.300> thing<00:00:12.509> you'll

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
battery and obviously first thing you'll

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
battery and obviously first thing you'll
need<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.679> PSP<00:00:14.280> Valley<00:00:14.519> excite<00:00:15.500> second<00:00:16.500> thing

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
need is a PSP Valley excite second thing

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.330 
need is a PSP Valley excite second thing
I<00:00:16.770> need<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.279> sharp<00:00:17.640> object<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.529> razor<00:00:20.220> blade

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
I need is a sharp object I a razor blade

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.609 
I need is a sharp object I a razor blade
is<00:00:20.640> probably<00:00:20.939> best<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.510> or<00:00:21.779> anything

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
is probably best for this or anything

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.089 
is probably best for this or anything
which<00:00:23.070> will<00:00:23.279> be<00:00:23.400> fin<00:00:23.730> enough<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.710> cut<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.920> line

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
which will be fin enough to cut the line

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.880 
which will be fin enough to cut the line
in<00:00:27.090> between<00:00:27.210> battery<00:00:27.840> there<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:30.289> ok<00:00:31.289> once

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
in between battery there and ok once

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.130 
in between battery there and ok once
you've<00:00:32.070> got<00:00:32.309> your<00:00:32.340> sharp<00:00:32.880> object<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
you've got your sharp object and you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.580 
you've got your sharp object and you
start<00:00:34.530> paying<00:00:34.980> away<00:00:35.250> at<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.430> battery<00:00:36.440> what<00:00:37.440> you

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
start paying away at a battery what you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.190 
start paying away at a battery what you
should<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.460> any<00:00:39.120> something<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.870> hope<00:00:40.020> he

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
should then have any something I hope he

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.630 
should then have any something I hope he
looks<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.739> it'll<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.309> where

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
looks and it'll be like this where

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.160 
looks and it'll be like this where
you've<00:00:41.820> cut<00:00:42.149> down<00:00:42.559> one<00:00:43.559> side<00:00:44.149> by<00:00:45.149> side<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
you've cut down one side by side of the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.850 
you've cut down one side by side of the
battery<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:47.100> do<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.550> slowly<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.539> very

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
battery now do this slowly it's a very

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.439 
battery now do this slowly it's a very
slow<00:00:49.860> process<00:00:50.100> because<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.420> very

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
slow process because you have to be very

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.180 
slow process because you have to be very
careful<00:00:51.870> when<00:00:52.230> you're<00:00:52.379> opening<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.800> battery

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
careful when you're opening the battery

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.119 
careful when you're opening the battery
itself<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.120> once<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.289> actually<00:00:55.710> cut<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
itself and once you have actually cut it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
itself and once you have actually cut it
down<00:00:56.280> far<00:00:56.640> enough<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.300> should<00:00:57.539> then<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.780> able

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
down far enough you should then be able

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.049 
down far enough you should then be able
to<00:00:58.140> do<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.680> we're<00:00:59.489> going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> little<00:00:59.940> bit

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
to do and we're going to be a little bit

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.549 
to do and we're going to be a little bit
of<00:01:00.300> force<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.170> open<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> battery<00:01:02.239> XO<00:01:03.559> inside

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
of force is open the battery XO inside

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.020 
of force is open the battery XO inside
as<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> battery<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
as you can see have the battery and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.510 
as you can see have the battery and
circuit<00:01:06.900> boards<00:01:07.200> well<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> think<00:01:07.500> why<00:01:08.040> did<00:01:08.340> when

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
circuit boards well I think why did when

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.810 
circuit boards well I think why did when
I<00:01:08.610> did<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.060> without<00:01:09.390> turnberry<00:01:10.170> round<00:01:10.820> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
I did this without turnberry round and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.530 
I did this without turnberry round and
very<00:01:12.060> carefully<00:01:13.220> pulled<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.490> circuit<00:01:15.390> board

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
very carefully pulled the circuit board

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.260 
very carefully pulled the circuit board
alongside<00:01:15.900> now<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.549> showing<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.909> C<00:01:18.119> is

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
alongside now I'm not showing as C is

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.660 
alongside now I'm not showing as C is
very<00:01:18.540> clearly<00:01:18.900> unfortunately<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.400> you

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
very clearly unfortunately but if you

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.280 
very clearly unfortunately but if you
look<00:01:21.200> here<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> tip<00:01:23.610> still<00:01:24.570> black<00:01:25.080> one

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
look here there is a tip still black one

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.100 
look here there is a tip still black one
here<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.250> either<00:01:26.400> side<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.420> chip<00:01:27.810> are

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
here now on either side of this chip are

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.260 
here now on either side of this chip are
four<00:01:28.500> pins<00:01:28.799> now<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:31.470> right<00:01:31.740> hand<00:01:32.009> side

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
four pins now on the right hand side

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.319 
four pins now on the right hand side
which<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.689> side<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.909> will<00:01:36.030> need<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
which is this side here you will need to

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.020 
which is this side here you will need to
cut<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.900> bottom<00:01:37.409> pin<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.369> I'm<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.759> sure<00:01:38.939> if

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
cut the bottom pin and I'm not sure if

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.590 
cut the bottom pin and I'm not sure if
you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.540> very<00:01:39.630> clearly<00:01:40.009> but<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.070> have

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
you can see it very clearly but I have

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.289 
you can see it very clearly but I have
removed<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.899> once<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.890> are<00:01:44.189> able<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.880> do<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
removed it once you are able to do that

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.389 
removed it once you are able to do that
we<00:01:46.170> don't<00:01:46.399> issue<00:01:47.780> simply<00:01:49.280> prozac<00:01:50.280> carefully

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
we don't issue simply prozac carefully

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.120 
we don't issue simply prozac carefully
and<00:01:53.399> place<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.970> battery<00:01:54.590> back<00:01:55.590> together<00:01:56.009> now

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and place the battery back together now

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.069 
and place the battery back together now
if<00:01:56.549> you've<00:01:56.700> got<00:01:56.909> some<00:01:57.119> type<00:01:57.450> sticking

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
if you've got some type sticking

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.160 
if you've got some type sticking
together<00:01:58.880> because<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.090> easier<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.540> get<00:02:00.659> PSP

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
together because it's easier to get PSP

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.550 
together because it's easier to get PSP
once<00:02:01.500> you've<00:02:01.680> done<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:03.350> okay<00:02:04.350> that's

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
once you've done it and okay that's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.010 
once you've done it and okay that's
basically<00:02:05.219> pretty<00:02:05.670> much<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.240> Pandora's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
basically pretty much it for Pandora's

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.469 
basically pretty much it for Pandora's
battery<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.740> I'll<00:02:08.489> do<00:02:08.819> not<00:02:09.030> take<00:02:09.270> any

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
battery and I'll do not take any

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.640 
battery and I'll do not take any
responsibility<00:02:09.629> if<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.800> doin<00:02:11.129> up<00:02:11.250> miss

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
responsibility if you doin up miss

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.670 
responsibility if you doin up miss
your<00:02:11.829> PSP<00:02:12.189> but<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.959> same<00:02:14.260> battery<00:02:14.650> I

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
your PSP but this is the same battery I

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.220 
your PSP but this is the same battery I
used<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.129> customize<00:02:15.340> my<00:02:15.879> own<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.450> hope<00:02:16.959> it

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
used to customize my own so hope it
