coconut oil on the ends of your hair but

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.760 
coconut oil on the ends of your hair but
the<00:00:35.580> trick<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:35.970> is<00:00:36.449> to<00:00:36.480> put<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.900> on<00:00:37.020> before<00:00:37.260> you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the trick is is to put it on before you

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.220 
the trick is is to put it on before you
shower<00:00:38.010> before<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.120> rinse<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.449> hair<00:00:39.750> not

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
shower before you rinse your hair not

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.259 
shower before you rinse your hair not
afterwards<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.100> find<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.760> makes<00:00:41.970> a<00:00:42.059> huge

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
afterwards I find this makes a huge

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.900 
afterwards I find this makes a huge
difference<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.199> when<00:00:43.949> my<00:00:44.040> hair<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.309> dry<00:00:44.640> before

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
difference so when my hair is dry before

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.460 
difference so when my hair is dry before
I<00:00:45.120> jump<00:00:45.450> into<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.840> shower<00:00:45.870> whether<00:00:46.320> I'm

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470

ends of my hair so I find this makes a
huge<00:02:14.760> difference<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.480> then

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
huge difference and then

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.120 
huge difference and then
