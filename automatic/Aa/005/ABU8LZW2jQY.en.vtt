00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:06.109
 Team World Cup on ice like Clariant Inzell that means driving it 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.590
 always two nations with two drivers against each other gets the first place 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.570
 three points the second part of the third place gets one point 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.589
 and the last place goes blank 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.689
 after four rounds, the points are added all the nations drive once 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.619
 against each other then it goes into the final 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.910
 in the German team disturbs Günter Bauer from Reit im Winkl 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 Stefan Pletschacher from Inzell and Florian Fürst from Wasserburg 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.600
 These are also the first three of the German championship of the past 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.420
 Thursday 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.480
 Germany is in third place after the first day with 17 points, 16 of them 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.940
 Günter Bauer retracted for the German team 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.050
 Günter Bauer also scores the points for Germany on the second day 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.410
 In the race against the Czech Republic, nothing will be paid 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.440
 because in the second round FFF Czechs Jan Klata many a bale of straw we 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.920
 lying on the track 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.280
 After a terrible second, the team shows up but nothing happened 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.969
 Banner of the brother of the Czechs in the round previously torn into the web 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.969
 That's why he was disqualified 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.550
 the race was repeated with a simple less the German team 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.550
 takes over the leadership then happens the next misfortune 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.549
 Stefan Pletschacher collides with the Czechs and disturbs 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.710
 he calls for the disqualification of the Czechs at this in Vienna at the time 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.910
 would mean that the two German drivers alone in the race 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.909
 go 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 five points are so sure of you 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.300
 Albert problem Ortner &amp; Ortner there is the stop ball 3 Crysis noted at the 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.080
 Wilstorfer was cleared or dropped there costs rotten 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.409
 it would have developed in front of the goal from the first success 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.990
 Greuther Fürth relies on the 5 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.939
 the Czech driver was disqualified the five points are 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.949
 Germany in this race for sure 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.949
 because you see only two of their rounds 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.069
 two races after the next fall 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.569
 the Dutchman Johnny 2 1 hit loses control of his 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 Motorcycle and crashed into the gang 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.299
 he is all right again he gets up and pushes his bike off the flag 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.569
 at speeds of up to 130 kilometers per hour would have this fall 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.569
 can also end differently 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.440
 It follows the race Germany against Sweden 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.260
 when the farmer blocks his teammate Stefan right in the first corner 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.380
 Pletschacher so are the two German riders on the last 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.380
 seats 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:12.109
 Günther Bauer managed to make up for his mistake but he wins 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.329
 at the end of the race and brings so for Germany three points 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.670
 Germany against Russia in the final loses the German team it is title 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.569
 "World champion victory means that Germany is world champion 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.309
 Günther Bauer immediately takes the lead in the field Stefan Pletschacher 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:36.819
 is in third place 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.069
 in the second round, however, none advance to second place 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.829
 That means another five points for the German team 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.409
 Germany is second in the team world championship 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.829
 oro statements are also going to expound back on door handles so if 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.539
 she instead became thus solo private rooms 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.859
 and only but also as head of the us-sports graber if so far 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.189
 draw drawn children to their side 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.739
 For Florian Fürst from Wasserburg am Inn it was a premiere for him 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.519
 has been sponsoring Speedway for two years and has been in second place at the 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.629
 German championship 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.860
 nachnominiert for the World Cup 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.659
 of course I'm there anyway since they are there 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.659
 that it will then be the most important thing for the mothers 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.979
 that was super audience disgusting 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.120
 yes because of the 4th 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.780
 is good also for the drivers from Russia is they won the 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.490
 World Cup before the second from Austria
