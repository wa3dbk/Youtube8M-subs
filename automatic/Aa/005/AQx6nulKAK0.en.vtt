thinner<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.989> mean<00:02:53.199> this<00:02:53.349> is<00:02:53.469> already<00:02:53.650> pretty

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
thinner I mean this is already pretty

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.300 
thinner I mean this is already pretty
thin<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.409> and<00:02:56.409> I<00:02:56.500> believe<00:02:56.530> it's<00:02:57.069> going<00:02:57.159> to<00:02:57.219> be

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
thin and and I believe it's going to be

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.819 
thin and and I believe it's going to be
some<00:02:57.519> price<00:02:57.699> reductions<00:02:58.239> as<00:02:58.389> well<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.709> this
