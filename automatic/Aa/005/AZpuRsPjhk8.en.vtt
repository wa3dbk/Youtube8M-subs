 this creation there will be a master of the 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.590
 veil 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:49.909
 a pretty pink gingham fabric one 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.769
 needle the mini flowers in fabrics and 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:56.149
 skull beads a scream comes from 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:01:01.129
 sewing the felt an object 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.589
 cylindrical enough wide of the glue a 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.820
 styling clamp a stapler that 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.420
 I forgot to film you and to finish 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.420
 a hair clip 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.000
 to start you go surrounded your 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.640
 head with the veil join the two 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.450
 sides together is added in cm and then 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.450
 you will cut 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.100
 and 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.730
 we 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.730
 1 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:44.030
 once that's done cutting the sides of the 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:45.020
 high diagonally do not bother 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.039
 cut the corners so 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.689
 rough 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.189
 we see what this gives the length 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:54.679
 is equal to the leading round plus one 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:56.569
 centimeter and width 22 cm take a 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:06.619
 meter twenty of yarn you go doubled 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:08.060
 and add a needle made of only for 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.160
 start you go inserted referrals 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.910
 in the first little square that links to 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.910
 between two diamonds 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.250
 with needle you went below 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.660
 of the small square shoot continue from there 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.310
 pass over the next square draw 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.010
 and did the same thing all the way past 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:41.320
 below or above or below 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:42.940
 on it and farting operation all the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.890
 along the right arm to the left 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.890
 powder-free on the bottom 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.030
 to finish with the sewing I 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.550
 passed the thread in the last little 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.720
 square without pulling on the wire 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.720
 to darken the veil 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.770
 be careful do not think completely 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.960
 left a space between the two sides 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:14.570
 so the same if it does not show in 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:16.310
 video makes a man of your object 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.350
 cylindrical traced a good on the homeland 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.200
 for you and to use a pencil to 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.700
 seam flap the side a flyer that goes 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.060
 allow you to cut two points in 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.060
 same time 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.360
 2 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.120
 put the sail is on the round in 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.710
 felt and what is the part 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.800
 superior with a forceps 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:51.010
 folds stapled the right and left side of 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.900
 the sail is sure the felt add 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.370
 a good dose of glue so here 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.830
 I use the ASUS but I advise you 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.980
 the 6000 that will make it more efficient for 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.920
 this project the glue and the second of 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.390
 felt over you will put 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.040
 pliers all around for the glue 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.100
 adheres perfectly let dry at 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.410
 at least an hour away at the party the 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.640
 more funky the decoration paste the 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.850
 elements you want on the fault 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.080
 remy and here is the result so if you 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.730
 ask what is at the center 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.910
 us dollar it's just a pearl head of 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.910
 death 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.830
 Yes 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.659
 it's very simple the veil arises as 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.280
 a simple look and to adjust it 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.830
 face first a hair clip 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.419
 you can put it on both sides and 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.500
 tonight I decided to wear it with 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.330
 a braid I hope this tutorial has you 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.729
 more and if I have any advice to give you 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.729
