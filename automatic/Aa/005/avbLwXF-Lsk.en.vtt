00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
AC and the power steering I didn't have

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.510 
AC and the power steering I didn't have
to<00:00:21.000> disconnect<00:00:21.510> anything<00:00:21.950> just<00:00:22.950> lead<00:00:23.190> it<00:00:23.370> all

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
to disconnect anything just lead it all

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.300 
to disconnect anything just lead it all
to<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> side<00:00:26.840> so<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:27.869> don't<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.950> recharge

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
to the side so I don't have to recharge

to the side so I don't have to recharge
my<00:00:29.400> C<00:00:30.050> refill<00:00:31.050> my<00:00:31.260> power<00:00:31.470> steering<00:00:31.949> or<00:00:32.070> any<00:00:32.250> of

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
my C refill my power steering or any of

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.770 
my C refill my power steering or any of
that<00:00:33.170> it's<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.350> good<00:00:34.730> I<00:00:35.730> didn't<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.570> to

as<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.119> see<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.479> pretty<00:01:48.630> bad<00:01:48.930> right

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
as you can see it's pretty bad right

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.889 
as you can see it's pretty bad right
through<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.070> oil<00:01:50.100> pan<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:51.060> little<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:51.810> of

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
through the oil pan and a little bit of

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.249 
through the oil pan and a little bit of
the<00:01:51.990> block<00:01:52.229> got<00:01:52.590> some<00:01:53.219> of<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.990> on<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.170> side

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.020 
the block got some of it on this side
there<00:01:58.259> should<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> little<00:01:59.189> hole<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.490> here

this side thank you find it but anyway
the<00:02:14.069> engines<00:02:14.430> out<00:02:17.150> there's<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.330> new<00:02:18.450> engine

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
the engines out there's the new engine

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.259 
the engines out there's the new engine
over<00:02:19.049> there<00:02:19.489> I'm<00:02:20.489> going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> reuse<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
over there I'm going to reuse the

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:30.490 
over there I'm going to reuse the
transmission<00:02:24.410> let's<00:02:25.410> go<00:02:25.590> take<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.829> look<00:02:25.920> at

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:40.160 

there's<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.739> train<00:02:33.440> for<00:02:34.440> our<00:02:34.769> 70<00:02:35.370> W<00:02:39.049> got<00:02:40.049> it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
there's the train for our 70 W got it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.130 
there's the train for our 70 W got it
all<00:02:40.319> out<00:02:41.390> disconnect<00:02:42.390> from<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.840> engine

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
there's the flex plate and the little

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.970 
there's the flex plate and the little
metal<00:02:45.959> plate<00:02:46.049> that<00:02:46.260> goes<00:02:46.380> in<00:02:46.560> between<00:02:46.860> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
metal plate that goes in between the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.190 
metal plate that goes in between the
engine<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.340> bell<00:02:47.760> housing<00:02:49.880> but<00:02:50.880> that's<00:02:51.090> that

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.270 

let's<00:02:55.200> go<00:02:55.319> take<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> look<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.010> torque

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
let's go take a look at the torque

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.809 
let's go take a look at the torque
converter<00:02:57.889> the<00:02:58.889> torque<00:02:59.220> converter<00:02:59.340> is

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
converter the torque converter is

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.460 
converter the torque converter is
massive<00:03:00.980> it's<00:03:01.980> huge

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
massive it's huge

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.610 
massive it's huge
there's<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.680> torque<00:03:04.950> converter<00:03:06.380> here's<00:03:07.380> my

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
there's the torque converter here's my

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.620 
there's the torque converter here's my
hand<00:03:07.980> by<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.750> it's<00:03:09.750> pretty<00:03:10.019> big<00:03:11.480> and<00:03:12.480> that

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
hand by it it's pretty big and that

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.360 
hand by it it's pretty big and that
wasn't<00:03:12.840> easy<00:03:13.139> to<00:03:13.440> unbolt<00:03:13.769> either

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
wasn't easy to unbolt either

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.080 
wasn't easy to unbolt either
there's<00:03:15.239> bolts<00:03:15.630> on<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.810> bottom<00:03:15.959> here<00:03:16.410> studs

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
there's bolts on the bottom here studs
