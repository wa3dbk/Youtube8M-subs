00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
with this particular tire here not only

with this particular tire here not only
did<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:00.879> fill<00:01:01.210> up<00:01:01.389> with<00:01:01.679> you<00:01:02.679> know<00:01:02.799> mud<00:01:03.100> and

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
did it fill up with you know mud and

dirt and carry that in my building but

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.830 
dirt and carry that in my building but
when<00:01:05.890> it<00:01:06.040> did<00:01:06.159> slip<00:01:06.520> which<00:01:06.909> was<00:01:07.150> on<00:01:07.299> every<00:01:07.600> turn

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
when it did slip which was on every turn

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.310 
when it did slip which was on every turn
I'd<00:01:08.530> end<00:01:08.799> up<00:01:08.950> with<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.430> 12<00:01:09.969> inch<00:01:10.149> wide<00:01:10.390> by<00:01:10.750> 16

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
I'd end up with a 12 inch wide by 16

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.010 
I'd end up with a 12 inch wide by 16
inch<00:01:11.610> bare<00:01:12.610> spot<00:01:12.969> aground<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.600> grass<00:01:13.810> could

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
inch bare spot aground the grass could

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.990 
inch bare spot aground the grass could
pull<00:01:14.170> be<00:01:14.259> wiped<00:01:14.500> clean<00:01:14.649> that<00:01:15.610> take<00:01:15.789> a<00:01:15.820> long

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
pull be wiped clean that take a long

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.300 
pull be wiped clean that take a long
time<00:01:16.270> for<00:01:16.329> that<00:01:16.600> patch<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.840> heal<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
time for that patch to heal the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.999 
time for that patch to heal the
Chevron's<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:22.229> rounded<00:01:23.229> at<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:23.680> edge

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
Chevron's are rounded at the edge

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.190 
Chevron's are rounded at the edge
they're<00:01:24.340> not<00:01:24.460> like<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.670> lot<00:01:24.909> of<00:01:25.030> ATV<00:01:25.539> tires<00:01:25.840> and

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
they're not like a lot of ATV tires and

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.349 
they're not like a lot of ATV tires and
the<00:01:27.070> reason<00:01:27.369> they<00:01:27.460> have<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.789> that<00:01:27.939> way<00:01:28.149> is<00:01:28.329> to

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
the reason they have it that way is to

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.389 
the reason they have it that way is to
minimize<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.289> amount<00:01:29.439> of<00:01:29.560> turf<00:01:29.770> damage<00:01:30.039> on

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
minimize the amount of turf damage on

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.760 
minimize the amount of turf damage on
the<00:01:30.609> turns<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:31.930> when<00:01:32.079> you<00:01:32.200> do<00:01:32.320> have<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.590> little

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
the turns now when you do have a little

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.620 
the turns now when you do have a little
bit<00:01:32.859> of<00:01:33.009> turf<00:01:33.189> damage<00:01:33.429> on<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.820> turns<00:01:34.090> with

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
bit of turf damage on the turns with

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.020 
bit of turf damage on the turns with
these<00:01:34.780> Chevron's<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:36.130> just<00:01:36.310> kind<00:01:36.490> of<00:01:36.549> picks<00:01:36.789> up

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
these Chevron's it just kind of picks up

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.690 
these Chevron's it just kind of picks up
you<00:01:37.689> know<00:01:37.780> some<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.109> the<00:01:38.170> turf<00:01:38.409> in<00:01:39.219> kind<00:01:39.549> of<00:01:39.609> a

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
you know some of the turf in kind of a

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.969 
you know some of the turf in kind of a
line<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.689> really<00:01:40.869> kind<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.229> falls<00:01:41.469> back<00:01:41.770> by

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
line that really kind of falls back by

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.190 
line that really kind of falls back by
itself<00:01:42.250> most<00:01:42.549> of<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.789> time<00:01:43.030> I've<00:01:43.299> had<00:01:43.750> a<00:01:43.810> lot

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
itself most of the time I've had a lot

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.709 
itself most of the time I've had a lot

it<00:03:53.600> just<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.870> little<00:03:53.989> bit<00:03:54.140> iffy<00:03:54.590> especially

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
it just a little bit iffy especially

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.280 
it just a little bit iffy especially
when<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.250> get<00:03:55.370> close<00:03:55.580> to<00:03:55.610> the<00:03:55.880> trees<00:03:56.209> now<00:03:57.080> with

these 80 101 s with it with the Chevron

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.130 
these 80 101 s with it with the Chevron

a<00:04:03.170> non<00:04:03.560> directional<00:04:03.920> pattern<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:05.090> get<00:04:05.480> an

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
a non directional pattern you get an

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.720 
a non directional pattern you get an
even<00:04:05.900> distribution<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.920> traction<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:07.580> that

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
even distribution of traction so that

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.759 
even distribution of traction so that
you<00:04:07.880> can<00:04:08.060> back<00:04:08.420> up<00:04:08.660> either<00:04:08.840> way<00:04:09.110> you're<00:04:09.590> less

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
you can back up either way you're less

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.530 
you can back up either way you're less
likely<00:04:09.799> to<00:04:10.310> kind<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:10.820> slide<00:04:11.090> down<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.510> hill

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
likely to kind of slide down the hill

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.539 
likely to kind of slide down the hill
and<00:04:12.140> if<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.350> do<00:04:12.530> need<00:04:12.769> to<00:04:13.040> make<00:04:13.370> some

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
and if you do need to make some

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:14.860 
and if you do need to make some
adjustment<00:04:14.030> in<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.150> steering<00:04:14.570> you've

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
adjustment in the steering you've

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.110 
adjustment in the steering you've
actually<00:04:15.019> up<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.320> traction<00:04:15.709> to<00:04:15.769> do<00:04:15.920> it<00:04:16.120> let's

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
actually up the traction to do it let's

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.849 
actually up the traction to do it let's
take<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.330> look<00:04:17.630> and<00:04:17.840> hopefully<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:18.500> can<00:04:18.620> kind

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
take a look and hopefully you can kind

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.620 
take a look and hopefully you can kind
of<00:04:18.950> get<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.280> feel<00:04:19.519> on<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.760> video<00:04:20.060> for<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.510> real

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
of get a feel on the video for the real

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.969 
of get a feel on the video for the real
advantage<00:04:21.080> that<00:04:21.200> you<00:04:21.229> do<00:04:21.440> get<00:04:21.680> with<00:04:21.799> these

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
advantage that you do get with these

00:04:21.979 --> 00:05:04.480 
advantage that you do get with these
tires

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.679 

now<00:05:05.490> what<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:05.729> just<00:05:05.759> saw<00:05:06.060> me<00:05:06.240> do<00:05:06.360> with<00:05:06.539> these

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:06.689 
now what you just saw me do with these

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:07.399 
now what you just saw me do with these
8101

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
8101

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:08.719 
8101
I<00:05:07.620> don't<00:05:07.800> recommend<00:05:08.039> you<00:05:08.250> try<00:05:08.460> it<00:05:08.490> with<00:05:08.639> the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
I don't recommend you try it with the

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.939 
I don't recommend you try it with the
standard<00:05:08.939> turf<00:05:09.300> tires<00:05:09.569> because<00:05:10.319> I<00:05:10.469> have<00:05:10.710> had<00:05:10.919> a

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
standard turf tires because I have had a

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.429 
standard turf tires because I have had a
couple<00:05:11.159> instances<00:05:11.400> as<00:05:11.759> well<00:05:12.080> kind<00:05:13.080> of<00:05:13.199> slid

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:13.439 
couple instances as well kind of slid

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:14.990 
couple instances as well kind of slid
into<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.680> trees<00:05:13.949> just<00:05:14.219> a<00:05:14.370> little<00:05:14.610> bit<00:05:14.789> and

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
into the trees just a little bit and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.429 
into the trees just a little bit and
these<00:05:15.360> one-on-ones<00:05:15.870> made<00:05:16.139> the<00:05:16.259> big

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:16.439 
these one-on-ones made the big

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.469 
these one-on-ones made the big
difference<00:05:16.949> and<00:05:17.099> as<00:05:17.669> you<00:05:17.789> notice<00:05:18.090> when<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.330> got

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
difference and as you notice when I got

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.089 
difference and as you notice when I got
to<00:05:18.629> the<00:05:18.719> ends<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.050> turned<00:05:19.229> around<00:05:19.349> or<00:05:19.800> when<00:05:20.069> I

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
to the ends and turned around or when I

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.040 
to the ends and turned around or when I
try<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.430> actually<00:05:20.879> pull<00:05:21.479> straight<00:05:21.810> back<00:05:22.020> up

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
try to actually pull straight back up

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.929 
try to actually pull straight back up
the<00:05:22.409> hill<00:05:22.560> backing<00:05:23.280> straight<00:05:23.520> up<00:05:23.639> the<00:05:23.759> hill

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 
the hill backing straight up the hill

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:26.570 
the hill backing straight up the hill
there<00:05:24.780> was<00:05:24.840> a<00:05:24.960> little<00:05:25.259> bit<00:05:25.469> of<00:05:25.590> slippage<00:05:25.979> not

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
there was a little bit of slippage not

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.909 
there was a little bit of slippage not
quite<00:05:26.819> 100%<00:05:27.180> control<00:05:27.780> but<00:05:28.229> I<00:05:28.409> just<00:05:28.680> wouldn't

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
quite 100% control but I just wouldn't

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.320 
quite 100% control but I just wouldn't
have<00:05:29.009> even<00:05:29.099> had<00:05:29.310> a<00:05:29.340> chance<00:05:29.639> with<00:05:29.939> those<00:05:30.060> turf

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
have even had a chance with those turf

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.659 
have even had a chance with those turf
