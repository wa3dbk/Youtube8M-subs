00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.740 
normally put redstone dust we're going
to<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.560> putting<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.920> repeater<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.750> you're

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
to be putting a repeater and you're

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.749 
to be putting a repeater and you're
going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> skip<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> space<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.890> put<00:02:05.549> another

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
going to skip a space and put another

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.690 
going to skip a space and put another
repeater<00:02:06.149> facing<00:02:06.659> outward<00:02:07.250> except<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.429> one

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
repeater facing outward except this one

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.430 
repeater facing outward except this one
instead<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.209> no<00:02:09.390> delay<00:02:09.720> we're<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.289> put

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
instead of no delay we're going to put

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.090 
instead of no delay we're going to put
all<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> way<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.030> pull<00:02:12.030> delay

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
all the way to pull delay

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.590 
all the way to pull delay
and<00:02:14.100> we're<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.430> place<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.910> block<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.390> top

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and we're going to place a block on top

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.580 
and we're going to place a block on top
of<00:02:15.960> here<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:17.060> put<00:02:18.060> one<00:02:18.510> above<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.170> repeater

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
of here and put one above the repeater

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.030 
of here and put one above the repeater
and<00:02:20.360> get<00:02:21.360> rid<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.630> one<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.140> redstone

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
and get rid of that one and redstone

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.760 
and get rid of that one and redstone
dust<00:02:23.310> on<00:02:23.550> top<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.060> block<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.320> normal

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
dust on top of that block with a normal

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.300 
dust on top of that block with a normal
piston<00:02:26.280> pointing<00:02:26.790> down<00:02:27.180> towards<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.840> log

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
piston pointing down towards the log

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.240 
piston pointing down towards the log
here<00:02:29.310> we<00:02:29.400> go<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.940> that's<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:33.860> yeah<00:02:34.860> get

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
here we go and that's it and yeah get

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.090 
here we go and that's it and yeah get
rid<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.520> that's<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.720> alright<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.680> now

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
rid of that that's it alright so now

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.010 
rid of that that's it alright so now
let's<00:02:39.060> put<00:02:39.240> some<00:02:39.450> beans<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:40.140> here<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:42.020> when

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
let's put some beans on here and when

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.110 
let's put some beans on here and when
you<00:02:43.110> do<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.740> do<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.820> keep<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.090> mind

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
you do this you do have to keep in mind

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.450 
you do this you do have to keep in mind
that<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.990> have<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.260> cocoa<00:02:47.070> beans<00:02:47.280> on

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
that you have to have the cocoa beans on

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.150 
that you have to have the cocoa beans on
every<00:02:47.820> log<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.450> work<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.010> there<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.040> go

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
every log for it to work so there you go

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.640 
every log for it to work so there you go
it's<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.940> little<00:02:51.240> bit<00:02:51.390> slower<00:02:51.780> than<00:02:52.020> before<00:02:52.200> so

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
it's a little bit slower than before so

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.960 
it's a little bit slower than before so
let's<00:02:53.040> go<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.250> there<00:02:53.460> and<00:02:53.580> mess<00:02:53.760> with<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
let's go up there and mess with the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.150 
let's go up there and mess with the
timing<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.450> little<00:02:54.480> bit<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.160> repeater

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
timing a little bit on that repeater

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.100 
timing a little bit on that repeater
here<00:02:56.780> go<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> three<00:03:00.830> nice<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.860> little<00:03:02.310> faster

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
here go to three nice a little faster

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:11.750 
here go to three nice a little faster
now<00:03:04.110> let's<00:03:04.410> go<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.710> two<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.950> there<00:03:11.520> yeah

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
now let's go to two and there yeah

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.700 
now let's go to two and there yeah
that's<00:03:12.150> probably<00:03:12.570> about<00:03:12.900> as<00:03:13.050> fast<00:03:13.350> as<00:03:13.560> it'll

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
that's probably about as fast as it'll

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.500 
that's probably about as fast as it'll
get<00:03:13.920> without<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.370> getting<00:03:14.760> out<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.120> sync<00:03:15.390> so

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
get without it getting out of sync so

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.180 
get without it getting out of sync so
that'll<00:03:18.510> work<00:03:18.660> that's<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.200> fix<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.860> so

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
that'll work that's the fix for it so

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.550 
that'll work that's the fix for it so
normally<00:03:21.120> what<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.840> would<00:03:22.080> do<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.470> would

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
normally what you would do is you would

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.780 
normally what you would do is you would
have<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:25.710> ground<00:03:26.010> here<00:03:26.310> all<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.550> hole

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
have the the ground here all this hole

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.440 
have the the ground here all this hole
covered<00:03:27.390> up<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.940> know<00:03:30.060> like<00:03:30.180> if<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.360> had

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
covered up and you know like if you had

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.880 
covered up and you know like if you had
this<00:03:30.600> outside<00:03:31.020> you'd<00:03:31.260> have<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.620> know<00:03:31.710> your

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
this outside you'd have you know your

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.320 
this outside you'd have you know your
grass<00:03:32.130> or<00:03:32.430> something<00:03:32.730> like<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.880> they're

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
grass or something like that they're

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.030 
grass or something like that they're
covering<00:03:33.930> all<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.200> up<00:03:34.380> except<00:03:34.680> for<00:03:34.710> the<00:03:34.860> one

amounts of cocoa beans I don't know why

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.340 
amounts of cocoa beans I don't know why
you<00:03:46.110> need<00:03:46.440> any<00:03:46.530> more<00:03:46.680> than<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.350> 24

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
you need any more than this this is 24

you need any more than this this is 24
cocoa<00:03:49.710> beans<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.280> yields<00:03:50.760> probably<00:03:51.330> about

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
cocoa beans and it yields probably about

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.450 
cocoa beans and it yields probably about
a<00:03:51.780> stack<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.620> half<00:03:52.830> when<00:03:53.100> it's<00:03:53.250> fully

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
a stack and a half when it's fully

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.210 
a stack and a half when it's fully
harvested<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.240> I<00:03:54.530> don't<00:03:55.530> really<00:03:55.620> see<00:03:55.980> why<00:03:56.010> you

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
harvested so I don't really see why you

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.870 
harvested so I don't really see why you
would<00:03:56.460> need<00:03:56.490> that<00:03:57.000> anymore<00:03:57.530> cocoa<00:03:58.530> beans<00:03:58.880> and

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
would need that anymore cocoa beans and

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.450 
would need that anymore cocoa beans and
sometimes<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.720> like<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.900> take<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.500> jungle

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
sometimes I like to take the jungle

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.940 
sometimes I like to take the jungle
leaves<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.060> place<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.720> around<00:04:03.810> all<00:04:04.380> the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
leaves and place it around all the

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.070 
leaves and place it around all the
Redstone<00:04:05.460> up<00:04:05.760> top<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.690> kind<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.900> hides

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
Redstone up top so that it kind of hides

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.540 
Redstone up top so that it kind of hides
it<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.590> actually<00:04:07.770> makes<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.190> look<00:04:08.340> like<00:04:08.490> a

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
it and it actually makes it look like a
