 I started small peak in the sense that 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.500
 however the first generation artists 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.689
 Italian pop so let's talk about the years 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.449
 80 82 so much for a fourth that I 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.059
 personally and 84 I was 14 years old and 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.950
 it happens like when you fall in love with 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.340
 woman observed life not 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.379
 program a group imagine 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.090
 unexpected and buemi when it happens you are 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.820
 both of these women are facts 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 others a casino seemed to be second 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.930
 so let's say you fell in love with 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.399
 this art that brought you to an end is yes 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.010
 because if the times were not all there 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.809
 these communities that today the dock 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570
 let's say the first from the whole network 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.699
 and it is mandatory to have a contact 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.739
 own physical with people and even i 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.750
 tests were very rare however 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.040
 concerns the hip hop in arguments 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.320
 general therefore also of rap music 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.409
 break dance writing what 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.790
 commonly called graffiti and therefore 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.650
 my first avenue in the sacred ones of which I am 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.590
 of the allow I see kind twenty years are 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.509
 the new york and I had the opportunity 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.560
 the great does not recognize the masters like this 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.420
 the very culture we have 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.110
 founded the foundation of the roots above all 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.490
 regarding writing and also rep 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.619
 but then there was a radical change 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.860
 that has upset the three thousand heads 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.930
 totally mine 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.820
 statistical and also as a person 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.950
 in 95 when he came into contact with the 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.480
 culture we canaccia practically 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.740
 they are of the American Mexican people who 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.630
 the united states of america 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.600
 let's learn about the under west coast tariff 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.479
 los angeles lists her to be exact and 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.630
 from 95 onwards a new saying is entered 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.160
 a new victory always speech at 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.110
 meanwhile in that marriage they are meanwhile 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.660
 couples must be in force 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.890
 our destiny have understood our sea 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.330
 he remarries the second time and that is 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.840
 It was like a second marriage for me 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.220
 95 with this mysterious woman and I have 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.100
 known this new type of this 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.260
 new to this new let's say part of the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.989
 bang culture and played from there 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.180
 practically 15 years I spent more time 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.540
 in los angeles that in milan than mine 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.170
 native city of origin and I am 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.340
 resumed making even music that a 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.830
 area that I had set aside for the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.380
 moment in 2006 I came out a 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.520
 they beat productions from the United States 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.170
 completely by one cross band 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.440
 Californian called symphonies 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.120
 you know how the arbus titled the sign 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.769
 our sign and it was the particular thing 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.420
 it was more than it was the first gold 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.070
 Italian is buried administered in 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.920
 america like ticking the big 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.540
 Italian where of course all mine 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.980
 songs interpreted in Italian e 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.320
 when the states live months 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.540
 they sang Italian and therefore for me 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.430
 this was another reason 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.560
 of pride and with the ed he had to say 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.209
 as I took from the culture of the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.739
 United States I also succeeded mine 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.200
 small give something so this is 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.820
 the CEO was the formula that has me 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.420
 allowed to go ahead all these 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.320
 years 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.239
 on the other side I want you then gave 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.850
 so much the united states is given so much in 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.049
 italy we are when the total of all 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.260
 your projects 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.880
 now the same going out this promotes me 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.170
 I'm working a lot with 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.850
 destinies paintings that practically 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.670
 date back to my last selection I have 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.710
 done in Milan that they heard the 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.370
 valley for mannerist ism in this 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.530
 definition 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.900
 I created that I am the new movement 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.490
 artistic seem practically current 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.740
 lettrismo even if a paratina you do not 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.690
 our grammar exists , however, it is a lot 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.700
 easy to stay at the root with yes 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.080
 paravia letters me the evolution of 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.060
 form the letters of which I am 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.440
 I am a mannerist because I was a mannerist 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.270
 the ancient term for which it is seen is said 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.959
 we say the exact same thing as us 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.640
 we are hip hop 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.920
 so when we say stylish it is 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.120
 practically stylish danger however use 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.840
 a word a little more the charge has 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.459
 reported a mannerism and I work a lot 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.530
 here recycled materials also because 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.570
 as in music and fundamental photo the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.420
 made to be from sony already 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.040
 pre-existing use of tools in 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.770
 actually they are not arcs to do 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.239
 music or how in writing that we 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.470
 we have created many say showcase 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.419
 this movement we have given 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.050
 an artistic movement he used 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.880
 a tool that in reality was not and 3 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.680
 place to make art but it is a tool 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.390
 of colas ascom displays are colored 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.280
 bikes at most washing machines of the 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.900
 grandmother understood and so this is one thing 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.330
 interesting so I said the same 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.160
 this we can write this in 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.300
 my art in my letters I created 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.880
 of buildings in three dimensions 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.229
 also can be said fourth dimensional 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.600
 that the fourth dimension dimension of the 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:47.570
 magic heart and suture with the heart then 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.979
 forgotten the previous three and that it 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.350
 the eminent then you have have 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.570
 examples these are letters 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.450
 carved on wood with assembly of 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.690
 pieces found from anywhere to find 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.280
 from lighters to springs to especially pieces 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.419
 played I like among whose players 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.640
 because they can remember a return to the 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.310
 time to time to themselves that this child 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.350
 it's a memory that I didn't have a lot of 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.270
 however, the way of book is always always 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.860
 stayed longer than me and transferred him 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.400
 in my art in that when there is 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.350
 square 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.330
 among other things he tells me about this 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.400
 represents a letter y 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.699
 it's one thing is a very important thing 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.770
 I'll explain why in 2010 I am 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.319
 was almost 2009 have been named 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.060
 from this very great a great master 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.590
 I mean to make themselves come yes 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.560
 practically an artist he founded 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.389
 the model is not the conception of 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.009
 writing of the art of letters and trademarks 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.240
 was a forefather as regards 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.330
 precisely the rap music 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.259
 unfortunately the masina died 2010 and died 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.830
 at the age of 50 years 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:51.740
 we go without young is but before that 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.449
 This happened, they love me 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.969
 last disciple have yes we have 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.699
 faced a kind of army 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:00.530
 positive of artists and based on 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:03.050
 alphabet of 26 and then Latin alphabet 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.330
 Roman and he represented the letter z 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.800
 final letter therefore we have and juan che 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.690
 not even looking for juan's unfortunately 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.729
 you look at everything else and me 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.979
 practically just to complete 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.849
 this wheel and it will be this cycle of 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.500
 destiny 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:17.210
 I was light then the ypsilon practically 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.389
 poet who father my name fi 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.789
 then he named me the defender of 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.370
 letter y in this elusive war 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:27.500
 always positive and proactive 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.479
 when TV war I mean war 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.360
 of style because it is immediately in hip hop 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:35.029
 this is very important, let's say this 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.310
 of the competition, however, that 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.930
 no positive competition attracts and 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.490
 then energies of each of us must not 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.770
 lead to unfortunately many violence 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.599
 sometimes you hear episodes of these 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.060
 these facts happen a lot 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.529
 regrettable sad but these things here 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.870
 I'm from Italy and I'm at it 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:54.469
 point do something else and how to say 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.849
 I take the vows and then go to amaze the 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.310
 children understand masses more instincts 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:01.039
 sure big 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.440
 listening to a last question like never 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.629
 you feel like archives I feel at the camp 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.600
 because already done that you are 24 grams 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:10.420
 miu miu bunker here my group 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.130
 reflecting few people come here nothing 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.160
 I do come in then maybe it doesn't come out 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.160
 more 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:26.650
 and then I this subject which is not that 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:28.360
 then good and bad to tell me this 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.060
 the point remains only for those named 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:34.210
 knights big hard candy knights 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.050
 psi with a hello guys from candy and da 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:39.480
