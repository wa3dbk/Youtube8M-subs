three<00:00:25.669> to<00:00:25.789> six<00:00:26.089> look<00:00:26.300> for<00:00:26.509> a<00:00:26.539> target<00:00:26.779> number

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
three to six look for a target number

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.109 
three to six look for a target number
it's<00:00:27.289> pretty<00:00:27.499> straightforward<00:00:27.819> works<00:00:28.819> very

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
it's pretty straightforward works very

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.749 
it's pretty straightforward works very
nicely<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:30.289> engine<00:00:30.980> for<00:00:31.159> this<00:00:31.279> though<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:31.489> not

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
nicely the engine for this though is not

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:33.910 
nicely the engine for this though is not
really<00:00:32.149> what<00:00:32.270> makes<00:00:32.480> Lightspeed<00:00:33.020> cool<00:00:33.290> what

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
really what makes Lightspeed cool what

really what makes Lightspeed cool what
makes<00:00:34.220> Lightspeed<00:00:34.850> need<00:00:35.180> is<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.690> don't<00:00:36.380> know

this<00:00:36.680> for<00:00:36.890> sure<00:00:36.920> but<00:00:37.220> personally<00:00:37.640> I<00:00:37.670> think

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
this for sure but personally I think

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.340 
this for sure but personally I think

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.770 
like the that's the race that are the
Vulcans<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.430> are<00:02:01.549> that<00:02:01.850> are<00:02:01.909> just<00:02:02.330> sort<00:02:02.659> of

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
Vulcans that are that are just sort of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.300 
Vulcans that are that are just sort of
different<00:02:03.320> their<00:02:03.500> skin<00:02:03.770> colors<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.159> little

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
different their skin colors a little

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.609 
different their skin colors a little
different<00:02:04.729> that's<00:02:04.880> mainly<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.420> thing<00:02:05.720> but

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
different that's mainly the thing but

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.469 
different that's mainly the thing but
they're<00:02:06.770> still<00:02:06.860> logically<00:02:07.400> driven<00:02:07.820> there's

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
they're still logically driven there's

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.260 
they're still logically driven there's
it<00:02:09.439> brings<00:02:09.979> in<00:02:10.159> a<00:02:10.280> certain<00:02:10.580> amount<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.819> anime

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
it brings in a certain amount of anime

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.880 
it brings in a certain amount of anime
that<00:02:11.450> I'm<00:02:11.569> not<00:02:11.750> terribly<00:02:12.140> comfortable<00:02:12.410> with

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
that I'm not terribly comfortable with

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.780 
that I'm not terribly comfortable with
but<00:02:13.130> it's<00:02:13.310> very

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
but it's very

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.220 
but it's very
easily<00:02:14.030> removed<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.540> that's<00:02:14.689> another<00:02:14.989> thing

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
easily removed and that's another thing

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.869 
easily removed and that's another thing
about<00:02:15.379> this<00:02:15.709> that's<00:02:15.890> nice<00:02:16.129> is<00:02:16.370> it's<00:02:16.819> very

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
about this that's nice is it's very

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.940 
about this that's nice is it's very
thing<00:02:17.569> you<00:02:17.659> don't<00:02:17.780> like<00:02:17.989> is<00:02:18.200> very<00:02:18.709> easily

thing you don't like is very easily

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.920 
thing you don't like is very easily
removed<00:02:19.459> like<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.849> want<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.090> play<00:02:20.239> just

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
you get but the harder it is to get out

whole role-playing game that lets you

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.740

that you normally wouldn't get to see it

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.420 
that you normally wouldn't get to see it
gives<00:02:53.329> you<00:02:53.510> sort<00:02:53.810> of<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.530> want<00:02:55.129> to<00:02:55.189> say<00:02:55.280> it's<00:02:55.370> a

gives you sort of a I want to say it's a

gives you sort of a I want to say it's a
predetermined<00:02:56.090> campaign<00:02:56.510> style<00:02:56.930> but<00:02:57.500> what<00:02:57.680> it

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
predetermined campaign style but what it

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.589 
predetermined campaign style but what it
is<00:02:57.799> is<00:02:57.919> it<00:02:58.129> sort<00:02:58.400> of<00:02:58.459> supposed<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.299> are

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
is is it sort of supposed that you are

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.319 
is is it sort of supposed that you are
Astro<00:03:00.530> Paul<00:03:00.799> Rangers<00:03:01.340> which<00:03:01.609> are<00:03:01.790> essentially

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
Astro Paul Rangers which are essentially

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.069 
Astro Paul Rangers which are essentially
cops<00:03:02.959> for<00:03:03.590> Star<00:03:04.159> Trek<00:03:04.269> it's<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.450> genre<00:03:05.629> that

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
cops for Star Trek it's a genre that

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.020 
cops for Star Trek it's a genre that
really<00:03:06.620> hasn't<00:03:06.889> been<00:03:07.069> explored<00:03:07.519> all<00:03:07.849> that

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
really hasn't been explored all that

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.849 
really hasn't been explored all that
much<00:03:08.239> except<00:03:08.659> for<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.840> couple<00:03:08.900> minor<00:03:09.409> attempts

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
much except for a couple minor attempts

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.949 
much except for a couple minor attempts
like<00:03:10.010> I<00:03:10.159> think<00:03:10.370> space<00:03:10.700> Rangers<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.750> more<00:03:11.930> of

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
like I think space Rangers the more of

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.479 
like I think space Rangers the more of
us<00:03:12.019> they<00:03:12.139> can<00:03:12.260> forget<00:03:12.439> about<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:13.310> better

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
us they can forget about that the better

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.849 
us they can forget about that the better
that<00:03:13.939> short-lived<00:03:14.419> TV<00:03:14.629> series<00:03:14.810> anyway<00:03:15.590> don't

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
that short-lived TV series anyway don't

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.309 
that short-lived TV series anyway don't
go<00:03:16.340> near<00:03:16.519> it<00:03:16.549> Jason<00:03:17.389> Star<00:03:17.659> Command<00:03:17.930> is<00:03:18.109> really

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
go near it Jason Star Command is really

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.689 
go near it Jason Star Command is really
the<00:03:18.409> next<00:03:18.590> one<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:18.919> comes<00:03:18.979> to<00:03:19.190> mind<00:03:19.400> for<00:03:19.639> me

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
the next one that comes to mind for me

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.960 
the next one that comes to mind for me
where<00:03:20.329> you're<00:03:20.479> essentially<00:03:21.019> space<00:03:21.260> cops<00:03:21.530> and

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
where you're essentially space cops and

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.640 
where you're essentially space cops and
sort<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.150> go<00:03:23.299> around<00:03:23.419> you<00:03:23.810> solve<00:03:24.049> crimes<00:03:24.409> I

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
sort of you go around you solve crimes I

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.319 
sort of you go around you solve crimes I
initially<00:03:25.099> described<00:03:25.459> as<00:03:25.609> law<00:03:25.819> and<00:03:25.970> order<00:03:26.209> in

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
initially described as law and order in

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.349 
initially described as law and order in
space<00:03:26.720> but<00:03:27.500> really<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.280> allows<00:03:28.849> you<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.180> go

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
space but really it allows you to go

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.390 
space but really it allows you to go
into<00:03:29.540> all<00:03:29.750> these<00:03:29.930> different<00:03:30.199> sectors<00:03:30.829> it

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
into all these different sectors it

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.229 
into all these different sectors it
really<00:03:31.819> encourages<00:03:32.419> you<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:34.030> think<00:03:35.030> about

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
really encourages you to think about

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.780 
really encourages you to think about
just<00:03:35.720> any<00:03:36.019> sci-fi<00:03:36.379> you<00:03:36.620> want<00:03:36.949> to<00:03:37.040> do<00:03:37.190> it's<00:03:37.459> in

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
just any sci-fi you want to do it's in

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.629 
just any sci-fi you want to do it's in
here<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.449> engine<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:38.989> easy<00:03:39.229> it's<00:03:39.590> easy<00:03:40.129> to<00:03:40.400> set

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
here the engine is easy it's easy to set
