00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to me so how I know is it's made of some

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.490

sort<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.710> metal<00:00:31.949> alloy<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:33.140> what's<00:00:34.140> really

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
sort of metal alloy and what's really

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.220 
sort of metal alloy and what's really
great<00:00:34.890> about<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.120> fact<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.630> if<00:00:37.140> you

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
great about it is the fact that if you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.110 
great about it is the fact that if you
look<00:00:37.350> at<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> hinges<00:00:37.770> right<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.340> they're

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
look at the hinges right here they're

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.569 
look at the hinges right here they're
made<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.899> titanium<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> put

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
made out of this titanium so when I put

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.680 
made out of this titanium so when I put
them<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:43.190> they<00:00:44.190> stay<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.450> know<00:00:45.539> they

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
them on they stay like you know they

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.770 
them on they stay like you know they
think<00:00:45.989> actually<00:00:46.379> flex<00:00:46.890> out<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.640> my<00:00:47.879> face<00:00:48.239> it's

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
think actually flex out to my face it's

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
think actually flex out to my face it's
my<00:00:48.899> chunky<00:00:49.289> face<00:00:49.770> here<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:50.879> when<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.000> take

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
my chunky face here but then when I take

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.810 
my chunky face here but then when I take
them<00:00:51.360> off<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:52.170> titanium<00:00:52.649> doesn't<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.520> bent

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
them off like titanium doesn't get bent

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.400 
them off like titanium doesn't get bent
out<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.000> shape<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.539> kind<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.780> stays<00:00:55.140> where

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
out of shape so it kind of stays where

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.189 
out of shape so it kind of stays where
it<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.800> actually<00:00:56.129> bends<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.789> not<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it is it actually bends at not at the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.680 
it is it actually bends at not at the
actual<00:00:58.350> hinge<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.940> hinge<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.570> not

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
actual hinge like the hinge here but not

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.869 
actual hinge like the hinge here but not
have<00:01:00.840> two<00:01:00.960> ears<00:01:01.199> them<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.309> separate

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
have two ears them but the separate

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.520 
have two ears them but the separate
hinge<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> stays<00:01:03.899> intact

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
hinge here so that it stays intact

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.380 
hinge here so that it stays intact
another<00:01:05.159> great<00:01:05.369> thing<00:01:05.430> about<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.939> sea<00:01:06.150> wire

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
another great thing about the sea wire

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.560 
another great thing about the sea wire
is<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.100> it's<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> slim<00:01:08.790> design<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.479> if

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
is that it's just a slim design so if

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.700 
is that it's just a slim design so if
you're<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.810> trying<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.110> look<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.770 
glasses this is really nice this is
actually<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> model<00:01:17.189> called<00:01:17.580> them<00:01:17.820> polished

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
actually a model called them polished

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
actually a model called them polished
black<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.280> polished

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
black so if you look at the polished

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.580 
black so if you look at the polished
black<00:01:21.180> color<00:01:22.130> with<00:01:23.130> black<00:01:24.259> iridium<00:01:25.259> polarized

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
black color with black iridium polarized

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.679 
black color with black iridium polarized
what<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.280> means<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.939> like<00:01:27.090> black

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
what that means this is just like black

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.929 
what that means this is just like black
with<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> iridium<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> shiny<00:01:29.490> coating

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
with the iridium so the shiny coating

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.569 
with the iridium so the shiny coating
and<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> polarized<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.920> which<00:01:32.159> means<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and it's a polarized one which means it

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.850 
and it's a polarized one which means it
just<00:01:32.610> blocks<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.150> glare<00:01:33.299> more<00:01:33.560> if<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> look

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
just blocks the glare more if you look

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.830 
just blocks the glare more if you look
at<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.220> another<00:01:35.460> model<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> same

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.170 
frame another thing that's kind of
interesting<00:01:48.750> about<00:01:49.170> hopefully<00:01:49.920> see<00:01:50.250> wires<00:01:50.520> is

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
interesting about hopefully see wires is

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.090 
interesting about hopefully see wires is
that<00:01:53.030> they<00:01:54.030> come<00:01:54.329> with<00:01:54.360> rubber<00:01:54.960> material<00:01:55.860> on

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100

the back and most oakley's if you look
they<00:02:00.479> don't<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.829> rubber<00:02:02.040> come<00:02:02.310> all<00:02:02.460> the

they don't have the rubber come all the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.130 
they don't have the rubber come all the
way<00:02:02.640> back<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:03.210> think<00:02:03.420> there's<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.750> cut<00:02:04.020> off

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
way back I think there's like a cut off

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.910 
way back I think there's like a cut off
piece<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.500> which<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.710> metal<00:02:05.070> again<00:02:05.340> or<00:02:05.579> what

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
piece here which is metal again or what

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.800 
piece here which is metal again or what
materialist<00:02:06.640> but<00:02:06.939> here<00:02:07.119> it<00:02:07.210> goes<00:02:07.330> all<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.630> way

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
materialist but here it goes all the way

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.940 
materialist but here it goes all the way
through<00:02:07.900> so<00:02:08.349> it's<00:02:08.440> kind<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:08.679> an<00:02:08.800> interesting

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
through so it's kind of an interesting

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.940 
through so it's kind of an interesting
kind<00:02:09.789> of<00:02:09.910> design<00:02:10.300> if<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.290> look<00:02:11.500> at<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.800> I'm

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
kind of design if you look at it I'm

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.650 
kind of design if you look at it I'm
just<00:02:12.040> gonna<00:02:12.160> let<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.370> look<00:02:12.790> at<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.030> on<00:02:13.239> me<00:02:13.480> for

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
just gonna let you look at it on me for

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.680 
just gonna let you look at it on me for
a<00:02:13.720> sec<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.220> head-on<00:02:15.849> look<00:02:18.690> right

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
a sec so this is the head-on look right

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.770 
a sec so this is the head-on look right
and<00:02:20.080> as<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.739> can<00:02:20.920> see<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.760> O's<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
and as you can see the O's have the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.270 
and as you can see the O's have the
different<00:02:23.140> color<00:02:23.319> I<00:02:23.440> really<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.069> blue

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
different color I really like the blue

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.340 
different color I really like the blue

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
oh here it's a slim design this way if

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.949 
oh here it's a slim design this way if
you<00:02:29.590> look<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:29.980> way<00:02:30.150> as<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.360> can<00:02:31.390> tell<00:02:31.720> it's

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
you look this way as you can tell it's

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.850 
you look this way as you can tell it's
kind<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.319> like<00:02:32.530> slightly<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.870> circular<00:02:35.410> it's

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
kind of like slightly it's circular it's

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.729 
kind of like slightly it's circular it's
not<00:02:36.540> completely<00:02:37.540> circular<00:02:38.230> it's<00:02:38.530> kind<00:02:38.709> of

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
not completely circular it's kind of

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.699 
not completely circular it's kind of
