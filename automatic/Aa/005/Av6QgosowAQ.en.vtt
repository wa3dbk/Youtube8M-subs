00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
to nibble into the roots so rather than

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.400

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.569 
especially pleased about our garlic crop
we<00:02:51.480> had<00:02:51.659> two<00:02:52.109> different<00:02:52.379> varieties<00:02:53.069> planted

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
we had two different varieties planted

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.839 
we had two different varieties planted
these<00:02:54.329> are<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:55.790> spring<00:02:56.790> planted<00:02:57.540> variety<00:02:58.530> and

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
these are the spring planted variety and

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.920 
these are the spring planted variety and
it<00:02:59.849> would<00:02:59.970> crop<00:03:00.150> there<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:01.049> look<00:03:01.709> at<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.220> lot

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
it would crop there but look at this lot

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.009 
it would crop there but look at this lot
this<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:05.000> variety<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.329> we<00:03:06.480> planted<00:03:06.780> in

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
this is the variety that we planted in

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.890 
this is the variety that we planted in

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.349 
November last year and we have had a
very<00:03:10.260> very<00:03:11.159> good<00:03:11.430> crop<00:03:11.700> after<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:14.359> I'll

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.650 
show you a bit later on bed to where we
planted<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:21.569> courgettes<00:03:23.359> this<00:03:24.359> is<00:03:24.510> what

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
we're getting now we didn't spot this

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.439 
we're getting now we didn't spot this
one<00:03:26.819> because<00:03:27.829> as<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:28.980> will<00:03:29.099> see<00:03:29.250> later<00:03:29.519> we

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
one because as you will see later we

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.559 
one because as you will see later we
planted<00:03:30.840> nasturtiums<00:03:31.199> on<00:03:31.879> bed<00:03:32.879> too<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.359> well

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
planted nasturtiums on bed too as well

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.500

as<00:03:33.629> a<00:03:34.260> food<00:03:34.500> crop<00:03:34.849> and<00:03:35.849> they've<00:03:36.150> just<00:03:36.180> taken

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
as a food crop and they've just taken

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.750 
as a food crop and they've just taken
over<00:03:36.959> they've<00:03:37.500> smothered<00:03:37.919> everything<00:03:38.310> but

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
over they've smothered everything but

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.210 
over they've smothered everything but
the<00:03:38.940> courgettes<00:03:39.840> which<00:03:40.500> we<00:03:40.650> also<00:03:40.769> planted

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
the courgettes which we also planted

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.250 
the courgettes which we also planted
there<00:03:41.400> we're<00:03:41.669> growing<00:03:41.930> underneath<00:03:42.930> the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
there we're growing underneath the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.589 
there we're growing underneath the
nasturtiums<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.159> suddenly<00:03:45.060> we<00:03:45.150> discovered

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
nasturtiums and suddenly we discovered

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.410 
nasturtiums and suddenly we discovered
we've<00:03:46.139> got<00:03:46.319> super-sized<00:03:48.229> courgettes

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
we've got super-sized courgettes

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.600 
we've got super-sized courgettes
suppose<00:03:50.690> it's<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:50.900> Meryl<00:03:51.200> now<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:51.770> finally

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
suppose it's a Meryl now and finally

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.610 
suppose it's a Meryl now and finally
what<00:03:52.790> we<00:03:52.849> picked<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.330> name<00:03:53.480> of<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.890> piece<00:03:56.620> and

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
what we picked the name of the piece and

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.670 
what we picked the name of the piece and
again<00:03:58.569> we'll<00:03:59.569> get<00:03:59.780> back<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.050> we'll<00:04:00.349> freeze

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
again we'll get back and we'll freeze

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.370 
again we'll get back and we'll freeze
these<00:04:01.450> when<00:04:02.450> we<00:04:02.569> get<00:04:02.690> back<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.140> house

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
these when we get back to the house

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.800 
these when we get back to the house
we've<00:04:04.130> only<00:04:04.280> picture<00:04:04.580> in<00:04:04.849> a<00:04:04.940> small<00:04:05.209> quantity

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
we've only picture in a small quantity

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.870 
we've only picture in a small quantity
today<00:04:06.110> because<00:04:06.500> lots<00:04:07.340> of<00:04:07.489> them<00:04:07.610> are<00:04:07.730> still

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
today because lots of them are still

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.760 
today because lots of them are still
growing<00:04:08.180> but<00:04:09.340> hopefully<00:04:10.340> soon<00:04:10.580> I'll<00:04:11.180> be

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
growing but hopefully soon I'll be

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.330 
growing but hopefully soon I'll be
another<00:04:12.770> good<00:04:12.920> crop<00:04:13.190> under<00:04:14.030> our<00:04:14.120> belt
