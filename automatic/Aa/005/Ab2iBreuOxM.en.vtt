00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.080
 rewrite the expression five times 9 -4 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.490
 which is enclosed in parentheses using 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.520
 distributive ownership of the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.830
 multiplication over subtraction and then 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:20.100
 simplify then just write 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:25.140
 This is going to be five times 9 -4 9 Nov 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.770
 - 49 - four well as well 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.039
 now if we want to use the property 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.289
 distributive 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.630
 you do not need you can only 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.450
 calculate 9 -4 and then multiply by 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.960
 five but must distribute 15 multiply 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:46.070
 the five by nine and 15 by the four then 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:48.950
 you get five times 9 - minus 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.190
 five times 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.200
 4 - five times four 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.480
 look, we only distribute the 5 and 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.489
 multiplied by nine times four 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.570
 in the first property video 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.790
 distributive 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.649
 we have an idea because it makes sense 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.249
 distribute the five because it is not 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.799
 Just x 9 and let's check it out. 

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:12.389
 reach the same result if you calculate 1 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.149
 9 -4 

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:22.439
 anyway what is this then five times 9 is 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:28.439
 45 then we have 45 - how much is five times 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:31.740
 20 is four 45-20 is equal to 25 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.909
 so here I used the property 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.490
 distributive 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.450
 if we did not want to use the property 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.639
 distributive but only calculate 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.569
 first what is in brackets 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:47.880
 we would have to five times how much it is 9 - 49 - 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:52.349
 49 - 45 I'll do with a color 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 different here is five times 9 -4 then 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:58.139
 is five times 55 25 and 25 then 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.090
 anyway we have the same answer 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:01.739
 this is the distributive property of 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.689
 multiplication over subtraction 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:06.029
 we usually refer to it only 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.709
 as distributive property this 

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:09.810
 means first to calculate what is 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.170
 within relatives and then multiply 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.170
 for five
