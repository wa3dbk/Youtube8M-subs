00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
in this video I'm going to continue the

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.740 
in this video I'm going to continue the
theme<00:00:17.800> from<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.250> previous<00:00:18.730> one<00:00:18.939> and<00:00:19.180> try<00:00:19.689> to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
theme from the previous one and try to

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.290 
theme from the previous one and try to
refine<00:00:20.200> the<00:00:20.410> photos<00:00:20.800> a<00:00:20.830> bit<00:00:21.130> more<00:00:21.340> especially

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
refine the photos a bit more especially

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.030 
refine the photos a bit more especially
in<00:00:22.390> terms<00:00:22.570> of<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:22.900> softness<00:00:23.380> of<00:00:23.529> the<00:00:23.590> lyre<00:00:23.860> and

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
in terms of the softness of the lyre and

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.909 
in terms of the softness of the lyre and
of<00:00:24.759> the<00:00:24.849> background<00:00:25.300> now<00:00:26.289> we've<00:00:26.619> got<00:00:26.800> the

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
of the background now we've got the

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.249 
of the background now we've got the
lovely<00:00:27.130> Hannah<00:00:27.550> here<00:00:27.849> with<00:00:28.240> us<00:00:28.360> today<00:00:28.539> as<00:00:28.869> our

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
lovely Hannah here with us today as our

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.200 
lovely Hannah here with us today as our
model<00:00:29.590> but<00:00:29.950> before<00:00:30.309> I<00:00:30.340> start<00:00:30.669> I'm<00:00:30.849> just<00:00:31.029> going

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
model but before I start I'm just going

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.609 
model but before I start I'm just going
to<00:00:31.329> take<00:00:31.509> a<00:00:31.540> couple<00:00:31.869> of<00:00:31.989> shots<00:00:32.259> of<00:00:32.380> Hannah

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
to take a couple of shots of Hannah

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.040 
to take a couple of shots of Hannah
using<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:33.640> same<00:00:33.910> kind<00:00:34.149> of<00:00:34.210> lighting<00:00:34.660> setup

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
using the same kind of lighting setup

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.260 
using the same kind of lighting setup
and<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.649> same<00:00:35.860> camera<00:00:36.340> and<00:00:36.550> flash<00:00:36.700> settings

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
and the same camera and flash settings

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.290 
and the same camera and flash settings
as<00:00:37.480> I<00:00:37.960> used<00:00:38.290> in<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:38.680> previous<00:00:39.040> video<00:00:39.340> so<00:00:39.579> let's

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
as I used in the previous video so let's

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.000 
as I used in the previous video so let's
do<00:00:40.480> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
do that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.139 
do that
so<00:00:42.010> I'm<00:00:42.070> just<00:00:42.280> trying<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:42.489> get<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:42.760> exposure

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
so I'm just trying to get the exposure

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.090 
so I'm just trying to get the exposure
sorted<00:00:43.600> out<00:00:43.719> now<00:00:43.989> set<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.290> camera<00:00:44.649> again<00:00:44.920> to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
sorted out now set the camera again to

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.880 
sorted out now set the camera again to
250th<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.850> second<00:00:46.239> f<00:00:46.600> 5.6<00:00:47.579> ISO<00:00:48.749> 200<00:00:49.749> but<00:00:50.710> I'll

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
250th of a second f 5.6 ISO 200 but I'll

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.680 
250th of a second f 5.6 ISO 200 but I'll
first<00:00:51.399> of<00:00:51.519> all<00:00:51.609> take<00:00:51.789> a<00:00:51.820> shot<00:00:52.120> with<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.480> flash

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
first of all take a shot with the flash

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.389 
first of all take a shot with the flash
turned<00:00:52.929> off<00:00:53.199> just<00:00:53.649> to<00:00:53.769> make<00:00:53.829> sure<00:00:53.949> there's<00:00:54.280> not

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
turned off just to make sure there's not

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.220 
turned off just to make sure there's not
too<00:00:54.609> much<00:00:54.760> ambient<00:00:55.149> light<00:00:55.449> getting<00:00:55.929> in<00:00:56.140> the

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
too much ambient light getting in the

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.500 
too much ambient light getting in the
shop<00:00:56.469> so<00:00:57.100> let's<00:00:57.249> try<00:00:57.460> not<00:01:00.149> flush<00:01:01.149> didn't<00:01:01.390> go

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
shop so let's try not flush didn't go

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.170 
shop so let's try not flush didn't go
off<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.890> not<00:01:03.069> completely<00:01:03.460> black<00:01:03.730> but<00:01:03.760> it<00:01:04.059> is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
off it's not completely black but it is

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.670 
off it's not completely black but it is
dark<00:01:04.449> enough<00:01:04.570> there's<00:01:04.989> hardly<00:01:05.229> any<00:01:05.409> light

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
dark enough there's hardly any light

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.710 
dark enough there's hardly any light
getting<00:01:06.070> on<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.520> getting<00:01:07.060> onto<00:01:07.240> Hannah<00:01:07.479> there

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
getting on to getting onto Hannah there

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.020 
getting on to getting onto Hannah there
so<00:01:08.260> let's<00:01:08.620> try<00:01:08.800> that<00:01:08.830> again<00:01:09.100> with<00:01:09.760> the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
so let's try that again with the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.080 
so let's try that again with the
flashlight<00:01:10.510> on<00:01:10.690> now<00:01:10.900> and<00:01:11.229> it's<00:01:11.590> set<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.090> flash

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
flashlight on now and it's set to flash

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:21.480 
flashlight on now and it's set to flash
power<00:01:13.420> is<00:01:13.750> set<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:15.360> 1/8<00:01:16.360> power<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.920> that's<00:01:21.399> a

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
power is set to 1/8 power and that's a

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.969 
power is set to 1/8 power and that's a
little<00:01:21.670> bit<00:01:21.790> underexposed<00:01:22.060> isn't<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.869> so<00:01:23.619> all

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
little bit underexposed isn't it so all

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.429 
little bit underexposed isn't it so all
I<00:01:24.130> have<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.340> do<00:01:24.520> is<00:01:24.790> up<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.450> power<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.380> the

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
I have to do is up the power of the

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.520 
I have to do is up the power of the
flash<00:01:26.680> it's<00:01:27.250> set<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.750> 1/8<00:01:28.750> at<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.020> moment<00:01:29.409> I'll

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
flash it's set to 1/8 at a moment I'll

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:38.370 
flash it's set to 1/8 at a moment I'll
set<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.770> to<00:01:29.890> quarter<00:01:30.340> power<00:01:37.110> let's<00:01:38.110> try<00:01:38.229> that

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
set it to quarter power let's try that

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.960 
set it to quarter power let's try that
again

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.160 

yeah<00:01:42.970> these<00:01:43.180> look<00:01:43.329> a<00:01:43.450> lot<00:01:43.570> better<00:01:43.689> now<00:01:43.960> that

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
yeah these look a lot better now that

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.609 
yeah these look a lot better now that
exposure<00:01:44.470> seems<00:01:44.799> about<00:01:45.009> right<00:01:46.470> here's<00:01:47.470> the

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
exposure seems about right here's the

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.380 
exposure seems about right here's the
first<00:01:47.799> shot<00:01:48.100> without<00:01:48.280> the<00:01:48.490> flash<00:01:48.759> just<00:01:49.299> to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
first shot without the flash just to

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.030 
first shot without the flash just to
show<00:01:49.630> that<00:01:49.659> there's<00:01:50.049> hardly<00:01:50.320> any<00:01:50.560> ambient

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
show that there's hardly any ambient

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.700 
show that there's hardly any ambient
light<00:01:51.340> in<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.670> image<00:01:51.939> if<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:53.110> room<00:01:53.350> if<00:01:53.560> the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
light in the image if the room if the

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.230 
light in the image if the room if the
room<00:01:53.890> you're<00:01:54.070> shooting<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.820> brighter<00:01:55.090> than

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
room you're shooting in is brighter than

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.850 
room you're shooting in is brighter than
this<00:01:55.420> one<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.659> you're<00:01:55.930> seeing<00:01:56.259> too<00:01:56.649> much

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
this one and you're seeing too much

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.969 
this one and you're seeing too much
ambient<00:01:57.340> light<00:01:57.670> then<00:01:58.420> try<00:01:58.810> lowering<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.530> ISO

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
ambient light then try lowering the ISO

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.880 
ambient light then try lowering the ISO
or<00:02:00.250> closing<00:02:00.729> down<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.000> aperture<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.420> little

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
or closing down the aperture a little

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.289 
or closing down the aperture a little
although<00:02:02.890> that<00:02:03.189> will<00:02:03.399> mean<00:02:03.670> your<00:02:03.820> Flash<00:02:04.119> is

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
although that will mean your Flash is

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.960 
although that will mean your Flash is
going<00:02:04.600> to<00:02:04.720> work<00:02:04.899> harder<00:02:05.439> so<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:06.429> set<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:06.789> I'm

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
going to work harder so the set is I'm

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.120 
going to work harder so the set is I'm
using<00:02:07.210> are<00:02:07.600> pretty<00:02:07.840> much<00:02:08.050> our<00:02:08.229> optimum<00:02:08.800> for

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
using are pretty much our optimum for

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.850 
using are pretty much our optimum for
this<00:02:09.340> amount<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.179> ambient<00:02:10.840> light<00:02:10.899> allowing

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
this amount of ambient light allowing

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.150 
this amount of ambient light allowing
the<00:02:12.069> flash<00:02:12.280> power<00:02:12.549> to<00:02:12.819> be<00:02:12.940> kept<00:02:13.150> quite<00:02:13.420> low

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
the flash power to be kept quite low

we<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.350> do<00:02:26.470> better<00:02:26.650> than<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.370> I'll<00:02:27.610> come

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
we can do better than this but I'll come

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.800 
we can do better than this but I'll come
back<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.239> in<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.420> minute

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
back to that in a minute

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.809 
back to that in a minute
to<00:02:29.590> start<00:02:29.830> off<00:02:29.980> with<00:02:30.160> I<00:02:30.280> want<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.489> make<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
to start off with I want to make the

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.430 
to start off with I want to make the
background<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.360> little<00:02:31.660> more<00:02:31.840> interesting

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
background a little more interesting

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.370 
background a little more interesting
maybe<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.250> little<00:02:33.459> moodier<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.209> in<00:02:34.930> order<00:02:35.260> to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
maybe a little moodier and in order to

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.080 
maybe a little moodier and in order to
do<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:35.920> have<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.280> take<00:02:36.430> control<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.880> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
do that I have to take control of the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.120 
do that I have to take control of the
background<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:38.260> what<00:02:38.530> do<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.739> mean<00:02:38.920> by<00:02:38.980> that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
background but what do I mean by that

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.910 
background but what do I mean by that
well<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.480> shots<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.959> just<00:02:40.989> took<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
well in the shots I just took the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.830 
well in the shots I just took the
background<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.670> kind<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.090> medium<00:02:43.540> gray

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
background is a kind of medium gray

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.470 
background is a kind of medium gray
maybe<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.829> bit<00:02:45.010> darker<00:02:45.459> but<00:02:46.030> when<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.269> think

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
maybe a bit darker but when you think

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.390 
maybe a bit darker but when you think
about<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.930> because<00:02:47.290> as<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:47.739> saw<00:02:48.070> we're

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
about it because as you just saw we're

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.280 
about it because as you just saw we're
not<00:02:48.549> allowing<00:02:48.850> in<00:02:49.180> any<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.720> ambient<00:02:50.109> light

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
not allowing in any of the ambient light

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.620 
not allowing in any of the ambient light
then<00:02:50.980> without<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.459> flash<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.209> background

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
then without the flash the background

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.840 
then without the flash the background
goes<00:02:52.840> very<00:02:53.049> dark<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:54.459> wouldn't<00:02:54.760> have

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
goes very dark and it wouldn't have

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.160 
goes very dark and it wouldn't have
mattered<00:02:55.000> even<00:02:55.420> if<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.810> was<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> white

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
mattered even if it was a white

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.380 
mattered even if it was a white
background<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:57.070> would<00:02:57.190> still<00:02:57.430> have<00:02:57.579> gone<00:02:57.820> very

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
background it would still have gone very

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.550 
background it would still have gone very
dark<00:02:58.750> if<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.049> hadn't<00:02:59.350> used<00:02:59.590> flash<00:03:01.350> what<00:03:02.350> that

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
dark if I hadn't used flash what that

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.380 
dark if I hadn't used flash what that
tells<00:03:02.829> us<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.489> some<00:03:03.730> of<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:04.000> light<00:03:04.209> from

tells us is that some of the light from

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.780 
tells us is that some of the light from
the<00:03:04.540> flash<00:03:04.780> hit<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.410> background<00:03:05.859> or<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.640> put

the flash hit the background or to put

the flash hit the background or to put
it<00:03:06.880> another<00:03:06.940> way<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.750> contaminated<00:03:08.620> the

it another way it contaminated the

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.729 
it another way it contaminated the
background<00:03:09.239> now<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.480> want<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.810> try<00:03:11.019> try<00:03:11.680> to

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
background now I want to try try to

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.199 
background now I want to try try to
avoid<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.459> light<00:03:12.640> from<00:03:12.850> hitting<00:03:13.030> the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
avoid the light from hitting the

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.030 
avoid the light from hitting the
background<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:13.870> will<00:03:14.319> allow<00:03:14.590> me<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.829> do

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
background and that will allow me to do

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.160 
background and that will allow me to do
other<00:03:15.190> things<00:03:15.310> with<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.790> but<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.690> don't<00:03:16.810> want<00:03:17.109> to

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
other things with it but I don't want to

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.970 
other things with it but I don't want to
get<00:03:17.290> ahead<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.530> myself<00:03:17.730> one<00:03:18.730> thing<00:03:18.970> at<00:03:19.120> a<00:03:19.180> time

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
get ahead of myself one thing at a time

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.440 
get ahead of myself one thing at a time
to<00:03:20.980> take<00:03:21.190> control<00:03:21.579> to<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.790> background<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.269> have

to take control to the background I have

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.970 
to take control to the background I have
to<00:03:22.569> protect<00:03:22.900> prevent<00:03:23.350> it<00:03:23.530> from<00:03:23.650> being

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.770 
to protect prevent it from being

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
contaminated by the light from the flash

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.289 
contaminated by the light from the flash
and<00:03:26.079> if<00:03:26.739> I<00:03:26.859> can<00:03:27.010> do<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.850> background

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
and if I can do that the background

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.720 
and if I can do that the background
should<00:03:28.450> go<00:03:28.630> darker<00:03:29.280> that's<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.459> kind<00:03:30.639> of

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
should go darker that's the kind of

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.910 
should go darker that's the kind of
starting<00:03:31.269> point<00:03:31.299> it<00:03:31.870> may<00:03:32.079> not<00:03:32.230> go<00:03:32.410> completely

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
starting point it may not go completely

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.180 
starting point it may not go completely
black<00:03:33.160> but<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.730> will<00:03:33.850> be<00:03:34.060> darker<00:03:34.540> but<00:03:35.130> how<00:03:36.130> can

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
black but it will be darker but how can

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.370 
black but it will be darker but how can
I<00:03:36.400> do<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:36.790> after<00:03:37.030> all<00:03:37.329> I<00:03:37.540> can't<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.170> lower

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
I do that after all I can't just lower

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.170 
I do that after all I can't just lower
the<00:03:38.620> flash<00:03:38.859> power<00:03:39.130> or<00:03:39.430> close<00:03:39.760> down<00:03:40.000> the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
the flash power or close down the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.180 
the flash power or close down the
aperture<00:03:40.389> sure<00:03:41.319> that<00:03:41.709> would<00:03:41.889> make<00:03:42.069> the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
aperture sure that would make the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.789 
aperture sure that would make the
background<00:03:42.400> darker<00:03:43.060> but<00:03:43.630> Hannah<00:03:44.049> would<00:03:44.560> go

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
background darker but Hannah would go

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.310 
background darker but Hannah would go
darker<00:03:45.400> too<00:03:45.579> should<00:03:46.329> be<00:03:46.450> underexposed

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
darker too should be underexposed

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.620

here's<00:03:53.760> what<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:53.970> can<00:03:54.209> do<00:03:54.890> first<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:56.100> all<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.430> can

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
here's what I can do first of all I can

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.490 
here's what I can do first of all I can
bring<00:03:56.790> Hannah<00:03:57.060> away<00:03:57.690> from<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.020> background<00:03:58.410> a

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
bring Hannah away from the background a

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.280 
bring Hannah away from the background a
few<00:03:58.680> feet<00:03:58.920> right<00:03:59.459> let's<00:03:59.670> try<00:03:59.760> that<00:04:00.000> Hannah<00:04:00.290> so

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
few feet right let's try that Hannah so

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.960 
few feet right let's try that Hannah so
let's<00:04:01.650> move<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.280> brow<00:04:02.640> here<00:04:03.500> fine<00:04:04.500> yep

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
let's move it to a brow here fine yep

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.160 
let's move it to a brow here fine yep
that's<00:04:05.970> pretty<00:04:06.180> obvious<00:04:06.330> really<00:04:06.720> isn't<00:04:07.110> it

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
that's pretty obvious really isn't it

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.480 
that's pretty obvious really isn't it
the<00:04:07.380> further<00:04:07.620> away<00:04:07.830> she<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.220> from<00:04:08.459> the

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
the further away she is from the

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.370 
the further away she is from the
background<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.360> darker<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:09.870> going<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.200> get

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
background the darker is going to get

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.220 
background the darker is going to get
due<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.160> light<00:04:11.370> fall-off<00:04:11.810> but<00:04:12.810> not<00:04:13.050> so

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
due to the light fall-off but not so

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.080 
due to the light fall-off but not so
obvious<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.830> bringing<00:04:14.370> bringing<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.880> light

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
obvious is bringing bringing the light

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.020 
obvious is bringing bringing the light
in<00:04:15.390> closer

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
in closer

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.570 
in closer
bring<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.180> really<00:04:18.359> close<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:22.250> know<00:04:23.250> that

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
bring it in really close I know that

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.460 
bring it in really close I know that
seems<00:04:23.820> counterintuitive<00:04:24.210> doesn't<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.080> but

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
seems counterintuitive doesn't it but

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.050 
seems counterintuitive doesn't it but
remember<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.010> inverse<00:04:26.340> square<00:04:26.520> inverse

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
remember the inverse square inverse

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.240 
remember the inverse square inverse
square<00:04:27.419> law<00:04:27.630> when<00:04:28.140> the<00:04:28.260> light<00:04:28.410> is<00:04:28.440> closer<00:04:28.860> it

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
square law when the light is closer it

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.430 
square law when the light is closer it
falls<00:04:29.610> off<00:04:29.820> quicker<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.480> look<00:04:30.900> how<00:04:30.990> close<00:04:31.260> it

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
falls off quicker and look how close it

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.830 
falls off quicker and look how close it
is<00:04:31.500> now<00:04:31.910> before<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.000> was<00:04:33.120> about<00:04:33.300> five<00:04:33.540> or<00:04:33.570> six

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
is now before it was about five or six

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.810 
is now before it was about five or six
feet<00:04:33.960> away<00:04:34.230> now<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:34.950> only<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.250> couple<00:04:35.430> of<00:04:35.669> feet

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
feet away now it's only a couple of feet

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.060 
feet away now it's only a couple of feet
away<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.930> light<00:04:37.140> is<00:04:37.320> going<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.620> fall<00:04:37.830> off

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
away so the light is going to fall off

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.890 
away so the light is going to fall off
to<00:04:38.520> practically<00:04:38.880> nothing<00:04:38.970> before<00:04:39.600> it<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
to practically nothing before it is the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.680 
to practically nothing before it is the
background<00:04:41.150> obviously<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.270> light<00:04:42.480> has

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
background obviously the light has

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.390 
background obviously the light has
become<00:04:43.020> more<00:04:43.200> powerful<00:04:43.440> because<00:04:44.010> flash<00:04:44.250> the

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
become more powerful because flash the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.550 
become more powerful because flash the
subject<00:04:44.820> distance<00:04:44.970> has<00:04:45.390> been<00:04:45.419> reduced<00:04:45.960> so<00:04:46.530> I

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
subject distance has been reduced so I

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.020 
subject distance has been reduced so I
have<00:04:46.890> to<00:04:47.040> reduce<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.550> flash<00:04:47.760> power

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
have to reduce the flash power

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.540 
have to reduce the flash power
accordingly<00:04:48.690> probably<00:04:49.650> by<00:04:49.860> stop<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.370> half

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
accordingly probably by stop and a half

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.120 
accordingly probably by stop and a half
maybe<00:04:51.180> a<00:04:51.540> couple<00:04:51.810> of<00:04:51.990> stops<00:04:52.229> let's<00:04:52.770> come<00:04:52.950> round

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
maybe a couple of stops let's come round

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.270 
maybe a couple of stops let's come round
here<00:04:53.510> get<00:04:54.510> out<00:04:54.630> of<00:04:54.660> way<00:04:54.780> but<00:04:55.770> not<00:04:55.919> only<00:04:56.130> that

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
here get out of way but not only that

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.070 
here get out of way but not only that
moving<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:56.850> light<00:04:57.030> in<00:04:57.180> closer<00:04:57.479> has<00:04:57.810> another

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
moving the light in closer has another

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.960 
moving the light in closer has another
great<00:04:58.410> advantage<00:04:58.740> it's<00:04:59.520> bigger

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
great advantage it's bigger

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.880 
great advantage it's bigger
well<00:05:00.690> it's<00:05:00.900> not<00:05:00.990> really<00:05:01.169> bigger<00:05:01.440> but<00:05:01.770> in

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
well it's not really bigger but in

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.710 
well it's not really bigger but in
relation<00:05:02.280> to<00:05:02.310> Hannah<00:05:02.640> its<00:05:02.970> bigger<00:05:03.180> which

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
relation to Hannah its bigger which

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.210 
relation to Hannah its bigger which
means<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.260> light<00:05:04.440> is<00:05:04.680> going<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.979> get

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
means that the light is going to get

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.180 
means that the light is going to get
softer<00:05:05.669> in<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.690> first<00:05:07.080> shots<00:05:07.410> I<00:05:07.590> took<00:05:07.650> the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
softer in the first shots I took the

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.340 
softer in the first shots I took the
light<00:05:08.460> was<00:05:08.700> several<00:05:09.030> feet<00:05:09.240> away<00:05:09.390> it<00:05:10.050> was<00:05:10.200> only

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
light was several feet away it was only

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.620 
light was several feet away it was only
a<00:05:10.440> moderately<00:05:10.979> soft<00:05:11.310> light<00:05:11.580> but<00:05:12.180> now<00:05:12.330> that<00:05:12.539> is

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
a moderately soft light but now that is

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.330 
a moderately soft light but now that is
closer<00:05:12.900> it<00:05:13.560> looks<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:13.830> lot<00:05:13.950> bigger

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
closer it looks a lot bigger

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.820 
closer it looks a lot bigger
does<00:05:14.880> this<00:05:15.000> look<00:05:15.180> big<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.450> you<00:05:15.600> what<00:05:16.169> it<00:05:16.350> really

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
does this look big to you what it really

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.010 
does this look big to you what it really
looks<00:05:17.220> really<00:05:17.490> big<00:05:17.669> there<00:05:17.850> doesn't<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.240> that's

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
looks really big there doesn't it that's

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.330 
looks really big there doesn't it that's
a<00:05:19.110> great<00:05:19.289> thing<00:05:19.470> about<00:05:19.500> this<00:05:19.830> shoe<00:05:20.039> the<00:05:20.310> shoe

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
a great thing about this shoe the shoe

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.860 
a great thing about this shoe the shoe
come<00:05:20.789> good<00:05:20.970> as<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.210> can<00:05:21.270> get<00:05:21.390> really<00:05:21.660> close

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
come good as you can get really close

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.200 
come good as you can get really close
with<00:05:22.530> no<00:05:22.710> danger<00:05:23.160> of<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.370> shaft<00:05:23.640> taking<00:05:24.060> out

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
with no danger of the shaft taking out

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.180 
with no danger of the shaft taking out
the<00:05:24.330> subject<00:05:24.720> eyeball<00:05:25.110> which<00:05:25.500> they<00:05:25.800> might<00:05:26.010> not

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
the subject eyeball which they might not

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.790 
the subject eyeball which they might not
appreciate<00:05:26.990> having<00:05:27.990> said<00:05:28.200> all<00:05:28.229> of<00:05:28.380> that<00:05:28.500> if

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
appreciate having said all of that if

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.409 
appreciate having said all of that if
you're<00:05:28.950> shooting<00:05:29.220> in<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:29.580> smaller<00:05:29.910> room<00:05:30.030> and

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
you're shooting in a smaller room and

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.150 
you're shooting in a smaller room and
there's<00:05:30.660> no<00:05:30.780> space<00:05:31.110> to<00:05:31.169> get<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:31.530> subject<00:05:31.830> away

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
there's no space to get the subject away

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.550 
there's no space to get the subject away
from<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.580> background<00:05:32.960> that<00:05:33.960> might<00:05:34.200> be<00:05:34.320> time

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
from the background that might be time

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.290 
from the background that might be time
to<00:05:34.740> use<00:05:34.890> a<00:05:34.919> reflective<00:05:35.580> umbrella<00:05:35.970> because

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
to use a reflective umbrella because

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.330 
to use a reflective umbrella because
there's<00:05:36.720> less<00:05:36.870> spill<00:05:37.169> of<00:05:37.289> the<00:05:37.380> light<00:05:37.590> onto<00:05:38.010> the

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
there's less spill of the light onto the

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.969 
there's less spill of the light onto the
background<00:05:38.850> and<00:05:39.060> if<00:05:40.020> that's<00:05:40.200> if<00:05:40.500> that<00:05:40.680> still

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
background and if that's if that still

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.380 
background and if that's if that still
produces<00:05:41.460> too<00:05:41.640> much<00:05:41.820> light<00:05:42.090> onto<00:05:42.300> the

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
produces too much light onto the

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.960 
produces too much light onto the
background<00:05:42.870> then<00:05:43.289> try<00:05:43.500> a<00:05:43.530> softbox<00:05:44.070> the<00:05:44.729> light

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
background then try a softbox the light

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.390 
background then try a softbox the light
is<00:05:45.120> far<00:05:45.360> more<00:05:45.600> directional<00:05:46.289> so<00:05:46.740> even<00:05:47.220> less

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
is far more directional so even less

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.940 
is far more directional so even less
light<00:05:47.640> is<00:05:47.789> going<00:05:47.970> to<00:05:48.090> fall<00:05:48.270> on<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.539> background

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
light is going to fall on the background

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.860 
light is going to fall on the background
but<00:05:49.950> for<00:05:50.160> simplicity<00:05:50.430> and<00:05:51.060> because<00:05:51.419> I've<00:05:51.630> got

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
but for simplicity and because I've got

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.840 
but for simplicity and because I've got
the<00:05:51.960> space<00:05:52.229> I'll<00:05:52.800> continue<00:05:53.220> with<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.610> shoot

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
the space I'll continue with the shoot

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.240 
the space I'll continue with the shoot
through<00:05:54.060> umbrella<00:05:54.710> so<00:05:55.710> let's<00:05:56.010> get<00:05:56.130> the

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
through umbrella so let's get the

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.060 
through umbrella so let's get the
exposure<00:05:56.520> sorted<00:05:57.000> up<00:05:57.150> and<00:05:57.360> we'll<00:05:57.630> get<00:05:57.780> going

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
exposure sorted up and we'll get going

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.440 
exposure sorted up and we'll get going
so<00:05:59.070> now<00:05:59.250> we've<00:05:59.400> got<00:05:59.550> the<00:05:59.669> umbrella<00:05:59.789> in<00:06:00.180> really

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
so now we've got the umbrella in really

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.899 
so now we've got the umbrella in really
close<00:06:00.750> I've<00:06:01.050> had<00:06:01.710> to<00:06:01.919> reduce<00:06:02.460> the<00:06:02.669> power<00:06:02.849> of

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
close I've had to reduce the power of

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.519 
close I've had to reduce the power of
the<00:06:03.180> flash<00:06:03.419> so<00:06:04.200> it's<00:06:04.530> now<00:06:04.800> on

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
the flash so it's now on

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:08.759 
the flash so it's now on
a<00:06:06.029> 16th<00:06:07.029> power<00:06:07.329> it<00:06:07.809> was<00:06:08.019> on<00:06:08.169> a<00:06:08.199> call<00:06:08.439> to<00:06:08.589> power

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:08.769 
a 16th power it was on a call to power

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:10.409 
a 16th power it was on a call to power
before<00:06:09.069> wasn't<00:06:09.369> it<00:06:09.429> I've<00:06:09.639> kept<00:06:09.969> the<00:06:10.089> camera

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
before wasn't it I've kept the camera

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.209 
before wasn't it I've kept the camera
settings<00:06:10.779> exactly<00:06:11.139> the<00:06:11.259> same<00:06:11.469> so<00:06:11.919> let's<00:06:12.129> see

00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:12.219 
settings exactly the same so let's see

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.949 
settings exactly the same so let's see
how<00:06:12.279> this<00:06:12.459> looks<00:06:15.119> I'm<00:06:16.119> just<00:06:16.389> looking<00:06:16.689> at<00:06:16.809> these

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:16.959 
how this looks I'm just looking at these

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:19.139 
how this looks I'm just looking at these
images<00:06:17.139> as<00:06:17.589> I<00:06:17.739> edit<00:06:18.009> a<00:06:18.099> video<00:06:18.249> I'm<00:06:18.819> really

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:19.149 
images as I edit a video I'm really

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:20.609 
images as I edit a video I'm really
pleased<00:06:19.359> with<00:06:19.539> them<00:06:19.689> bearing<00:06:20.199> in<00:06:20.319> mind<00:06:20.349> it's

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:20.619 
pleased with them bearing in mind it's

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:22.639 
pleased with them bearing in mind it's
just<00:06:20.859> one<00:06:21.039> light

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:22.649 
just one light

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:25.349 
just one light
yeah<00:06:23.649> the<00:06:23.769> background<00:06:24.159> has<00:06:24.369> gone<00:06:24.609> darker<00:06:25.059> and

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:25.359 
yeah the background has gone darker and

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:27.209 
yeah the background has gone darker and
that<00:06:25.569> means<00:06:25.839> we<00:06:26.049> can<00:06:26.229> now<00:06:26.349> start<00:06:26.409> to<00:06:26.739> do<00:06:26.949> things

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:27.219 
that means we can now start to do things

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.629 
that means we can now start to do things
with<00:06:27.339> it

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
with it

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.119 
with it
also<00:06:28.329> this<00:06:28.659> demonstrate<00:06:29.259> that<00:06:29.499> you<00:06:29.589> can<00:06:29.829> work

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:30.129 
also this demonstrate that you can work

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:32.599 
also this demonstrate that you can work
in<00:06:30.429> a<00:06:30.519> smallish<00:06:30.969> area<00:06:31.389> without<00:06:31.839> the<00:06:32.169> light

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:32.609 
in a smallish area without the light

00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:35.309 
in a smallish area without the light
contaminating<00:06:33.609> your<00:06:33.999> background<00:06:34.419> but<00:06:35.109> see

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
contaminating your background but see

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.289 
contaminating your background but see
how<00:06:35.439> soft<00:06:35.739> that<00:06:35.889> light<00:06:36.219> looks<00:06:36.489> now<00:06:36.729> with<00:06:37.269> a

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:37.299 
how soft that light looks now with a

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:39.949 
how soft that light looks now with a
beautiful<00:06:37.839> transition<00:06:38.319> to<00:06:38.769> the<00:06:38.889> shadow<00:06:39.129> area

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:39.959 
beautiful transition to the shadow area

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:42.329 
beautiful transition to the shadow area
compare<00:06:40.959> it<00:06:41.109> with<00:06:41.139> these<00:06:41.469> shots<00:06:41.769> when<00:06:42.219> the

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:42.339 
compare it with these shots when the

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:44.609 
compare it with these shots when the
light<00:06:42.549> was<00:06:42.699> further<00:06:42.969> away<00:06:43.209> you<00:06:43.629> can<00:06:44.229> really

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:44.619 
light was further away you can really

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:47.279 
light was further away you can really
see<00:06:44.889> the<00:06:45.159> difference<00:06:45.749> I'm<00:06:46.749> a<00:06:46.779> big<00:06:47.019> fan<00:06:47.259> of

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:47.289 
see the difference I'm a big fan of

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.499 
see the difference I'm a big fan of
getting<00:06:47.589> the<00:06:47.799> light<00:06:48.009> in<00:06:48.249> close<00:06:48.549> closes<00:06:49.329> your

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509 
getting the light in close closes your

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.079 
getting the light in close closes your
friend<00:06:49.949> more<00:06:50.949> control<00:06:51.369> of<00:06:51.399> the<00:06:51.639> background

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:52.089 
friend more control of the background

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:54.449 
friend more control of the background
the<00:06:52.509> beautiful<00:06:52.989> soft<00:06:53.229> light<00:06:53.409> and<00:06:53.619> easy<00:06:54.219> on

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:54.459 
the beautiful soft light and easy on

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:56.579 
the beautiful soft light and easy on
your<00:06:54.489> flashes<00:06:54.999> and<00:06:55.119> batteries<00:06:55.509> you<00:06:56.199> can't<00:06:56.469> say

00:06:56.579 --> 00:06:56.589 
your flashes and batteries you can't say

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.279 
your flashes and batteries you can't say
further<00:06:56.859> than<00:06:57.039> that<00:06:57.509> in<00:06:58.509> the<00:06:58.689> next<00:06:58.869> lecture

00:06:59.279 --> 00:06:59.289 
further than that in the next lecture

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:01.169 
further than that in the next lecture
I'll<00:06:59.469> show<00:06:59.769> you<00:06:59.829> how<00:07:00.039> to<00:07:00.099> take<00:07:00.369> advantage<00:07:00.999> of

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:01.179 
I'll show you how to take advantage of

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:03.149 
I'll show you how to take advantage of
this<00:07:01.479> control<00:07:01.929> that<00:07:02.409> we<00:07:02.559> have<00:07:02.769> over<00:07:03.069> the

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:03.159 
this control that we have over the

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:05.969 
this control that we have over the
background<00:07:03.549> in<00:07:03.879> order<00:07:04.479> to<00:07:04.659> improve<00:07:05.289> the<00:07:05.829> look

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979 
background in order to improve the look

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.629 
background in order to improve the look
at<00:07:06.129> the<00:07:06.249> look<00:07:06.369> of<00:07:06.459> the<00:07:06.609> images<00:07:06.969> bye<00:07:07.359> for<00:07:07.599> now
