00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.389
 4 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.660
 hello friends we're back here to answer some questions that 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.009
 hassle the problem was not true 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.810
 by twitter 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.030
 I have an interesting question here that I ask yes 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.100
 is still possible on Saturday in the polar regions 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.590
 where the nights for six months and the days plus six months 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.440
 of course 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.060
 for three main reasons 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.780
 the first of them 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.940
 when we have wine tiling have your team god it's something still day 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.760
 Following 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.770
 reminder of the 10 th Saturday to identify yourself 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.200
 or when God gave a commandment 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.890
 he knew 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.920
 that in the polar regions the time zone would be totally different from the other 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.080
 regions 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.440
 so I already knew that even then no progress 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.660
 showing that it is possible to 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.650
 the second reason that leads them to believe that it is possible to observe on 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.880
 polar regions 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.100
 is the fact that Sunday's own conservatives got preserved Sunday 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.180
 if they can get away with Sunday in the polar regions 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.410
 because that the inhabitants of the seventh day can not wait for the facts 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.440
 and a third plea 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 It's the way they count the days. 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.170
 during the period in which you used 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.170
 being above the horizon and in the polar regions 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.920
 they conception pine when they finish when the day starts depending 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.970
 of the position in which only luck was found 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.120
 when the sun is below the resort 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.950
 it is possible through twilight that takes place around noon 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.880
 wise 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.749
 looking for I say on stage 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.879
 then there is no treatment 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.349
 not to keep the Sabbath with the same real creator god 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.409
 including 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.899
 in the polar regions 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:21.979
 Here is another question. 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.530
 is a question 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.659
 dieter hoeness wedge 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.140
 he still does 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.119
 political saw 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.749
 mentioned bizarre 34 14 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:37.249
 the demon responsible for all sin connected to the sector of mankind 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.619
 who is she 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:44.469
 in fact dear friend the limit word in which it appears here in the regional 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.359
 of the Old Testament 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.629
 is a word that does not have the purpose of becoming young and personal 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.279
 there that term 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:58.939
 it was used was used in the old semis to set itself for 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.769
 where you rode in the desert give me reason the female chassis 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:09.089
 so I was used here in this text I did not kill Joanna that we have been referring to 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:14.019
 but simply a cultural expression was used for the pointers 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.430
 to illustrate 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.819
 for the punishment the destruction would say about the city 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.489
 good day 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.609
 if you read for example life in prison beyond the magazine and corrected 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:31.959
 you will notice that 134 14 translated by pair of more public football 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.539
 and also in the league of the magazine updated by ghosts 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.280
 so as it says there are more fats or ghosts than piracy in that region 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.360
 which is good we have been stressing that this town is totally 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.940
 destroyed for having turned away from the offices of God 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.589
 and did not regret 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:54.729
 and fortunately people get 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:55.990
 yesterday in the bible 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.460
 there is often a specific culture here 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.429
 and makes a baita have occurred on top being that there is no need for this 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.790
 We will grow learning by how she is. 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.790
 and do not put ours beautiful it is by chance that private individuals 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.729
 in the book of god 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.379
 Let's go to the third question 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.840
 with which case 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.019
 and grass were the first inhabitants of the earth 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.919
 the answer to this question lies in sherry and without business 4 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:29.229
 here in sherry and yes so the next athletics 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.449
 after it generated 7 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.250
 Adam lived 800 years 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.319
 and fathered children him 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.169
 branches 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:46.539
 realize that Adam did not have as children only April cars he had more 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.189
 sons and daughters 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:50.749
 therefore 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.300
 there is a unit to multiply 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.120
 because there was a wedding 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.550
 hey brothers 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.659
 between the sons of Adam and Eve 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.139
 you may ask yourself 'but this does not deserve this 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.279
 certainly not 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:09.319
 because in addition to teaching came to exist only outgoing with 18 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.529
 millennia is saleh did not exist because the human race was since generated 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:15.580
 genetically 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.210
 so do not deserve this 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.129
 because the law of amnesty and then he is mythical 18 as these 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:23.729
 we will find 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.219
 on the next occasion to respond more questions from the public a hug 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.900
 it's that
