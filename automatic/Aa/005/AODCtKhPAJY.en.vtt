and<00:00:27.060> fed<00:00:28.060> that<00:00:28.210> to<00:00:28.649> my<00:00:29.649> multimeter<00:00:30.329> just<00:00:31.329> an

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
and fed that to my multimeter just an

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.650 
and fed that to my multimeter just an
side<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.869> car<00:00:32.079> there<00:00:32.320> and<00:00:33.180> I've<00:00:34.180> found<00:00:34.480> a

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
side the car there and I've found a

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.709 
side the car there and I've found a
suitable<00:00:35.110> ground<00:00:35.500> down<00:00:36.010> near<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.190> alternator

them back which is nothing at all now on
a<00:01:00.999> pig<00:01:01.149> addition<00:01:01.420> on<00:01:01.510> I'll<00:01:02.079> get<00:01:02.199> about<00:01:02.409> five

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
a pig addition on I'll get about five

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.259 
a pig addition on I'll get about five
volts<00:01:03.100> which<00:01:03.249> means<00:01:03.489> there's<00:01:03.640> no<00:01:03.789> pressure<00:01:04.059> at

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
volts which means there's no pressure at

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.920 
volts which means there's no pressure at
all<00:01:04.420> in<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.940> engine<00:01:06.940> that's<00:01:07.390> at<00:01:07.570> four<00:01:07.750> point

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
all in the engine that's at four point

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.410 
all in the engine that's at four point
five<00:01:08.140> three<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:09.220> then<00:01:09.670> I'll<00:01:09.760> start<00:01:10.030> up<00:01:10.240> and

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
five three and then I'll start up and

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.930 
five three and then I'll start up and
that<00:01:10.510> will<00:01:10.600> go<00:01:10.750> down<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.460> a<00:01:12.490> half<00:01:12.640> two

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
that will go down to one and a half two

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.400 
that will go down to one and a half two
volts<00:01:13.240> should<00:01:13.420> do<00:01:13.630> because<00:01:14.020> it's<00:01:14.230> going<00:01:14.320> to

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
volts should do because it's going to

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.680 
volts should do because it's going to
have<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.620> fossil<00:01:15.340> clothes<00:01:15.820> high<00:01:16.240> pressure<00:01:16.570> in

have the fossil clothes high pressure in
the<00:01:16.750> engine<00:01:17.190> so<00:01:18.190> that<00:01:18.700> means<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.180> fuel<00:01:19.450> is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
the engine so that means the fuel is

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.220 
the engine so that means the fuel is
lean<00:01:19.930> or<00:01:20.910> not<00:01:21.910> as<00:01:22.360> much<00:01:22.570> fuel<00:01:22.750> as<00:01:22.840> need<00:01:23.020> in<00:01:23.140> the

okay so bill bit little bit of

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.750 
okay so bill bit little bit of
acceleration<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.860> see<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.129> vultures<00:02:12.489> climbs

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
acceleration you see the vultures climbs

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.430 
acceleration you see the vultures climbs
up<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.030> bit

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.680 

forth<00:02:17.440> accelerator<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.970> when<00:02:22.390> I'm<00:02:22.480> going<00:02:22.660> up

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
forth accelerator so when I'm going up

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.350 
forth accelerator so when I'm going up
hill<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.200> Volt<00:02:23.650> should<00:02:23.860> go<00:02:23.980> up<00:02:24.190> no<00:02:24.730> nearer<00:02:25.209> to

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
hill the Volt should go up no nearer to

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.770 
hill the Volt should go up no nearer to
5<00:02:25.569> volts<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:26.170> this<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:27.450> less<00:02:28.450> pressure

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
5 volts really this is on less pressure

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.420 
5 volts really this is on less pressure
in<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:28.989> back<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.380> an<00:02:29.500> or<00:02:29.739> less<00:02:29.860> vacuum<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.340> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
in the back in an or less vacuum in the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.000 
in the back in an or less vacuum in the
engine<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.630> I'm<00:02:31.690> going<00:02:31.870> about<00:02:31.989> 20<00:02:32.680> miles<00:02:32.830> an

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
engine so I'm going about 20 miles an

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.430 
engine so I'm going about 20 miles an
hour<00:02:33.160> now<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.780> light<00:02:34.930> load<00:02:35.230> on<00:02:35.410> my

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
hour now the light load on my

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:43.020 
hour now the light load on my
accelerator<00:02:39.989> just<00:02:40.989> 1/4<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.860> pedal<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:42.910> it

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
accelerator just 1/4 of a pedal so it

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.620 
accelerator just 1/4 of a pedal so it
drops<00:02:43.269> again<00:02:43.540> because<00:02:43.690> my<00:02:45.510> accelerator<00:02:46.510> is

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
drops again because my accelerator is

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.319 
drops again because my accelerator is
off<00:02:46.829> it's<00:02:47.829> a<00:02:47.950> cut<00:02:48.489> to<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.730> air<00:02:48.880> off<00:02:49.030> so

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
off it's a cut to the air off so

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.059 
off it's a cut to the air off so
therefore<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.840> as<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.140> Pistons<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.769> suck<00:02:50.950> it

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
therefore that as the Pistons of suck it

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.789 
therefore that as the Pistons of suck it
up<00:02:51.130> suck<00:02:51.640> an<00:02:51.790> engine<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.390> air<00:02:52.720> it's<00:02:53.440> creating<00:02:53.739> a

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
up suck an engine of air it's creating a

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.000 
up suck an engine of air it's creating a
vacuum<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.450> actual<00:02:55.810> map<00:02:56.110> sensor<00:02:56.410> senses

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
vacuum so the actual map sensor senses

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.259 
vacuum so the actual map sensor senses
that<00:02:57.190> until<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.640> into<00:02:57.790> not<00:02:57.910> too<00:02:58.000> thin<00:02:58.120> or<00:02:58.209> too

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
that until the into not too thin or too

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.690 
that until the into not too thin or too
much<00:02:58.390> fuel<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:58.959> I'm<00:02:59.019> going<00:02:59.170> up<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.290> hill<00:02:59.440> now

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
much fuel so I'm going up a hill now

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.069 
much fuel so I'm going up a hill now
foot<00:03:00.700> bit<00:03:00.849> further<00:03:01.090> down<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.690> bundle<00:03:01.959> to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
foot bit further down to the bundle to

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.949 
foot bit further down to the bundle to
the<00:03:02.230> floor<00:03:04.079> just<00:03:05.079> under<00:03:05.349> 30<00:03:05.560> miles<00:03:05.860> an<00:03:06.010> hour

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
the floor just under 30 miles an hour

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.530 
the floor just under 30 miles an hour
it's<00:03:07.959> about<00:03:08.139> 1,800<00:03:08.859> revs<00:03:11.310> ok<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.340> press<00:03:13.180> heart

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
it's about 1,800 revs ok I press heart

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.970 
it's about 1,800 revs ok I press heart
now<00:03:13.889> 4.4<00:03:14.889> to<00:03:15.090> 4.3<00:03:16.090> 6<00:03:16.870> get<00:03:17.139> a<00:03:17.170> lot<00:03:17.470> welly<00:03:17.709> there

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
now 4.4 to 4.3 6 get a lot welly there

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.910 
now 4.4 to 4.3 6 get a lot welly there
these<00:03:18.970> nothing<00:03:19.239> up<00:03:19.480> there<00:03:19.600> now<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:20.739> see

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
these nothing up there now so you see

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.990 
these nothing up there now so you see
that<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.220> went<00:03:21.370> up<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.730> much<00:03:22.120> higher<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.940> is

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
that it went up to much higher this is

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.710 
that it went up to much higher this is
why<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.299> map<00:03:25.540> sensor<00:03:25.810> enhancers<00:03:26.380> are<00:03:26.410> making

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
why the map sensor enhancers are making

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.849 
why the map sensor enhancers are making
see<00:03:28.720> understand<00:03:29.049> folks<00:03:29.350> all<00:03:29.500> right<00:03:29.590> let's<00:03:29.769> go

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
see understand folks all right let's go

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.099 
see understand folks all right let's go
now<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.400> actual<00:03:31.180> map<00:03:31.510> sensor<00:03:31.720> on<00:03:31.930> I'm

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
now the actual map sensor on I'm

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:33.930 
now the actual map sensor on I'm
building<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.829> going<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.130> take<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.549> voltage

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
building is going to take that voltage

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.099 
building is going to take that voltage
off<00:03:34.329> when<00:03:34.660> I'm<00:03:34.780> traveling<00:03:36.389> so<00:03:37.389> lean<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.810> fuel

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
off when I'm traveling so lean that fuel

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.319 
off when I'm traveling so lean that fuel
out<00:03:38.319> so<00:03:38.590> my<00:03:38.709> foots<00:03:38.920> down<00:03:39.100> against<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.519> floor

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
out so my foots down against the floor

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.910 
out so my foots down against the floor
it's<00:03:41.400> sucking<00:03:42.400> all<00:03:42.609> that<00:03:42.730> air<00:03:42.940> out<00:03:43.359> of<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.920> big

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
it's sucking all that air out of the big

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.110 
it's sucking all that air out of the big
dark<00:03:45.190> or<00:03:45.400> like<00:03:45.549> tonight

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120

see it climbs up again till you get the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.029 
see it climbs up again till you get the
idea<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:38.759> with<00:04:38.909> the<00:04:38.999> map<00:04:39.150> sensor<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.860> more

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
idea of it with the map sensor the more

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.159 
idea of it with the map sensor the more
sort<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.550> gas<00:04:41.819> you<00:04:42.090> need<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.659> higher<00:04:42.900> the

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
sort of gas you need the higher the

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.260 
sort of gas you need the higher the
volts<00:04:44.159> are<00:04:44.310> from<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.580> map<00:04:44.759> Center<00:04:45.090> because

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
volts are from the map Center because

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.700 
volts are from the map Center because
it's<00:04:45.419> less<00:04:45.629> hot<00:04:45.990> vacuum<00:04:46.919> in<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:48.469> manifold<00:04:49.469> and

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
it's less hot vacuum in the manifold and

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.059 
it's less hot vacuum in the manifold and
when<00:04:50.490> your<00:04:50.900> throttle<00:04:51.900> plate<00:04:52.139> is<00:04:52.289> closed

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
when your throttle plate is closed

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:55.969 
when your throttle plate is closed
you're<00:04:53.909> an<00:04:54.000> idol<00:04:54.210> all<00:04:54.659> in<00:04:55.020> just<00:04:55.469> seconds

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
you're an idol all in just seconds

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.089 
you're an idol all in just seconds
traffic<00:04:56.490> your<00:04:57.000> vacuums<00:04:57.509> a<00:04:57.659> lot<00:04:57.810> higher<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:58.500> the

00:04:59.089 --> 00:04:59.099 
traffic your vacuums a lot higher so the

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.360 
traffic your vacuums a lot higher so the
vaults<00:04:59.460> go<00:04:59.699> down<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.360> that<00:05:01.080> means<00:05:01.469> the<00:05:01.620> engine

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
vaults go down and that means the engine

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.570 
vaults go down and that means the engine
doesn't<00:05:02.819> need<00:05:03.060> so<00:05:03.240> much<00:05:03.360> fuel<00:05:04.340> I've<00:05:05.340> done<00:05:05.490> all

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
doesn't need so much fuel I've done all

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.010 
doesn't need so much fuel I've done all
reach<00:05:05.789> us<00:05:05.939> on<00:05:06.060> these<00:05:06.180> maps<00:05:06.360> intimate<00:05:06.810> but<00:05:06.990> I

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
reach us on these maps intimate but I

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.689 
reach us on these maps intimate but I
believe<00:05:07.319> that<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:07.680> map<00:05:07.860> senses<00:05:08.219> the<00:05:08.279> primary

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
believe that the map senses the primary

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.959 
believe that the map senses the primary
sensor<00:05:09.120> that<00:05:09.270> some<00:05:09.949> tells<00:05:10.949> the<00:05:11.159> ECU<00:05:11.729> what's

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:11.969 
sensor that some tells the ECU what's

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:13.820 
sensor that some tells the ECU what's
fuel<00:05:12.479> to<00:05:12.629> deliver<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.139> pulse-width

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
fuel to deliver to the pulse-width

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.790 
fuel to deliver to the pulse-width
injectors<00:05:14.639> in<00:05:15.479> the<00:05:15.659> engine<00:05:16.969> so<00:05:17.969> now<00:05:18.089> I'm<00:05:18.150> just

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
injectors in the engine so now I'm just

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.879 
injectors in the engine so now I'm just
about<00:05:19.800> are<00:05:20.009> just<00:05:20.159> cruising<00:05:20.520> about<00:05:21.589> 30<00:05:22.589> miles

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
about are just cruising about 30 miles

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.269 
about are just cruising about 30 miles
an<00:05:23.039> hour<00:05:23.159> over<00:05:23.870> 1,000<00:05:24.870> revs<00:05:25.289> no<00:05:25.650> foot<00:05:25.949> my<00:05:26.099> first

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:26.279 
an hour over 1,000 revs no foot my first

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:28.969 
an hour over 1,000 revs no foot my first
lockdown<00:05:26.550> tool<00:05:27.080> just<00:05:28.080> put<00:05:28.289> under<00:05:28.469> one<00:05:28.500> volt

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
lockdown tool just put under one volt

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:36.170 
lockdown tool just put under one volt
then<00:05:31.699> so<00:05:32.699> I<00:05:32.729> put<00:05:33.539> my<00:05:33.629> foot<00:05:33.839> down<00:05:34.819> those<00:05:35.819> volts

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
then so I put my foot down those volts

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.810 
then so I put my foot down those volts
will<00:05:36.300> climb<00:05:36.569> up<00:05:36.659> a<00:05:36.750> bit

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
will climb up a bit

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.990 
will climb up a bit
something<00:05:38.390> for<00:05:38.510> down<00:05:38.660> now<00:05:39.310> see<00:05:40.310> that<00:05:40.460> the

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
something for down now see that the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.630 
something for down now see that the
voltage<00:05:41.720> shots<00:05:42.200> up<00:05:42.380> right<00:05:42.530> up<00:05:42.800> there<00:05:42.980> so<00:05:43.520> the

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
voltage shots up right up there so the

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.450 
voltage shots up right up there so the
idea<00:05:43.880> of<00:05:43.910> the<00:05:44.030> map<00:05:44.990> enhancer<00:05:45.530> is<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:45.800> you

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
idea of the map enhancer is that you

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.950 
idea of the map enhancer is that you
just<00:05:46.670> haven't<00:05:47.000> you<00:05:47.240> just<00:05:47.330> take<00:05:47.570> off<00:05:47.780> some

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
just haven't you just take off some

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.900 
just haven't you just take off some
Volkswagen<00:05:50.960> sin<00:05:51.140> there<00:05:51.350> and<00:05:51.620> it<00:05:52.370> just<00:05:52.400> leans

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
Volkswagen sin there and it just leans

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.160 
Volkswagen sin there and it just leans
the<00:05:53.000> fuel<00:05:53.240> a<00:05:53.360> bit<00:05:53.570> but<00:05:53.720> you<00:05:53.780> will<00:05:53.870> be<00:05:53.960> careful

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
the fuel a bit but you will be careful

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.540 
the fuel a bit but you will be careful
these<00:05:54.350> things<00:05:54.590> apparently<00:05:55.010> because<00:05:55.250> if<00:05:55.430> you

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
these things apparently because if you

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.580 
these things apparently because if you
lean<00:05:55.700> out<00:05:55.880> too<00:05:56.090> much<00:05:56.210> you<00:05:56.270> can<00:05:56.630> get<00:05:57.440> your

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
lean out too much you can get your

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.400 
lean out too much you can get your
engine<00:05:57.740> too<00:05:58.070> hot<00:05:58.340> as<00:05:58.640> well<00:05:59.140> so<00:06:00.140> thanks<00:06:00.350> for

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
engine too hot as well so thanks for

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.810 
engine too hot as well so thanks for
watching<00:06:00.470> this<00:06:00.800> demonstration<00:06:01.070> of<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.700> map

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
watching this demonstration of the map

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.540 
watching this demonstration of the map
sensor<00:06:02.090> in<00:06:02.540> action<00:06:03.110> before<00:06:03.310> modification<00:06:04.310> I

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
sensor in action before modification I

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.190 
sensor in action before modification I
hope<00:06:05.240> it<00:06:05.360> helps<00:06:05.570> in<00:06:05.660> you<00:06:05.810> guys<00:06:05.930> out<00:06:06.170> there

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
hope it helps in you guys out there

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.790 
hope it helps in you guys out there
doing<00:06:06.470> h<00:06:06.770> h<00:06:07.010> at<00:06:07.160> the<00:06:07.280> moment<00:06:07.640> take<00:06:08.300> care<00:06:08.510> yeah

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.610 

so<00:06:12.800> um<00:06:13.130> I<00:06:13.900> was<00:06:14.900> never<00:06:15.020> view<00:06:15.290> of<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:15.500> map

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:15.620 
so um I was never view of the map

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.740 
so um I was never view of the map
enhancer<00:06:16.160> then<00:06:16.310> so<00:06:16.640> was<00:06:16.910> you<00:06:17.060> do<00:06:17.180> sealed<00:06:17.480> the

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
enhancer then so was you do sealed the

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.480 
enhancer then so was you do sealed the
experiment<00:06:18.410> did<00:06:18.590> it's<00:06:18.740> very<00:06:19.040> very<00:06:19.400> good

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
experiment did it's very very good

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.280 
experiment did it's very very good
experimental<00:06:20.150> thought<00:06:20.420> some<00:06:20.750> house<00:06:21.020> me<00:06:21.170> I'm

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
experimental thought some house me I'm

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.170 
experimental thought some house me I'm
not<00:06:21.380> here<00:06:21.620> to<00:06:22.160> understand<00:06:22.550> the<00:06:22.640> map<00:06:22.790> sensor<00:06:23.030> a

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
not here to understand the map sensor a

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.230 
not here to understand the map sensor a
bit<00:06:23.330> more<00:06:23.510> now<00:06:23.830> so<00:06:24.830> as<00:06:25.010> as<00:06:25.550> you<00:06:25.910> start<00:06:26.150> the

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
bit more now so as as you start the

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.730 
bit more now so as as you start the
engine<00:06:26.420> up<00:06:26.570> or<00:06:26.870> before<00:06:27.140> you<00:06:27.230> start<00:06:27.410> engine<00:06:27.590> up

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
engine up or before you start engine up

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.250 
engine up or before you start engine up
it<00:06:27.860> starts<00:06:28.130> at<00:06:28.280> four<00:06:28.520> and<00:06:28.580> a<00:06:28.640> half<00:06:28.670> volts

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
it starts at four and a half volts

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.620 
it starts at four and a half volts
once<00:06:30.770> engine<00:06:31.040> is<00:06:31.100> started<00:06:31.580> it<00:06:31.850> comes<00:06:32.150> down<00:06:32.390> to

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
once engine is started it comes down to

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.930 
once engine is started it comes down to
one<00:06:33.380> and<00:06:33.500> a<00:06:33.530> half<00:06:33.710> volts<00:06:33.740> ish<00:06:34.750> on<00:06:35.750> acceleration

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
one and a half volts ish on acceleration

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.660 
one and a half volts ish on acceleration
volts<00:06:37.940> go<00:06:38.090> up<00:06:38.240> because<00:06:38.450> the<00:06:38.570> vacuum<00:06:39.110> is<00:06:39.670> lower

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
volts go up because the vacuum is lower

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.200 
volts go up because the vacuum is lower
because<00:06:41.030> your<00:06:41.270> throttle<00:06:41.600> plate<00:06:41.840> is<00:06:41.990> open<00:06:42.440> the

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
because your throttle plate is open the

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.250 
because your throttle plate is open the
airs<00:06:44.210> gushing<00:06:44.810> in<00:06:44.960> so<00:06:45.770> it's<00:06:46.100> telling<00:06:46.460> the<00:06:47.260> ECU

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
airs gushing in so it's telling the ECU

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.900 
airs gushing in so it's telling the ECU

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
more feeling when it cruise in the volts

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.620 
more feeling when it cruise in the volts
can<00:06:59.540> go<00:06:59.690> down<00:06:59.930> to<00:07:00.290> anything<00:07:00.560> from<00:07:00.860> 1.2<00:07:01.820> 1.5

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940 
fuel so with this enhancer I can see

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.760

that<00:07:08.060> I'd<00:07:08.150> have<00:07:08.300> to<00:07:08.390> take<00:07:08.510> a<00:07:08.930> lot<00:07:09.140> of<00:07:09.260> voltage

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
that I'd have to take a lot of voltage

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.370 
that I'd have to take a lot of voltage
off<00:07:10.150> even<00:07:11.150> half<00:07:11.420> a<00:07:11.570> volt<00:07:11.780> is<00:07:11.930> probably<00:07:12.170> enough

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
off even half a volt is probably enough

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.160 
off even half a volt is probably enough
I<00:07:12.500> think<00:07:12.610> I<00:07:13.610> did<00:07:14.420> a<00:07:14.450> little<00:07:14.570> experiment<00:07:14.840> going

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.170 
I think I did a little experiment going

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.410 
I think I did a little experiment going
on<00:07:15.290> on<00:07:15.650> the<00:07:15.800> on<00:07:15.950> a<00:07:16.070> faster<00:07:16.550> Road<00:07:16.700> as<00:07:16.850> well<00:07:17.030> again

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:17.420

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.030 
hour the fuel is not neither so much you

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.060 
hour the fuel is not neither so much you
can<00:07:23.510> run<00:07:23.660> about<00:07:23.810> I<00:07:24.560> think<00:07:25.070> I<00:07:25.160> saw<00:07:25.370> about<00:07:25.550> 1.6<00:07:26.480> is

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.070 
can run about I think I saw about 1.6 is

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.830 
can run about I think I saw about 1.6 is
1.5<00:07:28.070> ish<00:07:28.340> bulbs<00:07:29.060> so<00:07:29.180> therefore<00:07:29.450> I<00:07:29.510> could<00:07:29.660> take

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 
1.5 ish bulbs so therefore I could take

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.930 
1.5 ish bulbs so therefore I could take
about<00:07:29.960> half<00:07:30.650> off<00:07:30.920> of<00:07:31.070> that<00:07:31.340> when<00:07:31.670> on<00:07:31.760> cruises

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:31.940 
about half off of that when on cruises

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.320 
about half off of that when on cruises
at<00:07:32.420> say<00:07:32.630> 70<00:07:33.200> so<00:07:33.800> tell<00:07:34.250> the<00:07:34.460> ECU<00:07:34.820> that's<00:07:35.060> got<00:07:35.300> one

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330

taste<00:07:57.949> out<00:07:58.160> from<00:07:58.370> what's<00:07:58.490> or<00:07:58.639> feel<00:07:58.820> you<00:07:58.850> feel

00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.120 
taste out from what's or feel you feel

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.180 
taste out from what's or feel you feel
using<00:07:59.330> obviously<00:08:00.050> more<00:08:00.560> you<00:08:00.710> go<00:08:00.830> up<00:08:00.889> to<00:08:00.979> five

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.190 
using obviously more you go up to five

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.980 
using obviously more you go up to five
volts<00:08:01.520> the<00:08:02.090> more<00:08:02.240> fuel<00:08:02.479> you<00:08:02.539> use<00:08:02.600> unless

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:02.990 
volts the more fuel you use unless

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.779 
volts the more fuel you use unless
that's<00:08:03.440> the<00:08:03.560> volts<00:08:03.860> are<00:08:04.009> that's<00:08:04.280> for<00:08:04.460> use<00:08:04.610> and

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:04.789 
that's the volts are that's for use and

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:07.629 
that's the volts are that's for use and
so<00:08:04.880> yeah<00:08:05.090> it's<00:08:05.360> a<00:08:05.509> good<00:08:05.630> experiment<00:08:06.490> hope<00:08:07.490> this

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 
so yeah it's a good experiment hope this

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:09.279 
so yeah it's a good experiment hope this
