I<00:00:00.060> don't<00:00:00.659> know<00:00:00.750> how<00:00:00.870> we<00:00:00.989> got<00:00:01.140> started<00:00:01.380> off

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
I don't know how we got started off

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.720 
I don't know how we got started off
let's<00:00:02.070> put<00:00:02.250> it<00:00:02.310> back<00:00:02.399> on<00:00:04.040> higher<00:00:05.040> direction

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.730 
let's put it back on higher direction

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.580 
let's put it back on higher direction
real<00:00:08.730> easy<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.059> put<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.480> backwards<00:00:12.590> make

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
real easy to put it on backwards make

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.950 
real easy to put it on backwards make
sure<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:14.040> lot<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.400> times<00:00:14.820> what<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.000> do<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.660> lot

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
sure a lot of times what I do is a lot

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.050 
sure a lot of times what I do is a lot
of<00:00:16.049> rings<00:00:16.260> have<00:00:16.580> directions<00:00:17.580> are<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.820> marrow

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
of rings have directions are the marrow

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.359 
of rings have directions are the marrow
of<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.359> case<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:19.020> not<00:00:19.410> show<00:00:19.680> people<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.100> do

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
of the case you not show people you do

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.859 
of the case you not show people you do
but<00:00:20.609> they're<00:00:20.789> around<00:00:21.000> yeah<00:00:21.270> because<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.689> looks

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
but they're around yeah because it looks

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.200 
but they're around yeah because it looks
the<00:00:21.930> same<00:00:22.170> exact<00:00:22.680> program<00:00:22.890> whomever<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:24.029> make

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the same exact program whomever to make

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.209 
the same exact program whomever to make
this<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> front<00:00:24.779> room<00:00:26.060> yes<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:31.219> same

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
this the front room yes the same

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.700 
this the front room yes the same
direction<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:38.690> sometimes<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.840> even<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
direction but sometimes they even have a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.200 
direction but sometimes they even have a
speedometer<00:00:41.070> driver<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.940> son

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
speedometer driver that son

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.569 
speedometer driver that son
so<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.539> really<00:00:46.530> don't<00:00:46.680> care<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.370> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
so I really don't care about this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.299 
so I really don't care about this
particular<00:00:47.940> tire<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.660> should<00:00:49.100> one<00:00:50.100> thing

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
particular tire but you should one thing

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.790 
particular tire but you should one thing
about<00:00:50.930> these<00:00:51.930> arrows<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:53.280> arranged<00:00:53.579> thing

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
about these arrows it's arranged thing

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.100 
about these arrows it's arranged thing
it's<00:00:55.800> what<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.699> directs<00:00:57.210> rain<00:00:57.510> away<00:00:57.839> from<00:00:58.019> the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
it's what it directs rain away from the

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.280 
it's what it directs rain away from the
Centers<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.620> time<00:00:58.769> at<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> track<00:00:59.670> up<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.809> one

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
Centers and time at the track up on one

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.609 
Centers and time at the track up on one
track<00:01:01.559> day<00:01:01.969> with<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> widow<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.019> entire<00:01:04.320> face

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
track day with the widow is entire face

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.289 
track day with the widow is entire face
in<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.009> direction<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.909> next<00:01:06.270> day

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
in one direction and then the next day

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.710 
in one direction and then the next day
I'll<00:01:06.540> swap<00:01:06.899> tire<00:01:07.259> on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> run<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.890> backwards

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
I'll swap tire on the run it backwards

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.289 
I'll swap tire on the run it backwards
and<00:01:09.860> Desiree<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.950> go<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.399> with<00:01:11.549> track<00:01:11.850> okay

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and Desiree I go out with track okay

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.670 
and Desiree I go out with track okay
less<00:01:12.539> but<00:01:13.170> you're<00:01:13.289> right

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
less but you're right

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
less but you're right
that's<00:01:13.950> exactly<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.670> hope<00:01:14.940> it<00:01:15.090> doesn't<00:01:15.240> rain

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
that's exactly it hope it doesn't rain

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.840 
that's exactly it hope it doesn't rain
but<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.320> why<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:17.039> most<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.429> the<00:01:17.460> third<00:01:17.670> as

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
but that's why it's most of the third as

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.889 
but that's why it's most of the third as
I'm<00:01:18.000> Linda<00:01:18.300> u-turns

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
I'm Linda u-turns

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.330 
I'm Linda u-turns
yes<00:01:19.619> why<00:01:21.380> one<00:01:22.380> side<00:01:22.649> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> tires<00:01:23.069> will<00:01:23.250> wear

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
yes why one side of the tires will wear

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520 
yes why one side of the tires will wear
out<00:01:23.610> real<00:01:23.909> quick<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.289> have<00:01:25.440> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
out real quick and then you have to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.800 
out real quick and then you have to
throw<00:01:25.649> it<00:01:25.800> away<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.429> can<00:01:26.520> rotate<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:27.000> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
throw it away but you can rotate it and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.870 
throw it away but you can rotate it and
then<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.860> sell<00:01:29.069> it<00:01:29.100> some<00:01:29.369> ways<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.640> speed

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
then you sell it some ways to speed

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.630 
then you sell it some ways to speed
night<00:01:30.619> it's<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.679> middle<00:01:32.009> schooler<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the time you really don't want to have

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.660 
the time you really don't want to have
any<00:01:44.280> water<00:01:45.240> inside<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.929> time<00:01:49.369> one<00:01:50.369> thing<00:01:50.550> let

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
any water inside the time one thing let

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.380 
any water inside the time one thing let
me<00:01:50.700> touch<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.739> Spence<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:53.759> should<00:01:54.030> replace

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
me touch on Spence you should replace

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.869 
me touch on Spence you should replace
your<00:01:54.539> other<00:01:54.959> Spence<00:01:55.379> with<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.509> metal<00:01:57.509> stem<00:01:57.899> I

00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:58.879 
your other Spence with a metal stem I

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:02.020 
your other Spence with a metal stem I
think<00:01:59.879> it<00:01:59.940> back<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.239> me<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.440> there<00:02:01.590> cheap

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
think it back for me but in there cheap

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.320 
think it back for me but in there cheap
what<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.780> reason<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.319> that

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
what the reason is that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.520 
what the reason is that
we're<00:02:05.900> out<00:02:07.390> they<00:02:08.390> do<00:02:08.450> get<00:02:08.720> rotted<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.380> they

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
we're out they do get rotted and they

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.980 
we're out they do get rotted and they
should<00:02:09.770> be<00:02:09.890> changed<00:02:10.430> both<00:02:11.090> by<00:02:11.330> chops<00:02:11.720> just

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
should be changed both by chops just

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.810 
should be changed both by chops just
change<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.380> tire<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.890> never<00:02:13.040> changes<00:02:13.490> stem

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
change a tire that never changes stem

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.330 
change a tire that never changes stem
that's<00:02:14.480> something<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.930> should<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:16.130> put<00:02:16.280> a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
that's something you should you put a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.100 
that's something you should you put a
metal<00:02:16.670> one<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:17.000> you're<00:02:17.270> done<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.750> never<00:02:17.870> have

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
metal one in you're done you never have

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.490 
metal one in you're done you never have
to<00:02:18.230> change<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.620> again<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.900> that's<00:02:21.230> something

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
to change it again so that's something

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.660 
to change it again so that's something
to<00:02:22.010> consider

up inside the tire is a bitch to get
them<00:04:37.410> up<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.910> find<00:04:38.910> that<00:04:39.090> these<00:04:39.210> are<00:04:39.270> much

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570

to blow up that way you don't want it to

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:09.679 
to blow up that way you don't want it to
be<00:07:06.459> blowing<00:07:06.729> out<00:07:06.939> this<00:07:07.209> way<00:07:08.039> this<00:07:09.039> comes<00:07:09.339> from

be blowing out this way this comes from

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:14.009 
be blowing out this way this comes from
aviation<00:07:10.689> experience<00:07:11.589> where<00:07:12.159> we<00:07:12.939> put<00:07:13.149> 200<00:07:13.569> psi

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:14.019 
aviation experience where we put 200 psi

aviation experience where we put 200 psi
and<00:07:14.379> a<00:07:14.529> tyre<00:07:14.769> quarrel<00:07:15.809> so<00:07:16.809> and<00:07:17.559> the<00:07:17.860> tires<00:07:18.129> are

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:18.579 
and a tyre quarrel so and the tires are

00:07:18.579 --> 00:07:20.699 
and a tyre quarrel so and the tires are
like<00:07:19.029> four<00:07:19.329> four<00:07:19.719> or<00:07:19.779> five<00:07:19.989> feet<00:07:20.169> tall<00:07:20.379> and

like four four or five feet tall and

like four four or five feet tall and
about<00:07:20.919> this<00:07:21.219> wide<00:07:21.519> so<00:07:22.149> there's<00:07:22.299> a<00:07:22.360> tremendous

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:22.539 
about this wide so there's a tremendous

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:24.719 
about this wide so there's a tremendous
amount<00:07:23.199> of<00:07:23.319> energy<00:07:23.439> there<00:07:23.889> there's<00:07:24.639> a

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:27.489 
tremendous amount of energy in here but

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:30.119 
tremendous amount of energy in here but
that<00:07:27.669> one<00:07:27.819> is<00:07:27.939> just
