00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
but a shortage of fire and earth there

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.619 
but a shortage of fire and earth there
is<00:00:51.710> an<00:00:52.710> average<00:00:53.129> amount<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.579> air<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> sky

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
is an average amount of air in the sky

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.600 
is an average amount of air in the sky
at<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> moment<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> couple<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.430> big

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
at the moment we have a couple of a big

asteroid Ceres and Vesta in Libra we've

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
asteroid Ceres and Vesta in Libra we've
also<00:00:59.579> got<00:00:59.940> retrograde<00:01:00.600> Mars<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.260> Libra<00:01:01.289> which

also got retrograde Mars in Libra which

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.520 
also got retrograde Mars in Libra which
more<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> moment<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.719> about<00:01:03.989> 3<00:01:04.350> hours

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
more in a moment and as of about 3 hours

more in a moment and as of about 3 hours
ago

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
ago

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.700 
ago
we've<00:01:05.400> got<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> moon<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.510> Aquarius<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
we've got the moon in Aquarius and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.070 
we've got the moon in Aquarius and
that's<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.000> there<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> next<00:01:09.689> 36

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
that's going to be there for the next 36

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.300 
that's going to be there for the next 36
48<00:01:10.860> hours<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:13.080> does<00:01:13.409> seem<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.040> there's

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
48 hours so it does seem that there's

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.810 
48 hours so it does seem that there's
quite<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> lot<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.850> verbal<00:01:15.330> communication

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
quite a lot of verbal communication

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
quite a lot of verbal communication
mental<00:01:17.930> interaction<00:01:18.930> social<00:01:20.540> mingling<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
mental interaction social mingling and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.289 
mental interaction social mingling and
coming<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.320> over<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> coming<00:01:23.130> 48<00:01:23.790> hours<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
coming up over the coming 48 hours is

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.870 
coming up over the coming 48 hours is
quite<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.930> communicative<00:01:25.830> time<00:01:26.280> although<00:01:26.580> with

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
quite a communicative time although with

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.390 
quite a communicative time although with
a<00:01:26.909> lack<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.360> fire<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.470> lack<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> Earth<00:01:28.979> there

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
a lack of fire and a lack of Earth there

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
a lack of fire and a lack of Earth there
may<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.759> lack<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> substance<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.990> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
may be a lack of substance in that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.800 
may be a lack of substance in that
communication<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.790> water<00:01:33.030> with

Scorpio<00:01:40.710> there<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.850> an<00:01:42.060> abundance<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.869> water

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
Scorpio there is an abundance of water

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.310 
Scorpio there is an abundance of water

over the course of a next couple of days
is<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.259> much<00:01:49.500> stronger<00:01:49.860> than<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
clear specific actions we're going to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.950 
clear specific actions we're going to
find<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.820> people's<00:01:57.149> feelings<00:01:57.630> are<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.899> to

find that people's feelings are going to

find that people's feelings are going to
get<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> way<00:01:59.030> also<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.540> look<00:02:00.570> at<00:02:00.810> this

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
get in the way also if we look at this

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.289 
get in the way also if we look at this
