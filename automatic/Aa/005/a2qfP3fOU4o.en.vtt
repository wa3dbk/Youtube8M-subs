searching on the benches and everything
falling<00:01:10.800> okay

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.970 

that<00:01:13.980> just<00:01:14.190> comes<00:01:14.400> off<00:01:14.550> like<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.680> then<00:01:16.680> all<00:01:16.800> its

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
that just comes off like so then all its

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.180 
that just comes off like so then all its
left<00:01:17.190> is<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> valve<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:19.320> valve<00:01:19.350> seal<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
left is the valve the valve seal and

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.350 
left is the valve the valve seal and
then<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.410> rotating<00:01:22.410> and<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.370> that<00:01:23.580> strange

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
then the rotating and is that strange

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.760 
then the rotating and is that strange
we're<00:01:24.540> sitting<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:26.360> back<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.570> forth

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770

now<00:01:31.700> some<00:01:31.939> of<00:01:31.970> these<00:01:32.119> they<00:01:32.439> put<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.560> valve

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
now some of these they put the valve

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.020 
now some of these they put the valve
adjustment<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:34.280> everything<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.670> put<00:01:34.850> too

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
adjustment and everything and put too

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.550 
adjustment and everything and put too
much<00:01:35.180> pressure<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.930> stuff<00:01:36.110> on<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.350> tip<00:01:36.530> of

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
much pressure and stuff on the tip of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.499 
much pressure and stuff on the tip of
the<00:01:36.680> valve<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.100> they<00:01:37.159> cause<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.670> wear

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
the valve and they cause it to wear

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:39.060 
the valve and they cause it to wear

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
on the end of the valve so you wouldn't

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.340 
on the end of the valve so you wouldn't
want<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.060> do<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.500> just<00:01:45.500> grab<00:01:45.649> yourself<00:01:45.979> a<00:01:46.070> file

want to do is just grab yourself a file
just<00:01:48.350> rotate<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.860> valve<00:01:49.070> while<00:01:49.369> you're

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
just rotate the valve while you're

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.719 
just rotate the valve while you're
grinding<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:50.929> down

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
grinding it down

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.870 
grinding it down
sometimes<00:01:52.729> they<00:01:52.850> just<00:01:52.880> get<00:01:53.149> all<00:01:53.240> beat<00:01:53.509> up<00:01:53.539> and

try to punch them through and they'll
just<00:02:00.470> damage<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.009> valve<00:02:01.189> even<00:02:01.460> more<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.759> then

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
just damage the valve even more and then

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.910 
just damage the valve even more and then
you're<00:02:01.970> going<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.179> add<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.450> button<00:02:02.770> have<00:02:03.770> to

you're going to add the button have to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.639 
you're going to add the button have to
buy<00:02:04.039> a<00:02:04.069> new<00:02:04.100> valve<00:02:04.580> is<00:02:04.959> to<00:02:05.959> go<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.229> tip<00:02:06.409> them

everything on the valve grinding machine

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.440 
everything on the valve grinding machine
sometimes<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.200> just<00:02:09.670> won't<00:02:10.670> come<00:02:10.880> out<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:14.330> if

on the tip of the valve would not hurt

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.580 
on the tip of the valve would not hurt
to<00:02:17.959> go<00:02:18.080> ahead<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.610> grab<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> file<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.590> follow

everything<00:02:26.239> in<00:02:26.420> here<00:02:26.660> inserted<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:27.830> got<00:02:28.010> that

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
everything in here inserted you got that

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.520 
everything in here inserted you got that
uh<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:29.510> lip<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:29.959> everything<00:02:30.260> there<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.440> the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
uh that lip and everything there on the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.620 
uh that lip and everything there on the
tip<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.860> valve<00:02:31.040> could<00:02:31.370> put<00:02:32.269> a<00:02:32.299> decent

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
tip of the valve could put a decent

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.740 
tip of the valve could put a decent
little<00:02:32.750> scratch<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.290> stuff<00:02:33.470> down<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:33.680> there

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
little scratch and stuff down in there

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.920 
little scratch and stuff down in there
this<00:02:36.640> got<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.760> rotators<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:38.329> everything<00:02:38.780> on

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
this got the rotators and everything on

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.090 
this got the rotators and everything on
the<00:02:39.019> exhaust<00:02:39.320> side<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:40.000> that<00:02:41.000> does<00:02:41.299> is

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
the exhaust side to that does is

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.490 
the exhaust side to that does is
springing<00:02:43.100> their<00:02:43.190> thing<00:02:43.370> sits<00:02:43.579> on<00:02:43.760> top

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
springing their thing sits on top

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.979 
springing their thing sits on top
rotates<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.620> valve<00:02:45.829> keep<00:02:46.670> from<00:02:46.970> sit<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:47.900> the

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
rotates the valve keep from sit in the

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.110 
rotates the valve keep from sit in the
same<00:02:48.109> spot<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.680> way<00:02:48.799> that<00:02:49.579> increases<00:02:49.850> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
same spot the way that increases the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.340 
same spot the way that increases the
durability<00:02:50.269> of<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.720> valve<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.079> keeps<00:02:51.260> it

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
durability of the valve and keeps it

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.750 
durability of the valve and keeps it
from<00:02:51.380> burning<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:51.859> way<00:02:52.010> it's<00:02:52.130> not<00:02:52.250> set<00:02:52.489> in<00:02:52.579> one

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
from burning the way it's not set in one

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.970 
from burning the way it's not set in one
place<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.269> seat<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:54.380> so<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.769> valve

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
place on the seat and just so the valve

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.490 
place on the seat and just so the valve
itself<00:02:55.190> will<00:02:55.549> kind<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:55.850> rotate<00:02:56.269> a<00:02:56.500> different

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
itself will kind of rotate a different

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.289 
itself will kind of rotate a different
spot<00:02:57.850> exactly<00:02:58.880> where's<00:02:59.359> even<00:02:59.810> mm-hmm<00:03:00.260> and

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
spot exactly where's even mm-hmm and

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.610 
spot exactly where's even mm-hmm and
valve<00:03:02.299> job<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.630> everything<00:03:02.810> last<00:03:03.140> longer<00:03:03.440> and

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
valve job and everything last longer and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.800 
valve job and everything last longer and
look<00:03:04.069> better<00:03:05.000> when<00:03:05.329> you<00:03:05.390> go<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.510> tear<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.780> down

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
look better when you go to tear it down

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.629 
look better when you go to tear it down
so<00:03:06.709> that's<00:03:06.829> good<00:03:08.739> what's<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.829> next<00:03:10.519> step

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
so that's good what's the next step

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.420 
so that's good what's the next step
disassembly<00:03:14.680> get<00:03:15.680> them<00:03:15.769> caged<00:03:16.040> up<00:03:16.250> and

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
disassembly get them caged up and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.780 
disassembly get them caged up and

filming the shop lasted for five to
seven<00:03:19.940> minutes<00:03:20.359> and<00:03:20.480> they'll<00:03:20.600> come<00:03:20.810> out<00:03:20.900> look

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
seven minutes and they'll come out look

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.670 
seven minutes and they'll come out look
like<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.260> brand<00:03:21.440> new<00:03:21.500> piece<00:03:21.680> okay<00:03:23.380> alright<00:03:24.380> well

they'll<00:04:23.470> catch<00:04:23.650> them<00:04:23.800> occasional<00:04:24.250> crack

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
they'll catch them occasional crack

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.780 
they'll catch them occasional crack
going<00:04:24.760> from<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.800> bullet<00:04:26.800> hole<00:04:26.980> down<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.669> the

going from the bullet hole down to the
head<00:04:27.970> bolt<00:04:28.180> hole<00:04:28.360> okay<00:04:28.960> but<00:04:29.260> usually<00:04:29.590> any

head bolt hole okay but usually any

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.880 
head bolt hole okay but usually any
crack<00:04:30.070> you<00:04:30.250> find<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.730> cast<00:04:31.000> iron

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
crack you find in the cast iron

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
crack you find in the cast iron
depending<00:04:32.890> on<00:04:32.980> where<00:04:33.160> it's<00:04:33.310> that's<00:04:33.490> usually

depending on where it's that's usually
not<00:04:34.120> good<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.870> find<00:04:35.080> cracks<00:04:35.350> anyway<00:04:35.800> though

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
not good to find cracks anyway though

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.570 
not good to find cracks anyway though
okay<00:04:37.650> some<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.860> them<00:04:38.980> you<00:04:39.130> can't<00:04:39.370> get<00:04:39.490> away

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
okay some of them you can't get away

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.560 
okay some of them you can't get away
with<00:04:39.730> but<00:04:40.360> most<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.810> them<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.050> can't

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
with but most of them you can't

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.610 
with but most of them you can't
especially<00:04:43.570> if<00:04:43.840> they're<00:04:43.930> going<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.320> coolant

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
especially if they're going to a coolant

passage you might as well go ahead and

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.650 
passage you might as well go ahead and
scrap<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:49.229> that's<00:04:50.229> good<00:04:50.880> okay<00:04:51.880> one<00:04:52.150> down<00:04:52.419> then

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
scrap it that's good okay one down then

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.150 
scrap it that's good okay one down then
we<00:04:52.780> check<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.020> other<00:04:53.169> one<00:04:53.470> yes<00:04:53.770> sir<00:04:53.950> awesome

okay to give you an example since our

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.120 
okay to give you an example since our
head<00:04:58.690> cylinder<00:04:59.080> heads<00:04:59.260> and<00:04:59.410> block<00:04:59.650> we're<00:04:59.830> okay

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
head cylinder heads and block we're okay

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.060 
head cylinder heads and block we're okay
we've<00:05:01.060> got<00:05:01.300> here<00:05:01.750> another<00:05:02.350> customers

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
we've got here another customers

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.920 
we've got here another customers
cylinder<00:05:04.060> head<00:05:04.210> off<00:05:04.390> of<00:05:04.600> 1952<00:05:05.640> 35:6<00:05:06.640> owner

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
cylinder head off of 1952 35:6 owner

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.060 
cylinder head off of 1952 35:6 owner
we're<00:05:07.930> going<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.140> check<00:05:08.320> it<00:05:08.530> because<00:05:08.890> there's

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
we're going to check it because there's

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.550 
we're going to check it because there's
probably<00:05:09.430> some<00:05:09.640> cracking<00:05:10.060> in<00:05:10.180> this<00:05:10.330> one<00:05:10.560> so

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
probably some cracking in this one so

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:21.080 
probably some cracking in this one so
Tony<00:05:11.860> let's<00:05:12.070> see<00:05:12.250> what<00:05:12.580> we<00:05:12.669> can<00:05:12.700> find<00:05:12.970> out<00:05:13.180> here

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.810 

then<00:05:21.690> you<00:05:21.780> start<00:05:22.080> seeing<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.520> flux<00:05:23.520> getting

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
then you start seeing the flux getting

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.070 
then you start seeing the flux getting
down<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.210> crack<00:05:24.449> and<00:05:24.600> everything<00:05:24.690> right

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
down to the crack and everything right

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.680 
down to the crack and everything right
there<00:05:25.520> what<00:05:26.520> usually<00:05:26.669> causes<00:05:27.150> that<00:05:27.270> cracking

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
there what usually causes that cracking

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.800 
there what usually causes that cracking
would<00:05:27.810> have<00:05:27.900> been<00:05:27.990> water<00:05:28.260> in<00:05:28.410> there<00:05:28.740> okay

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
would have been water in there okay

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.830 
would have been water in there okay
possibly<00:05:31.070> but<00:05:32.070> this<00:05:32.550> motor<00:05:32.820> has<00:05:33.120> been<00:05:33.150> sitting

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
possibly but this motor has been sitting

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.310 
possibly but this motor has been sitting
for<00:05:33.870> for<00:05:34.560> quite<00:05:34.740> some<00:05:34.979> time<00:05:35.780> but<00:05:36.780> came<00:05:36.930> in<00:05:37.110> have

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
for for quite some time but came in have

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.080 
for for quite some time but came in have
rust<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.860> everything<00:05:37.919> all<00:05:38.310> over<00:05:38.699> it<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:38.820> then

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
rust and everything all over it and then

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.420 
rust and everything all over it and then
just<00:05:39.960> from<00:05:40.290> sitting<00:05:40.560> over<00:05:40.710> time<00:05:40.949> from<00:05:41.220> going

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
just from sitting over time from going

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.820 
just from sitting over time from going
from<00:05:41.580> hot<00:05:41.729> to<00:05:42.000> cold<00:05:42.199> causing<00:05:43.199> stress<00:05:43.500> cracks

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
from hot to cold causing stress cracks

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.010 
from hot to cold causing stress cracks
and<00:05:44.010> everything<00:05:44.460> but<00:05:45.120> this<00:05:45.330> one<00:05:45.510> right<00:05:45.660> here

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
and everything but this one right here

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.510 
and everything but this one right here
you<00:05:46.710> can<00:05:46.830> see<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.130> crack<00:05:47.340> and<00:05:47.460> everything

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
you can see the crack and everything

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.770 
you can see the crack and everything
right<00:05:47.850> there<00:05:48.060> is<00:05:48.180> actually<00:05:48.479> going<00:05:48.660> down

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
right there is actually going down

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.140 
right there is actually going down
inside<00:05:49.139> of<00:05:49.260> coolant<00:05:49.530> passage<00:05:49.949> I<00:05:50.220> can<00:05:50.880> take<00:05:51.000> my

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
inside of coolant passage I can take my

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.930 
inside of coolant passage I can take my
finger<00:05:51.740> stick<00:05:52.740> it<00:05:52.860> in<00:05:52.979> there<00:05:53.400> and<00:05:53.610> get<00:05:53.700> right

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
finger stick it in there and get right

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.440 
finger stick it in there and get right
back<00:05:54.360> behind<00:05:54.540> it<00:05:54.900> okay<00:05:55.620> so<00:05:56.160> this<00:05:56.340> head<00:05:56.580> is

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
back behind it okay so this head is

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.170 
back behind it okay so this head is
beyond<00:05:57.840> repair<00:05:58.229> correct<00:05:59.130> okay<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.910> we're

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
beyond repair correct okay and we're

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.290 
beyond repair correct okay and we're
just<00:06:00.270> lucky<00:06:00.479> with<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.110> Malibu<00:06:01.919> that<00:06:02.669> we

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
just lucky with the Malibu that we

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.450 
just lucky with the Malibu that we
didn't<00:06:03.540> have<00:06:03.720> this<00:06:03.990> so<00:06:04.440> we<00:06:04.530> won't<00:06:04.710> have<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:04.889> try

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
didn't have this so we won't have to try

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.640 
didn't have this so we won't have to try
to<00:06:05.520> hurt<00:06:05.700> search<00:06:06.060> for<00:06:06.270> parts<00:06:06.540> right<00:06:06.930> so<00:06:07.500> we

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
to hurt search for parts right so we

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.990 
to hurt search for parts right so we
have<00:06:07.770> a<00:06:07.800> car<00:06:08.100> that<00:06:08.130> went<00:06:08.520> through<00:06:08.639> a<00:06:08.729> brick

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
have a car that went through a brick

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.210 
have a car that went through a brick
wall<00:06:09.030> but<00:06:09.630> honestly<00:06:10.380> the<00:06:10.560> engine<00:06:10.860> is<00:06:10.979> still

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
wall but honestly the engine is still

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.760 
wall but honestly the engine is still
completely<00:06:11.610> intact<00:06:11.910> yes<00:06:12.900> sir<00:06:13.080> so<00:06:13.410> it<00:06:13.530> very

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
completely intact yes sir so it very

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.730 
completely intact yes sir so it very
usable<00:06:14.600> that's<00:06:15.600> a<00:06:15.720> good<00:06:15.870> thing<00:06:16.080> a<00:06:16.320> lot<00:06:16.680> of

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 
usable that's a good thing a lot of

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.110 
usable that's a good thing a lot of
people<00:06:17.010> think<00:06:17.220> that<00:06:17.370> just<00:06:17.430> because<00:06:17.729> it's<00:06:18.000> in<00:06:18.090> a

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
people think that just because it's in a

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.270 
people think that just because it's in a
wreck<00:06:18.389> and<00:06:18.419> hits<00:06:18.780> in<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:18.990> front<00:06:19.260> the<00:06:19.919> engines

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
wreck and hits in the front the engines

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.040 
wreck and hits in the front the engines
no<00:06:20.400> good<00:06:20.610> in<00:06:20.850> this<00:06:20.970> case<00:06:21.240> we<00:06:21.479> show<00:06:21.690> houses

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
no good in this case we show houses

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.420 
no good in this case we show houses
bigger<00:06:22.229> something<00:06:22.500> you<00:06:22.710> get<00:06:22.860> hit<00:06:23.039> and<00:06:23.280> there's

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
bigger something you get hit and there's

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.310 
bigger something you get hit and there's
a<00:06:23.490> good<00:06:23.639> chance<00:06:23.699> that<00:06:24.270> the<00:06:24.750> motor<00:06:24.930> is<00:06:25.020> okay

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
a good chance that the motor is okay

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.219 
a good chance that the motor is okay
right<00:06:25.700> all<00:06:26.700> right<00:06:26.910> if<00:06:27.510> you<00:06:27.630> jump<00:06:27.810> to<00:06:27.960> anything

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
right all right if you jump to anything

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.470 
right all right if you jump to anything
