on my facebook page this week why not

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.589 
on my facebook page this week why not
combine<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.190> two<00:00:14.370> into<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> single<00:00:15.030> video<00:00:15.150> and

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
combine the two into a single video and

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.880 
combine the two into a single video and
compare<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.020> contrast<00:00:16.080> how<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.590> shoot

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
compare and contrast how I shoot

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.470 
compare and contrast how I shoot
differently<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.400> portraits<00:00:17.850> then<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> shoot

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
differently for portraits then I shoot

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.779 
differently for portraits then I shoot
for<00:00:18.660> landscape<00:00:19.020> images<00:00:19.380> first<00:00:20.340> let's<00:00:20.640> talk

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
for landscape images first let's talk

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.939 
for landscape images first let's talk
about<00:00:20.939> color<00:00:21.300> when<00:00:22.140> doing<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.439> portrait<00:00:22.680> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
about color when doing a portrait I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.470 
about color when doing a portrait I
typically<00:00:23.369> want<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> more<00:00:23.820> neutral<00:00:24.060> color

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
typically want a more neutral color

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.670 
typically want a more neutral color
palette<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:25.140> obtain<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> most

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
palette to obtain the most

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.580 
palette to obtain the most
natural-looking<00:00:26.160> skin<00:00:26.580> tones<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.990> get<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.380> I

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
natural-looking skin tones to get that I

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.640 
natural-looking skin tones to get that I
adjust<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.160> couple<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.609> things<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:30.000> my<00:00:30.060> camera

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
adjust a couple of things on my camera

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.959 
adjust a couple of things on my camera
first<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.920> could<00:00:32.399> change<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> picture

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
first I could change the picture

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.900 
first I could change the picture
controls<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.660> my<00:00:34.260> Nikon<00:00:34.649> DSLRs<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.489> get<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> few

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
controls in my Nikon DSLRs I get a few

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.060 
controls in my Nikon DSLRs I get a few
options<00:00:36.300> right<00:00:36.450> out<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> box<00:00:36.930> one<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.920> them

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
options right out of the box one of them

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610 
options right out of the box one of them
is<00:00:38.250> neutral<00:00:38.730> frankly<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.780> don't<00:00:40.200> always<00:00:40.410> make

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
is neutral frankly I don't always make

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
is neutral frankly I don't always make
this<00:00:40.770> change<00:00:41.010> however<00:00:41.520> it's<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.300> good<00:00:42.450> option

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this change however it's a good option

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.470 
this change however it's a good option
to<00:00:42.899> use<00:00:43.399> second<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.550> always<00:00:45.149> make<00:00:45.300> sure<00:00:45.329> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to use second I always make sure to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.360 
to use second I always make sure to
adjust<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:46.079> white<00:00:46.260> balance<00:00:46.649> color

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
adjust my white balance color

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.369 
adjust my white balance color
temperature<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.180> wreak<00:00:48.450> havoc<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.079> skin

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
temperature can wreak havoc on skin

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.260 
temperature can wreak havoc on skin
tones<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:49.980> changing<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.370> white<00:00:50.579> balance<00:00:50.820> to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
tones so changing the white balance to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.000 
tones so changing the white balance to
match<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:51.660> lighting<00:00:51.960> conditions<00:00:52.410> will<00:00:52.800> help

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
match your lighting conditions will help

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.670 
match your lighting conditions will help
obtain<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> natural<00:00:53.940> look<00:00:54.320> one<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:55.500> recent

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
obtain a natural look one of my recent

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.170 
obtain a natural look one of my recent
videos<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.219> about<00:00:56.430> performing<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> white

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
videos is about performing a white

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.670 
videos is about performing a white
balance<00:00:57.539> preset<00:00:57.960> which<00:00:58.260> will<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
balance preset which will get you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920 
balance preset which will get you
extremely<00:00:59.370> accurate<00:00:59.969> color<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.690> here's<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
extremely accurate color and here's a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.889 
extremely accurate color and here's a
link<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.260> video<00:01:02.090> when<00:01:03.090> photographing<00:01:03.660> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
link to that video when photographing a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.810 
link to that video when photographing a
landscape<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.589> go<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> other<00:01:05.369> end<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
landscape I go to the other end of the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.690 
landscape I go to the other end of the
spectrum<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.420> will<00:01:07.200> almost<00:01:07.470> always<00:01:07.770> amp<00:01:08.369> up<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
spectrum I will almost always amp up the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550 
spectrum I will almost always amp up the
reds<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.000> greens<00:01:09.210> using<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> vivid<00:01:10.200> option

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
reds and greens using the vivid option

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.649 
reds and greens using the vivid option
and<00:01:10.710> picture<00:01:10.979> controls<00:01:11.400> white<00:01:12.180> balance<00:01:12.510> may

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and picture controls white balance may

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
and picture controls white balance may
also<00:01:12.840> be<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> factor<00:01:13.409> when<00:01:13.799> shooting<00:01:14.010> landscape

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
also be a factor when shooting landscape

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.390 
also be a factor when shooting landscape
but<00:01:15.090> most<00:01:15.600> often<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.020> use<00:01:16.049> auto<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.250> don't

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
but most often I use auto if I don't

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.740 
but most often I use auto if I don't
take<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> time<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.180> get<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> white<00:01:18.570> balance

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
take the time to get the white balance

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.719 
take the time to get the white balance
right<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.259> i<00:01:19.530> will<00:01:19.619> err<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.250> side<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.549> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
right on i will err on the side of a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.030 
right on i will err on the side of a
warmer<00:01:21.090> image<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:22.020> most<00:01:22.380> people<00:01:22.680> find

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
warmer image which most people find

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.730 
warmer image which most people find
pleasing<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.729> landscape<00:01:24.150> photos<00:01:24.619> next<00:01:25.619> I'll

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
pleasing for landscape photos next I'll

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.340 
pleasing for landscape photos next I'll
talk<00:01:25.890> about<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.759> almost<00:01:27.299> always<00:01:27.630> want<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
talk about I so I almost always want the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.710 
talk about I so I almost always want the
lowest<00:01:28.740> ISO<00:01:29.159> available<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.939> both<00:01:30.119> portraits

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
lowest ISO available for both portraits

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.960 
lowest ISO available for both portraits
and<00:01:30.869> landscapes<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.710> way<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and landscapes that way I will get a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
and landscapes that way I will get a
crisp<00:01:33.420> image<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.170> little<00:01:34.470> noise<00:01:34.590> as

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
crisp image with as little noise as

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.359 
crisp image with as little noise as
possible<00:01:35.390> now<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.720> aperture<00:01:37.049> when<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> am

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
possible now for aperture when I am

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.700 
possible now for aperture when I am
taking<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.909> portrait<00:01:39.420> shot<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.869> usually<00:01:40.500> have<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
taking a portrait shot I usually have a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.499 
taking a portrait shot I usually have a
wider<00:01:41.009> aperture<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> depth<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.240> field

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
wider aperture so the depth of field

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.870

never<00:03:32.790> or<00:03:33.139> usually<00:03:34.139> that's<00:03:35.129> because<00:03:35.430> every

situation<00:03:36.299> is<00:03:36.389> different<00:03:36.449> also<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.889> like<00:03:38.250> to

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
situation is different also I like to

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.030 
situation is different also I like to
experiment<00:03:38.729> in<00:03:39.090> my<00:03:39.810> experimentation<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.769> often

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
experiment in my experimentation I often

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.520 
experiment in my experimentation I often
break<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.639> rules<00:03:41.849> there<00:03:42.569> is<00:03:42.720> an<00:03:42.870> exception<00:03:43.109> to

use artificial light on a landscape if i
