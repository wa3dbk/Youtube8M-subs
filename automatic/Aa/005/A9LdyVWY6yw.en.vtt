parts<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.200> just<00:02:48.860> about<00:02:49.070> doubled<00:02:49.520> the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
parts that just about doubled the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:03:05.630 
parts that just about doubled the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.120 

I<00:03:05.840> wouldn't<00:03:06.840> call<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.170> fast<00:03:07.470> car<00:03:07.800> but<00:03:08.010> it's

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
I wouldn't call it a fast car but it's

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.500 
I wouldn't call it a fast car but it's
definitely<00:03:08.340> has<00:03:08.790> enough<00:03:08.910> power<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.300> have<00:03:09.480> a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
definitely has enough power to have a

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:18.530 
definitely has enough power to have a
lot<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.780> fun

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.450 

it's<00:03:19.540> basically<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.990> street-legal<00:03:20.410> racecar<00:03:20.710> so

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
it's basically a street-legal racecar so

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.980 
it's basically a street-legal racecar so
it's<00:03:21.670> not<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.970> most<00:03:22.120> comfortable<00:03:22.390> it's<00:03:22.930> not

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
it's not the most comfortable it's not

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.860 
it's not the most comfortable it's not
quiet<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:24.550> could<00:03:24.700> be<00:03:24.820> pretty<00:03:25.000> stinky<00:03:25.480> after<00:03:25.810> a

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
quiet it could be pretty stinky after a

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.470 
quiet it could be pretty stinky after a
while<00:03:26.080> but<00:03:26.770> it's<00:03:26.920> just<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.400> fun<00:03:27.580> experience

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
while but it's just the fun experience

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:37.080 
while but it's just the fun experience
to<00:03:28.600> take<00:03:28.750> out

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.140 

and<00:03:37.770> I<00:03:38.770> cleaned<00:03:39.010> up<00:03:39.069> the<00:03:39.220> body<00:03:39.430> significantly

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150

corner markers and I just really wanted

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.380 
corner markers and I just really wanted
to<00:03:44.440> go<00:03:44.650> with<00:03:44.800> a<00:03:44.830> really<00:03:45.010> minimal<00:03:45.610> kind<00:03:46.300> of
