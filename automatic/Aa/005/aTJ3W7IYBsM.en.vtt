00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.870
 Perez and the Caribbean 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.940
 sweat locomotives work hard 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.620
 to keep the island clean and tidy 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.620
 there is always garbage that is removed 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.700
 barrero 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.520
 what is discarded 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.010
 but the protections are always 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.350
 happy because everyone wants to be 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.010
 really useful 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.010
 one day 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.300
 trash 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.700
 his last stop was the country house 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.520
 of the Duke and the Duchess of Oxford 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.200
 the duchess had something very unusual that 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.300
 throw 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.230
 and that in mind 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.570
 is a callus that fell is an organ that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.980
 he played music at summer fairs 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.980
 years ago 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.430
 unfortunately someone forgot this what 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.870
 he left out and rusted percy's eyes 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.870
 they were full of amazement 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:13.909
 and now I have to take it to the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.909
 casting should be discarded if ship sar 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.960
 but without hooking a gauge it would not be 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.450
 wonderful to go to the street or to play 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.390
 music again 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.760
 it's just a piece of garbage while 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.070
 soon we discard it better 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.450
 but persie did not want the organ 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.850
 out of trash 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.400
 he thought he was special and he got the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.060
 Calliope will not work 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.870
 dismiss it that did that it says touch its 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.320
 plate 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.910
 that pile of old pipes that life of 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.270
 kids you already loosened a piston wheels 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.880
 of percy trembled did not want to look silly 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.290
 in front of says but did not want to 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.200
 they destroyed the calliope 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.590
 to play before we get to the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.590
 foundry 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.789
 the two locomotives transported the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.549
 heavy load 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.959
 to see if it blew and snorted while 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.959
 I pushed the wagons 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.860
 this is exhausting I need more water 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.340
 and percy and he says they stopped at the 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.560
 water tower 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.989
 says the grullo 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.620
 they tell us we should never stop by 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.739
 water we have to stop tell us about 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.830
 steam we do not run without water an idea 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.440
 it went through Percy's pistons maybe 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.069
 The Kaliope also works with water 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.060
 then you decide how serious 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:55.810
 he says he was surprised the water came in and 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.200
 splashed on the organ tubes 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.970
 I expected to hear music but the only sound 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.739
 it was a weird drip that made the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.739
 Sometimes I would tremble 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.660
 he says he laughed with laughter 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.569
 but without blushing see if there was not 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:23.459
 repaired the calíope I'm sure that 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.459
 I can make the caliope work 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.330
 as all advanced to the foundry 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.510
 I sensed if they criticized him 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.510
 tracks 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.670
 the foundry 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.420
 but if I was worried soon the 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.670
 organ would be discarded 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.040
 then the locomotives had to 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.030
 stop at a level crossing 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.200
 that was and did not light 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.200
 we help him mr 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.700
 the helpers say they touch hot it 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.910
 They pushed hard to push the car 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.910
 faster and faster until the engine 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.100
 and they continued 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.980
 but if I had a plan to push the car 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:22.160
 a certain screen caused it to ignite 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.160
 time and pushed the cardio that touched 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:31.249
 and so little by little 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.189
 with the love of faster and faster 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:37.459
 the organ vibrated and ran over the 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:42.270
 tracks the pipes made metallic sounds 

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:45.150
 but they did not play music I should push more 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.640
 I must save him from the condition 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.550
 the caliope advanced on the tracks in 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.780
 front of ps 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.110
 but I still did not play music 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.780
 then there were problems but if I get to 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.510
 the top of godó hill 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.350
 he stopped but the caribbean hair 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.350
 and it had broken 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:26.490
 but if it felt terrible now 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.490
 if it is sure that destroyed of calíope 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.230
 sigh 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.830
 a vapor came out of his pistons and a little 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.830
 of his whistles 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:40.249
 says goodbye that's the only music I've 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:43.099
 heard all day 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:47.969
 that made an idea start to boil 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:49.979
 in the caldera of percy whistle whistle 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:52.879
 Now I know how to make the change 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.879
 presumptions 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.080
 the percy driver connected a 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.830
 cylinder outlet hose 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.770
 personal 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.310
 steam entered the organ which gave floor 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.820
 and pop 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.820
 and wii 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:15.240
 with a snort and a trickle began 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.740
 touch 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:21.970
 well I smile from bumper to bumper 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.970
 then it arrived 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:30.250
 Christ playing that music is the change 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:35.430
 faith sir they told us to take it to 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.430
 the commission but I made it work 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.650
 I just saved an important piece of 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:49.030
 the history of envelope 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:53.759
 proudly took the angels Viktor 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.759
 he did not repair how he should teach 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:01.350
 In the workshops the Caribbean was painted and 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.500
 polished the brass tubes shone in 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:06.800
 Sun 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:09.520
 he snorted proudly everyone wanted 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.210
 hear the music of the Caribbean 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.300
 he lit his charcoal 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.449
 he boiled his boiler and injected steam 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.909
 in the canyon 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:21.909
 and the sweetest sound
