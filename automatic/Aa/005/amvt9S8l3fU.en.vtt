hi there J of Canadian energy today

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.580 
hi there J of Canadian energy today
we're<00:00:12.750> going<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.929> have<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> look<00:00:13.170> at<00:00:13.259> battery

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
we're going to have a look at battery

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.799 
we're going to have a look at battery
Isolators<00:00:14.190> how<00:00:14.670> they're<00:00:14.880> used<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.389> why

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
Isolators how they're used and why

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.650 
Isolators how they're used and why
they're<00:00:16.049> used<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.619> dual<00:00:16.770> battery<00:00:17.130> system<00:00:17.660> so

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
they're used in a dual battery system so

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.390

appropriate sized amperage isolator the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
corresponds to our alternator battery

corresponds to our alternator battery
Isolators<00:02:01.860> come<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.820> multiple<00:02:03.350> inputs<00:02:04.350> for

Isolators come in multiple inputs for

Isolators come in multiple inputs for
multiple<00:02:05.250> alternators<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.380> multiple

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
multiple alternators and multiple

multiple alternators and multiple

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200

amps<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.550> there<00:02:15.700> you<00:02:15.760> go<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:16.060> little<00:02:16.150> bit<00:02:16.390> on

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
amps so there you go a little bit on

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.700 
amps so there you go a little bit on
