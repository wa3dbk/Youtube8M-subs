00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
in the short little video we're going to

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.809 
in the short little video we're going to
have<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.170> look<00:00:04.319> at<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.620> hydrogenation<00:00:05.520> of

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
have a look at the hydrogenation of

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.450 
have a look at the hydrogenation of
polyunsaturated<00:00:06.660> plant<00:00:07.529> oils<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:08.250> form

margarine margarine is obviously very

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.980 
margarine margarine is obviously very
common<00:00:11.460> substance<00:00:11.940> most<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.420> us<00:00:12.509> use<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.870> in

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
common substance most of us use it in

bread<00:00:14.400> or<00:00:14.610> toast<00:00:14.990> but<00:00:15.990> how<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.320> form<00:00:16.920> it

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
bread or toast but how do we form it

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.540 
bread or toast but how do we form it
it<00:00:18.029> starts<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:18.420> hydrogenation<00:00:19.550> origination

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
it starts with hydrogenation origination

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.359 
it starts with hydrogenation origination
is<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> reaction<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.539> hydrogen<00:00:22.220> Vyra<00:00:23.220> an

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
is the reaction of hydrogen Vyra an

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.630 
is the reaction of hydrogen Vyra an
addition<00:00:23.850> reaction<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> oils<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.490> we

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
addition reaction and the oils that we

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.550 
addition reaction and the oils that we
use<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.269> plant<00:00:27.539> oils<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.109> refers<00:00:28.529> to

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
use there the plant oils that refers to

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.109 
use there the plant oils that refers to
probably<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> most<00:00:29.429> common<00:00:29.789> one<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:29.970> a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
probably the most common one is a

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.410 
probably the most common one is a
sunflower<00:00:30.480> oil<00:00:31.130> maybe<00:00:32.130> olive<00:00:32.430> oil<00:00:32.640> could<00:00:33.329> be

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
sunflower oil maybe olive oil could be

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.090 
sunflower oil maybe olive oil could be
used<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.809> well<00:00:33.960> let's<00:00:34.590> have<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.770> look<00:00:34.800> at<00:00:34.980> this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
used as well let's have a look at this

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.880 
used as well let's have a look at this
concept<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.840> polyunsaturated<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:37.739> make

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
concept of polyunsaturated just make

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.330 
concept of polyunsaturated just make
sure<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.399> clear<00:00:38.670> there<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.540> word<00:00:39.690> poly

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
sure that we clear there the word poly

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.900 
sure that we clear there the word poly
the<00:00:41.340> prefix<00:00:41.700> means<00:00:41.969> many<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.719> then

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
the prefix means many and then

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.040 
the prefix means many and then
unsaturated<00:00:44.910> remember<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.719> we've<00:00:45.870> done

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
unsaturated remember that we've done

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.950 
unsaturated remember that we've done
this<00:00:46.200> work<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.739> unsaturated<00:00:47.520> bond<00:00:48.239> means<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
this work and unsaturated bond means a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
this work and unsaturated bond means a
double<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> triple<00:00:49.829> bond<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:51.050> carbon-carbon

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
double or a triple bond a carbon-carbon

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.479 
double or a triple bond a carbon-carbon
double<00:00:52.230> bond<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> carbon-carbon<00:00:53.309> triple

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
double bond or a carbon-carbon triple

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.900 
double bond or a carbon-carbon triple
bond<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.899> polyunsaturated<00:00:55.469> plant<00:00:56.280> oils<00:00:56.640> mean

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
bond so polyunsaturated plant oils mean

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.869 
bond so polyunsaturated plant oils mean
that<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.329> corn<00:00:57.660> flour<00:00:57.930> oil<00:00:57.960> or<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.890> olive

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
that that corn flour oil or the olive

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.680 
that that corn flour oil or the olive
oil<00:01:00.620> has<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> number<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.370> double<00:01:02.789> carbon-carbon

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
oil has a number of double carbon-carbon

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.330 
oil has a number of double carbon-carbon
bonds<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.949> its<00:01:05.189> chain<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.479> look<00:01:06.659> at<00:01:07.340> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
bonds in its chain if we look at a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.020 
bonds in its chain if we look at a
particular<00:01:09.030> type<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:10.159> plant<00:01:11.159> oil<00:01:11.369> notice<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
particular type of plant oil notice I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
particular type of plant oil notice I
have<00:01:12.180> an<00:01:12.689> R<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> end<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.710> means<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
have an R on the end that means that the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.980 
have an R on the end that means that the
chain<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.790> continues<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> certain

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
chain just continues for a certain

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.719 
chain just continues for a certain
number<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.229> carbons<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.640> in

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
number of carbons but you can see in

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.520 
number of carbons but you can see in
that<00:01:17.880> chain<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.750> particular<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.380> I've

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
that chain this particular one I've

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.999 
that chain this particular one I've
drawn<00:01:19.740> has<00:01:19.950> got<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.400> two<00:01:20.610> three<00:01:20.640> double<00:01:21.479> bonds

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
drawn has got one two three double bonds

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.859 
drawn has got one two three double bonds
so<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.280> many<00:01:23.549> double<00:01:24.390> bonds<00:01:24.570> which

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
so it's got many double bonds which

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
so it's got many double bonds which
means<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.939> polyunsaturated<00:01:28.520> now

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
means that it's polyunsaturated now

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.060 
means that it's polyunsaturated now
because<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.509> those<00:01:30.600> double<00:01:31.020> bonds<00:01:31.229> I've<00:01:31.829> drawn

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
because of those double bonds I've drawn

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.640 
because of those double bonds I've drawn
in<00:01:32.189> blue<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.390> long<00:01:33.659> chain<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.320> notice

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
in blue here that long chain and notice

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.679 
in blue here that long chain and notice
I've<00:01:34.799> drawn<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.090> bunched<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
I've drawn it kind of all bunched up and

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.080 
I've drawn it kind of all bunched up and
in<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.350> kind<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.590> curly<00:01:37.979> way<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.400> that's

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
in a kind of curly way and that's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.550 
in a kind of curly way and that's
because<00:01:39.420> wherever<00:01:39.600> there's<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.930> double<00:01:40.290> bond

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
because wherever there's a double bond

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.490 
because wherever there's a double bond
we<00:01:40.829> end<00:01:41.220> up<00:01:41.369> getting<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.700> kink<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> chain

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
we end up getting a kink in the chain

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.319 
we end up getting a kink in the chain
and<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.950> with<00:01:44.159> those<00:01:44.340> two<00:01:44.520> molecules<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and so with those two molecules that

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.420 
and so with those two molecules that
I've<00:01:45.479> drawn<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.259> blue<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:49.439> bonds

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
I've drawn there in blue the the bonds

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.800 
I've drawn there in blue the the bonds
that<00:01:50.490> form<00:01:50.640> remember<00:01:51.210> those<00:01:51.329> intermolecular

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that form remember those intermolecular

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.539 
that form remember those intermolecular
forces<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.530> I've<00:01:52.740> shown<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.130> red<00:01:53.310> there

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
forces that I've shown in red there

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.980 
forces that I've shown in red there
those<00:01:54.210> bonds<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:56.280> will<00:01:56.689> bond<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> two

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
those bonds are what will bond the two

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.569 
those bonds are what will bond the two
molecules<00:01:58.409> together<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> strength<00:01:59.430> of

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
molecules together and the strength of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.030 
molecules together and the strength of
those<00:01:59.729> forces<00:02:00.030> determines<00:02:00.770> whether<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
those forces determines whether it's a

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.550 
those forces determines whether it's a
solid<00:02:02.399> or<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.640> liquid<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:04.409> these

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
solid or a liquid and because these

have a very small effect of surface area

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.960 
have a very small effect of surface area
and<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.709> remember<00:02:11.099> from<00:02:11.280> our<00:02:11.430> work<00:02:11.670> on

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
and you remember from our work on

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.400 
and you remember from our work on
melting<00:02:12.480> points<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
effective surface area means that they

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.810 
effective surface area means that they
are<00:02:18.030> weak<00:02:18.480> intermolecular<00:02:18.900> forces<00:02:19.820> reminder

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
are weak intermolecular forces reminder

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.790 
are weak intermolecular forces reminder
in<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.090> particular<00:02:21.420> case<00:02:21.840> because<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
in this particular case because it's a

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.580 
in this particular case because it's a
hydrocarbon<00:02:23.580> those<00:02:24.480> weak<00:02:24.750> forces<00:02:25.230> are<00:02:25.410> weak

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
hydrocarbon those weak forces are weak

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.820 
hydrocarbon those weak forces are weak
van<00:02:25.800> der<00:02:25.830> Waals<00:02:26.070> forces<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.990> because<00:02:28.800> of

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
van der Waals forces and so because of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.780 
van der Waals forces and so because of
those<00:02:29.100> weak<00:02:29.310> forces<00:02:29.880> we<00:02:30.240> end<00:02:30.510> up<00:02:30.780> with<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.010> low

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
those weak forces we end up with a a low

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.240 
those weak forces we end up with a a low
melting<00:02:33.060> point<00:02:33.800> for<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.980> particular

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
melting point for that particular

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.500 
melting point for that particular
substance<00:02:35.760> because<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.360> weak

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
substance because of the weak

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.240 
substance because of the weak
intermolecular<00:02:36.870> forces<00:02:37.530> which<00:02:37.980> means

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
intermolecular forces which means

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.420 
intermolecular forces which means
generally<00:02:38.760> at<00:02:38.880> room<00:02:39.060> temperature<00:02:39.920> these<00:02:40.920> oils

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
generally at room temperature these oils

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.850 
generally at room temperature these oils
are<00:02:41.580> liquids<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.690> obviously<00:02:43.020> in<00:02:43.410> terms<00:02:43.650> of

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
are liquids and obviously in terms of

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.330 
are liquids and obviously in terms of
marjorine<00:02:44.340> that's<00:02:45.090> not<00:02:45.270> very<00:02:45.480> practical<00:02:45.780> and

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
marjorine that's not very practical and

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.240 
marjorine that's not very practical and
so<00:02:47.870> chemists<00:02:48.870> use<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.680> process<00:02:50.130> of

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
so chemists use the process of

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.630 
so chemists use the process of
hydrogenation<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:51.810> try<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.200> change<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.340> and

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
hydrogenation to try to change that and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.270 
hydrogenation to try to change that and
increase<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.360> melting<00:02:55.050> point<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:58.530> we<00:02:58.710> take

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
increase the melting point so we take

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.040 
increase the melting point so we take
one<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.460> those<00:02:59.610> polyunsaturated<00:03:00.050> molecules

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
one of those polyunsaturated molecules

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.190 
one of those polyunsaturated molecules
and<00:03:01.320> through<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.190> process<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.730> hydrogenation

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
and through a process of hydrogenation

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.600 
and through a process of hydrogenation
that's<00:03:04.200> reaction<00:03:04.620> of<00:03:04.710> hydrogen<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.190> can<00:03:05.430> see

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
that's reaction of hydrogen you can see

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.310 
that's reaction of hydrogen you can see
there<00:03:05.850> in<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.390> presence<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:06.960> a<00:03:07.080> nickel

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
there in the presence of a nickel

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.830 
there in the presence of a nickel
catalyst<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:08.760> then<00:03:09.740> hydrogenate<00:03:10.740> that

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
catalyst we then hydrogenate that

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.570 
catalyst we then hydrogenate that
particular<00:03:12.840> molecule<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.560> you'll<00:03:13.680> see<00:03:13.890> that

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
particular molecule and you'll see that

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.790 
particular molecule and you'll see that
the<00:03:15.360> product<00:03:15.750> there<00:03:15.960> has<00:03:16.260> none<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.650> those

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
the product there has none of those

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.150 
the product there has none of those

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
double bonds present anymore they've all

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.550

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.470 
been hydrogenated hydrogen's been added
across<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:22.980> double<00:03:23.130> bond<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.640> we<00:03:24.090> now<00:03:24.240> just

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
across the double bond and we now just

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.560 
across the double bond and we now just
have<00:03:24.600> single<00:03:25.560> bonds<00:03:25.740> through<00:03:26.280> that

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
have single bonds through that

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.980 
have single bonds through that
particular<00:03:27.570> oil<00:03:28.110> molecule<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.340> if<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:29.760> now

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
particular oil molecule and if I now

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.360 
particular oil molecule and if I now
draw<00:03:30.990> those<00:03:31.590> molecules

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
draw those molecules

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.420 
draw those molecules
you'll<00:03:32.970> notice<00:03:33.240> that<00:03:33.500> we<00:03:34.500> because<00:03:35.160> we<00:03:35.280> don't

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
you'll notice that we because we don't

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.690 
you'll notice that we because we don't
have<00:03:35.550> any<00:03:35.700> double<00:03:36.000> bonds<00:03:36.180> now<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:38.490> chain

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
have any double bonds now the the chain

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.490 
have any double bonds now the the chain
doesn't<00:03:38.910> kink<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.420> Bend<00:03:39.630> back<00:03:39.840> on<00:03:40.020> itself<00:03:40.320> and

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
doesn't kink and Bend back on itself and

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.740 
doesn't kink and Bend back on itself and
so<00:03:40.709> they<00:03:41.280> tend<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:41.610> be<00:03:41.730> long<00:03:41.940> straight<00:03:42.390> chains

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
so they tend to be long straight chains

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.630 
so they tend to be long straight chains
and<00:03:43.170> you'll<00:03:43.560> know<00:03:43.770> from<00:03:43.920> our<00:03:44.100> work<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.489> long

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
and you'll know from our work that long

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.580 
and you'll know from our work that long
straight<00:03:45.030> chains<00:03:45.330> mean<00:03:45.600> more<00:03:45.989> intermolecular

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
straight chains mean more intermolecular

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.090 
straight chains mean more intermolecular
forces<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.660> that<00:03:48.660> means<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.380> each<00:03:49.739> molecule

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
forces and that means that each molecule

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.729 
forces and that means that each molecule
has<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.610> much<00:03:50.850> greater<00:03:50.930> effect<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:52.380> surface

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
has a much greater effect of surface

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.260 
has a much greater effect of surface
area<00:03:53.040> because<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.520> a<00:03:53.610> long<00:03:53.820> straight

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
area because it's a long straight

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.890 
area because it's a long straight
molecule<00:03:54.750> now<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:56.160> results<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:56.900> much

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
molecule now and that results in much

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.660 
molecule now and that results in much
stronger<00:03:58.320> intermolecular<00:03:58.650> forces<00:03:59.370> they

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
stronger intermolecular forces they

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.190 
stronger intermolecular forces they
still<00:03:59.970> friend<00:04:00.150> of<00:04:00.239> ours<00:04:00.390> forces<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.959> same

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
still friend of ours forces the same

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.880 
still friend of ours forces the same
kinds<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:02.160> they<00:04:02.310> much<00:04:02.489> stronger<00:04:03.020> and<00:04:04.020> because

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
kinds but they much stronger and because

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.199 
kinds but they much stronger and because
the<00:04:05.040> intermolecular<00:04:05.430> forces<00:04:05.880> are<00:04:06.090> now

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
the intermolecular forces are now

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.479 
the intermolecular forces are now
stronger<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:07.080> means<00:04:07.290> about<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.950> has<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.190> higher

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
stronger it means about it has a higher

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.120 
stronger it means about it has a higher
melting<00:04:08.760> point<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.420> so<00:04:10.140> those<00:04:10.350> plant<00:04:10.709> oils

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
melting point and so those plant oils

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.220 
melting point and so those plant oils
that<00:04:11.340> we<00:04:11.520> started<00:04:12.030> with<00:04:12.209> which<00:04:12.480> had<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:13.020> low

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
that we started with which had a low

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.630 
that we started with which had a low
melting<00:04:13.500> point<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.040> we're<00:04:14.190> liquid<00:04:14.489> at<00:04:14.610> room

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
melting point and we're liquid at room

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.000 
melting point and we're liquid at room
temperature<00:04:15.290> through<00:04:16.290> this<00:04:16.410> process<00:04:16.650> of

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
temperature through this process of

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.729 
temperature through this process of
hydrogenation<00:04:17.340> we<00:04:17.970> have<00:04:18.090> now<00:04:18.299> increased<00:04:19.169> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
hydrogenation we have now increased the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.279 
hydrogenation we have now increased the
melting<00:04:20.489> point<00:04:20.730> and<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.510> at<00:04:21.570> room<00:04:21.720> temperature

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
melting point and so at room temperature

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.219 
melting point and so at room temperature
our<00:04:22.410> marjorine<00:04:22.950> now<00:04:23.190> is<00:04:24.150> slightly<00:04:24.539> more<00:04:24.840> solid

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
our marjorine now is slightly more solid

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.090 
our marjorine now is slightly more solid
and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
and

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.730 
and
we<00:04:26.430> were<00:04:26.490> able<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.790> package<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.900> in<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.140> tab<00:04:28.350> and

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
we were able to package it in a tab and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.770 
we were able to package it in a tab and
you<00:04:28.890> can<00:04:29.070> use<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.400> to<00:04:29.610> then<00:04:29.790> spread<00:04:30.450> on<00:04:30.630> your

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
you can use it to then spread on your

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.530 
you can use it to then spread on your
bread<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:32.220> we<00:04:32.340> then<00:04:32.520> say<00:04:32.820> that<00:04:33.090> those

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
bread and so we then say that those

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.350 
bread and so we then say that those
plant<00:04:33.960> oils<00:04:34.320> have<00:04:34.530> been<00:04:34.560> hardened<00:04:35.490> through<00:04:36.270> a

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
plant oils have been hardened through a

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.870 
plant oils have been hardened through a
process<00:04:36.840> of<00:04:37.050> hydrogenation<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.670> form

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
process of hydrogenation to form

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.300 
process of hydrogenation to form
margarine<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:40.590> reaction<00:04:41.040> was<00:04:41.280> that

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
margarine and the reaction was that

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.760 
margarine and the reaction was that
polyunsaturated<00:04:42.170> molecule<00:04:43.170> reacting<00:04:43.620> with

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
polyunsaturated molecule reacting with

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.740 
polyunsaturated molecule reacting with
hydrogen<00:04:44.280> in<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:45.000> presence<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.450> a<00:04:45.540> nickel

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
hydrogen in the presence of a nickel

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.940 
hydrogen in the presence of a nickel
catalyst<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:47.070> hydrogenate<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.800> form<00:04:49.800> the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
catalyst to hydrogenate it and form the

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.850 
catalyst to hydrogenate it and form the
margarine<00:04:50.340> that<00:04:50.520> we're<00:04:50.700> after
