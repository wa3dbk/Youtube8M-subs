00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.960
 back on destiny comment on have you at 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.490
 the less it goes nickel 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.080
 we find ourselves today all 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.840
 just for a new soil flap 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.190
 of two groups the part of the bridge I 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.949
 will activate the bridge and my colleagues 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.480
 will have to wedge themselves deep from this piece 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.250
 it looks a bit strangely at all 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.890
 first glitch they had but that 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.589
 was changed we will not stay pot 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.180
 in the first part of this map pro 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.940
 skype and here it will be necessary 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.799
 past the pulse it will just be enough 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.620
 only person to go i 'm going to you 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:58.089
 to see so the little dance 4 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.799
 seconds and so let's go away people 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.590
 put a right my a range to 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.019
 left 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.920
 without the plates put off that misleading 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.830
 of course I'm going to present here good 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.790
 so I advise you actually in 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.890
 my time right and left 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.990
 I said we will put under the bridge 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.510
 to wait until the bridge is open 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.720
 of course after she has to conceive 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.130
 open well you get off the carrier 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.780
 from the sword to segodo who will do it 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.050
 and menu choice a little corner for the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.050
 finish 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.180
 this is the franc is built excuse me 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.399
 a reverse or coffee so that's when 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.479
 we retrieve the sword will cross the 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:49.950
 boxes what trying to kill the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.950
 second carrier who has the other side 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.850
 I think there will be a fail he will 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.399
 to fall he's going to commit suicide in fact that 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.909
 of ovalia scare the hercules and 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.820
 backward push back down it's enough 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.200
 nice a laugh that time so 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.890
 here it is going to have you see the little 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.750
 lamp that right 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.670
 there is even there on the left and in fact he is going 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.890
 hide behind this lamp on the left 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.380
 so the plates actually I do not know 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.110
 why do not you ask me that celestini 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.360
 this is the game that is behind this 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.670
 little lamp the right plates and 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.980
 left does not activate if 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.459
 your share on two the side is ok 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.709
 activate 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.410
 so here is the bass and center know 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.340
 from Sinai and I told myself music said 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.340
 accelerated touched 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.880
 so that's how you could 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.620
 glimpse on the accelerated but I 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.300
 did not have a lot of bullets actually 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.440
 we know that a balmont 5 like so you 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.140
 not much in fact 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.660
 on these parts there is rather the 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.170
 colleagues when everything decidedly does that 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.570
 change a little 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.760
 so here are the three radiant energy 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.530
 super as usual shit 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.940
