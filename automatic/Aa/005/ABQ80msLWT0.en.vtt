00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
is a bottle brush that would fit down

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.779 
is a bottle brush that would fit down
inside<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.899> bottles<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:56.070> instance<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.550> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
inside of bottles for instance I have a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.389 
inside of bottles for instance I have a
12-ounce<00:00:57.329> bottle<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.949> guy<00:00:59.070> would

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
12-ounce bottle here and this guy would

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.479 
12-ounce bottle here and this guy would
simply<00:00:59.789> fit<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.329> into<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.070> kind<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.160> hard<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
simply fit down into it kind of hard to

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.329 
simply fit down into it kind of hard to
get<00:01:02.730> into<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.329> it'll<00:01:03.449> spring<00:01:04.290> out<00:01:04.619> once

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
get into it and it'll spring out once

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.429 
get into it and it'll spring out once
you<00:01:05.519> get<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> down<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:07.549> like<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.439> pops

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
you get it down in there like so pops

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.590 
you get it down in there like so pops
out<00:01:10.740> inside<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> bottle<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.820> gets<00:01:11.970> all<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
out inside the bottle so it gets all the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.170 
out inside the bottle so it gets all the
different<00:01:13.350> contact<00:01:13.979> points<00:01:14.520> inside<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.060> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
different contact points inside of it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.999 
different contact points inside of it
and<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> cleans<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:15.960> really<00:01:16.320> nice<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.890> easy

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and it cleans it up really nice and easy

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.730 
and it cleans it up really nice and easy
and<00:01:17.340> then<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> last<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.840> would<00:01:19.020> mention<00:01:19.380> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and then the last one I would mention is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.570 
and then the last one I would mention is
our<00:01:20.549> carboy<00:01:21.060> brush<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.290> carboy<00:01:22.799> brush<00:01:23.130> has

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
this l-shaped angle to it so that you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120 
this l-shaped angle to it so that you
can<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.720> up<00:01:27.780> inside<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> neck<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
can get up inside of the neck of a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.420 
can get up inside of the neck of a
carboy<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:30.689> these<00:01:31.020> brushes<00:01:31.409> started<00:01:32.189> about

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
carboy so these brushes started about

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.330 
carboy so these brushes started about
three<00:01:32.970> dollars<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.689> they<00:01:33.750> go<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> about<00:01:34.530> seven

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
three dollars and they go to about seven

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.569 
three dollars and they go to about seven
dollars<00:01:35.520> okay<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.930> different<00:01:37.680> applications

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
dollars okay so different applications

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.859 
dollars okay so different applications
different<00:01:39.240> shapes<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.390> brush<00:01:42.630> for

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
different shapes of the brush for

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.960 
different shapes of the brush for
different<00:01:43.229> applications<00:01:43.520> for<00:01:44.520> instance<00:01:44.820> in

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
different applications for instance in

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.880 
different applications for instance in
this<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.869> get<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.170> into<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.500> top<00:01:46.710> of

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
this one so I can get up into the top of

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.980 
this one so I can get up into the top of
that<00:01:46.979> car<00:01:47.250> boy<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.729> all<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> way<00:01:48.540> down<00:01:48.780> each
