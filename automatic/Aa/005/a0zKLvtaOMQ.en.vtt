00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:19.170
 welcome everyone today we are going to 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.390
 Venetian and style close to 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.130
 classical, that is, we will make masks 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.820
 and take get such a recession present 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.190
 mode to prepare for plaster 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.579
 required and perfect defense of the fuel on 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.610
 truth then painted with paint in 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.770
 In this case, of course, let's say because 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.989
 the rink as killed the walls and no we did not spend 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.719
 also not mine but it was done under the knives as 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.960
 consultation unfortunately we have after 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.440
 long days of work was just such 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.949
 detailed wall with mod different such 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.049
 by moments 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.750
 let's say the most important moments we 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.080
 of course stuffed roughly 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.520
 megane ching plaster 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:19.850
 here but nevertheless nevertheless none 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:24.830
 less unfortunately that has and 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:34.020
 what do we hope to do 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:36.539
 following our say let's put the people 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.100
 we will be in dressura and the first first layer 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.039
 will apply 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.179
 let's say so leaving the first small 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:02:23.849
 spaces for the subsequent drawing 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:02:26.730
 pattern used for this 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.819
 this year the venetian to spirit perfectly 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.739
 firms and gave 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.470
 which can be used as a hunter 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:41.040
 its not quite at all is 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:44.970
 personal reasons and after our 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:49.049
 first layer is fully applied next 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.930
 layer two do it about 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.720
 also while closing our whites 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.040
 gaps in the animal Sasha masked paw 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.040
 laybu lay down on plus 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.980
 so after complete drying our 2 2 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.800
 its we put the third final layer 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.410
 in the same light as the first second layer 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.410
 but let's say so small 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.349
 after we say so our third 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.530
 the layer is completely dry my nonsense gives 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.020
 gloss 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.120
 final i will say so you definition 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.770
 the woods of the world 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:54.319
 attach with a spatula with 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:56.449
 voting here so convenient and let's say 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:59.330
 so here it is on acquires already 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.680
 completely finished glitters and 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:06.940
 overflows 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.940
 with you was Sergey before new meetings 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.349
 not
