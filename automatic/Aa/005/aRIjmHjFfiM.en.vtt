hooked<00:03:44.310> up<00:03:44.580> because<00:03:44.760> it's<00:03:45.120> got<00:03:45.330> a<00:03:46.070> slot<00:03:47.070> in<00:03:47.430> one

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
hooked up because it's got a slot in one

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.140 
hooked up because it's got a slot in one
hand<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:49.650> tab<00:03:49.950> in<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.370> other<00:03:50.490> hand<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.940> tab

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
hand and a tab in the other hand the tab

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.710 
hand and a tab in the other hand the tab
goes<00:03:51.420> in<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.020> then<00:03:52.610> folds<00:03:53.610> so<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.330> order<00:03:54.450> to

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
goes in and then folds so in order to

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.350 
goes in and then folds so in order to
remove<00:03:55.110> it<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.920> have<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.190> bring<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.760> up<00:03:57.000> and

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
remove it you have to bring it up and

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.550 
remove it you have to bring it up and
then<00:03:58.640> then<00:03:59.640> remove<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.840> put<00:04:00.990> it<00:04:01.110> back<00:04:01.290> in

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
then then remove it to put it back in

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.260 
then then remove it to put it back in
there<00:04:01.770> there<00:04:02.670> are<00:04:02.790> two<00:04:03.000> tabs<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:05.000> here<00:04:06.000> on<00:04:06.150> the

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
there there are two tabs in here on the

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.580 
there there are two tabs in here on the
inside<00:04:07.190> these<00:04:08.190> tabs<00:04:08.610> are<00:04:08.880> flat<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:09.600> then

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
inside these tabs are flat and then

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.610 
inside these tabs are flat and then
groove<00:04:10.950> over<00:04:11.190> here<00:04:11.730> oops<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.960> grooves<00:04:13.290> over

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
groove over here oops the grooves over

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.180 
groove over here oops the grooves over
here<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:17.430> match<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.910> groove<00:04:18.680> with<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.860> with

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
here you match the groove with it with

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.590 
here you match the groove with it with
an<00:04:20.280> angle<00:04:20.730> like<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.750> go<00:04:21.989> in<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:24.680> then

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
an angle like that you go in and then

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.030 
an angle like that you go in and then
straighten<00:04:27.600> it<00:04:27.750> then<00:04:28.170> it<00:04:28.350> stays<00:04:28.650> dat<00:04:28.920> it

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
straighten it then it stays dat it

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.890 
straighten it then it stays dat it
doesn't<00:04:29.340> fall<00:04:29.550> off<00:04:30.140> yeah<00:04:31.140> so<00:04:31.880> bring<00:04:32.880> it<00:04:33.030> up<00:04:33.240> and

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
doesn't fall off yeah so bring it up and

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.170 
doesn't fall off yeah so bring it up and
slide<00:04:34.560> it<00:04:34.770> out<00:04:36.080> so<00:04:37.080> now<00:04:37.290> we<00:04:38.100> disassembled<00:04:39.000> that

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
slide it out so now we disassembled that

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.850 
slide it out so now we disassembled that
that<00:04:39.480> we<00:04:39.570> need<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.900> do<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.230> same<00:04:40.470> thing<00:04:40.680> with

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
that we need to do the same thing with

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.760 
that we need to do the same thing with
another<00:04:41.160> link<00:04:41.490> to<00:04:41.760> remove<00:04:42.330> one<00:04:42.570> of<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.780> links

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:05:02.520 

we<00:04:46.770> do<00:04:46.920> the<00:04:47.040> same<00:04:47.250> thing<00:04:47.580> with<00:04:48.360> this<00:04:48.570> one

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.300 

you<00:05:03.530> may<00:05:03.650> have<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:04.039> sometimes<00:05:04.460> grab<00:05:04.789> a<00:05:06.310> needle

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
you may have to sometimes grab a needle

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.080 
you may have to sometimes grab a needle
nose<00:05:07.340> or<00:05:07.729> something<00:05:07.909> and<00:05:08.240> pull<00:05:08.419> it<00:05:08.539> out<00:05:10.090> here's

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
nose or something and pull it out here's

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.550 
nose or something and pull it out here's
the<00:05:11.389> next<00:05:11.629> link<00:05:11.960> I<00:05:12.169> mean<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.650> pan<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:14.930> this

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
the next link I mean the pan and this

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:23.409 
the next link I mean the pan and this
link<00:05:15.919> you<00:05:16.340> fold<00:05:16.970> it<00:05:17.210> and<00:05:17.530> remove<00:05:18.530> it<00:05:22.300> then<00:05:23.300> you

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
link you fold it and remove it then you

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.770 
link you fold it and remove it then you
get<00:05:23.629> this<00:05:23.840> one<00:05:25.270> reversal<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.360> watch<00:05:26.509> with<00:05:26.690> the

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
get this one reversal to watch with the

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.430 
get this one reversal to watch with the
band<00:05:27.020> and<00:05:27.349> in<00:05:28.129> an<00:05:28.280> angle<00:05:28.669> go<00:05:29.240> in<00:05:29.479> into<00:05:30.319> the

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
band and in an angle go in into the

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.899 
band and in an angle go in into the
groove<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:33.550> then<00:05:34.550> flatten<00:05:35.240> it<00:05:36.490> hold<00:05:37.490> it<00:05:37.729> like

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
groove and then flatten it hold it like

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.700 
groove and then flatten it hold it like
that<00:05:37.940> so<00:05:38.300> it<00:05:38.419> doesn't<00:05:38.780> come<00:05:39.319> out<00:05:39.349> of<00:05:39.530> the

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
that so it doesn't come out of the

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.230 
that so it doesn't come out of the
groove<00:05:40.009> and<00:05:41.889> insert<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:43.099> pin<00:05:43.810> the<00:05:44.810> flag<00:05:45.229> pan

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
groove and insert the pin the flag pan

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.839 
groove and insert the pin the flag pan
in<00:05:47.240> there<00:05:50.949> you<00:05:51.949> can<00:05:52.129> I<00:05:52.219> guess<00:05:52.400> give<00:05:52.729> it<00:05:52.819> a

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
in there you can I guess give it a

00:05:52.849 --> 00:06:01.240 
in there you can I guess give it a
little<00:05:53.030> tap<00:05:56.830> and<00:05:57.830> there<00:05:58.099> it<00:05:58.250> is<00:05:59.889> ready<00:06:00.889> to<00:06:01.099> go

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
little tap and there it is ready to go

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.839 
little tap and there it is ready to go
and<00:06:01.520> then<00:06:01.699> there's<00:06:02.300> another<00:06:02.479> adjustment<00:06:03.849> on

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
and then there's another adjustment on

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:10.390 
and then there's another adjustment on
the<00:06:07.120> another<00:06:08.120> which<00:06:08.300> color<00:06:08.599> goes<00:06:08.840> dead<00:06:09.400> the

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
the another which color goes dead the

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.029 
the another which color goes dead the
lock<00:06:10.639> mechanism<00:06:10.990> has<00:06:11.990> more<00:06:12.319> holes<00:06:12.620> that<00:06:12.889> you

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
lock mechanism has more holes that you

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.550 
lock mechanism has more holes that you
can<00:06:13.159> adjust<00:06:13.310> but<00:06:13.789> these<00:06:14.539> may<00:06:14.870> not<00:06:15.050> be<00:06:15.229> enough

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
can adjust but these may not be enough

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.649 
can adjust but these may not be enough
for<00:06:15.740> adjustment<00:06:16.400> so<00:06:16.639> you<00:06:16.669> may<00:06:17.150> have<00:06:17.330> to<00:06:17.509> remove

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
for adjustment so you may have to remove

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.350 
for adjustment so you may have to remove
the<00:06:17.960> legs<00:06:18.199> that's<00:06:18.469> what<00:06:18.710> we<00:06:18.830> did<00:06:19.039> here<00:06:19.370> if<00:06:20.150> I

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
the legs that's what we did here if I

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.930 
the legs that's what we did here if I
need<00:06:20.539> to<00:06:20.659> adjust<00:06:20.750> it<00:06:21.110> furthermore<00:06:21.740> I<00:06:21.800> can<00:06:22.250> move

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
need to adjust it furthermore I can move

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.110 
need to adjust it furthermore I can move
that<00:06:23.210> pin<00:06:24.250> right<00:06:25.250> then<00:06:25.430> it's<00:06:25.580> at<00:06:25.699> the<00:06:25.819> end<00:06:26.000> I

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
that pin right then it's at the end I

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.559 
that pin right then it's at the end I
can<00:06:26.150> just<00:06:26.449> move<00:06:26.599> it<00:06:26.810> forward<00:06:28.029> to<00:06:29.029> adjust<00:06:29.419> that

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:29.569 
can just move it forward to adjust that

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:33.129 
can just move it forward to adjust that
make<00:06:29.779> it<00:06:29.930> even<00:06:30.169> smaller<00:06:30.469> and<00:06:31.779> then<00:06:32.779> we<00:06:32.870> put

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139 
make it even smaller and then we put

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:38.529 
make it even smaller and then we put
this<00:06:33.490> other<00:06:34.490> pan<00:06:34.879> back<00:06:35.150> in<00:06:35.389> there<00:06:36.039> and<00:06:37.539> then

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
this other pan back in there and then

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:46.930 
this other pan back in there and then
we're<00:06:38.719> done<00:06:38.870> so<00:06:40.930> slide<00:06:41.930> the<00:06:42.169> pan<00:06:42.440> in<00:06:42.620> there

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:54.770 

put<00:06:47.940> one<00:06:48.180> end<00:06:48.480> into<00:06:48.720> the<00:06:48.960> hole<00:06:49.170> you<00:06:53.600> got<00:06:54.600> to<00:06:54.690> be

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
put one end into the hole you got to be

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.410 
put one end into the hole you got to be
careful<00:06:55.020> with<00:06:55.320> this<00:06:55.500> one<00:06:55.560> because<00:06:56.420> while

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
careful with this one because while

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.470 
careful with this one because while
you're<00:06:57.660> trying<00:06:57.840> to<00:06:57.990> push<00:06:58.760> this<00:06:59.760> spring-loaded

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
you're trying to push this spring-loaded

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.810
