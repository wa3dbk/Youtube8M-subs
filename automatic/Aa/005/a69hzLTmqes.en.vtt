year

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
year

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400 
year
and<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.660> came<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.230> pretty

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
and it came with some pretty

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.290 
and it came with some pretty
good-looking<00:00:32.009> bands<00:00:32.219> such<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.759> sport

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
good-looking bands such as the sport

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.430 
good-looking bands such as the sport
band<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.840> actually<00:00:34.230> really

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
band which is actually really

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.620 
band which is actually really
comfortable<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.550> Milanese<00:00:35.940> loop<00:00:35.969> which<00:00:36.480> is

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
comfortable the Milanese loop which is

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.360 
comfortable the Milanese loop which is
the<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.110> review<00:00:37.380> today<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.190> love

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
the one on the review today and the love

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.250 
the one on the review today and the love
the<00:00:38.489> loop<00:00:38.670> which<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.149> will<00:00:39.390> probably<00:00:39.629> review<00:00:40.140> in

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the loop which I will probably review in

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.330 
the loop which I will probably review in
the<00:00:40.320> few<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> future

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the few in the future

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
the few in the future
so<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.850> melon<00:00:42.149> needs<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:42.989> cost

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so the melon needs to have actually cost

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.639 
so the melon needs to have actually cost
150<00:00:44.190> dollars<00:00:44.520> however<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.840> can't<00:00:46.140> find<00:00:46.469> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
150 dollars however you can't find it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:47.560 
150 dollars however you can't find it
yourself

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
yourself

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.069

eBay now this band right here knowing
these<00:00:54.840> loop<00:00:55.230> third-party<00:00:56.070> fake<00:00:57.199> it<00:00:58.199> looks

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
these loop third-party fake it looks

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.340 
these loop third-party fake it looks
just<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.430> regular<00:00:59.609> one<00:01:00.000> from<00:01:00.180> Apple<00:01:00.570> as

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
you can see right here the match is

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.080 
you can see right here the match is
pretty<00:01:03.570> good<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:05.100> magnets<00:01:05.640> are<00:01:05.790> pretty

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
pretty good the magnets are pretty

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.700 
pretty good the magnets are pretty
strong<00:01:06.420> maybe<00:01:06.720> even<00:01:07.049> stronger<00:01:07.380> than<00:01:07.530> they

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
strong maybe even stronger than they

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.730 
strong maybe even stronger than they
should<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.549> let's<00:01:09.030> go<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.500> attach<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
should be so let's go and attach the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
should be so let's go and attach the
back<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.880> attach<00:01:12.479> anywhere<00:01:13.110> over

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
back here and just attach anywhere over

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.499 
back here and just attach anywhere over
on<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> other<00:01:13.830> side<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> band<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.240> can

so we're actually gonna try out the the
middle<00:01:28.380> needs<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.890> right<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.869> here

apple watch that's kind of dirty in the
back<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.420> Milanese<00:01:39.840> loop<00:01:40.110> third<00:01:40.590> party

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
back to the Milanese loop third party

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.560 
back to the Milanese loop third party
van<00:01:41.159> or<00:01:41.400> fake<00:01:42.119> uh<00:01:43.040> so<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.610> site<00:01:44.970> by<00:01:45.299> side

van or fake uh so this is a site by side

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.389 
van or fake uh so this is a site by side
comparison<00:01:46.140> now<00:01:46.439> we're<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.770> actually<00:01:47.250> gonna

we're so it's actually it's actually a
bit<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.229> workaround<00:02:01.560> because<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.430> melon

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
bit of a workaround because the melon

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.370 
bit of a workaround because the melon
needs<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.030> cook<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> bit<00:02:03.840> messy<00:02:04.200> but

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
needs to cook get it a bit messy but

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.649 
needs to cook get it a bit messy but
that's<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.280> real<00:02:05.399> one<00:02:05.640> from<00:02:06.210> Apple

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
that's just like the real one from Apple

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.779 
that's just like the real one from Apple
and<00:02:06.810> you're<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.619> simply<00:02:07.979> gonna<00:02:08.129> find<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
and you're just simply gonna find the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.910 
and you're just simply gonna find the
adapters<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.479> input<00:02:09.840> them

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
adapters and input them

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.360 
adapters and input them
how<00:02:12.490> am<00:02:12.550> i<00:02:12.610> doing<00:02:12.850> is<00:02:12.940> correct<00:02:13.980> actually<00:02:14.980> this

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
how am i doing is correct actually this

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.070 
how am i doing is correct actually this
way<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.910> put<00:02:19.120> them<00:02:19.240> there<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.660> then

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
way and you put them there and then

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.150 
way and you put them there and then
you're<00:02:20.230> gonna<00:02:20.319> do<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.560> same<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.130> other

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
you're gonna do the same to the other

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.809 
you're gonna do the same to the other
side

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.640 

there<00:02:30.819> we<00:02:30.940> go<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:32.099> now<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.160> put<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.640> on<00:02:34.650> well

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
there we go so now to put it on well

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.020 
there we go so now to put it on well
first<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:36.010> all<00:02:36.069> let's<00:02:36.280> just<00:02:36.430> see<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:36.849> this

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
first of all let's just see it like this

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.699 
first of all let's just see it like this
right<00:02:37.239> now<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.420> can<00:02:37.720> see<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.080> it<00:02:38.200> does<00:02:38.440> look

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
right now you can see that it does look

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.790 
right now you can see that it does look
pretty<00:02:38.950> incredible<00:02:39.870> looks<00:02:40.870> really<00:02:41.230> shiny

pretty incredible looks really shiny
no<00:02:42.489> no<00:02:43.000> flaws<00:02:43.300> in<00:02:43.540> here<00:02:43.780> no<00:02:44.349> recognizable

no no flaws in here no recognizable
flaws<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.959> see<00:02:47.080> how<00:02:47.200> strong<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.950> magnet<00:02:48.340> is

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
flaws you see how strong the magnet is

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.160 
flaws you see how strong the magnet is
it<00:02:48.610> can<00:02:48.730> actually<00:02:49.120> stick<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.690> whole<00:02:49.870> thing

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
it can actually stick the whole thing

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.010 
it can actually stick the whole thing
together<00:02:50.819> now<00:02:51.819> we're<00:02:52.420> actually<00:02:52.480> gonna<00:02:52.780> put

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
together now we're actually gonna put

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.270 
together now we're actually gonna put
this<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.350> my<00:02:54.450> left<00:02:55.450> wrist<00:02:55.660> here<00:02:56.550> simply<00:02:57.550> just

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
this on my left wrist here simply just

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.280 
this on my left wrist here simply just
tight<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:00.459> around<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:02.730> there<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:03.850> go<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:05.140> this

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
tight it around and there you go so this

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.190 
tight it around and there you go so this
is<00:03:05.350> how<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.760> fake<00:03:06.760> Milanese<00:03:07.390> loop<00:03:07.420> looks<00:03:07.989> like

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
is how the fake Milanese loop looks like

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.979 
is how the fake Milanese loop looks like
you<00:03:08.950> can<00:03:09.340> actually<00:03:09.459> see<00:03:09.819> there's<00:03:10.090> no<00:03:10.360> there's

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
you can actually see there's no there's

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.650 
you can actually see there's no there's
no<00:03:11.230> real<00:03:11.650> thing<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.400> can<00:03:12.549> notice<00:03:12.970> to

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
no real thing that you can notice to

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.050 
no real thing that you can notice to
find<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.260> see<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.739> it's<00:03:14.950> it's<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.489> fake<00:03:15.790> one

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
find to see that it's it's the fake one

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.390 
find to see that it's it's the fake one
it<00:03:16.630> just<00:03:16.660> looks<00:03:17.170> like<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.500> real<00:03:17.709> apple

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
it just looks like the real apple

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.170 
it just looks like the real apple
Milanese<00:03:18.880> loop<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:21.250> looks<00:03:21.459> really<00:03:21.819> good<00:03:22.030> in<00:03:22.150> my

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
Milanese loop it looks really good in my

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.240 
Milanese loop it looks really good in my
opinion<00:03:22.720> looks<00:03:22.810> really<00:03:23.110> shiny

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
opinion looks really shiny

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.490 
opinion looks really shiny
didn't<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.390> a<00:03:25.450> lot<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.630> prompts<00:03:25.959> for<00:03:26.080> it

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
didn't you get a lot of prompts for it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.650 
didn't you get a lot of prompts for it
now<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.489> things<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.910> do<00:03:28.120> want<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.450> point

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
now so things that I do want to point

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.280 
now so things that I do want to point
out<00:03:28.900> was<00:03:29.459> yes<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.489> Milanese<00:03:31.239> loop<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:32.080> fake

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
out was yes the Milanese loop the fake

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.500 
out was yes the Milanese loop the fake
one<00:03:32.530> does<00:03:32.769> look<00:03:33.069> really<00:03:33.340> great<00:03:33.609> from<00:03:34.060> long

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
one does look really great from long

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.860 
one does look really great from long
distance<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.230> people<00:03:38.670> actually<00:03:39.670> they<00:03:40.600> won't

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
distance and people actually they won't

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.020 
distance and people actually they won't
recognize<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.500> at<00:03:41.650> all<00:03:41.769> it's<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.130> fake<00:03:42.370> even

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
recognize that at all it's a fake even

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.470 
recognize that at all it's a fake even
from<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.239> closed<00:03:43.540> point<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:44.140> view<00:03:44.290> however<00:03:45.480> the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
from a closed point of view however the

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.960 
from a closed point of view however the
person<00:03:46.840> wearing<00:03:47.109> it<00:03:47.410> will<00:03:47.680> recognize<00:03:48.190> one

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
person wearing it will recognize one

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.050 
person wearing it will recognize one
minor<00:03:49.359> flaw<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:50.079> this<00:03:50.769> Apple<00:03:51.459> watch<00:03:51.640> band

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
minor flaw that this Apple watch band

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.340 
minor flaw that this Apple watch band
did<00:03:52.480> have<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:53.709> is<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:54.420> mesh<00:03:55.420> is<00:03:55.930> really

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
did have and that is the mesh is really

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.740 
did have and that is the mesh is really
great<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.739> mesh<00:03:56.920> on<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.340> it's<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.540> little

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
great the mesh on it it's the little

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.470 
great the mesh on it it's the little
little<00:03:59.410> patterning<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.489> brings<00:04:00.820> it's<00:04:01.269> all

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
little patterning it brings it's all

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.759 
little patterning it brings it's all
great<00:04:02.579> until<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.670> very<00:04:03.940> very<00:04:04.299> end<00:04:04.780> so<00:04:05.260> the

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
great until the very very end so the

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.780 
great until the very very end so the
bottom<00:04:06.130> to<00:04:06.280> top<00:04:06.489> it's<00:04:07.030> great<00:04:07.920> right<00:04:08.920> until<00:04:09.640> I'm

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
bottom to top it's great right until I'm

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.160 
bottom to top it's great right until I'm
not<00:04:09.940> sure<00:04:10.120> if<00:04:10.209> this<00:04:10.269> cameras<00:04:10.630> gonna<00:04:10.810> be<00:04:11.079> able

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
not sure if this cameras gonna be able

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.460 
not sure if this cameras gonna be able
to<00:04:11.320> focus<00:04:11.709> but<00:04:11.920> right<00:04:12.340> here<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.700> can<00:04:12.850> notice

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
to focus but right here you can notice

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.460 
to focus but right here you can notice
the<00:04:14.470> mesh<00:04:14.769> kind<00:04:15.069> of<00:04:15.190> breaks<00:04:16.000> out<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.630> its<00:04:17.109> line

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
the mesh kind of breaks out of its line

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.430 
the mesh kind of breaks out of its line
where<00:04:18.070> it's<00:04:18.190> supposed<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.579> be<00:04:19.169> right<00:04:20.169> there

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
where it's supposed to be right there

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.230 
where it's supposed to be right there
and<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.859> goes<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.160> little<00:04:21.430> bit<00:04:21.700> off<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:22.060> that's

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240
