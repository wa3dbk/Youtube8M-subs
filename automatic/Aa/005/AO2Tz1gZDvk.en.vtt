my tongues pretty swollen well it's not
as<00:00:57.329> swollen<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.109> probably<00:00:58.500> gonna<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.890> so

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.070 

but<00:01:02.489> um<00:01:04.280> getting<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.460> pierced<00:01:05.720> wasn't<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.900> bad

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
but um getting it pierced wasn't so bad

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.410 
but um getting it pierced wasn't so bad
the<00:01:07.880> clamp<00:01:08.880> was<00:01:09.330> pretty<00:01:09.659> rough<00:01:11.150> like<00:01:12.150> they

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the clamp was pretty rough like they

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600 
the clamp was pretty rough like they
have<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.630> put<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.170> tightly<00:01:13.610> which

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
have to put it on really tightly which

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
have to put it on really tightly which
you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.479> makes<00:01:15.659> sense<00:01:15.960> because<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.439> it's

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
you know makes sense because if it's

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.429 
you know makes sense because if it's
slips<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.310> could<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:18.000> disaster<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.170> I

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
slips that could be like a disaster so I

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.039 
slips that could be like a disaster so I
put<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> clamp<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.939> tightly<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.689> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
put the clamp on really tightly and it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.929 
put the clamp on really tightly and it
kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.320> hurts<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.310> once<00:01:23.759> they

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
kind of hurts and then like once they

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.830 
kind of hurts and then like once they
once<00:01:24.390> he<00:01:24.630> took<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> clamp<00:01:25.320> off<00:01:25.530> though

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
once he took the clamp off though

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.899 
once he took the clamp off though
it<00:01:27.840> didn't<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.009> thought<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.700> was<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it didn't like I thought that it was the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.280 
it didn't like I thought that it was the
needle<00:01:30.210> through<00:01:30.420> my<00:01:30.450> tongue<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.900> was<00:01:31.020> like

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
needle through my tongue that was like

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.719 
needle through my tongue that was like
really<00:01:31.470> painful<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.189> took<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> clamp

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
really painful but then took the clamp

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.340 
really painful but then took the clamp
off<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:34.130> didn't<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.220> hurt<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.350> um

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
off and it didn't really hurt so um

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440 
off and it didn't really hurt so um
right<00:01:37.530> now<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.890> hurts<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.400> little<00:01:38.610> bit<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
