00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
around those two yarns there now I'm

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.130 
around those two yarns there now I'm
just<00:01:55.970> going<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.180> go<00:01:56.300> to<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.480> Magic<00:01:56.990> Loop

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
just going to go to the Magic Loop

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.860 
just going to go to the Magic Loop
method<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.790> have<00:01:58.970> them<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.360> need<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.660> draw

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
method so to have them I need to draw

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.830 
method so to have them I need to draw
them<00:02:00.050> down<00:02:00.080> onto<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:00.890> cable<00:02:01.600> counter<00:02:02.600> for

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
them down onto the cable counter for

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.050 
them down onto the cable counter for
draw<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.710> cable<00:02:04.130> up<00:02:04.250> through<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.550> fourth<00:02:04.820> and

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
draw the cable up through the fourth and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.620 
draw the cable up through the fourth and
fifth<00:02:05.270> stitch<00:02:07.149> like<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:09.040> and<00:02:10.040> then<00:02:10.550> grab<00:02:10.910> the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
fifth stitch like so and then grab the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.050 
fifth stitch like so and then grab the
short<00:02:11.960> yarn<00:02:12.400> rid<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.490> some<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:13.970> you

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
short yarn rid of some of that so you

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.450 
short yarn rid of some of that so you
can<00:02:14.180> see<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.420> better<00:02:14.620> grab<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.800> short<00:02:16.100> yarn

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
can see it better grab the short yarn
