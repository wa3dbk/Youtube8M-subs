 motorcycle coolant 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.879
 oil or gasoline moko funi level I 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.370
 check my oil level through this 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.920
 porthole to do this I put the bike 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.390
 right and I check as my level and 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.040
 well understood between the minimal men 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.630
 is the maximum word coop unicoop 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.240
 transmission for that I take the key 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.799
 for us not get my fingers dirty and I 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.020
 will check the deflection of the 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.810
 chain we call the arrow that has to 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.869
 be between 2 and 4 cm will note 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.030
 also that the chain is well greased 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.270
 moko was nitra our records checks that 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.689
 I ended up what corresponds to my 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.390
 vehicle

 part cycle and gloves retains ten 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.860
 until the matic says as direction for 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.340
 that I check my bike right that my 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.929
 direction 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.689
 the stubborn points holding the handlebars 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:02.240
 from stop to stop then I checked the 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:07.810
 good visual tightening of fork mettet 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.810
 upper and lower on each side 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.879
 I also check the good seal of 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.220
 may june lips on either side which does not 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:19.400
 not present and that my tubes 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.130
 fork are not damaged suspension 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.489
 back and check that my suspension 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.650
 there is no leak and that 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.200
 my preload ring and well tuned for 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.989
 one or two people say usco cocom 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.150
 brake control command wifi as one 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.829
 will do before is not seized and I 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.780
 also checks his level through his 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.760
 porthole to do this I loved the motorcycle 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.010
 right and I check that my level is 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.810

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:07.400
 motorcycle right and that is well understood 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:10.750
 between the minimum and the maximum 10 usco 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.160
 matic pneumatic rear tire 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.100
 I check that my tire 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.870
 and well inflated that my sculptures are 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.940
 deep enough and that the steps of 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.130
 foreign art bodies cease the same 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.500
 but flank does not have a tear 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.530

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.560
 side of the bike the same to the front tire 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.360
 who looks well inflated who has 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.490
 sufficiently deep sculptures and which 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.000
 does not have foreign bodies I 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.800
 also check but flank on each side 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.010
 and that does not have blisters 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.570

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.280
 present to the inspector my pair of 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.490
 gloves that is so adapted to the used of 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.490
 the motorbike 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.980
 lighting and security accessories 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.480
 motorcycle drivers we remember that a fact is 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.360
 as a helmet 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.349
 so I have a helmet is approved which 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.989
 have these four reflecting and 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:14.180
 which also includes the European standard 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:16.989
 so we see on the jugular more than this 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.989
 helmet skates battle 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:27.990

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.169
 that my mirrors are well fixed 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:37.289
 own time enough f like fire for this 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:41.220
 do I put my contact what turns on 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.479
 the position lights my little red on 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.300
 also called rear position lights 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:48.389
 and clean not broken and works 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.090
 then I start my bike that she a 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.949
 cross lamp and I press the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.729
 high beam switch for 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.620
 turn on the high beams 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.990
 I then check that the given set 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.610
 little in the front of position the crossing 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.949
 and road that the whole is so 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:09.389
 clean not broken and works pretty but 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:11.550
 blinking libido mouth in the front and at 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.650
 the back are blackcurrant clean and 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.840
 even works for my clients 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.479
 places that are at the front and at 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.639
 the rear clean not broken and works 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.490
 note that my reflex reflectors is 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.560
 clean not broken is well attached the same 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.560
 for my plate which is prof paca it is 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.300

 also stop light 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.780
 so for those I put my hand 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.490
 check that I see the reflection of my fire 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.380
 stop on my hand so that does not take 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.380
 broken and works but also with the 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.580
 brake pedal laugh that is peculiar to 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.580
 break it works
