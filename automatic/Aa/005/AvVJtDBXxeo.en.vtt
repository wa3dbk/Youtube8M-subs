hi<00:00:07.859> guys<00:00:08.010> welcome<00:00:08.250> back<00:00:08.990> apologize<00:00:09.990> for<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
hi guys welcome back apologize for the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.410 
hi guys welcome back apologize for the
buzzing<00:00:10.620> I'm<00:00:10.980> having<00:00:11.580> better<00:00:11.759> issues<00:00:12.179> again

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
buzzing I'm having better issues again

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.390 
buzzing I'm having better issues again
but<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.719> want<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.019> take<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> look<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
but I want to take a look at the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.500 
but I want to take a look at the
comparators<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.350> latest<00:00:16.740> update<00:00:17.510> played

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
comparators in the latest update played

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.480 
comparators in the latest update played
a<00:00:18.539> snapshot<00:00:18.869> 13<00:00:19.740> wo<00:00:20.160> 5b<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.410> I<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.890> did<00:00:23.460> a

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
a snapshot 13 wo 5b and I just did a

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.290 
a snapshot 13 wo 5b and I just did a
whole<00:00:23.789> video<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.289> 13<00:00:25.289> w<00:00:25.560> 5a<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.369> half<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
whole video on 13 w 5a and half the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.929 
whole video on 13 w 5a and half the
comparators<00:00:28.080> worked<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> checked

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
comparators worked and then I checked

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.290 
comparators worked and then I checked
both<00:00:30.240> mojang<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.960> they<00:00:31.080> had<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> new<00:00:31.439> snapshot

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
both mojang and they had a new snapshot

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.240 
both mojang and they had a new snapshot
so<00:00:33.300> let's<00:00:33.809> look<00:00:34.050> at<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.649> i'll<00:00:34.980> tell<00:00:35.219> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
so let's look at it and i'll tell you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.720 
so let's look at it and i'll tell you
what<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:35.730> different<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:37.110> version<00:00:37.730> in

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
what was different in this version in

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.889 
what was different in this version in
this<00:00:39.210> snapshot<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.920> opposed<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.899> snapshot

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
this snapshot as opposed to the snapshot

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.520 
this snapshot as opposed to the snapshot
before<00:00:43.469> last<00:00:43.850> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:45.989> last<00:00:46.260> video

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
before last in the in the last video

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.119 
before last in the in the last video
anyway<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:48.200> timing<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.410> variable<00:00:49.860> between

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
anyway the timing was variable between

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.569 
anyway the timing was variable between
the<00:00:50.460> repeater<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.750> comparator<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:53.309> it's

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the repeater and the comparator now it's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.029 
the repeater and the comparator now it's
pretty<00:00:54.030> consistent<00:00:54.719> there<00:00:55.260> seems<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.829> some

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
pretty consistent there seems to be some

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.430 
pretty consistent there seems to be some
variability<00:00:56.430> between<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.360> straight<00:00:58.260> red

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
variability between the straight red

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.520 
variability between the straight red
stone<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> other<00:00:59.100> two<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.579> just<00:01:00.500> kind<00:01:01.500> of

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
stone and the other two but just kind of

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.219 
stone and the other two but just kind of
odd<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.699> comparator<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.660> repeater

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
odd but the comparator and the repeater

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.460 
odd but the comparator and the repeater
seemed<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.650> work<00:01:04.799> pretty<00:01:04.860> well<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.820> far<00:01:06.090> as

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
seemed to work pretty well as far as

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.980 
seemed to work pretty well as far as
working<00:01:08.470> together<00:01:09.330> now<00:01:10.330> this<00:01:10.510> is<00:01:10.750> different

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
working together now this is different

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.820 
working together now this is different
than<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:13.049> snapshot<00:01:14.049> 30-day<00:01:14.500> yeah<00:01:14.770> I

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
than the snapshot 30-day yeah I

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.660 
than the snapshot 30-day yeah I
definitely<00:01:15.100> changed<00:01:15.850> this<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.360> snapshot<00:01:17.320> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
definitely changed this and snapshot a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.980 
definitely changed this and snapshot a
the<00:01:18.670> repeaters<00:01:19.030> on<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.330> let<00:01:19.659> are<00:01:19.869> the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
the repeaters on the let are the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.520 
the repeaters on the let are the
comparators<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:22.000> were<00:01:22.540> much<00:01:22.840> faster<00:01:23.200> and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
comparators here were much faster and

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.649 
comparators here were much faster and
then<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:23.890> repeaters<00:01:24.340> so<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.479> made<00:01:25.630> a

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
then the repeaters so and it made a

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.850 
then the repeaters so and it made a
difference<00:01:25.840> whether<00:01:26.229> there<00:01:26.530> was<00:01:26.680> the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
difference whether there was the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.219 
difference whether there was the
redstone<00:01:27.220> dust<00:01:27.520> between<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.210> comparators<00:01:28.810> or

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
redstone dust between the comparators or

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.170 
redstone dust between the comparators or
if<00:01:29.800> they<00:01:29.920> were<00:01:29.979> hooked<00:01:30.250> directly<00:01:30.670> together

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
if they were hooked directly together

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.040 
if they were hooked directly together
but<00:01:31.479> now<00:01:31.690> they<00:01:32.440> are<00:01:32.500> virtually<00:01:33.490> identical<00:01:34.050> so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
but now they are virtually identical so

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.120 
but now they are virtually identical so
that's<00:01:35.740> that's<00:01:36.430> good<00:01:37.800> before<00:01:38.800> this

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
that's that's good before this

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.609 
that's that's good before this
experiment<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.360> one<00:01:40.509> on<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.869> right<00:01:41.200> was

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
experiment of the one on the right was

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.900 
experiment of the one on the right was
much<00:01:41.890> faster<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:44.110> they<00:01:44.710> still<00:01:45.009> have<00:01:45.640> broken

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
much faster this they still have broken

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.680 
much faster this they still have broken
the<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:47.050> fast<00:01:47.289> clock<00:01:47.940> feature<00:01:48.940> I<00:01:49.090> guess<00:01:49.509> you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
the the fast clock feature I guess you

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.160 
the the fast clock feature I guess you
call<00:01:49.869> it<00:01:49.899> so<00:01:50.860> they<00:01:51.070> will<00:01:51.220> not<00:01:51.929> shoot<00:01:52.929> out

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
call it so they will not shoot out

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.320 
call it so they will not shoot out
arrows<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.649> very<00:01:54.009> fast<00:01:54.310> if<00:01:54.580> you<00:01:54.940> hook<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.090> up<00:01:55.300> to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
arrows a very fast if you hook it up to

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.169 
arrows a very fast if you hook it up to
a<00:01:55.479> dispenser<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.229> they<00:01:56.860> still<00:01:57.160> don't<00:01:57.369> are

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
a dispenser and they still don't are

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.529 
a dispenser and they still don't are
they<00:01:58.690> they<00:01:59.259> didn't<00:01:59.530> no<00:01:59.710> longer<00:02:00.300> update<00:02:01.300> and

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
they they didn't no longer update and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.290 
they they didn't no longer update and
buds<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.710> they<00:02:02.979> don't<00:02:03.460> they<00:02:03.700> won't<00:02:03.880> work<00:02:04.090> for

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
buds so they don't they won't work for

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.450 
buds so they don't they won't work for
that<00:02:04.420> purpose<00:02:04.720> but<00:02:05.619> they<00:02:05.770> still<00:02:05.950> work<00:02:06.159> very

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
that purpose but they still work very

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.169 
that purpose but they still work very
well<00:02:06.520> as<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.420> kind<00:02:08.019> of<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.910> know<00:02:10.000> if<00:02:10.090> the

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
well as a kind of a I don't know if the

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.729 
well as a kind of a I don't know if the
proper<00:02:10.420> term<00:02:10.569> would<00:02:10.720> be<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.899> capacitor<00:02:11.500> but

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
proper term would be a capacitor but

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.479 
proper term would be a capacitor but
anyway<00:02:12.040> they<00:02:12.190> hold<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.700> power<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:14.190> pretty<00:02:15.190> long

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
anyway they hold the power a pretty long

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.020 
anyway they hold the power a pretty long
time<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.440> previous<00:02:17.950> snapshot<00:02:18.489> 13<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.910> be

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
time in the previous snapshot 13 to be

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.470 
time in the previous snapshot 13 to be
5a<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.950> one<00:02:21.100> on<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.280> left<00:02:21.579> was<00:02:21.700> faster<00:02:22.269> than

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
5a the one on the left was faster than

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.550 
5a the one on the left was faster than
the<00:02:22.570> one<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.900> right<00:02:22.930> which<00:02:23.260> would<00:02:23.410> make

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the one on the right which would make

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.370 
the one on the right which would make
sense<00:02:23.769> but<00:02:24.459> now<00:02:24.700> they<00:02:25.030> are<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.390> same<00:02:25.570> which<00:02:26.350> is

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
sense but now they are the same which is

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.190 
sense but now they are the same which is
good<00:02:26.799> so<00:02:27.790> now<00:02:28.000> if<00:02:28.450> you<00:02:28.690> want<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.930> do<00:02:29.019> one<00:02:29.170> of

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
good so now if you want to do one of

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.810 
good so now if you want to do one of
these<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.530> don't<00:02:29.709> have<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.100> separate<00:02:30.549> it<00:02:30.700> out

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
these you don't have to separate it out

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.509 
these you don't have to separate it out
by<00:02:31.470> redstone<00:02:32.470> dust<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.890> can<00:02:33.010> just<00:02:33.160> pack<00:02:33.340> them

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
by redstone dust you can just pack them

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.009 
by redstone dust you can just pack them
tightly<00:02:33.730> together<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.420> has<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.810> same

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
tightly together and it has the same

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.670 
tightly together and it has the same
functionality<00:02:35.829> which<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.790> awesome<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.470> let's

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
functionality which is awesome so let's

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.620 
functionality which is awesome so let's
look<00:02:38.799> at<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:38.980> long<00:02:39.250> one

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
look at a long one

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.350 
look at a long one
oops<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.680> guess<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.040> could<00:02:42.160> turn<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.400> on<00:02:42.520> they<00:02:43.300> do

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
oops I guess I could turn it on they do

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.140 
oops I guess I could turn it on they do
load<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> little<00:02:44.140> differently<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.640> as<00:02:45.910> far<00:02:46.090> as

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
load a little differently but as far as

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.720 
load a little differently but as far as
going<00:02:46.480> off<00:02:46.870> they<00:02:47.200> seem<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.470> be<00:02:47.620> just<00:02:47.980> about<00:02:48.220> the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
going off they seem to be just about the

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.160 
going off they seem to be just about the
same<00:02:49.000> must<00:02:49.780> double<00:02:50.140> Chuck<00:02:51.150> very<00:02:52.150> long<00:02:52.540> time

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
same must double Chuck very long time

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.980 
same must double Chuck very long time
for<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.950> wind<00:02:54.580> down

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
for to wind down

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.970 
for to wind down
so<00:02:56.590> yeah<00:02:56.920> they<00:02:57.340> went<00:02:57.820> out<00:02:57.970> at<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.330> same<00:02:58.540> time

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
so yeah they went out at the same time

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.560 
so yeah they went out at the same time
but<00:02:59.980> i<00:03:00.040> think<00:03:00.370> this<00:03:00.460> one<00:03:00.670> started<00:03:01.180> going<00:03:01.450> out

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
but i think this one started going out

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.490 
but i think this one started going out
sooner<00:03:02.050> which<00:03:02.230> is<00:03:03.240> see<00:03:04.240> this<00:03:04.390> one<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:05.050> takes<00:03:05.410> a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
sooner which is see this one it takes a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.860 
sooner which is see this one it takes a
little<00:03:05.620> longer<00:03:05.770> to<00:03:06.100> load<00:03:06.370> as<00:03:06.820> far<00:03:07.180> as<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:07.720> the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
little longer to load as far as but the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.970 
little longer to load as far as but the
powers<00:03:08.500> others

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.690 

just<00:03:11.610> kind<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:11.879> strange<00:03:12.269> but<00:03:13.010> as<00:03:14.010> far<00:03:14.220> as<00:03:14.280> this

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
just kind of strange but as far as this

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.490 
just kind of strange but as far as this
dust<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.269> this<00:03:15.450> desk<00:03:15.720> going<00:03:15.900> out<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.260> think

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
dust and this desk going out I think

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.440 
dust and this desk going out I think
it's<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.920> same<00:03:17.720> isolated<00:03:19.640> yeah<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.239> it's

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
it's the same isolated yeah so it's

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.740 
it's the same isolated yeah so it's
about<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.720> same<00:03:21.900> but<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:23.720> little<00:03:24.720> different

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
about the same but a little different

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.990 
about the same but a little different
visually<00:03:25.530> I<00:03:25.560> guess<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:27.590> nice<00:03:28.590> job<00:03:28.890> on<00:03:29.220> fixing

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
visually I guess so nice job on fixing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.960 
visually I guess so nice job on fixing
that<00:03:30.709> dinner<00:03:31.709> bone<00:03:31.950> or<00:03:32.220> jab<00:03:32.459> every<00:03:32.730> over<00:03:32.910> was<00:03:33.410> i

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
that dinner bone or jab every over was i

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.380 
that dinner bone or jab every over was i
miss<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.680> functionality<00:03:37.680> of<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.099> fast<00:03:38.879> clock

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
miss the functionality of the fast clock

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.030 
miss the functionality of the fast clock
that's<00:03:39.900> disappointing<00:03:40.170> i<00:03:40.560> hope<00:03:40.709> they<00:03:40.860> come

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
that's disappointing i hope they come

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.000 
that's disappointing i hope they come
out<00:03:41.159> with<00:03:41.450> something<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.810> replace<00:03:43.349> that<00:03:43.470> may

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
out with something to replace that may

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.160 
out with something to replace that may
be<00:03:44.069> but<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:46.110> the<00:03:46.590> bud<00:03:46.790> canceling<00:03:48.170> but

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
be but and the the bud canceling but

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.380 
be but and the the bud canceling but
overall<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:50.220> think<00:03:50.340> it's<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.849> vast<00:03:51.180> improvement

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
overall I think it's a vast improvement

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.869 
overall I think it's a vast improvement
over<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.470> previous<00:03:52.859> version<00:03:53.519> now<00:03:53.670> if<00:03:53.760> they

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
over the previous version now if they

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.869 
over the previous version now if they
would<00:03:54.000> only<00:03:54.030> fix<00:03:54.540> these<00:03:54.840> stupid<00:03:55.879> monostable

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
would only fix these stupid monostable

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.250 
would only fix these stupid monostable
circuits<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.569> we<00:03:57.720> used<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.989> have<00:03:58.940> oops<00:04:00.260> this

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
circuits that we used to have oops this

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.210 
circuits that we used to have oops this
used<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.650> work<00:04:02.569> well<00:04:03.569> but<00:04:04.109> now<00:04:04.440> they've<00:04:04.829> broken

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
used to work well but now they've broken

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.759 
used to work well but now they've broken
it<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.640> they<00:04:06.239> haven't<00:04:06.540> seemed<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.319> want<00:04:07.650> to

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
it and they haven't seemed to want to

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:08.960 
it and they haven't seemed to want to
fix<00:04:07.950> it

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
fix it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.340 
fix it
kind<00:04:09.240> of<00:04:09.270> a<00:04:09.360> pet<00:04:09.570> peeve<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:09.930> mine

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
kind of a pet peeve of mine

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.980 
kind of a pet peeve of mine
let's<00:04:11.890> make<00:04:12.100> sure<00:04:12.130> it's<00:04:12.550> still<00:04:13.150> broken<00:04:13.630> in

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
let's make sure it's still broken in

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.770 
let's make sure it's still broken in
this<00:04:14.140> snapshot<00:04:14.650> before<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.220> get<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.490> him<00:04:15.670> um<00:04:16.420> no

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
this snapshot before I get to him um no

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.060 
this snapshot before I get to him um no
wait<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.050> minute<00:04:17.380> wait<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.800> minute

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
wait a minute wait a minute

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.280 
wait a minute wait a minute
that's<00:04:19.640> a<00:04:19.910> one<00:04:20.090> tick<00:04:20.330> I<00:04:20.600> think<00:04:22.900> always<00:04:23.900> test<00:04:24.140> up

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
that's a one tick I think always test up

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.360 
that's a one tick I think always test up
with<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.590> piston

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.719 

come<00:04:27.699> on<00:04:27.850> baby<00:04:28.380> no<00:04:29.380> that's<00:04:30.010> still<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.490> tick

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
come on baby no that's still a to tick

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.030 
come on baby no that's still a to tick
one<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.630> a<00:04:31.660> half<00:04:31.720> tech<00:04:32.020> or<00:04:32.169> something<00:04:32.440> but

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
one and a half tech or something but

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.740 
one and a half tech or something but
what's<00:04:33.250> odd<00:04:33.430> is<00:04:33.460> he<00:04:33.850> put<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.030> torch<00:04:34.300> over<00:04:34.389> here

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
what's odd is he put a torch over here

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.189 
what's odd is he put a torch over here
and<00:04:37.199> you<00:04:38.199> put<00:04:38.410> a<00:04:38.440> block<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.880> hit<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:40.960> watch

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
and you put a block and hit it watch

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.820 
and you put a block and hit it watch
what<00:04:41.500> happens<00:04:41.800> down

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
what happens down

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.809 
what happens down
so<00:04:44.830> fun<00:04:45.099> on<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.520> on<00:04:45.699> the<00:04:45.759> end<00:04:46.360> there<00:04:46.539> is<00:04:46.720> a<00:04:47.819> one

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.819 
so fun on the on the end there is a one

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:50.820 
so fun on the on the end there is a one
tick<00:04:49.060> pulse<00:04:49.629> and<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.319> one<00:04:50.470> on<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.650> right<00:04:50.680> is

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
tick pulse and the one on the right is

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.179 
tick pulse and the one on the right is
it<00:04:51.129> or<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.699> one<00:04:51.909> left<00:04:52.210> is<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:53.560> checkers<00:04:53.979> or

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.189 
it or the one left is a to checkers or

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:58.020 
it or the one left is a to checkers or
something<00:04:55.500> so<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:56.530> think<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:56.919> has<00:04:57.009> an<00:04:57.219> east-west

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
something so I think it has an east-west

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.670 
something so I think it has an east-west
thing<00:04:58.569> to<00:04:58.719> do<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.960> casaya<00:04:59.199> did<00:04:59.409> this<00:04:59.530> in

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
thing to do the casaya did this in

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.439 
thing to do the casaya did this in
another<00:05:00.039> world<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.580> this<00:05:00.729> one<00:05:00.939> was<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.270> one

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
another world and this one was the one

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.390 
another world and this one was the one
tick<00:05:01.659> and<00:05:01.840> that<00:05:01.960> one<00:05:02.139> so<00:05:02.409> i<00:05:02.650> don't<00:05:03.159> know<00:05:03.280> why

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
tick and that one so i don't know why

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.020 
tick and that one so i don't know why
they<00:05:03.580> em<00:05:03.669> fix<00:05:03.939> this<00:05:04.150> yet<00:05:04.360> anyway<00:05:05.199> I'm<00:05:05.740> sorry

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
they em fix this yet anyway I'm sorry

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.420 
they em fix this yet anyway I'm sorry
there<00:05:07.030> we<00:05:07.090> go<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.900> new<00:05:08.050> comparators<00:05:08.620> thanks

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
there we go the new comparators thanks

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.490 
there we go the new comparators thanks
for<00:05:09.520> watching<00:05:09.699> guys<00:05:09.789> all<00:05:10.509> right<00:05:10.689> i<00:05:10.870> forgot<00:05:10.930> to

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
for watching guys all right i forgot to

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.240 
for watching guys all right i forgot to
check<00:05:11.680> something<00:05:12.039> and<00:05:12.400> i'm<00:05:13.000> glad<00:05:13.150> that<00:05:13.240> i<00:05:13.449> did

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
check something and i'm glad that i did

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.999 
check something and i'm glad that i did
in<00:05:15.250> previous<00:05:16.030> versions<00:05:16.539> we<00:05:17.169> were<00:05:17.530> able<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.889> do

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
in previous versions we were able to do

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.809 
in previous versions we were able to do
a<00:05:18.039> monostable<00:05:18.520> circuit<00:05:19.270> one<00:05:19.990> tick<00:05:20.199> pulse<00:05:20.500> by<00:05:20.889> a

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
a monostable circuit one tick pulse by a

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:27.180 
a monostable circuit one tick pulse by a
set<00:05:22.750> up<00:05:22.900> similar<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:24.039> this<00:05:25.319> and<00:05:26.319> i'll<00:05:26.740> show<00:05:26.800> you

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
set up similar to this and i'll show you

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.230 
set up similar to this and i'll show you
what<00:05:27.729> happens<00:05:28.150> now<00:05:29.490> so<00:05:30.490> we<00:05:30.610> have<00:05:30.729> compared<00:05:31.120> to

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
what happens now so we have compared to

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.170 
what happens now so we have compared to
a<00:05:31.330> repeater<00:05:31.870> going<00:05:32.199> into<00:05:32.530> it<00:05:32.650> with<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:33.180> 2

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
a repeater going into it with a 2

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.640 
a repeater going into it with a 2
technically<00:05:34.690> i<00:05:34.719> think<00:05:34.990> that's<00:05:35.139> proper<00:05:37.650> once

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
technically i think that's proper once

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.490 
technically i think that's proper once
that's<00:05:38.889> not<00:05:39.729> turning<00:05:40.599> off<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.779> comparator

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
that's not turning off the comparator

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.059 
that's not turning off the comparator
that<00:05:42.009> repeater<00:05:43.110> should<00:05:44.110> be<00:05:44.259> powering<00:05:44.680> the

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.069 
that repeater should be powering the

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:47.070 
that repeater should be powering the
comparator<00:05:45.669> from<00:05:45.969> the<00:05:46.060> side<00:05:46.270> at<00:05:46.569> a<00:05:46.599> more

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
comparator from the side at a more

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.879 
comparator from the side at a more
powerful<00:05:48.180> signal<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.539> it<00:05:49.960> should<00:05:50.229> turn<00:05:50.800> it

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
powerful signal and it should turn it

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.909 
powerful signal and it should turn it
off<00:05:51.039> it's<00:05:51.699> not<00:05:51.969> doing<00:05:52.210> that<00:05:52.349> let's<00:05:53.349> look<00:05:53.590> at<00:05:53.770> it

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
off it's not doing that let's look at it

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.970 
off it's not doing that let's look at it
a<00:05:53.949> little<00:05:54.219> bit<00:05:54.460> more<00:05:54.669> simplified

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
a little bit more simplified

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.020 
a little bit more simplified
let's<00:05:57.790> see<00:05:57.940> Sakura<00:05:58.540> that<00:05:59.040> all<00:06:00.040> right<00:06:00.160> so<00:06:00.430> if<00:06:00.790> we

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
let's see Sakura that all right so if we

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.900 
let's see Sakura that all right so if we
have<00:06:01.270> dust<00:06:01.960> here<00:06:02.260> and<00:06:02.470> dust<00:06:02.680> there<00:06:02.920> and<00:06:03.220> we

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
have dust here and dust there and we

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.040 
have dust here and dust there and we
power<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:05.070> comparator<00:06:06.070> and<00:06:06.100> we<00:06:06.370> power<00:06:06.610> these

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
power the comparator and we power these

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.550 
power the comparator and we power these
be<00:06:08.050> input<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:09.430> should<00:06:09.730> be<00:06:10.230> proper<00:06:11.230> I<00:06:11.260> mean

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
be input that should be proper I mean

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.750 
be input that should be proper I mean
you<00:06:11.740> shouldn't<00:06:12.010> shut<00:06:12.220> off<00:06:12.340> because<00:06:12.550> they're

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
you shouldn't shut off because they're

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.220 
you shouldn't shut off because they're
the<00:06:12.790> same<00:06:13.150> but<00:06:14.110> if<00:06:14.230> we<00:06:14.320> change<00:06:14.620> this<00:06:15.510> to<00:06:17.160> to

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
the same but if we change this to to

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:23.730 
the same but if we change this to to
signal<00:06:20.230> strength<00:06:20.470> of<00:06:20.650> two<00:06:20.890> and<00:06:21.430> put<00:06:21.670> a<00:06:22.740> some

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
signal strength of two and put a some

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.400 
signal strength of two and put a some
dust<00:06:23.980> for<00:06:24.460> one<00:06:24.580> thing<00:06:24.610> that's<00:06:25.240> not<00:06:25.480> lighting

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
dust for one thing that's not lighting

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.640 
dust for one thing that's not lighting
up<00:06:26.530> I<00:06:26.830> should<00:06:27.430> go<00:06:27.790> that<00:06:28.180> best<00:06:28.390> Mouse<00:06:28.720> no<00:06:28.930> that's

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
up I should go that best Mouse no that's

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.410 
up I should go that best Mouse no that's
not<00:06:29.770> right<00:06:29.920> that's<00:06:30.160> not<00:06:30.730> lighting<00:06:31.120> up<00:06:31.210> that's

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
not right that's not lighting up that's

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.080 
not right that's not lighting up that's
what<00:06:31.510> I<00:06:31.540> was<00:06:31.690> meant<00:06:31.990> to<00:06:32.140> say<00:06:32.320> if<00:06:33.100> I<00:06:33.280> take<00:06:33.760> take

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
what I was meant to say if I take take

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.530 
what I was meant to say if I take take
take<00:06:34.360> away<00:06:34.720> the<00:06:34.930> be<00:06:35.620> input<00:06:36.180> why<00:06:37.180> is<00:06:37.240> the

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:37.540 
take away the be input why is the

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.840 
take away the be input why is the
comparator<00:06:38.050> not<00:06:38.230> powering<00:06:38.530> on<00:06:38.710> that's<00:06:39.310> not

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
comparator not powering on that's not

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:46.290 
comparator not powering on that's not
right<00:06:42.630> if<00:06:43.630> you<00:06:44.470> take<00:06:45.130> away<00:06:45.160> the<00:06:45.340> be<00:06:45.670> input<00:06:46.000> that

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
right if you take away the be input that

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.540 
right if you take away the be input that
should<00:06:46.870> be<00:06:46.960> on<00:06:47.050> but<00:06:47.800> if<00:06:47.890> you<00:06:48.040> take<00:06:48.370> away<00:06:48.400> the

should be on but if you take away the

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.490 
should be on but if you take away the
dust<00:06:48.790> and<00:06:48.970> then<00:06:49.150> repower<00:06:49.570> it<00:06:49.810> comes<00:06:50.230> on

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
dust and then repower it comes on

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.960 
dust and then repower it comes on
but<00:06:52.280> if<00:06:52.610> I<00:06:52.970> power<00:06:53.810> the<00:06:54.020> compare<00:06:54.320> tour<00:06:54.590> on<00:06:55.340> the

but if I power the compare tour on the

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.270 
but if I power the compare tour on the
be<00:06:56.090> input<00:06:56.390> at<00:06:56.570> a<00:06:56.600> higher<00:06:56.990> strength<00:06:57.530> it's<00:06:58.040> not

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
shutting off so and as far as that now

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.710 
shutting off so and as far as that now
they're<00:07:03.230> completely<00:07:03.560> broken<00:07:03.860> so<00:07:04.570> maybe<00:07:05.570> we'll

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
they're completely broken so maybe we'll
