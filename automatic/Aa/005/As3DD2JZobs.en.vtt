00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.330 
to start down here with these blocks

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.140 
to start down here with these blocks
which<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.470> situated<00:00:34.769> down<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> other

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
you might have to do is use a pry tool

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.240 
you might have to do is use a pry tool
okay<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.360> saw<00:00:48.629> edgy<00:00:49.410> off<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.829> you'll

find<00:00:50.520> all<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.790> way<00:00:51.000> around<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> sides<00:00:51.600> you'll

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
find all the way around the sides you'll

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.020 
find all the way around the sides you'll
have<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.440> same<00:00:52.710> okay<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.460> lift<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> up

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
have to do the same okay to lift it up

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.540 
have to do the same okay to lift it up
and<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.750> same<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.260> side<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.710> well<00:00:55.860> okay

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and the same on this side as well okay

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.779 
and the same on this side as well okay
once<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.360> popped<00:00:58.050> off<00:00:58.289> basically<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.430> new<00:00:59.579> one

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
once I popped off basically the new one

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
once I popped off basically the new one
goes<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:01.110> might<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.860> stick<00:01:02.129> this

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
goes on you might have to stick this

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.270 
goes on you might have to stick this
down<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.360> I<00:01:03.390> wouldn't<00:01:03.899> worry<00:01:04.140> too<00:01:04.259> much<00:01:04.470> okay

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
down but I wouldn't worry too much okay

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.749 
down but I wouldn't worry too much okay
is<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> will<00:01:06.000> hold<00:01:06.240> into<00:01:06.630> place<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.759> your

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
is it will hold into place and your

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.390 
is it will hold into place and your
battery<00:01:09.390> cover<00:01:10.080> won't<00:01:10.380> hold<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.979> into<00:01:11.100> place

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
battery cover won't hold it into place

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.030 
battery cover won't hold it into place
as<00:01:11.610> well<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.600> now<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.170> pop<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.380> onto<00:01:13.710> there

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
as well so now just pop that onto there

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.510 
as well so now just pop that onto there
okay<00:01:15.409> make<00:01:16.409> sure<00:01:16.590> decide<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.310> into

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
okay make sure decide to go into

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.870 
okay make sure decide to go into
position<00:01:18.390> they<00:01:18.720> often<00:01:19.049> come<00:01:19.229> back<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.880> this

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
position they often come back out this

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.999 
position they often come back out this
sides<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.540> bit<00:01:21.869> easier<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> side<00:01:22.710> pops

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
sides a little bit easier this side pops

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.050 
sides a little bit easier this side pops
out<00:01:23.220> quite<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> lot<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.990> said<00:01:25.020> once<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.619> on

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
out quite a lot like I said once it's on

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.300 
out quite a lot like I said once it's on
okay<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> then<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> battery<00:01:28.799> cover<00:01:29.009> will

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
okay and then the battery cover will

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.330 
okay and then the battery cover will
come<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> hold<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.780> into<00:01:30.930> place<00:01:31.140> anyway<00:01:31.860> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
come on and hold it into place anyway so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.399 
come on and hold it into place anyway so
you<00:01:32.400> shouldn't<00:01:32.790> have<00:01:32.909> too<00:01:33.060> many<00:01:33.180> problems<00:01:33.420> but

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you shouldn't have too many problems but

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.890 
you shouldn't have too many problems but
that<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.680> how<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.299> okay<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.479> keep

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
that is how you do it okay just keep

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.140 
that is how you do it okay just keep
till<00:01:37.590> you've<00:01:37.710> got<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> somewhere<00:01:38.369> near<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
till you've got it somewhere near and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
till you've got it somewhere near and
then<00:01:39.509> use<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> little<00:01:40.200> bit<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.409> glue<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.650> already

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
then use a little bit of glue to already

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
then use a little bit of glue to already
into<00:01:41.369> place<00:01:41.840> okay<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:44.369> basically<00:01:45.360> that's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
into place okay so basically that's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.649 
into place okay so basically that's
gonna<00:01:45.990> sit<00:01:46.229> back<00:01:46.409> down<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
gonna sit back down like that then and

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.749 
gonna sit back down like that then and
then<00:01:48.659> obviously<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:49.439> battery<00:01:50.310> cover<00:01:50.520> would

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
then obviously your battery cover would

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.429 
then obviously your battery cover would
just<00:01:50.939> slide<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.689> hold<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.140> into<00:01:52.229> place

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
just slide on and hold it into place

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.080 
just slide on and hold it into place
anyway<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.189> won't<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.490> too<00:01:53.670> much<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
anyway so it won't be too much of a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.179
