00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:08.750
 or we're going to make it to frankenstein 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.250
 use a toilet paper tube that 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.530
 you know that I love to do 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.180
 crafts I'm going to paint green with 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.880
 acrylic paint you can also use 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.130
 tempera 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.780
 and if you see that it does not cover well you give two 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.250
 layers when I know that the first one you give him 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.140
 the second is what I'll do 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.360
 Well, I have it here dry and what 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.890
 first thing I'm going to do is select 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.529
 a pair of little eyes that I will place more 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.180
 late I like to always use these 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.690
 they are plastic fabric is very good and 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.489
 if you can not do them with paper too 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.699
 Well, to make your hair, I'm going to use 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.350
 black cardboard I'm going to cut a piece 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.500
 more or less as you see 3 centimeters 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.360
 enough 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 long enough to turn everything around 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.710
 the tube the quickest way to cut 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.110
 to make the little hair below is 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.150
 fold it like this in several parts and cut out 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.070
 some triangles 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.910
 and so doing all four times 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.910
 we finished before 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.670
 he did not press much so that they do not mark 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.990
 the folds but you see in a moment 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.579
 we have done the whole length of the strip 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.689
 I fix it a little bit the parts that 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.180
 have been a little bit wrong in the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.590
 together and I have it here ready it does not 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.869
 missing that they are perfect triangles 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.100
 because hair never is but better 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.600
 make him these triangles andrew to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 leave it straight to give it a little more 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.750
 realism 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.400
 Well now I'm going to hit it with a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.259
 little bit of glue you can use 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.060
 glue stick or liquid glue 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.750
 like I 'm using a little bit of 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.750
 tail double-sided tape whatever you want 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.520
 we stick it on the top edge if it 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.110
 you want to make higher stop letting go 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.730
 cardboard up a bit and if not what 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.580
 You put me out I'm going to upload a 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.130
 little bit 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.650
 Well once stuck and dry you see 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.660
 let's put the eyes on these 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.660
 I have here they have a piece of paper behind 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.560
 and it's removed and they're like a sticker and 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.840
 comes with the glue not all that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.640
 I have sometimes I have to put glue 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.560
 and if not, as I said, you remember 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.390
 white circles of paper and inside a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.670
 black circle or draw it with 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.009
 marker for the eyebrows I will use 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.200
 the same cardboard cut out two 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.119
 equal rectangles 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.099
 of the size that you are seeing more or less 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.739
 and one centimeter long by 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.450
 half a width and with glue I'm going to 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.450
 place covering part of the eye 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.590
 I'm going to put them a little diagonally 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.660
 that always looked like this 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.220
 How sad you can also put them 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.860
 straight but I'm going to place them like that 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.020
 diagonal slightly fall down the side 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.390
 for the nose it has trimmed half 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.880
 cardboard or folio circumference 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.620
 orange you can make it red if 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.500
 you want or another color and for the mouth 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.060
 as you have seen a simple line like this 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.819
 a little zig zag with the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.409
 permanent marker 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.150
 it was a characteristic thing of 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.189
 frankenstein is those nuts or screws 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.230
 that he's carrying I'm not really sure if in 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.060
 the forehead or in the neck and I'm going to 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.400
 use these little things that I have to 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.840
 It serves to make bracelets are a monkey 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.489
 good beadwork but you can 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.109
 use whatever else you have 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.329
 and if you do not have you can make some balls 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.099
 of paper too and place them here by 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.340
 example I can think of a painted chickpea 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.530
 a lentil or something 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.209
 and I'm going to use the dwellings and it seems to me that 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.040
 purple orange and green and black 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.660
 they are halloween colors but you can 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.000
 use any other gray color 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.980
 even and good have you decided 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.810
 put them on your neck here you see what 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.060
 they were better and that's how it's done 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.849
 our Francoist another pair of ideas 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.830
 for halloween are this ghost and this 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.000
 terrifying drink with a hand of 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.000
 goodbye death
