 Oleg they storm value the odds on that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.250

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.890
 a few comments here is rice 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.529
 remote that looks like a scorpion probably 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.680
 I do not know who it is but let's yourself 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.010
 let's see this scorpion this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.850
 to the console but here it turns on and off 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:35.460
 Well, I'll show you today how to manage it 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.180
 using the phone and under the iPad and everything 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.950
 other things need to be programmed to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.379
 he worked with this remote here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.850
 see we need to first turn on 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.000
 bluetooth is on and on 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:55.110
 here is shown the evolution of the company here we are 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.870
 we connect to it we connect 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.699
 connected and on it myself 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:08.090
 sign it yourself but we still have to if you 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.090
 Bought now corrected here camera 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.770
 I will try to be seen here we go 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.110
 fasting and spruce so on all that was 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:31.650

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.780
 the letter was all bluetooth iphone ipad 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.369
 ipod and we have to put 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.189
 everywhere tick let's continue 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.860
 How to connect and how much 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.200
 special program called 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.070
 commander with the help of it we press not on 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.340
 her and we can manage it right here 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.399
 have a robot commander have 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.399
 scorpion and eat I don't know how it is 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:10.940
 nay on the road can grow 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:14.190
 clear here i'm a scorpion media commander i 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.190
 I don't know what to call him, I don't know at all 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.849
 someone flu I noticed in the video that 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.209
 he can carry things and can do 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:28.980
 still others to create how many they can 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:35.099
 just create a lot of Well 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.620
 let's connect to the robot itself we 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.340
 connected we can click go back 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.890
 left right 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.790
 forward back left-right 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.190
 shoot up 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.480
 you can just shoot can attack and 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.840
 can slide 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.530
 Well , let's see about ourselves 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.530
 there is still a stop here is a red button 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.940
 have voice but voice me now 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:06.569
 until it works let's sleep meters 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:14.599
 Itself on the left turn in general to me very much 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:19.079
 like the way he says it is just fine 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:22.470
 back can go like this he says dupe 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:26.819
 Donkey is just cool here he can 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:30.260
 of course I can drive everywhere but 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.859
 Of course, this can also fall 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.130
 turn right 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.530
 so he looked at us and shooting me 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.549
 and you can just bum up from when 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:46.519
 he raises his hand shoots here shoot with 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:49.560
 just shoot thats just shoot and 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.609
 attack but first we need to drive off 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.889
 far away 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:59.040
 because when he attacks he goes ahead 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:04:01.700
 far she goes forward like that 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.919
 he still has claws 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.090
 claws and not just like that they can 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:12.180
 keep that kind of cherry 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.810
 here itself this sensor it can with 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.480
 using 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:21.979
 let me take the box to you all 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:26.160
 show here is an infrared sensor 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:28.199
 lets your robot see there is more 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.370
 the program block is the most important brain and 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:33.840
 your robot 's voice is tactile 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.560
 sensors let 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:43.889
 allows you to feel at the robot 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:47.250
 touch and touch that is to the end 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.830
 and he says there is a light sensor 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.760
 allows you to be recognized 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:05:00.330
 colors but to our colors i don't know but 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:06.270
 if you let down any thing says here 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:09.660
 still 33 do not know why there are only three, two 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.940
 three interactive servomotors 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.820
 allows your robot to move 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.560
 Well , you can write a comment 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.930

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:26.550

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.120
