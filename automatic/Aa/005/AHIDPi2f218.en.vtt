00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
green stuff starts growing I've been

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.950 
green stuff starts growing I've been
thinking<00:01:10.010> about<00:01:10.340> doing<00:01:10.520> that<00:01:11.030> if<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:11.330> covered

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
thinking about doing that if I covered

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.750 
thinking about doing that if I covered
such<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.740> while<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.040> area<00:01:13.280> that's<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.580> most

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
such that while the area that's the most

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.109 
such that while the area that's the most
ball<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.479> put<00:01:15.410> this<00:01:15.560> paste<00:01:16.100> on<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.790> then<00:01:16.910> the

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
ball I put this paste on and then the

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.930 
ball I put this paste on and then the
seeds<00:01:17.479> or<00:01:17.780> whatever<00:01:18.140> it<00:01:18.290> is<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.590> two<00:01:19.310> or<00:01:19.670> three

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
seeds or whatever it is and two or three

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.540 
seeds or whatever it is and two or three
or<00:01:20.210> four<00:01:20.240> weeks<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:21.050> would<00:01:21.619> have<00:01:21.830> this<00:01:22.100> growth

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
or four weeks I would have this growth

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.609 
or four weeks I would have this growth
it<00:01:22.940> would<00:01:23.090> probably<00:01:23.360> be<00:01:23.630> green<00:01:24.050> but<00:01:24.080> it<00:01:24.500> would

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
it would probably be green but it would

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.219 
it would probably be green but it would
be<00:01:24.650> better<00:01:24.800> than<00:01:25.130> nothing<00:01:25.700> i<00:01:25.850> think<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.420> i

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
be better than nothing i think and i

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.350 
be better than nothing i think and i
talked<00:01:27.470> my<00:01:27.590> barber<00:01:28.130> already<00:01:28.520> about<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.150> that

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
talked my barber already about this that

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.010 
talked my barber already about this that
he<00:01:29.479> could<00:01:29.630> probably<00:01:29.840> trim<00:01:30.320> that<00:01:30.500> up<00:01:30.560> for<00:01:31.070> me

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
he could probably trim that up for me

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.520 
he could probably trim that up for me
anyhow<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:33.560> just<00:01:33.830> a<00:01:34.009> thought<00:01:34.910> and<00:01:35.390> i<00:01:35.780> don't

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
anyhow it's just a thought and i don't

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.109 
anyhow it's just a thought and i don't
know<00:01:36.590> if<00:01:36.649> it<00:01:36.740> improve<00:01:37.100> my<00:01:37.280> appearance<00:01:37.399> or<00:01:37.970> not

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
know if it improve my appearance or not

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.730 
know if it improve my appearance or not
but<00:01:38.390> by<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.570> way<00:01:38.690> we're<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:38.960> half<00:01:39.259> I<00:01:39.470> don't<00:01:39.649> have

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
but by the way we're a half I don't have

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.040 
but by the way we're a half I don't have
one<00:01:39.890> immediately<00:01:40.399> in<00:01:41.090> front<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.570> me<00:01:41.660> but<00:01:41.690> I

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
one immediately in front of me but I

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.800 
one immediately in front of me but I
were<00:01:42.770> half<00:01:43.070> quite<00:01:43.490> often<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:44.300> you<00:01:44.479> don't

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
were half quite often so that you don't

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.880 
were half quite often so that you don't
see<00:01:45.350> how<00:01:46.009> bald<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.490> really<00:01:46.880> amps<00:01:47.300> up<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.890> option

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
see how bald I really amps up the option

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.620 
see how bald I really amps up the option
probably<00:01:49.250> at<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:49.460> point<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.880> best<00:01:50.030> option<00:01:50.539> I

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
probably at this point the best option I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.029 
probably at this point the best option I
have<00:01:50.899> without<00:01:51.110> going<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.590> be<00:01:51.649> a<00:01:51.679> lot<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:52.009> money

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
have without going to be a lot of money

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.710
