headlight<00:05:41.710> one<00:05:42.039> long<00:05:42.310> one<00:05:42.550> here<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.720> one

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990

headlight one long one here and one
shorter<00:05:44.500> one<00:05:44.680> over<00:05:44.949> here<00:05:46.349> start<00:05:47.349> putting<00:05:47.800> your

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919

shorter one over here start putting your
headlight<00:05:48.220> in<00:05:48.659> okay<00:05:49.659> on<00:05:49.810> this<00:05:50.020> side<00:05:50.199> you<00:05:50.349> want

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
headlight in okay on this side you want

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.070 
headlight in okay on this side you want
to<00:05:50.500> make<00:05:50.560> sure<00:05:51.180> that<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:53.729> tab<00:05:54.729> goes<00:05:55.090> into<00:05:55.509> the

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
to make sure that that tab goes into the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.040 
to make sure that that tab goes into the
slot<00:05:56.409> right<00:05:56.770> there

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
slot right there

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.420 
slot right there
so<00:05:59.050> yeah

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.860 

this<00:06:04.120> is<00:06:04.330> tough<00:06:04.570> to<00:06:04.600> film<00:06:06.419> okay<00:06:07.419> and<00:06:07.540> then<00:06:07.630> over

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
this is tough to film okay and then over

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.090 
this is tough to film okay and then over
here<00:06:08.340> you<00:06:09.340> want<00:06:09.550> to<00:06:09.580> watch<00:06:09.759> your<00:06:09.970> smaller<00:06:10.360> tab

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
here you want to watch your smaller tab

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.540 
here you want to watch your smaller tab
and<00:06:12.100> make<00:06:12.280> sure<00:06:12.580> it<00:06:12.759> goes<00:06:13.000> into<00:06:14.220> the<00:06:15.220> slot

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
and make sure it goes into the slot

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.840 
and make sure it goes into the slot
correctly<00:06:16.060> as<00:06:16.150> well<00:06:16.180> I<00:06:17.220> actually<00:06:18.220> do<00:06:18.550> is<00:06:18.669> use<00:06:18.820> a

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
correctly as well I actually do is use a

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:24.960 
correctly as well I actually do is use a
flashlight<00:06:19.300> if<00:06:20.139> I<00:06:20.380> see<00:06:20.710> over<00:06:21.039> here<00:06:22.770> see<00:06:23.970> this

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
flashlight if I see over here see this

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:39.549 
flashlight if I see over here see this
over<00:06:25.300> here

00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:39.559 

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:41.589 

it's<00:06:39.799> probably<00:06:40.279> the<00:06:40.429> most<00:06:40.669> difficult<00:06:40.969> part<00:06:41.209> is

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
it's probably the most difficult part is

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.469 
it's probably the most difficult part is
just<00:06:42.159> making<00:06:43.159> sure<00:06:43.429> this<00:06:43.609> gets<00:06:43.849> lined<00:06:44.269> up

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
just making sure this gets lined up

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:56.319 
just making sure this gets lined up
correctly<00:06:45.969> what<00:06:46.969> you<00:06:47.089> got<00:06:47.589> shit<00:06:48.589> in<00:06:53.109> then<00:06:55.329> move
