00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello very good everyone bacon echo and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.250
 Welcome to a new game of halo 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.890
 reach if we are a very game 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.360
 special since this is 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.360
 reid or car race 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.440
 so those that you have never seen 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.330
 This game mode gives me a lot of disgust 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.900
 true because playing a game 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.400
 it's good it's fun that you have a good time 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.770
 but like it's pretty at 7 if 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.630
 you play 50,000, which is what usually happens 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.539
 many times in multi purpose that by the way 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.820
 we are playing a multi team 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.630
 because it only comes out in this kind of way 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.520
 departure of this type of departure 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.110
 and well, most people do not know 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.850
 what do you vote in this game way so 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.630
 there were seasons when in play up 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.840
 those who play in multi team equal 8 of 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.910
 10 games were in these races and 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.190
 that a game is fun but like 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.410
 that 8 of 10 passes that did not come out price 4 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.410
 back things above all to kill more 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.660
 so that's what there is but good 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.720
 those who do not know this game is about 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.220
 what about right now 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.500
 teams go one co-driver with the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.250
 rocket launchers and grenade launchers which 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.500
 mp pulse makes makes 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.990
 you stop the vehicle 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.300
 another good quartz gunner with 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.460
 rockets and I who am the driver then 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.750
 we go to the driver then what there is 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.820
 what to do is go to the points because it is 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.460
 a race as well says the name there 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.280
 to give the points and the one that reaches 15 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.960
 before you win what is the problem that 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.030
 I do not like that basically what I 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.950
 like tactics and the only way 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.270
 to kill is when a car has been 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.950
 tipped over 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.810
 and all the occupants the occupants go 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.520
 quiet of the car go on foot then 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.090
 when you go on foot is vulnerable and you 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.880
 can kill and you're slower and all that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.500
 I then what is often 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.909
 when I get bored in this way I play 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.520
 to fuck the doctor people to go to 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.409
 kill 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.409
 Do not throw us in the water, you bastards 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.610
 so what you have to do is go go 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.210
 overturning the opponents and as soon as 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.210
 are overturned 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.410
 and shoot 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.219
 as you can see there we have taken a 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.900
 help from our money can be 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.609
 problem that people do not have 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.480
 fucking idea of playing and what it does is 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:31.280
 shoot without any ton nor are they 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.959
 look and we have taken double help 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.630
 so many people what they do is 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.459
 shoot and when you see that people are 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.800
 overturned because we all ended up after or 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.870
 rare online 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.569
 when people are on land 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.159
 what makes people keep firing 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.099
 then what it does is with its own 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.950
 Hispanics replaces the fourth gene 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:54.620
 on your site face up and so we can not 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.420
 kill people 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.040
 so here I have a little head is 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.420
 say if you're seeing that a car is going 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.790
 to dump do not shoot him until he 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.890
 dump everything and you can kill the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.370
 enemies because you're not going to be the one 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.370
 he returns 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.220
 the one that returns to turn it around and so 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.560
 prevents us from killing that and good 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.640
 after this brief explanation of 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.640
 how do we play the game 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.910
 let's dedicate ourselves to killing because if not 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.760
 I get bored and it happens to get bored so 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.129
 I run 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.810
 for now we are doing well the truth of ours 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.090
 gunner's mate is killing 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.189
 quite if we are 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.830
 taking aids which comes quite 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:37.110
 all right 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.650
 many times this happens where you stay 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.350
 embedded in an infinite loop or look 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.520
 I have a streak of 10 grants that our 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.520
 fellow differences 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.230
 not quite a-7 because he preferred to be 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.250
 I prefer gunner kill before 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.100
 helps but good 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.050
 now we have not turned to relief 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.970
 destinations then how dangerous of this 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.330
 is that when you fall, you are much more 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.420
 slow 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.849
 let's go come 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.530
 and when 10 seconds pass, you come back 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.060
 to reappear in the vehicles to which 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.060
 It is not that I have to come and look 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.540
 I'm not going to shoot until it comes 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.330
 do not see one dump 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.470
 so then you can nudge him and 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.250
 destroy the vehicle and with the explosion 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.250
 for lack of 3 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.070
 God 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.070
 dizzy fruit than to this game mode 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.839
 can be the grenade launcher very well 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.429
 tascón and a mine by the way there are mines 

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:39.550
 by the map so a little bit of 

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:39.550
 watch out 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.030
 just like someone if it 's a volcano to 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.030
 10 thanks 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.720
 to give 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:12.300
 let's see the magic not 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.300
 the area has the ground to the water sorry 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.000
 uncle fuck 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.639
 has died yes sir 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.620
 do the blue I'm going to shoot him because 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.240
 if he is not going to win the one that surely 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.400
 will win the but I prefer the game 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.400
 last a little more than five minutes 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.520
 Madness Madness Madness 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.290
 when you go co-pilot with rocket launchers 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.880
 also at least what you can do 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.810
 is if you see that you are going to overturn, I will 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.690
 get out of the car what you can do 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.969
 shoot the ground and your own missile makes 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.659
 what 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.659
 we are going to turn it 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:05.120
 of relief help because little else 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.120
 because I do not play we have not died there 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.880
 paris and dump is the fun of this 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.870
 game mode 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.870
 look how you see there 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.360
 that's why I run 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.889
 can only kill us when we are in 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.599
 land 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.189
 but good as you have seen there what I have 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.780
 fact has been as we have seen that as 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.620
 seen that we're going to capsize and we're going to 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.930
 die for what this has been 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.850
 we go double death yes sir has been 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.520
 shoot at the ground and as if as invisible 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.320
 we have been able 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.390
 do not 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.390
 been able to resume the walk 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:51.929
 or destroy the greens destroy the 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.929
 orchestras de huelquén 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.750
 war day 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:05.020
 five minutes to win the blue is 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.020
 clear so 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:15.520
 went around several times I shit on the 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:18.410
 turns 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.240
 Well, this game has been cut 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.550
 recorder so I'll surely put it 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.870
 with the cinema mode and it's already like that 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.080
 I look forward to it and until the next 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.080
 video
