00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
movements and location where they're

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.400

going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.940> clean<00:00:48.660> read<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> text

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
going to and clean read the text

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
going to and clean read the text
messages<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:51.629> best<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.440> has<00:00:52.620> GPS

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
messages and the best of all it has GPS

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.500 
messages and the best of all it has GPS
tracking<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:55.129> if<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.399> say<00:00:56.940> they're<00:00:57.329> going

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
tracking so if they say they're going

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.689 
tracking so if they say they're going
somewhere<00:00:57.870> then<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:59.340> verify<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:01.699> so

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
somewhere then you can verify it and so

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.710 
somewhere then you can verify it and so
it's<00:01:03.629> really<00:01:04.080> been<00:01:04.199> handy<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.360> also<00:01:06.360> keeping

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it's really been handy in also keeping

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
it's really been handy in also keeping
an<00:01:06.810> eye<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> children<00:01:07.460> there's<00:01:08.460> many
