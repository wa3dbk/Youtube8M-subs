00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:12.920
 Hi, I 'm piasson, welcome to 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:18.119
 my soul is the correct way of 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:22.140
 pencil point is just doing a little 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.240
 summary here it is important that you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.090
 the friend to the previous one when I explained 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:34.890
 about graduation there we are in 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.610
 babies of the gaza then do not let 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.809
 to see né 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.809
 who here 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:49.440
 so come on the first one is avoid one 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.870
 exe traditional pointer because you 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.469
 will lose me more than half of the other 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.469
 side is 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.850
 besides you lose what a pencil is 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:08.460
 you will lose a quali given also in the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.830
 What I draw is the then do not 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.740
 send the material here that I explained 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.890
 about this quality you will lose 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.830
 to use a traditional computer then 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.979
 the advisable is the knowledge is 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.100
 in this select it has of several types in 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.960
 you can choose plain more 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.340
 sophisticated to the simplest all 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:38.930
 then the correct way will work 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.730
 to hold the pee in case you 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.040
 work like me 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:52.340
 where you will pick to the right with this 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:55.910
 and will support Aquino Lagos and the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.020
 who will do the strength is not that not 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:02.900
 here it is there you will have firmness what 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.700
 will make the force and that the finger here 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.830
 other hand will only put here it goes 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.090
 to do it that way you just go 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:20.020
 take the wood is not had nothing to 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:24.890
 pretend you're going to enjoy it 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:28.010
 here I am working here with a lapse 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.530
 so simple right but probably 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.930
 As you run, everyone's entered. 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.390
 for example you will want to buy one 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.050
 more sophisticated material then it is very 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.660
 important that sea ​​is learning 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:46.350
 to care for as long as the material 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:50.580
 It's ahead you'll see is that 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.970
 beyond our range here of hb 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.750
 in case the more you see is a pencil 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.960
 softer darker branch to 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.630
 volumes on a in the case of h is a pencil 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.820
 it's harder drier, huh? 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.040
 for example in fact it is very little 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.110
 used in artistic drawing h 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.940
 he would be ready a drawing like that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.900
 neco more technical than a pencil very 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.120
 hard 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.990
 if you do not know how to work with him 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.610
 You end up sinking the paper and the fiber. 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:27.540
 the role and will then bring you a problem 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:30.720
 drawing is not good then the curve 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.320
 I explained to you right once again 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.680
 capture the other a little bigger maybe 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.460
 to enter better then with a hand that 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.330
 hold the hand that will make this force 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.760
 other 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.420
 Thank you, do not take it here so you do not hurt.

 goalkeeper always picks up on the soft part 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:57.600
 and thus makes a good result in the 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.760
 its side is then beyond this scale 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.610
 the more who you 're going to realize 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.520
