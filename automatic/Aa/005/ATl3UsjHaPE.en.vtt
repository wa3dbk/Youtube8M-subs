what you call it I'll see if I can get a
decent<00:02:35.700> shot<00:02:37.760> there<00:02:38.760> we<00:02:38.910> go<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:39.959> the

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
decent shot there we go this is the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.400 
decent shot there we go this is the
frame<00:02:41.540> I'd<00:02:42.540> say<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:42.959> about<00:02:44.810> 10<00:02:45.810> inches<00:02:46.019> right

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
frame I'd say it's about 10 inches right

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.590 
frame I'd say it's about 10 inches right
here<00:02:46.470> from<00:02:47.070> top<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.489> bottom<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.269> it's<00:02:48.420> kind<00:02:48.570> of

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
here from top to bottom and it's kind of

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.470 
here from top to bottom and it's kind of
odd<00:02:48.780> beam<00:02:48.959> shaped<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:50.150> then<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.239> have<00:02:51.360> these

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
odd beam shaped and then you have these

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.039 
odd beam shaped and then you have these
little<00:02:51.709> steel<00:02:52.709> supports<00:02:53.160> right<00:02:53.310> here<00:02:57.049> that's

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
little steel supports right here that's

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.259 
little steel supports right here that's
still<00:02:58.290> kind<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.620> good<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.100> mean<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.150> got<00:03:00.239> a

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
still kind of good I mean it's got a

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.360 
still kind of good I mean it's got a
little<00:03:00.450> bit<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.709> weather<00:03:01.709> damage<00:03:01.950> but<00:03:02.250> it's

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
little bit of weather damage but it's

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.979 
little bit of weather damage but it's
still<00:03:02.519> usable<00:03:02.880> like<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.540> want<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.750> have<00:03:03.870> an

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
rid of it have no use for it have no

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
rid of it have no use for it have no
need<00:05:36.620> for<00:05:36.950> it<00:05:37.070> and<00:05:38.290> I<00:05:39.290> figure<00:05:39.620> hopefully

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
need for it and I figure hopefully

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.080 
need for it and I figure hopefully
somebody<00:05:40.940> could<00:05:41.540> get<00:05:41.690> some<00:05:41.870> use<00:05:42.020> out<00:05:42.200> of<00:05:42.410> it

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
somebody could get some use out of it

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:51.270 
somebody could get some use out of it
maybe<00:05:44.090> even<00:05:44.270> make<00:05:44.480> a<00:05:44.510> little<00:05:44.660> money<00:05:44.780> off<00:05:45.020> of<00:05:45.200> it

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.840 

go<00:05:52.280> around<00:05:52.400> front<00:05:52.880> here<00:05:53.120> one<00:05:53.270> more<00:05:53.420> time<00:05:57.850> and

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
go around front here one more time and

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.960 
go around front here one more time and
try<00:05:59.060> to<00:05:59.150> get<00:05:59.330> a<00:05:59.360> shot<00:05:59.630> of<00:05:59.750> the<00:05:59.870> whole<00:06:00.020> thing
