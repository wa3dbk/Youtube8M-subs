 that changed my life and there are many in 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.100
 youtube but I find it interesting 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.500
 combat share them to you this 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.699
 adventure has served me well that is 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.699
 the next 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.610
 the next user 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.860
 Where is 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.910
 the next user that is from omar 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.220
 I'll tell you the truth, thanks to your water 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.290
 sea ​​that the truth is very good 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.690
 they can see and I just come to share 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.370
 good first of all, the index varies 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.090
 caracas or left them in the description of 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.460
 video but I for saving good time 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.560
 I'm not going to download it so I 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.590
 they tended this file 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.990
 we open it and we're going to open it before 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.930
 nothing, I'm going to check that here they could 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.369
 see that it already marks me with 3 gigabytes but 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.369
 in my case my memory was gb or 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.220
 954 megabytes and low this works with 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.119
 any this with any memory 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.360
 can have 32 megabytes 64 mb 32 megs 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.720
 84 megabytes one hundred thousand 100 megabytes what 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.390
 be and what this program does is 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.600
 increase up to 4 gigabytes I do not know if 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.479
 you without a love of 4 gigabytes 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.819
 I do not know if you increase it to 6 to 8 I do not know 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.649
 but you must do it since it is a 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.319
 very good program and you can see me 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.270
 it worked for me first of all 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:04.659
 this procedure make a backup of 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.659
 all your cellphone of your music 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.380
 of his images of everything I had here 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.470
 the backup will ensure that the same 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.470
 well I do not know if they want me to show you 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:28.680
 will show us 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:28.680
 if I have a memory of a script 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.030
 then connect my cell phone 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.930
 keep listening and we will possess weapons 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.410
 and if you wonder why you started 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.400
 session to the streets to show them the 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.400
 the memory 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.260
 let's go to tools 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.590
 options 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.590
 Video settings 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.730
 You can see that I'm showing you there 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.599
 how much do I have from memory I do not know if 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.599
 it is extinguished 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.390
 with water 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.769
 I think we can distinguish 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.819
 ah 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.430
 and ready let her put it on the phone 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.430
 mobile 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.379
 ready we grabbed the usb cable this 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.199
 also serves for the pendrive for 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:19.889
 USB memories works just like for 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:26.610
 sd memories or cell phone rooms 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:29.719
 and well we will open the driver and pigs 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.240
 remember to make a cellular backup to your 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:35.090
 memory and good here we are going to put the 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.960
 name that we have to our 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.960
 our usb or pendrive 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.729
 forgiveness sd or pendrive in my case is that 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.960
 all right 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:50.050
 we must put it in capital letters not 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.219
 put ok even if you lowercase 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.499
 they put and here it does not go with saying that 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:58.240
 let's put in my case here is the m between 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:02.409
 parentheses and see what it says here that the 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.339
 cove l in our case here says the m and 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:09.750
 we put it in capital letters and here the 

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:13.320
 we put capital 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.200
 and here I would start doing it here already has 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.650
 done the process already 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.840
 you can see and we go on the teams and here 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.470
 I'm going to suffice because doing 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.160
 its already obviously formatted and already 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.830
 with its four gigabytes 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.500
 available 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.920
 and well I hope it worked for them 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.920
 this video 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.940
 there is nothing left to tell them 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.920
 subscribe and go through the channel 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:50.370
 from the creator of the video that actually 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:53.760
 would have would be like a grass or 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.170
 be I copied it and I pasted it good I hope 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.990
