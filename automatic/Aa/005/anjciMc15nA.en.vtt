just<00:00:12.179> came<00:00:12.540> out<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.410> year<00:00:13.549> actually<00:00:14.690> this

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
just came out this year actually this

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.960 
just came out this year actually this
month<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.500> believe<00:00:17.330> mine<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.510> dated<00:00:18.869> 12<00:00:19.400> 2013<00:00:20.400> so

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
month I believe mine is dated 12 2013 so

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.330 
month I believe mine is dated 12 2013 so
December<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:22.140> know<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:22.800> prototypes

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
December I do know that some prototypes

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.450 
December I do know that some prototypes
came<00:00:23.640> out<00:00:23.789> earlier<00:00:24.210> obviously<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
came out earlier obviously but this is a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.000 
came out earlier obviously but this is a
new<00:00:26.730> model<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.630> came<00:00:27.810> out<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.650> far<00:00:28.859> as<00:00:28.949> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
new model that just came out as far as I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.359 
new model that just came out as far as I
know<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.550> only<00:00:29.789> offered<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:31.369> custom

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
know it is only offered in the custom

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.549 
know it is only offered in the custom
variety<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:33.930> imagine<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.440> gonna

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
variety and I would imagine it's gonna

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.709 
variety and I would imagine it's gonna
stay<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.100> way<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.309> don't<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.210> don't<00:00:36.600> see

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
stay that way I don't think I don't see

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.139 
stay that way I don't think I don't see
how<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.989> would<00:00:37.170> translate<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:38.149> production

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
how this would translate to a production

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.540 
how this would translate to a production
version<00:00:39.530> because<00:00:40.530> really<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.340> already

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
version because really there is already

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
version because really there is already
a<00:00:41.760> production<00:00:42.210> version<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.660> SOCOM<00:00:43.230> Delta

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
a production version of the SOCOM Delta

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.819 
a production version of the SOCOM Delta
which<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.460> pretty<00:00:44.940> much<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> same<00:00:45.390> knife<00:00:45.829> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
which is pretty much the same knife the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.430 
which is pretty much the same knife the
Bravo<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.489> features<00:00:47.969> bolsters<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.930> think

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
Bravo here features bolsters I think

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.680 
Bravo here features bolsters I think
this<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> first<00:00:50.160> micro<00:00:50.579> tech<00:00:50.760> model<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
this is the first micro tech model to

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.410 
this is the first micro tech model to
have<00:00:51.899> bolsters<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> could<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.039> wrong<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:54.239> it's

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
have bolsters I could be wrong and it's

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.880 
have bolsters I could be wrong and it's
pretty<00:00:54.629> cool<00:00:54.840> because<00:00:55.520> these<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.789> actually

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
pretty cool because these are actually

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.939 
pretty cool because these are actually
milled<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.609> piece<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.940> titanium<00:01:00.090> as

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
milled out of one piece of titanium as

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.590 
milled out of one piece of titanium as
you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.699> titanium

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
you can see right there the titanium

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.120 
you can see right there the titanium
liners<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:05.450> actually<00:01:06.450> all<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:07.409> piece<00:01:07.710> with

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
liners are actually all one piece with

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.340 
liners are actually all one piece with
the<00:01:08.549> bolsters<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:09.960> how<00:01:10.170> they

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the bolsters and you can see how they

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.950 
the bolsters and you can see how they
even<00:01:10.650> machined<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:11.520> lip<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> green

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
even machined a little lip for the green

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.450 
even machined a little lip for the green
canvas<00:01:13.290> micarta<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:14.130> fit<00:01:14.340> into<00:01:15.049> very<00:01:16.049> cool

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
canvas micarta to fit into very cool

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.850 
canvas micarta to fit into very cool
precision<00:01:17.460> machinery<00:01:18.180> right<00:01:18.570> there<00:01:18.869> because

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
precision machinery right there because

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.490 
precision machinery right there because
typically<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:20.430> you'd<00:01:20.580> see<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.479> liner<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
typically what you'd see is a liner and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.490 
typically what you'd see is a liner and
then<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> thicker<00:01:23.610> piece<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.119> titanium<00:01:24.780> that

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
then a thicker piece of titanium that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.499 
then a thicker piece of titanium that
would<00:01:25.680> actually<00:01:26.070> sit<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.430> top<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.360> be

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
would actually sit on top and then be

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.050 
would actually sit on top and then be
held<00:01:27.689> together<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.770> screw<00:01:29.369> usually<00:01:29.850> right

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
held together with a screw usually right

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.690 
held together with a screw usually right
here<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.960> course<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> pivot<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.549> then

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
here and of course the pivot and then

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
here and of course the pivot and then
the<00:01:32.820> same<00:01:33.030> thing<00:01:33.060> with<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.750> scale<00:01:34.170> would<00:01:34.619> be

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the same thing with the scale would be

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.560 
the same thing with the scale would be
held<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.520> liners<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.329> case

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
held on to the liners but in this case

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.050 
held on to the liners but in this case
they<00:01:37.170> took<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.439> thick<00:01:37.860> piece<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.159> titanium<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
they took a thick piece of titanium and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.780 
they took a thick piece of titanium and
milled<00:01:39.960> out<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.560> piece<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.670> inlay<00:01:43.670> sort<00:01:44.670> of

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
milled out a piece here to inlay sort of

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.190 
milled out a piece here to inlay sort of
inlay<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.930> canvas<00:01:46.560> micarta<00:01:47.390> which<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.659> 3d

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
inlay the canvas micarta which is 3d

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.130 
inlay the canvas micarta which is 3d
machined<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.579> see<00:01:50.729> right<00:01:50.909> there

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
machined as you can see right there

some<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.730> newer<00:04:25.000> finishes<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.230> are

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
some of the newer finishes that are

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.020 
some of the newer finishes that are
popular<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.950> stone<00:04:27.190> washing<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.970> the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
popular the stone washing and the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.230 
popular the stone washing and the
bronzing<00:04:28.540> and<00:04:28.750> things<00:04:28.900> like<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:30.240> mainly

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
bronzing and things like that mainly

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.120 
bronzing and things like that mainly
just<00:04:31.360> because<00:04:31.570> it<00:04:31.870> makes<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.380> easier<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.920> carry

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
just because it makes it easier to carry

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.310 
just because it makes it easier to carry
it's<00:04:34.000> hard<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.480> carry<00:04:34.690> knives<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.260> have

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
it's hard to carry knives that have

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.010 
it's hard to carry knives that have
these<00:04:35.650> beautiful<00:04:36.280> polishes<00:04:37.030> or<00:04:37.360> satin

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
these beautiful polishes or satin

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.190 
these beautiful polishes or satin
finishes<00:04:38.820> because<00:04:39.820> they<00:04:40.060> scratch<00:04:40.690> easily

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
finishes because they scratch easily

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.680 
finishes because they scratch easily
especially<00:04:41.680> if<00:04:42.040> you're<00:04:42.160> talking<00:04:42.520> about

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
especially if you're talking about

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.990 
especially if you're talking about
titanium<00:04:43.690> because<00:04:44.590> titanium<00:04:45.250> is<00:04:45.370> rather<00:04:45.550> soft

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
titanium because titanium is rather soft

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.760 
titanium because titanium is rather soft
it<00:04:46.270> doesn't<00:04:46.570> take<00:04:46.660> much<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:47.050> scratch<00:04:47.320> it<00:04:47.560> and

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
it doesn't take much to scratch it and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.610 
it doesn't take much to scratch it and
that's<00:04:48.700> why<00:04:48.930> stone<00:04:49.930> washing<00:04:50.350> is<00:04:50.440> such<00:04:50.590> a

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
that's why stone washing is such a

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.650 
that's why stone washing is such a
popular<00:04:50.950> finish<00:04:51.520> because<00:04:51.730> it<00:04:51.880> just<00:04:52.090> it<00:04:52.360> hides

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
popular finish because it just it hides

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.140 
popular finish because it just it hides
all<00:04:53.080> those<00:04:53.350> little<00:04:53.620> marks<00:04:53.980> and<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.970> more
