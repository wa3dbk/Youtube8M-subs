00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:09.800
 my name is phage gp and in this video I'm going 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.780
 to teach them how to install the software 2 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.250
 legacy of kain 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.700
 The first thing we need is 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.950
 unzip the 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.360
 the weird and we are going to follow all these 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.390
 archives in important every time and jesÃ© 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.539
 as care tv.com 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.869
 we have to open we have to assemble the 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:35.320
 image we present a program for 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.510
 do it I have the moon tools no 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.440
 I know another one but the one you have for 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.730
 mount or burn an image will serve 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.160
 so what we have to do is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.920
 I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.440
 with this program 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.160
 we are going to 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.160
 to 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.590
 we go devices habit we see this that 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.540
 it's empty we click right and 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.840
 we mount mount control-m would be 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.510
 we look for the game about seeing where 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.330
 we download the file where 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.330
 unzip and find the and jesÃ© 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.730
 We wait for the mount and here goes 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.150
 to open this 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.870
 this screen to install the game will 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.200
 we install 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.530
 Yes I agree 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.280
 we give the next one we're going to give it in 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.310
 the second 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.260
 for the maximum installation, remember 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.120
 where will he be 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.090
 installed from the file because we're going to 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.200
 need this address 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.200
 them interactive 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.100
 really good 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.810
 we wait for the game to be installed 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.920
 once it is installed, it will come out 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:02:00.049
 this little screen with direct access in the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.680
 desk and read file ln this is not what 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.350
 I want to read good, good if we're going to read 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.600
 this one does not have to start the single released 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.210
 for now we still do not have to do 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.460
 something else so we finished 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.860
 choosing to read the file 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.530
 once we give it final we come to 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.480
 the folder create more update version 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.780

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.290
 and it is there agree all next is already 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.430
 patched 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.430
 this does not end here we grab the crack 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.430
 we copy 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.410
 this sr2 file of the crack folder 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.800
 we go to program files and two 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.010
 interactive sun river 2 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.550
 and we are going to paste the file that we just 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.550
 to copy 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.200
 if he tells us that we want to replace them 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.200
 if we want 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.709
 and we are ready to double click here and 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.709
 We started playing 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.260
