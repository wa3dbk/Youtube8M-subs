more<00:01:31.079> oxygen<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.710> body<00:01:32.000> our<00:01:33.000> strength<00:01:33.450> it's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
more oxygen your body our strength it's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.330 
more oxygen your body our strength it's
moving<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.380> exists<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.979> energy

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
moving a little exists that energy

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.740 
moving a little exists that energy
exactly<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:35.850> we<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.659> our

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
exactly so we and then we got our

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.990 
exactly so we and then we got our
recovery<00:01:37.140> stuff<00:01:37.350> which<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.310> help<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.880> we'd

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
recovery stuff which will help so we'd

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.100 
recovery stuff which will help so we'd
all<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> muscle<00:01:39.360> breakdown<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.020> can

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
all have the muscle breakdown so we can

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.179 
all have the muscle breakdown so we can
get<00:01:40.200> back<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.590> we're<00:01:40.710> trying<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.100> as

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
get back to what we're trying to do as

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.590 
get back to what we're trying to do as
far<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.369> our<00:01:41.520> goals<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.000> next<00:01:42.030> day<00:01:42.299> and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
when you have a lot more energy going

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.499 
when you have a lot more energy going
into<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.399> workout<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.880> makes<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.149> work<00:01:45.329> out

out<00:02:56.049> so<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:56.530> hard<00:02:56.769> for<00:02:56.860> him<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.130> recover<00:02:57.790> and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
out so it's hard for him to recover and

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.430 
out so it's hard for him to recover and
bounce<00:02:58.269> back<00:02:58.569> from<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.930> workout<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.380> the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
bounce back from a workout in the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.140 
bounce back from a workout in the
morning<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.829> another<00:02:59.980> workout<00:03:00.310> or<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.640> training

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
morning to another workout or a training

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.640 
morning to another workout or a training
maybe<00:03:01.299> even<00:03:01.450> technique<00:03:01.810> session<00:03:02.140> at<00:03:02.260> night<00:03:02.410> so

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
maybe even technique session at night so

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.020 
maybe even technique session at night so
we<00:03:03.040> want<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.220> make<00:03:03.340> sure<00:03:03.370> we're<00:03:03.760> designing

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
we want to make sure we're designing

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.550 
we want to make sure we're designing
something<00:03:04.450> for<00:03:04.569> them<00:03:04.840> in<00:03:04.930> our<00:03:05.049> store<00:03:05.349> that's

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
something for them in our store that's

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.599 
something for them in our store that's
perfect<00:03:06.040> for<00:03:06.099> what<00:03:06.250> they're<00:03:06.400> trying<00:03:06.519> to

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
perfect for what they're trying to

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.490 
perfect for what they're trying to
accomplish<00:03:06.730> yeah<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.690> we<00:03:07.930> talked<00:03:08.170> about<00:03:08.290> this

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
accomplish yeah and we talked about this

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.170 
accomplish yeah and we talked about this
last<00:03:08.560> time<00:03:08.920> in<00:03:09.069> this<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.670> this<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:09.850> also

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
last time in this and this is also

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.380 
last time in this and this is also
critical<00:03:10.569> but<00:03:10.989> but<00:03:11.440> protein<00:03:12.040> protein<00:03:12.940> is

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
critical but but protein protein is

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.819 
critical but but protein protein is
really<00:03:13.720> what<00:03:13.930> helps<00:03:14.260> your<00:03:14.890> muscles<00:03:15.510> but

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
really what helps your muscles but

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.949 
really what helps your muscles but
bounced<00:03:17.829> back<00:03:18.130> after<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.700> workout<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.359> then<00:03:19.540> so

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
bounced back after a workout and then so

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.569 
bounced back after a workout and then so
getting<00:03:20.230> enough<00:03:20.500> protein<00:03:20.680> after<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.280> workout

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
getting enough protein after the workout

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.789 
getting enough protein after the workout
is<00:03:21.639> critical<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.239> is<00:03:22.690> can't<00:03:23.109> you<00:03:23.560> learn

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
is critical that is can't you learn

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.960 
is critical that is can't you learn
something<00:03:24.389> listening<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:27.370> biggest<00:03:27.730> thing<00:03:27.850> is

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
something listening the biggest thing is

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.129 
something listening the biggest thing is
when<00:03:28.090> you're<00:03:28.180> working<00:03:28.359> out<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:28.720> know<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.019> sounds

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
when you're working out I know it sounds

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:30.150 
when you're working out I know it sounds
kind<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.440> strange<00:03:29.620> but<00:03:29.829> you're<00:03:29.980> actually

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
kind of strange but you're actually

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.460 
kind of strange but you're actually
straining<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:30.940> muscle<00:03:31.269> tearing<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:31.660> down<00:03:31.690> so

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
straining the muscle tearing it down so

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.650 
straining the muscle tearing it down so
to<00:03:32.530> rebuild<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.519> takes<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:34.030> protein<00:03:34.480> and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
to rebuild it it takes that protein and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.690 
to rebuild it it takes that protein and
protein<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.200> build<00:03:35.590> blocking<00:03:36.130> building<00:03:36.489> of

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.120 
protein is build blocking building of
amino<00:03:37.299> acids<00:03:37.750> there's<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.350> lot<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.650> protein<00:03:39.010> out

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130

to<00:03:44.889> your<00:03:45.310> muscle<00:03:45.609> structure<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.480> if<00:03:46.569> you<00:03:46.690> can

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
to your muscle structure so if you can

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.770

hour 30 minutes to an hour after your
workout<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:53.079> are<00:03:53.230> feeling<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.680> muscle

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
workout you are feeling that muscle

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.979 
workout you are feeling that muscle
helping<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.459> regain<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:55.269> more<00:03:55.480> that<00:03:55.600> we<00:03:55.720> have

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
helping it regain the more that we have

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.680 
helping it regain the more that we have
of<00:03:56.290> muscle<00:03:57.250> to<00:03:57.340> our<00:03:57.430> body<00:03:57.609> to<00:03:57.700> fat<00:03:57.940> ratio<00:03:58.150> our

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
of muscle to our body to fat ratio our

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.990 
of muscle to our body to fat ratio our
metabolism<00:03:59.440> is<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.530> lot<00:03:59.650> higher<00:03:59.829> so<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.519> burn<00:04:00.970> a

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
metabolism is a lot higher so you burn a

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.280 
metabolism is a lot higher so you burn a
lot<00:04:01.180> more<00:04:01.269> calories<00:04:01.599> when<00:04:01.690> you're<00:04:01.810> at<00:04:01.870> rest<00:04:02.049> so

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
lot more calories when you're at rest so

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.080 
lot more calories when you're at rest so
you<00:04:02.349> put<00:04:02.650> those<00:04:02.739> workouts<00:04:03.190> how<00:04:03.670> you<00:04:03.730> want<00:04:04.030> to

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
you put those workouts how you want to

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.940 
you put those workouts how you want to
get<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.329> push<00:04:04.569> it<00:04:04.599> really<00:04:04.810> hard<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.680> rests

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
get it push it really hard and it rests

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.410 
get it push it really hard and it rests
you're<00:04:06.190> burning<00:04:06.430> more<00:04:06.519> calories<00:04:06.700> that's<00:04:07.209> the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
you're burning more calories that's the

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.640 
you're burning more calories that's the
whole<00:04:07.450> game<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.019> yeah<00:04:08.139> let's<00:04:08.380> talk<00:04:08.500> about

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
whole game of it yeah let's talk about

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.229 
whole game of it yeah let's talk about
carbs<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.340> know<00:04:09.400> when<00:04:09.639> I<00:04:09.670> when<00:04:09.880> people<00:04:10.120> talk

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
carbs I know when I when people talk

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.999 
carbs I know when I when people talk
about<00:04:10.269> carbs<00:04:10.750> with<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:11.079> it's<00:04:11.470> kind<00:04:11.590> of<00:04:11.680> a<00:04:11.799> bad

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:12.009 
about carbs with a it's kind of a bad

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:13.200 
about carbs with a it's kind of a bad
word<00:04:12.250> sometimes

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
word sometimes

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.540 
word sometimes
but<00:04:13.690> what<00:04:13.960> is<00:04:14.230> it<00:04:14.500> no<00:04:14.920> you<00:04:14.980> know<00:04:15.220> there's<00:04:15.430> still
