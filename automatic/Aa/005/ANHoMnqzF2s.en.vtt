00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
good it's squishy but after a while I

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.130 
good it's squishy but after a while I
could<00:02:01.770> picture<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.159> getting<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.700> flat<00:02:03.140> like

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
could picture it getting like flat like

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.709 
could picture it getting like flat like
and<00:02:04.590> not<00:02:05.340> having<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.729> squish<00:02:06.060> anymore<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.659> if

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
and not having that squish anymore so if

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.059 
and not having that squish anymore so if
you're<00:02:06.750> gonna<00:02:06.930> do<00:02:07.110> something<00:02:07.350> off<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> gap
