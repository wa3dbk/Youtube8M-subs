00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
yes this is quite a big bottle too if

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.289 
yes this is quite a big bottle too if
this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.040> supposed<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.579> hairspray

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
this is supposed to be hairspray

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.090 
this is supposed to be hairspray
although<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:49.200> use<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.590> as<00:01:49.710> hairspray

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
although I don't use it as hairspray

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.760 
although I don't use it as hairspray
because<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.549> doesn't<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.060> any<00:01:51.299> hold<00:01:52.170> at<00:01:52.470> all

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
because it doesn't have any hold at all

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.560 
because it doesn't have any hold at all
so<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.130> definitely<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.000> recommend<00:01:54.360> this

so I definitely would not recommend this
for<00:01:54.930> hairspray<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.310> amazing

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.730 
for hairspray but what this is amazing
for<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.210> texture<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.659> shine<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.560> you
