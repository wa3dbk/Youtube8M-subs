00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 give with you give a few 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.270
 tips for novice photographers 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.460
 how they need to behave on the set for 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.990
 most profitable models for beginners 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.670
 photographer usually work then 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.679
 it is beneficial for him to take a model so that she 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.000
 worked from a photo he didn't pay her 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.780
 money to make it profitable 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.930
 cooperation 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.029
 that is, the model is most profitable is 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.189
 model tests some portraits 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.740
 some kind of fashion some kind of beauty 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.070
 there is if the photographer is a beginner are turning 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.439
 to a model with some particular tone idea 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.030
 as a rule should formulate it in 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.800
 first to get it to pick it up 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.309
 that they want from her as a rule like me 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.370
 I usually ask the question what is where when your 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.379
 photos who the makeup artist for what we shoot 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.329
 where the photos will go then there is a person 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.739
 should competently responsible clearly on 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.270
 all these simple questions are what 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.730
 the conversation begins that so 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.829
 take pictures well and then 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.870
 We come up there as if something is well, as 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.579
 you shouldn't waste time on it 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.620
 models are not a photographer, what a model can 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.539
 hit the bad photographer and the photographer 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.920
 may have such a model that she 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.650
 will come to the shooting itself will not know what 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.500
 do at all in fact only would 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.550
 it is not clear that they wanted a model from her 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.410
 the agency is also willing 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.690
 collaborate with young beginner 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.220
 photographer in the sense that there are new 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.800
 person agency that can also 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.410
 self-realize they are actively working 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.780
 with novice photographer give them models then 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.640
 there is a photographer gaining experience and model 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.740
 gaining experience can even provide 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.270
 so would deal with a group that is how 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.090
 would tea which has a certain skill 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.800
 yes as a professional photographer 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.240
 should should contact the agency and 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.340
 start collaborating in general makita 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.010
 favorable conditions and the agency I told him 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.290
 most importantly do not forget to model 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.390
 this is not the client and there are a few others 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.550
 requirements and on the organization of shooting there 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.740
 there is this moment avenged mead then 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.590
 what not to forget you need something thought model 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.060
 withdrawn the contract must be made out 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.130
 This certificate that there were no such that I 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.780
 took cool pictures turned out there 1 1 1 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.150
 life times and can use them anywhere 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.950
 and secondly, the models are still 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.140
 need such shooting that we have in that 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.120
 be able to put in a portfolio that is 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.440
 working with a model she is more scrupulous 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.440
 a little why with the client
