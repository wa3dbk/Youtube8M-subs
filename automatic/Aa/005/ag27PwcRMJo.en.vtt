 hockey boot 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.390

 in 2007 month of july 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.820
 you can create 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.820
 many computers currently in dublin with the device 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.990
 then it is essential that it united much if one speculates the reader says that s 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.699
 that you will be able to burn many nei files not much more some files 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.269
 that the whole chains 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:39.260
 you can quietly store museum 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.250
 in the southeast is hockey

 What is a boot disk for? 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.970
 the boot disk if you are experiencing common problems with 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.489
 your computer is 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.460
 if your computer does not boot you use the boot disk 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.460
 to use to save the files 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.180
 and access the operating system 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.810
 this is already a forward thing of computer maintenance 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.580
 or hot 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.920
 create with the boot disk let's first place you 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.430
 Where did you drive? 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.780
 I've already put my 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.780
 go there do not ask for my computer 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.950
 giving a double click 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.570

 floppy disk 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.690
 let's take two clicks and check what's inside the floppy disk 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.910
 well this one of skateboard and has none that the engraved inside of it has so much hall of 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:29.570
 archive 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.870
 that the batch had already recorded some meliton files let's erase those 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.120
 files here 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.300
 and let's create 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.890
 another disk 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.720
 d eliminates the donation for him 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.250
 not very difficult to people is very practical simple and practical 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.060
 let's go back 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 then you have accessed and printed your computer or close again 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.520
 gives a double-click kimmel computer

 right-click the floppy disk 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.560
 that will appear 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.259
 various options here at the beginning in search sharing and security 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.539
 copy disk 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.570
 or format that our choice we want 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.430
 another person another method of access also by clicking the left 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.160
 on 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.709
 and in the File menu press the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.739
 and goes to the pisão 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.499
 format, we will now click the ocde 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.599
 here it will appear in the options 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.129
 You'll mark only this one is the creator says who I tell you a 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.079
 initialization of the 2nd time 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.959
 done that all the cars that fly to be deactivated because the essence 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.879
 it's just a risk 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.879
 done this click on start 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.120
 after starting the message the formatting message is deleted 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.680
 all the data on the disk 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.809
 what is formatting forma efe 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:46.789
 create floppy disk recording sectors or at certain says run 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.939
 both in knowing how much in dvd but also can take possession of it can format a 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:51.640
 DVD 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.279
 to capate files and create sectors 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:57.779
 so he can honor and record again clear if it was a rewritable cd 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:02.839
 and also on the hard disk is that it is the hard disk corpse or with igcp 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.999
 done that click ok 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.209
 and already will power will start 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.899
 to process 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.460
 the recording of the sectors 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.279
 recording 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:17.219
 and while such a form says it is typical and the boot files 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.989
 of the beginning of the month 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.989
 that it is very simple and practical who 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.069
 Let's wait a little bit. 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.319
 It's getting to half 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.299
 so we just ask here 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.089
 creates says 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:45.219
 in the file system makes 30 in 2001 it was bad in the first version 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.849
 used fateh 12 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.989
 farhat first is strong then came fateh 12 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.160
 fact 16 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.529
 32 is beginning here 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:59.629
 the floppy disk also forms on the new fateh 12 file system 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.689
 which is the file system or two old files 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.689
 in the first system that Microsoft created 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:09.049
 what does walking to fatima mean 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.819
 failing the complaint the time is with the beautiful allocation of files on the network 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.079
 goes from leandra hand to the files in the form of table system tables 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.870
 this is already a part of computer maintenance is the course 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.009
 more advanced 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.009
 that you will see 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.030
 done this click on format are complete click ok 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.240
 Ok let's close 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.659
 and let's explain explains that the khaki interest 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.990
 its boot files were created 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.749
 now enough you 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.580
 and want to start the computer 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.560
 to sesa the shoe and set to give an ultimatum but as it says that it is chic 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.880
 it will access the operating system now 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.889
 How about once I played 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.300
 This was our first video lesson creating boutique
