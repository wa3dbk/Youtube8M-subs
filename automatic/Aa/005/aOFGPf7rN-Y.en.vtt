00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:35.070
 he has his charge but can not talk about 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:35.910
 what I was already explaining is 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.550
 understandable 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.750
 I understood it angel soccer starter 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.550
 you remember that at the end of the matches 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.170
 performances, weird things, I see it 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.940
 understandable was the one of the parties in 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.289
 many season endings have been 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.610
 a series of situations I record a 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.800
 I do not know if it was a real partnership 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.030
 against getafe a couple of years ago that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.739
 they faced 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.720
 with the tie that came missing 15 to 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.980
 20 minutes was going quite and in the end 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.980
 they did not fight 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:29.230
 at the time of scoring the goal of tamudo 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.850
 we see the goal of tamudo 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.850
 what is produced with this play 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.660
 of a player 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.580
 low but beware if the villarreal looks 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.230
 right now this move is this action that 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.680
 they will see in their match against 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.680
 athletic of madrid 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:16.990
 and wait to see what happened because the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.150
 Malaga 11 0 to tie the stoppage could 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.860
 coordinate or 15 was playing the census 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.380
 how anyone can or can not 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.570
 recriminate anything to anyone who has 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.700
 It has acted badly his 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.150
 conscience and if something is proven then 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.819
 logically that but I insist these things 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.489
 the night is very hot and days and 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.489
 decisive controversial moves in getafe
