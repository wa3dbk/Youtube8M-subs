00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:28.619
 Hi there, this review fox motocross helmet 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.330
 racing in 2 model 2014 in coloring 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.050
 flight orange I bought it in Moscow 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.590
 moto85 for ten and a half 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 thousand rubles well plus delivery to 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.430
 Vladimir live Vladimir on ebay now 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.070
 such model costs from 200 to 300 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.820
 dollars respectively for 200 something 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.600
 there with a small 2014 model for 300 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.140
 the same model of 2015 on + delivery 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.960
 Now the USA has become dear and the course 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.950
 we have a high dollar now and price 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.799
 It turns out this very well sticking out 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.380
 I have this model in shape according to color 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.259
 I liked very much the formulas for shorter than 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.140
 my old and taller ie he is here 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.869
 closes a better chin because 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.390
 old device utyatki account chin so 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.130
 and stuck I do not like it more 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.759
 shorter this looks more compact 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:34.020
 generally very cool in my opinion size 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.869
 xl I hope to raise I can see on the head 61 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.729
 62 centimeters I have a head well 62 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.829
 I ordered a centimeter through the Internet 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.950
 There is not previously measured but a helmet 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.899
 came up just sitting like a very flush 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.149
 tightly 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.569
 head bows if you shake your head 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.030
 left right forward backward 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.639
 nowhere does he even attempt to move out 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.679
 so I hope that if what suddenly what 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:09.429
 I will be in a situation but I will protect 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:12.890
 I am left protected so the helmet means 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.230
 The model is called 2 in general at fox 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.109
 four models of helmets well and plus there 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.230
 every time there are a lot of color models 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:24.140
 model colors you are one in two in three or 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.549
 Four in Odintsovo simple in 4 myself and 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.760
 cool this is v2 such a middling 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:35.269
 it weighs 1400 grams right here from go 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.739
 stickers unenviable no written 1400 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.879
 plus or minus 50 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.370
 but this model is more accurate helmet size 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.980
 big x and but apparently so heavier 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.169
 a little bit but he even feels in his hand 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.159
 pretty easy even across the country with my 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:54.590
 old is such a story fox 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:58.760
 promises to be certified by 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.609
 dot snail 2010 edition standards 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.510
 but such an incident came out when I bought 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:09.349
 helmet he didn't come in the mail and 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.959
 and he usually means with helmets 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.709
 here is a sticker that is certified 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.799
 according to the dot standard, she dared it stickers 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.549
 was not I contacted the store manager 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.470
 I said that they say helmets to Russia 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.790
 go without this sticker but only 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.250
 I thought that the helmet you probably all 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.199
 the same miracle Fox does not do with 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.150
 less helmet protection there for others 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:34.879
 countries 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.739
 so I calmed down on this, but 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.169
 this helmet is like all sports 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.060
 helmets and 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:43.729
 motocross in particular clasp 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.009
 double ring I'm used to me 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:47.840
 problems it does not arise the inside 

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:50.290
 all removable ie everything here is on 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.159
 rivets everything is removable can be washed 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.269
 It says that they are some kind of a 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.180
 bactericidal there is nothing there you 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.870
 it wo n't start here from the interesting 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.489
 climate, this part is also all removed here 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.799
 here it will be now visible 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.629
 entrails in general as to sit there 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:13.479
 very cool here is still such a roller 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.479
 small under the head turns 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:25.450
 so what else can I tell you 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:28.300
 glasses tarskih on such glasses cake model 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.970
 we went to the old helmet will be with him 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.870
 also went they vylazit in principle 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:38.620
 great in themselves funny glasses but 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:42.580
 I also wanted something new and ordered glasses 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.460
 hundred percent kraft flight well if you know 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.530
 they are such protection of the nose and then only 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.040
 I have a question that probably I 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.280
 nose protection will not fit into the helmet because 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.830
 I dress me here remains somewhere 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.840
 centimeter or centimeter and a half 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.720
 The argument of this gum from the nose 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.530
 but if you do not climb it means I will take off and I will 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.650
 ride without nose protection and still such 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.360
 History proved that a top hat 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.400
 it means there is a scar so for lovers 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.400
 remove coils on goupro 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.900
 put here on top of the gopro will 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.990
 problematic but the internet I saw there 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.360
 comrades one of the passive tar did 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.890
 such as an adapter but more precisely 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.320
 custom gopro pad this 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.780
 epoxy resin Tanaka pasted 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.730
 sanded and stuck it double sided 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.280
 scotch and in principle she got here I 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:43.120
 I guess I also did pieces for the beginning. 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.880
 probably side glue here gopro 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.950
 on such a helmet turns practical 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.010
 and inexpensive costs 10 half as 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:53.230
 inexpensive decent chance to become but everyones 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.680
 cool airs 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.420
 show and there 30 thousand is not even a not 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.910
 necessary because the motocross network is not 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.920
 I'm doing now, I'll probably try 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.560
 take off for you what it looks like on 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.650
 man because here are the internet videos 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.630
 all sorts of reviews you look at all of something 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.780
 tell there usually tell 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:17.770
 all sorts of advertising phrases of 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.720
 she writes the manufacturer as a person 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.910
 looks not accepted thing not to show 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.940
 so I chose to helmet I was interested 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:31.780
 but never found now try for 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:34.140

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.570
 glasses to your old tor and us 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:41.310
 so it looks like, well, let's go with 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.310
 different sides seem ahead 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:54.970
 there is no other principle behind here 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:58.390
 if you shake your head tone sits 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:02.140
 absolutely tight so here so here 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:05.980

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.900

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.600
