00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.210

 We come here to me just 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.930
 option menu you have your camera well 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.989
 party so you have the and window titles 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.750

 beauty your interest after auto battle group 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.969
 read the new target selection from 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 battle helps messages on keyboard 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.750
 missionary and pulleys setting is still 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.030
 a lie 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.670
 that's the great thing about the game 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.310
 this controller this thing that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.960
 xbox controller don't work with dave 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.060
 the one that agrees is he who 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.290
 get a shadow or mordor from cromer 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.850
 player 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.259
 we allow them to immediately start the game 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 view of your husband you can also roll it 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.030
 don't do it not 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.640
 nice here well the game is 60 gigabytes 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.590
 large with 40 gigabytes already at the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.030
 are cut scenes so you should check the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.030
 game itself only 12 you big or so 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.490
 you can't do anything with boys 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.049
 busy 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.700
 In addition, the game just prepared 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.860
 720 p 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.820
 I'll just start four 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.350
 teams 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.060
 yes you don't because I play well now 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.170
 keyboard nice and easy with fake g 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.930
 because yes you also do that with 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.469
 keyboard naturalness the wictor what 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.240
 it is the game the cunt is not running 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.399
 once fluent 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.270
 the cunts are running like me at the moment 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.840
 so hear my b x view between 55 and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.520
 the 60 jumping that is constant too 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.530
 walk on the ground during normal 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.480
 walking during it 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.370
 it us can't even type in at 60 fps 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.200
 keep because he calls to 30 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.270
 because that is programmed that way 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.280
 coach screen I do not have a full 60 fps 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.990
 nothing graphic at all 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.390
 that also concerns there is none at all 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.130
 fucking graphic in this game 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.040
 just nothing 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.600
 the only thing you have is 720 p 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.130
 that's why you have to participate and if you 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.810
 you can't necessarily handle bad luck because you 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.000
 can put him on loom medium or high 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:45.440
 angle does he do now know who you 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.440
 he is not even worth it 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.580
 and then i like boys like you 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.280
 make a game please make it 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.739
 came hat or porticoed 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.920
 advantage in graphics controller in want 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.030
 this is it is very nice for him at 22 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.860
 play cup but I think it was 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.810
 similar to the playstation did 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.030
 playing 1080 p 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.590
 so screen i don't know what you are up to 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.599
 are doing or what you are doing 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.250
 are nice that you fought a game 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.750
 to the PC what already 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.980
 every time novita happens with playstation 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.390
 3 games what I have noticed but I understand 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.590
 it's just not when you become sport then 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.420
 this is really also the most 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.280
 worthless game once a sustainable I had 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.590
 prefer a couple and port seen from place 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.010
 with 2 game of final fantasy was twelve 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.470
 much nicer because 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.610
 or final fantasy 10 in hd on the pc that 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.049
 seems like a month or 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.330
 because this game is really the most 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.400
 worthless from the franchise the great day 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.489
 the game there is a parallel you need one 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 follow device and that's it you come 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.170
 that we each frame it on a large on one 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.660
 great place ever 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.150
 there you can an I back well they 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.120
 tried to fix it with final 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.680
 fantasy 13 213 two was an open world 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.090
 you could travel between citizens 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.220
 different areas 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:11.079
 No it was the grace of the game was 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.079
 just that it really just 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.269
 I can very well come to what I have a short 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.829
 was the game of thrones' real 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.419
 just really on the short side I bought 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.100
 I won the game less than 8 hours 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.919
 played and I do not expect to 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.240
 the final fantasy games and I am to 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.370
 to be honest i am the banjaard of 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.220
 or and thief and and I really wanted one 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.780
 series that I love what I love for those 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.870
 to crack 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.509
 but yes it is a pity 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.340
 they could take as much as they did with 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.460
 I have lightning returns twice 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.889
 both japanese and official english 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.889
 the game what so much potential no how 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:51.639
 you must level through site questing 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.500
 You need her php tag to dampen the fans 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.150
 mana 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.910
 you must all get by fucking 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.410
 site hurts to do at the door becomes that 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.060
 really boring 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.789
 I swear it is therefore boring 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.310
 I am also a cat my ideas and 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:08.289
 this just doesn't like it 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.820
 the only advantage to this bend is 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.470
 you'd want the Japanese voices there 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.060
 you don't get elsewhere on the playstation 3 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.849
 also download pack is therefore 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.949
 the game also if yes that is the only one 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.530
 actually good point about the game 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.780
 because now you also run between 50 and 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.690
 the fucking 60 fps i've had i had 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:30.009
 expects a fucking movie a cunt 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:32.770
 could just see a full stuff 

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.409
 and just a good one 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:40.630
 well what is the name of a good fps here me 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:47.139
 do than fuck, I can at the 30fps 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:49.870
 it really seems like the disease i have 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:52.030
 just really sorry 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.800
 sorry and my heart that this game map 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.870
 bought 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.960
 so guys i recommend i buy this one 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:04.360
 don't play on teams, but if you 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:06.849
 want to have him just for the merchant 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.990
 playstation 3 and then our goes for me 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:12.550
 I will be your moment to come Betsema 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.110
 I can see also a 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.940
 time to crack why I also think so 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:21.940
 becoming a power auto battle 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.930
 oh this fucken the record I only 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.700
 20 fps 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.610
 oh my god 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.980
 the god car we want to find those people 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.540
 true brand 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.880
 what is so you can do car 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.070
 battle and you can play the games 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.050
 nothing special yes you can be a relative 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.880
 and what abilities do I have 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.170
 to belle vie and eat blitz 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.010
 now we are going to bring blitz men to life 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.600
 drains yeah, well, boys 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.580
 this game is just not worth the money 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.290
 certainly that dent is only 13 euro mind of it 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.360
 not worth the 13 euros 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.620
 so guys sorry for my run sorry 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.140
