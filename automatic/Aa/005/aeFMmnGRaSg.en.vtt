of<00:01:38.789> gas<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.179> here<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.569> it's<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.140> light<00:01:41.750> anyways

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
of gas in here so it's not light anyways

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.160 
of gas in here so it's not light anyways
easiest<00:01:43.679> way<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:47.509> leave<00:01:48.509> those<00:01:48.720> two<00:01:48.959> things

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
easiest way is to leave those two things

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.850 
easiest way is to leave those two things
hooked<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.679> I<00:01:49.979> took<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.880> off<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.329> realized

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
hooked up I took one off then realized

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.249 
hooked up I took one off then realized
you<00:01:52.860> leave<00:01:53.009> those<00:01:53.130> hooked<00:01:53.429> up<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.259> you

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you leave those hooked up and you

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.609 
you leave those hooked up and you
disconnect<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.630> holders<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:58.049> are<00:01:58.110> holding

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
