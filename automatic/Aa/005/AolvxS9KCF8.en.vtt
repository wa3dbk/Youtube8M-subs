00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
personal physique from here if we have

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.250 
personal physique from here if we have
to<00:01:22.680> move<00:01:22.980> if<00:01:23.340> he<00:01:23.820> comes<00:01:24.000> forward<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:25.080> take<00:01:25.230> a

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
to move if he comes forward I can take a

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.930 
to move if he comes forward I can take a
step<00:01:25.500> back<00:01:26.240> alright<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:28.860> move<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.760> one

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
step back alright if you move to one

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.000 
step back alright if you move to one
side<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.570> example<00:01:31.350> if<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.560> were<00:01:31.620> to<00:01:31.710> move<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
side for example if you were to move to

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.570 
side for example if you were to move to
his<00:01:32.130> left<00:01:32.160> I<00:01:32.580> could<00:01:33.000> move<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.720> my<00:01:33.870> left<00:01:34.580> and

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
his left I could move to my left and

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.490 
his left I could move to my left and
still<00:01:36.360> maintain<00:01:36.810> what<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.230> call<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
still maintain what we call a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.950 
still maintain what we call a
reactionary<00:01:38.220> gap<00:01:38.550> that<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.510> essentially<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
reactionary gap that is essentially the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.450 
reactionary gap that is essentially the
distance<00:01:40.470> that's<00:01:40.590> going<00:01:40.830> to<00:01:40.890> allow<00:01:41.010> me<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
distance that's going to allow me to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.600 
distance that's going to allow me to
react<00:01:42.230> to<00:01:43.230> anything<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:44.010> he<00:01:44.130> tries<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.370> do

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
towards me from here we're going to talk

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.180 
towards me from here we're going to talk
about<00:01:47.130> basic<00:01:48.120> striking<00:01:48.180> techniques<00:01:49.070> from<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
about basic striking techniques from the

because it's a possibility they'll

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.630 
because it's a possibility they'll
shatter<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:37.270> want<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.870> use<00:02:38.020> a<00:02:38.260> soft<00:02:38.710> weapon<00:02:39.220> like

to base my palm or the hammer of my fist

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.050 
to base my palm or the hammer of my fist
okay

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
okay

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.420 
okay
so<00:02:43.510> if<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.720> have<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:44.170> I<00:02:44.380> can<00:02:44.740> strike<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.190> this

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
so if I have to I can strike like this

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.390 
so if I have to I can strike like this
or<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.210> can<00:02:46.240> strike<00:02:46.600> down<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.620> want<00:02:48.340> to

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.430 
or I can strike down like this I want to
use<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.520> hard<00:02:48.730> weapon<00:02:49.150> versus<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.780> softer<00:02:50.230> target

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
use a hard weapon versus a softer target

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.260 
use a hard weapon versus a softer target
which<00:02:51.160> will<00:02:51.310> increase<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.610> amount<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.060> impact

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
which will increase the amount of impact

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.140 
which will increase the amount of impact
I<00:02:52.870> can<00:02:53.170> deliver<00:02:53.350> my<00:02:53.590> subject<00:02:54.070> so<00:02:54.700> for<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.910> hard

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
I can deliver my subject so for a hard

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.390 
I can deliver my subject so for a hard
weapon<00:02:55.510> for<00:02:55.780> instance<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.170> knuckles<00:02:56.560> or<00:02:56.770> the

elbow

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.760 
elbow
I'd<00:02:57.970> be<00:02:58.420> looking<00:02:58.690> more<00:02:58.900> towards<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.590> center

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
I'd be looking more towards the center

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.220 
I'd be looking more towards the center
of<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.950> body<00:03:00.160> or<00:03:00.760> towards<00:03:01.090> his<00:03:01.240> arms<00:03:01.570> as<00:03:01.720> a

striking<00:03:02.830> technique<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.370> could<00:03:04.000> hit<00:03:04.120> the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
striking technique I could hit the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.650 
striking technique I could hit the
center<00:03:04.930> of<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.050> chest<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.340> abdomen<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:07.120> can

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
center of the chest to the abdomen I can

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.870 
center of the chest to the abdomen I can
strike<00:03:07.870> across<00:03:11.190> for<00:03:12.190> his<00:03:12.310> arms<00:03:12.580> if<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:12.760> were

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
strike across for his arms if you were

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.640

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
to try and strike and that would

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.520 
to try and strike and that would

out here so somehow I've got to close
the<00:03:41.230> distance<00:03:41.700> if<00:03:42.700> he<00:03:43.000> charges<00:03:43.270> me<00:03:43.590> then<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.680> can
