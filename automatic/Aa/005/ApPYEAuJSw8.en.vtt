00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
basketball team since I've been here my

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.340 
basketball team since I've been here my
favorite<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.460> at<00:00:59.460> Ohio<00:00:59.820> State<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.930> was<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
favorite one was at Ohio State it was a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.160 
favorite one was at Ohio State it was a
it<00:01:01.800> was<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> tip<00:01:02.219> dunk<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.149> first<00:01:03.449> half<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
it was a tip dunk in the first half and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.109 
it was a tip dunk in the first half and
I<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.430> big<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.790> me<00:01:05.909> just

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
I think that one was so big for me just

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.750 
I think that one was so big for me just
because<00:01:06.270> I'm<00:01:06.570> from<00:01:06.840> Ohio<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.500> they<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.920> little

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
because I'm from Ohio and they a little

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.160 
because I'm from Ohio and they a little
chip<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.030> my<00:01:09.150> shoulder<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.689> game<00:01:09.840> cuz<00:01:10.049> they
