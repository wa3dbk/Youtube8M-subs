conspiracy<00:01:49.439> theory<00:01:49.740> points<00:01:50.159> now<00:01:50.729> which<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
conspiracy theory points now which you

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.999 
conspiracy theory points now which you
can<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.630> which<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.810> definitely<00:01:52.290> possible<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
can do which is definitely possible and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.789 
can do which is definitely possible and
and<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.329> rather<00:01:54.540> easy<00:01:54.840> because<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
and is rather easy because the the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.859 
and is rather easy because the the
evidences<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.360> Sandy<00:01:57.659> Hook<00:01:57.689> conspiracy

is<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.250> very<00:01:59.430> definition<00:01:59.700> of<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.210> stretch

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
is just the very definition of a stretch

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
is just the very definition of a stretch
circumstantial<00:02:01.619> evidentiary<00:02:02.399> point<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.210> not

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
circumstantial evidentiary point and not

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.469 
circumstantial evidentiary point and not
really<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.409> oh<00:02:04.969> you<00:02:05.969> know<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.240> the
