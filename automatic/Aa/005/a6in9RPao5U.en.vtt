that were the first leaves and stems to
start<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:13.260> become<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.799> older<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
start have become a little older a

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.850 
start have become a little older a
little<00:01:14.250> more<00:01:14.880> rank<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.350> deer<00:01:16.530> tend<00:01:16.770> to

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
little more rank and so the deer tend to

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.679 
little more rank and so the deer tend to
avoid<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.850> they're<00:01:18.060> keeping<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> plant

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
avoid them but they're keeping the plant

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.789 
avoid them but they're keeping the plant
alive<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.200> they're<00:01:19.470> conducting

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
alive there they're conducting

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.830 
alive there they're conducting
photosynthesis<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.759> they're<00:01:21.360> keeping<00:01:21.720> this

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
photosynthesis and they're keeping this

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.830 
photosynthesis and they're keeping this
plant<00:01:22.140> viable<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.670> deer<00:01:23.850> eat<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.630> leaves

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
plant viable as the deer eat the leaves

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
plant viable as the deer eat the leaves
the<00:01:25.200> younger<00:01:25.530> leaves<00:01:25.740> from<00:01:25.950> inside<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.549> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the younger leaves from inside this this

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.510 
the younger leaves from inside this this
cage<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.659> older<00:01:27.930> leaves<00:01:28.049> those<00:01:28.829> leaves<00:01:29.100> regrow

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
cage of older leaves those leaves regrow

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
cage of older leaves those leaves regrow
so<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.030> constantly<00:01:30.420> regrowing<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.110> leaves

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
so it's constantly regrowing the leaves

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.080 
so it's constantly regrowing the leaves
that<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.890> deer<00:01:32.040> browsing<00:01:32.520> those<00:01:32.790> that's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
that the deer browsing those that's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.730 
that the deer browsing those that's
where<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> real<00:01:33.420> high<00:01:33.780> protein<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
where the real high protein is and the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
where the real high protein is and the
good<00:01:35.040> nutrients<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.000> more<00:01:36.150> succulent

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
good nutrients the more succulent

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.530 
good nutrients the more succulent
palatable<00:01:37.079> forage<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.970> plan<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
palatable forage is so this plan is a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050 
palatable forage is so this plan is a
220<00:01:40.350> day<00:01:40.439> maturation<00:01:41.100> plant<00:01:41.400> which<00:01:41.820> means

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
220 day maturation plant which means

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.460 
220 day maturation plant which means
you'll<00:01:42.210> never<00:01:42.450> see<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.689> go<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.899> seed<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.409> in

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
you'll never see it go to seed here in

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.289 
you'll never see it go to seed here in
the<00:01:43.530> United<00:01:43.799> States<00:01:43.860> I've<00:01:44.820> only<00:01:45.030> seen<00:01:45.210> that
