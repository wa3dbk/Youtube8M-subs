00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
yet it is is it super fast so I don't

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.759 
yet it is is it super fast so I don't
know<00:00:24.240> how<00:00:24.390> they've<00:00:24.570> done<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.839> technology's

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
come a long way but I'm really excited

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.210 
come a long way but I'm really excited
so<00:00:27.750> I'm<00:00:28.259> going<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.439> set<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.710> up<00:00:28.830> now<00:00:29.009> and<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
so I'm going to set it up now and the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.800 
so I'm going to set it up now and the
first<00:00:29.460> thing<00:00:29.669> I<00:00:29.789> normally<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.359> when<00:00:30.509> I<00:00:30.539> set<00:00:30.779> up

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
first thing I normally do when I set up

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.410 
first thing I normally do when I set up
a<00:00:30.990> bow<00:00:31.169> is<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.580> arrow<00:00:32.759> rest<00:00:33.090> all

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
a bow is get the the arrow rest all

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.420 
a bow is get the the arrow rest all
lined<00:00:33.720> out<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.260> normally<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.220> with<00:00:35.400> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
lined out and I normally do that with a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.750 
lined out and I normally do that with a
laser<00:00:36.740> so<00:00:37.740> I<00:00:37.770> get<00:00:38.010> everything<00:00:38.370> centered

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
laser so I get everything centered

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.540 
laser so I get everything centered
everything<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.630> square<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.740> then<00:00:41.310> I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
everything is square and then I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:01:16.050 
everything is square and then I
proceeded<00:00:42.150> to<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:43.140> paper<00:00:43.470> tuna

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.450 

you<00:01:16.330> know<00:01:16.420> when<00:01:16.540> I<00:01:16.570> said<00:01:16.870> a<00:01:16.900> drop<00:01:17.530> away<00:01:17.710> that's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
you know when I said a drop away that's

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.980 
you know when I said a drop away that's
where<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:18.700> like<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.180> set<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.420> where<00:01:19.750> it's<00:01:19.900> a

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
where I like to set it where it's a

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.500 
where I like to set it where it's a
little<00:01:20.170> bit<00:01:20.380> knock<00:01:20.770> hi<00:01:21.040> so<00:01:21.400> it<00:01:21.490> it's<00:01:21.970> lifting

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
little bit knock hi so it it's lifting

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.110 
little bit knock hi so it it's lifting
it<00:01:22.600> as<00:01:22.990> it's<00:01:23.170> going<00:01:23.380> however<00:01:24.190> if<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.700> if<00:01:25.000> you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
it as it's going however if you if you

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.080 
it as it's going however if you if you
like<00:01:25.300> to<00:01:25.420> set<00:01:25.600> it<00:01:25.750> a<00:01:25.810> little<00:01:26.050> bit<00:01:26.940> where<00:01:27.940> it's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
like to set it a little bit where it's

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.330 
like to set it a little bit where it's
parallel<00:01:28.510> now<00:01:29.229> I<00:01:29.260> just<00:01:29.320> move<00:01:29.680> my<00:01:29.710> knock<00:01:30.010> point

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
parallel now I just move my knock point

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.580 
parallel now I just move my knock point
so<00:01:30.520> now<00:01:30.700> it's<00:01:30.940> it's<00:01:31.780> right<00:01:32.080> in<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.260> middle<00:01:32.440> a

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
so now it's it's right in the middle a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.109 
so now it's it's right in the middle a
lot<00:01:32.710> of<00:01:32.860> guys<00:01:33.010> like<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.280> shoot<00:01:33.580> in<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:33.880> middle

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
lot of guys like to shoot in the middle

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:48.990 
lot of guys like to shoot in the middle
have<00:01:34.240> good<00:01:34.450> results<00:01:34.900> with<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.729> we<00:01:48.850> got

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
have good results with so we got

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.060 
have good results with so we got
everything<00:01:49.240> lined<00:01:49.540> out<00:01:49.840> in<00:01:50.350> fact<00:01:50.619> we<00:01:50.770> changed

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
everything lined out in fact we changed

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.800 
everything lined out in fact we changed
a<00:01:51.160> couple<00:01:51.190> rest<00:01:51.700> around<00:01:51.880> got<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.330> laser<00:01:52.630> on

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
a couple rest around got the laser on

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
target everything is the way that it

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.249 
target everything is the way that it
should<00:01:54.670> be<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.570> now<00:01:55.720> we're<00:01:55.869> going<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.050> shoot
