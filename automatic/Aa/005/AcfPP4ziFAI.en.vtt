 you you 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.310
 afraid of the democratic republic of

 congo the lions and so that will be over 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.739

 6 15 euros 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.850
 deserved victory deserved victory for 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.360
 cameroon we needed a victory 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.640
 for leopards to hope to go 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.960
 with serenity but I believe that the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.660
 cameroon did not steal his victory 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
 today we saw on the ground a 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.330
 Cameroonian team 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.790
 we have seen a team from time to time 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.460
 Congolese who tried by a few 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.050
 jolts but I did not feel a 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.570
 soul in this Congolese team 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.420
 an organization that could have sat down 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.229
 a certain superiority of the team 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.130
 Congolese national 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.430
 I think there is a lot of work 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.229
 for Florent coach ibenguÃ© there to 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.030
 very very good 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.579
 player there are very very good things 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.049
 we could see but it's not enough 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.369
 must there be a set and especially 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.259
 who is enthusiasm 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.289
 good I would just finish maybe 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.939
 insisting on a certain lethargy 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.429
 I have the impression that they're back 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.590
 Congolese back line tends to 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.720
 on it looks like the jump when the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.490
 the Cameroonians arrived he did not see them 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.509
 not progressed and he gets organized is 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.909
 not accordingly 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.530
 and although it is a shame for 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.179
 democratic republic of the congo for 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.310
 this first day of playoffs 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.380

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.150

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.430
 the 28 nations still in the running 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.350
 day after the disqualification of 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.160

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.530
