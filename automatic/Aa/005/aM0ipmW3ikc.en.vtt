00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
specifically at that pupil to see if it

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.880 
specifically at that pupil to see if it
constricts<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.909> how<00:01:18.509> well<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.930> does<00:01:19.140> then

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
constricts and how well it does then

when<00:01:20.100> you're<00:01:20.220> doing<00:01:20.549> consensual<00:01:21.180> you're

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
when you're doing consensual you're

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.030 
when you're doing consensual you're
going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.320> you're<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.830> look

those<00:01:25.619> two<00:01:25.680> pupils<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.490> constricting

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
those two pupils are constricting

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.840 
those two pupils are constricting
simultaneously<00:01:28.470> together<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.700> you're

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
simultaneously together so you're

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.039

looking at two things direct and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.069 
looking at two things direct and
consensual<00:01:31.759> then<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.210> order<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
consensual then in order to do that you

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.109 
consensual then in order to do that you
want<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> room<00:01:34.979> dim<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.939> want

want to have the room dim and you want
your<00:01:36.180> pin<00:01:36.360> light<00:01:36.710> then<00:01:37.710> you'll<00:01:38.040> want<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.460> look

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
your pin light then you'll want to look

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.149

you're going to look at those pupils see

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.800 
you're going to look at those pupils see
how<00:01:53.070> well<00:01:53.280> they're<00:01:53.369> fixating<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.180> object

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
how well they're fixating on the object

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.060 
how well they're fixating on the object
are<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.110> doing<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.530> together

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
are they doing it together

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.459 
are they doing it together
and<00:01:56.219> are<00:01:56.610> those<00:01:56.759> pupils<00:01:57.259> constricting<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and are those pupils constricting and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.580 
and are those pupils constricting and
has<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.920> object<00:01:59.040> moves<00:01:59.549> closer<00:02:00.079> then<00:02:01.079> after

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
has the object moves closer then after

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.810 
has the object moves closer then after
you<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:01.799> done<00:02:01.950> with<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.670> document

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you get done with that you can document

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.459 
you get done with that you can document
as<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.570> know<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.899> nursing<00:02:04.229> world<00:02:05.390> perrla

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
as we know in the nursing world perrla

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.040 
as we know in the nursing world perrla
which<00:02:07.469> means<00:02:07.799> pupils<00:02:08.550> equal<00:02:09.179> round<00:02:09.450> reactive

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
which means pupils equal round reactive

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.370 
which means pupils equal round reactive
to<00:02:10.800> light<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.900> accommodation<00:02:12.900> or

to light and accommodation or

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.460 
to light and accommodation or
knighting<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.580> let's<00:02:15.150> actually<00:02:15.480> see<00:02:16.260> this

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
knighting so let's actually see this

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.150 
knighting so let's actually see this
skill<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.180> use<00:02:18.410> okay<00:02:19.410> we're<00:02:19.650> going<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:19.800> use<00:02:19.890> our

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.200 
pin light and we are going to be looking
for<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> direct<00:02:22.890> response<00:02:23.340> which<00:02:24.180> means

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
for a direct response which means

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.990 
for a direct response which means
whenever<00:02:24.960> we<00:02:25.140> shine<00:02:25.530> light<00:02:25.980> into<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.940> eye

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
whenever we shine light into the eye

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.700 
whenever we shine light into the eye
were<00:02:27.240> shining<00:02:27.600> light<00:02:27.750> we're<00:02:28.110> looking<00:02:28.440> at<00:02:28.560> the

were shining light we're looking at the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.960 
were shining light we're looking at the
pupil<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.430> see<00:02:29.880> if<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.800> constricts<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.370> we're

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
pupil to see if it constricts and we're

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.580 
pupil to see if it constricts and we're
also<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.420> look<00:02:33.630> for<00:02:33.870> consensual

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
also going to look for consensual

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.400 
also going to look for consensual
response<00:02:35.460> when<00:02:36.240> we<00:02:36.270> shine<00:02:36.540> light<00:02:36.900> into<00:02:37.260> this

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
response when we shine light into this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.800

side<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:38.100> we're<00:02:38.430> seeing<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:39.120> pupil

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
side and we're seeing if this pupil

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.900 
side and we're seeing if this pupil
constricts<00:02:40.440> simultaneously<00:02:41.280> with<00:02:41.460> this<00:02:41.670> eye

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
constricts simultaneously with this eye

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.210 
constricts simultaneously with this eye
then<00:02:42.690> we're<00:02:42.900> going<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.080> look<00:02:43.290> at<00:02:43.530> accomodation

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
then we're going to look at accomodation

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.120 
then we're going to look at accomodation
response<00:02:44.880> whenever<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.930> patient<00:02:46.380> fixates

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130

themselves<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:47.940> an<00:02:48.180> object<00:02:48.720> far<00:02:48.990> away<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.560> we

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
themselves on an object far away and we

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.100 
themselves on an object far away and we
see<00:02:49.920> how<00:02:50.130> well<00:02:50.400> their<00:02:50.970> pupils<00:02:51.630> respond

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
see how well their pupils respond

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.720 
see how well their pupils respond
whenever<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.500> objects<00:02:52.800> move<00:02:52.980> closer<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.550> them

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
whenever the objects move closer to them

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.080 
we're going to look in this opposite eye
whenever<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.680> shine<00:03:43.950> light<00:03:44.160> into<00:03:44.190> this<00:03:44.610> eye<00:03:44.820> and

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
whenever I shine light into this eye and

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.470 
whenever I shine light into this eye and
see<00:03:45.420> how<00:03:45.750> this<00:03:46.050> pupil<00:03:46.430> responds<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:47.970> let's<00:03:48.209> do

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
see how this pupil responds so let's do

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.910 
see how this pupil responds so let's do
that<00:03:51.590> his<00:03:52.590> pupil<00:03:54.080> responds<00:03:55.080> just<00:03:55.110> like<00:03:55.620> the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
that his pupil responds just like the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.680 
that his pupil responds just like the
direct<00:03:56.280> response<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:57.090> constricts<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:59.570> it

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.480 

dilates<00:04:03.690> back<00:04:04.110> normally<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.070> you<00:04:05.220> want<00:04:05.400> to

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
dilates back normally and you want to

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.240 
dilates back normally and you want to
shine<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.060> both<00:04:06.450> eyes<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:07.709> back<00:04:08.040> and

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
shine it in both eyes just back and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.490 
shine it in both eyes just back and
forth<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:09.150> can<00:04:09.300> also<00:04:09.510> do<00:04:09.840> what's<00:04:10.050> called<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
forth you can also do what's called the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.949 
forth you can also do what's called the
flash<00:04:10.830> I<00:04:11.190> mean<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.610> swinging<00:04:12.209> test<00:04:12.510> with<00:04:12.750> this

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
flash I mean the swinging test with this

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.650 
flash I mean the swinging test with this
and<00:04:13.290> what<00:04:13.890> you<00:04:14.010> do<00:04:14.190> is<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:14.550> swing<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.209> lie<00:04:15.360> in

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
and what you do is you swing the lie in

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.630 
and what you do is you swing the lie in
between<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.260> two<00:04:16.470> eyes<00:04:16.680> every<00:04:17.310> 2<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.520> 3

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
between the two eyes every 2 to 3

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.320 
between the two eyes every 2 to 3
seconds<00:04:18.270> like<00:04:18.480> this

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.320 

and<00:04:23.650> you're<00:04:24.650> just<00:04:24.800> watching<00:04:25.010> for<00:04:25.610> pupil

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
and you're just watching for pupil

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.360 
and you're just watching for pupil
response<00:04:26.840> you<00:04:27.620> get<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:27.890> same<00:04:28.220> reaction<00:04:30.370> now

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
response you get the same reaction now

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.940 
response you get the same reaction now
let's<00:04:31.760> look<00:04:32.030> at<00:04:32.270> accommodating<00:04:33.170> response<00:04:33.620> and

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
let's look at accommodating response and

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.160 
let's look at accommodating response and
what<00:04:34.460> we're<00:04:34.580> going<00:04:34.700> to<00:04:34.730> have<00:04:34.970> him<00:04:35.420> do<00:04:35.660> is<00:04:35.990> we're

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
what we're going to have him do is we're

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.590 
what we're going to have him do is we're
going<00:04:36.290> to<00:04:36.350> hold<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.650> object<00:04:37.190> about<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:38.090> couple

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
going to hold the object about a couple

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.780 
going to hold the object about a couple
feet<00:04:38.780> away<00:04:38.810> from<00:04:39.290> his<00:04:39.440> face<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:40.100> I'm<00:04:40.580> going<00:04:40.700> to

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
feet away from his face and I'm going to

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.290 
feet away from his face and I'm going to
bring<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.090> in<00:04:41.240> slowly<00:04:42.490> close<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.760> his<00:04:43.910> nose<00:04:44.120> and

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
bring it in slowly close to his nose and

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.270 
bring it in slowly close to his nose and
have<00:04:44.420> him<00:04:44.630> fixate<00:04:45.050> on<00:04:45.170> the<00:04:45.260> object<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.160> we're

will document is that it's perrla which
means<00:05:03.350> pupils<00:05:04.220> are<00:05:04.370> equal<00:05:04.640> round<00:05:04.880> reactive<00:05:05.390> to

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
means pupils are equal round reactive to

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.240 
means pupils are equal round reactive to
light<00:05:06.140> and<00:05:06.560> has<00:05:07.630> accomodation<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.860> that<00:05:10.100> is
