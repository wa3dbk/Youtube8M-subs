of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.350> other<00:00:34.500> gaming<00:00:34.739> communities<00:00:35.190> have

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
of the other gaming communities have

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.020 
of the other gaming communities have
this<00:00:35.610> word<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> top-five<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.370> series<00:00:38.370> but

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
this word of a top-five a series but

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.030 
this word of a top-five a series but
motion<00:00:39.809> occurs<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.170> heroin<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.710> figured

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
motion occurs in heroin so I figured

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.889 
motion occurs in heroin so I figured
that<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> would<00:00:41.250> start<00:00:41.610> with<00:00:41.719> here<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.809> my

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
that I would start with here on my

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
that I would start with here on my
channel<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.350> hopefully<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:44.910> some

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120

problem<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.390> would<00:01:30.479> require<00:01:30.600> clips

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290

problem is that it would require clips
I'll<00:01:31.829> try<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.340> many<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.729> my<00:01:32.909> own<00:01:33.119> in

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
there so that I can I don't get too many

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.510 
there so that I can I don't get too many
clips<00:01:35.970> we<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.299> something<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:36.930> but

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
clips we have something in there but

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.560 
clips we have something in there but
hopefully<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> would<00:01:38.759> love<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> be<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.299> all

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
hopefully I would love it to be just all
