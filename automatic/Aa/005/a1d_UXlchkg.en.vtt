00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
invested in solar and we talked to them

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.020 
invested in solar and we talked to them
and<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.830> we<00:02:17.950> looked<00:02:18.160> at<00:02:18.250> those<00:02:18.340> numbers<00:02:18.790> and

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.180 
them are good all of this came about out
of<00:02:45.610> NASA<00:02:46.060> when<00:02:46.810> our<00:02:46.960> astronauts<00:02:47.530> stayed<00:02:47.890> up<00:02:48.070> in

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
of NASA when our astronauts stayed up in

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.570 
of NASA when our astronauts stayed up in
space<00:02:48.520> so<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.690> there's<00:02:50.530> not<00:02:50.830> many<00:02:51.220> many

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
space so the there's not many many

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.490 
space so the there's not many many
negatives<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:52.510> if<00:02:52.960> you'd<00:02:53.080> like<00:02:53.260> more

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
information on solar energy or the many

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.600 
information on solar energy or the many
government<00:02:56.110> programs<00:02:56.140> made<00:02:56.980> available<00:02:57.100> to
