 Bun for this to take it all into account 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.270
 get comfortable with the concept of recruit and recruiter 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.159
 recruit is the player who is 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.310
 just a novice who did not play the world 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.659
 of tanks either did not play and was inactive in 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.429
 for 60 days 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.299
 recruiter is the player who 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:29.149
 invited the player directly to the novice 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.030
 either he returned the man who 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:35.479
 60 days did not play Sanji directly 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.219
 recruiter must have more than 100 battles and 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.520
 just have an active fight 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.829
 at least one in these last 60 days 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.929
 after technically in your personal 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.020
 office close to phone 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.359
 agree that this man is mine 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.249
 recruiter accordingly you start 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.799
 getting buns first of all you 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:58.099
 get buns experiences in the first 24 hours 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.859
 in on you two if you win in platoon 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:03.709
 if you win and are in the top 10 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.619
 by experience on both of you falls yet 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.740
 additionally x3 experience further passes 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.990
 first 24 hours these x3 to the next 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.140
 week turn into x2 that is 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.950
 considering the star we still have 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.380
 total x4 passed the first day x3 then 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.650
 weeks x2 then you turn on 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.680
 modifier and a half then 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.620
 there was a star just x2 there is still a half 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.519
 became x3 and so you still 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.310
 are getting 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.769
 I play in a platoon I remind bonuses to experience 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.530
 until your foundation of experience is 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.959
 will exceed 350000 further here is your 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.659
 modifier as it disappears bonuses 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.810
 by experience ends here but 350 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:50.530
 thousand friends is at least a tank 6 7 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.920
 the level of which in general is not bad to that 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.900
 the moment you accumulate 350 thousand experience 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.940
 totally you get one more 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.700
 extra reward as soon as you 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.040
 translate 100,000 total experiences in this 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.930
 the fund itself you will get 1 million 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.840
 loans, respectively, maximum 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.930
 recruits can be invited 50 50 times 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.720
 skated with them for a hundred thousand in the platoon and 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.790
 got 50 million credits bought out 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.980
 all tanks you need besides 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.489
 this as soon as you overcome the bar 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.340
 300 thousand and you get yourself loader 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.519
 crew members what kind of tank is this 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.919
 everything refers it refers to tank t95 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.870
 2 tank that will be issued to include 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.819
 we are for the referral system it can not 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.739
 will in no way buy it will 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.260
 medium american tank of the eighth 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.409
 level guide on which you see me 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.989
 on the channel later on which 350 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.579
 thousands of experience in this foundation and losing 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.319
 modifier because here they are 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.620
 fall off know so the first step 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.760
 walked away and the second step you walked away 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.040
 keep playing with your friend and 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.280
 do n't give up and you say all respect go 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.739
 walk eat sawdust no you play with 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.840
 Comrade with my further here I do not remember 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.849
 How much experience have I turned off with my 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.909
 friends at one time when pumped 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.359
 I just can't say it was 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.000
 millions and tens of millions and so 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.060
 We continue receiving the charging us the same 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.789
 we need a full crew at all 1,500 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.070
 thousands we get a driver mechanic on 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.979
 700 thousand we get gunner 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.789
 on a million total experience we 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.930
 we get the commander and immediately in addition 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.289
 t95 and 2 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.990
 but it only gets recruiter 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.580
 the mole itself does not get because in fact he is 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.289
 at this very moment he becomes 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.229
 an experienced player he has a million 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.159
 experiences there may bring another of his 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.710
 comrade 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:46.089
 It is also important to note that if you are alone 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.569
 times already received 

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:51.610
 given tank t-95 2 you are his second time 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:54.039
 can not get well and have 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.559
 alternative way to get this 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.469
 tank if your rector is basically in 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:05:01.869
 away from you continues to play and 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:04.149
 fills himself with a certain amount 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:07.270
 experience on the party top ten as soon as 

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:09.819
 he buys a tank of level 10 from you 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.319
 This unit appears like a 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.569
 recruiter in the hangar 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.969
 but without a crew, which, in general, too 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:18.459
 not bad because it's a straight machine if 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.520
 you have a crew already you can him 

00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:25.379
 transplant and all bonuses in addition to the bonus 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.610
 besides yes besides it except besides the bonus 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:30.069
 credits you will receive that is 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.129
 experienced crew and also 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:35.559
 and a half modifier to experience simple 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.689
 but if it happens like that you don't 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:39.759
 throw your friend and you along with 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:42.309
 pump him for this total 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:45.490
 million and here's the general fund you have left 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:46.990
 you continue to receive bonuses for the game 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.629
 with his recruit 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.789
 and he also gets these same bonuses 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.039
 accordingly but he himself can 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.229
 already become an adult get yourself this 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.999
 tank and all the buns that are to him 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.449
 such a system is due 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:03.580
 bring a friend from the century. if you 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.069
 like this description if you like it 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.819
 revealed the essence directly 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:08.680
 systems 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.749
 put like under the video write to 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.939
 comments that you did not understand me 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:14.709
