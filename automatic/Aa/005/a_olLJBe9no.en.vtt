00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.419
 misses the notes hanging at the entrance of the circular walks Doom Metal it is 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:08.710
 One of several coaches around Altenbeken became cyclists on the way 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.319
 could have been 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:14.129
 All searches in the hilly forests around Altenbeken were so far 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.759
 unsuccessful 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.519
 but Christa and Norbert Lagers do not want to accept it 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.279
 Like many other friends of the cycling club today, the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.779
 Looking for other solutions 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.789
 we have not given up hope yet to find him 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.750
 surely we will not find him life anymore, we know that very well 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:35.460
 but we want to know 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.470
 makes us so with what many tours have made together 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.830
 and yet 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.180
 your worries 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.970
 Percent and we want him to be found that certainty 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.520
 to have 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.860
 what happened to him 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.880
 This morning they set off on foot 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.590
 For days, they have been looking for and mouse every group where they feel best 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.300
 knows 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.490
 within a radius of 35 kilometers, the police suspect the missing one 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.620
 Bikers at home will find their mountain bike of bicycle helmets 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.780
 sportswear 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.400
 With that he is driving less long distance but short training laps 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 his friends probably through rough terrain 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.820
 and Boonen way Sames terrain there is a lot of colorful Altenbeken looking for 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.820
 the pin in a haystack also for the police 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.610
 since last wednesday you should only sunbathe 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.620
 her various measures taken from the so can with one 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.740
 Helicopter over the mobile phone location and of course all the measures in his 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.710
 immediate private environment 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.400
 on all trails hang the search ads there were several 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.200
 Hints 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.840
 but for now all in vain 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.360
 we've got about ten twelve clues from the population 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.210
 and they are all finished so far 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.310
 um and we have to see if new clues come in now 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.880
 Brad put her at the moment 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.310
 yes, frankly, the hope is sitting 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.979
 he would have to be safe somewhere then again 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.840
 shows up 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.340
 where if we think of the most likely variant of an accident 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.600
 Of course his chances are very bad now after one week 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.800
 Christa and Norbert Lagers know that, too 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.049
 We hope that he also soon found the with her team 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.489
 by chance or whatever 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.980
 In any case, we will probably not know the next few days 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.489
 do not look any further 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.410
 This morning they had no success to the hour they are looking at 60-70 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.840
 People continue by bicycle 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.470
 at least until it gets dark
