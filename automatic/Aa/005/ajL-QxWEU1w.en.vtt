00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
only but I was really struggling because

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.459 
only but I was really struggling because
I<00:00:47.969> was<00:00:48.149> trying<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> play<00:00:48.480> sector<00:00:48.870> control<00:00:49.200> and

I was trying to play sector control and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.740 
I was trying to play sector control and
it's<00:00:49.980> hard<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> take<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> base<00:00:50.850> when<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.510> can't

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
it's hard to take a base when you can't

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.439 
it's hard to take a base when you can't
shoot<00:00:52.020> your<00:00:52.199> gun<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.770> mean<00:00:53.460> trying<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.420> a

shoot your gun I mean trying to be a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.750 
shoot your gun I mean trying to be a
hundred<00:00:54.660> percent<00:00:54.780> pure<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.280> one<00:00:56.399> thing<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.610> had

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
hundred percent pure and one thing I had

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.889 
hundred percent pure and one thing I had
to<00:00:56.789> say<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.899> want<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> knife<00:00:58.320> only<00:00:59.510> the<00:01:00.510> best

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
to say if you want a knife only the best

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.180 
to say if you want a knife only the best
class<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.500> definitely<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
class is definitely going to be a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.490 
class is definitely going to be a
rifleman<00:01:02.730> class<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.870> only<00:01:03.960> reason<00:01:04.080> why

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
rifleman class and the only reason why

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
rifleman class and the only reason why
is<00:01:04.530> because<00:01:04.739> he<00:01:05.220> has<00:01:05.400> smoke<00:01:05.760> grenades<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
is because he has smoke grenades and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.830 
is because he has smoke grenades and
some<00:01:08.520> people<00:01:08.820> might<00:01:08.939> look<00:01:09.150> down<00:01:09.330> upon<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
some people might look down upon that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
some people might look down upon that
because<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> hundred<00:01:11.070> sent<00:01:11.280> knife

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
because if you're a hundred sent knife

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.219 
because if you're a hundred sent knife
purists<00:01:12.270> you're<00:01:12.390> not<00:01:12.540> gonna<00:01:12.659> throw<00:01:12.930> any

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
purists you're not gonna throw any

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.820 
purists you're not gonna throw any
grenades<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.950> anything<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.360> use<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.500> smoke

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
grenades or anything but I use the smoke

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.520 
grenades or anything but I use the smoke
as<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> very<00:01:18.270> smart<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.049> tactical

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
as a like a very smart and tactical

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.249

run around the map and pretty much
flanked<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.150> team<00:01:42.329> because<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.689> only<00:01:42.810> way

flanked in a team because the only way
to<00:01:43.020> knife<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:44.100> pretty<00:01:44.340> hard<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> actually

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
to knife it's pretty hard to actually

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.120 
to knife it's pretty hard to actually
you<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> one-on-one<00:01:46.829> situation

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you know get a one-on-one situation

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.010 
you know get a one-on-one situation
where<00:01:47.759> you're<00:01:47.850> gonna<00:01:47.970> sprint<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.689> each<00:01:48.810> other

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
where you're gonna sprint at each other

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.950 
where you're gonna sprint at each other
because<00:01:49.229> most<00:01:50.189> likely<00:01:50.630> they're<00:01:51.630> gonna<00:01:51.720> be

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
because most likely they're gonna be

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.859 
because most likely they're gonna be
shooting<00:01:52.290> at<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.270> hip<00:01:54.270> firing<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
shooting at you and hip firing in this

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.929 
shooting at you and hip firing in this
game<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.380> easy<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.920> they're<00:01:56.820> gonna

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
game is so easy that they're gonna

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.530 
game is so easy that they're gonna
mostly<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.439> lot<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.799> times<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
mostly get you in a lot of times and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.910 
mostly get you in a lot of times and
I've<00:02:00.540> learned<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.409> know<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.590> pretty<00:02:01.799> much

I've learned you know you pretty much

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.679 
I've learned you know you pretty much

have to flank them you have to get them
with<00:02:03.899> their<00:02:04.020> backs<00:02:04.259> turned<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:05.130> not<00:02:05.670> you're

teammate

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
teammate

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.280 
teammate
and<00:02:14.220> knife<00:02:14.700> him<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> back<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.630> can

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and knife him in the back and you can

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.960 
and knife him in the back and you can
see<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.650> didn't<00:02:16.920> actually<00:02:17.040> use<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.820> knife

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
see that I didn't actually use the knife

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.160 
see that I didn't actually use the knife
until<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.270> was<00:02:18.360> right<00:02:18.540> behind<00:02:18.690> him<00:02:18.960> because

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
until I was right behind him because

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.740 
until I was right behind him because
it's<00:02:20.040> if<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.030> guys<00:02:21.150> didn't<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.510> there's

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
it's if you guys didn't know there's

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.630 
it's if you guys didn't know there's
actually<00:02:22.080> unlimited<00:02:22.590> spraying<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.220> game<00:02:23.430> so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
actually unlimited spraying this game so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.150 
actually unlimited spraying this game so
you<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.880> sprint<00:02:24.270> as<00:02:24.450> much<00:02:24.690> as<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.930> want<00:02:25.290> but

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
you can sprint as much as you want but

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.070 
you can sprint as much as you want but
it's<00:02:26.910> really<00:02:27.090> hard<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.450> catch<00:02:27.660> up<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> guys

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
it's really hard to catch up the guys

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.570 
it's really hard to catch up the guys
that<00:02:28.230> are<00:02:28.290> also<00:02:28.500> at<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.830> full<00:02:29.010> sprint<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.490> it

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
that are also at a full sprint so it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.760 
that are also at a full sprint so it
does<00:02:29.730> take<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:30.000> while<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.360> actually<00:02:30.560> get<00:02:31.560> used

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
does take a while to actually get used

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.220 
does take a while to actually get used
to<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.250> it's<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:33.270> whole<00:02:33.450> nother<00:02:33.570> playing<00:02:33.930> style

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
to and it's a whole nother playing style

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.680 
to and it's a whole nother playing style
to<00:02:34.290> actually<00:02:34.560> go<00:02:34.680> knife<00:02:34.890> only<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.760> actually

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
to actually go knife only so I actually

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.440 
to actually go knife only so I actually
had<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.960> lot<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.170> fun<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.440> felt<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:38.210> nobody<00:02:39.210> ever

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
had a lot of fun I felt like nobody ever

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.060 
had a lot of fun I felt like nobody ever
rushes<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:40.080> this<00:02:40.200> game<00:02:40.380> everybody<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:40.860> stays

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070

some lucky lobbies were not that many

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.000 
some lucky lobbies were not that many
people<00:02:44.250> were<00:02:44.550> sniping<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.530> every<00:02:46.530> situation

teammate actually kills that guy but

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.550 
teammate actually kills that guy but
then<00:02:50.640> here's<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.720> situation<00:02:51.900> where<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.290> could

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
then here's a situation where I could

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.890 
then here's a situation where I could
have<00:02:52.650> shot<00:02:52.770> this<00:02:52.950> guy<00:02:53.070> easily<00:02:53.670> but<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:54.090> end<00:02:54.750> up

time you uh see there's a one situation
i'm<00:03:08.790> pretty<00:03:09.030> sure<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.270> guy<00:03:09.300> was<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.570> sniper<00:03:09.900> so

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
i'm pretty sure that guy was a sniper so

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.990 
i'm pretty sure that guy was a sniper so
i<00:03:10.260> feel<00:03:10.500> comfortable<00:03:10.980> actually<00:03:11.130> running<00:03:11.700> full

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
i feel comfortable actually running full

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.460 
i feel comfortable actually running full
sprint<00:03:12.300> I<00:03:12.360> am<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.750> don't<00:03:12.930> think<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.200> can<00:03:13.320> get

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
sprint I am I don't think you can get

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.120 
sprint I am I don't think you can get
his<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.620> sniper<00:03:14.070> scope<00:03:14.370> up<00:03:14.520> quick<00:03:14.760> enough<00:03:14.930> but

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
his a sniper scope up quick enough but

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
settings on the default and I think I

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.979 
settings on the default and I think I
want<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.459> say<00:03:32.580> like<00:03:32.940> seventy<00:03:33.510> percent<00:03:33.630> of<00:03:33.870> the

majority<00:03:34.260> will<00:03:34.560> do<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.920> because<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:36.030> know

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
majority will do that because you know

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.370 
majority will do that because you know
though<00:03:36.270> this<00:03:36.390> feel<00:03:36.570> like<00:03:36.660> okay<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:37.050> is<00:03:37.110> what

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
though this feel like okay this is what

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.690 
though this feel like okay this is what
that<00:03:37.560> button<00:03:37.770> does<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:38.160> shoot<00:03:38.400> with<00:03:38.550> this

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
that button does I shoot with this

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.850 
that button does I shoot with this
button<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.420> throw<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.110> grenade<00:03:40.200> with<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:40.620> fun

button I throw a grenade with this fun

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.940 
button I throw a grenade with this fun
and<00:03:41.480> usually<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.690> would<00:03:42.840> have<00:03:43.050> my<00:03:43.200> setup<00:03:43.560> set<00:03:43.800> to

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
and usually I would have my setup set to

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.010 
and usually I would have my setup set to
tactical<00:03:44.489> where<00:03:44.670> my<00:03:44.820> knife<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.360> Mike<00:03:45.690> router

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
tactical where my knife and Mike router

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.620 
tactical where my knife and Mike router
are<00:03:46.320> switched<00:03:46.620> but<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.640> actually<00:03:47.790> changed<00:03:48.480> that

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
are switched but I actually changed that

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.600 
are switched but I actually changed that
so<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:48.989> my<00:03:49.170> knife<00:03:49.380> was<00:03:49.620> default<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:50.370> if<00:03:50.520> I

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
so that my knife was default so if I

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.310 
so that my knife was default so if I
ever<00:03:50.760> had<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.060> panic<00:03:51.450> situation<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:52.020> could<00:03:52.170> just

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
ever had a panic situation I could just

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.449 
ever had a panic situation I could just
tap<00:03:52.530> my<00:03:53.340> right<00:03:54.330> click<00:03:54.630> right<00:03:55.170> stick<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.709> it

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
tap my right click right stick and it

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.090 
tap my right click right stick and it
would<00:03:56.670> automatically<00:03:57.470> pretty<00:03:58.470> much<00:03:58.590> no<00:03:58.800> panic

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
would automatically pretty much no panic

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.140 
would automatically pretty much no panic
knife<00:03:59.250> there<00:03:59.459> but<00:03:59.610> I<00:03:59.640> doesn't<00:03:59.820> really<00:03:59.970> like

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150

you know panic knifing so first
recommendation<00:04:11.910> has<00:04:12.300> changed<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.980> other

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
just cuz I really don't think that half

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.480 
just cuz I really don't think that half
of<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.660> defensive<00:04:27.660> ones<00:04:27.930> do<00:04:28.230> much<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:29.310> see<00:04:29.460> I

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
of the defensive ones do much and see I

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.360 
of the defensive ones do much and see I

other<00:04:35.220> thing<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.520> have<00:04:35.670> to<00:04:35.700> say<00:04:35.790> if<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.030> want<00:04:36.270> a

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
other thing I have to say if you want a

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.010 
other thing I have to say if you want a
knife<00:04:36.480> only<00:04:36.660> is<00:04:37.970> make<00:04:38.970> sure<00:04:39.000> your<00:04:39.330> sensitivity

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
knife only is make sure your sensitivity

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.530 
knife only is make sure your sensitivity
is<00:04:40.140> higher<00:04:40.740> than<00:04:41.040> default<00:04:41.460> because<00:04:41.700> I've<00:04:42.480> had

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
is higher than default because I've had

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.390 
is higher than default because I've had
situations<00:04:42.900> where<00:04:43.320> people<00:04:43.440> were<00:04:43.860> shooting<00:04:44.100> at

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
situations where people were shooting at

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.390 
situations where people were shooting at
me<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:45.230> there<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.290> can<00:04:46.320> see<00:04:46.500> how<00:04:46.920> bad<00:04:47.190> their

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
me and there you can see how bad their

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.160 
me and there you can see how bad their
sensitivity<00:04:48.000> was<00:04:48.120> their<00:04:48.300> sensitivity<00:04:48.870> was<00:04:48.990> so

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
sensitivity was their sensitivity was so

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.650 
sensitivity was their sensitivity was so
slow<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.890> they<00:04:50.520> couldn't<00:04:50.820> even<00:04:50.880> turn<00:04:51.300> in

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
slow that they couldn't even turn in

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.080 
slow that they couldn't even turn in
time<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.680> my<00:04:53.040> sensitivity<00:04:53.490> was<00:04:53.790> pretty<00:04:54.000> much

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
time and my sensitivity was pretty much

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.340 
time and my sensitivity was pretty much
just<00:04:54.150> like<00:04:54.420> it<00:04:54.600> felt<00:04:54.810> like<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:55.050> had<00:04:55.200> my

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
just like it felt like I had my

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.710 
just like it felt like I had my
sensitivity<00:04:55.890> on<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.310> insanity<00:04:56.730> because<00:04:57.420> I<00:04:57.600> was

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
sensitivity on to insanity because I was

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.500 
sensitivity on to insanity because I was
just<00:04:57.810> whipping<00:04:57.990> around<00:04:58.230> corners<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.510> you

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
just whipping around corners and you
