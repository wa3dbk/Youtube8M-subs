00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.700 
can turn up the you can turn up only the
footsteps<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.689> or<00:02:00.840> turn<00:02:01.079> up<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.259> little

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
footsteps and or turn up that little

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.090

range<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.130> volume

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
range of volume

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.280 
range of volume
and<00:02:03.189> make<00:02:03.760> it<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:03.970> lot<00:02:04.240> easier<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.810> hear<00:02:04.960> people

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
and make it a lot easier to hear people

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.350 
and make it a lot easier to hear people
so<00:02:05.590> I'm<00:02:05.979> thinking<00:02:06.610> about<00:02:06.640> going<00:02:06.880> for<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.150> one

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
so I'm thinking about going for that one

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.969 
so I'm thinking about going for that one
it's<00:02:07.600> two<00:02:07.840> hundred<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.229> fifty<00:02:08.590> dollars<00:02:08.950> for

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
it's two hundred and fifty dollars for

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.970 
it's two hundred and fifty dollars for
the<00:02:09.190> heads<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.429> though<00:02:09.610> so<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:11.410> most<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.770> paid

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
the heads that though so the most I paid

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.059 
the heads that though so the most I paid
so<00:02:12.520> far<00:02:12.550> as<00:02:13.090> 200<00:02:13.420> for<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.110> x40<00:02:14.560> ones<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:15.010> I

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
so far as 200 for the x40 ones and I

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.170 
so far as 200 for the x40 ones and I
felt<00:02:15.310> like<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.550> probably<00:02:15.790> should<00:02:16.030> have<00:02:16.060> gone

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
felt like I probably should have gone

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.030 
felt like I probably should have gone
with<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.390> x31<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.380> hopefully<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:17.830> new

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
with the x31 so hopefully this new

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.559 
with the x31 so hopefully this new
headset<00:02:18.220> won't<00:02:18.640> let<00:02:18.850> me<00:02:18.940> down<00:02:19.060> when<00:02:19.209> I<00:02:19.330> finally

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
headset won't let me down when I finally

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.370 
headset won't let me down when I finally
do<00:02:19.900> get<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.930> was<00:02:22.930> kind<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.230> thinking

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
do get it but I was kind of thinking

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.260

first<00:05:16.410> or<00:05:16.740> second<00:05:17.100> place<00:05:17.190> so<00:05:18.000> that<00:05:18.090> just<00:05:18.270> shows

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
first or second place so that just shows

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.629

you<00:05:18.449> that<00:05:18.930> camping<00:05:19.919> is<00:05:20.039> not<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:20.370> best<00:05:20.520> thing

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
you that camping is not the best thing

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.070 
you that camping is not the best thing
to<00:05:20.700> do<00:05:20.910> in<00:05:21.030> free-for-all<00:05:21.450> it<00:05:21.630> might<00:05:21.780> give<00:05:21.960> you

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
to do in free-for-all it might give you

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.510 
to do in free-for-all it might give you
a<00:05:22.110> better<00:05:22.169> kill<00:05:22.560> death<00:05:22.800> ratio<00:05:22.889> if<00:05:23.370> you're

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
a better kill death ratio if you're

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.710 
a better kill death ratio if you're
playing<00:05:23.729> against<00:05:24.000> people<00:05:24.270> who<00:05:24.330> don't<00:05:24.570> know

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
playing against people who don't know

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.370

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
though it's a pretty easy to do that

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.129 
though it's a pretty easy to do that
yeah<00:05:37.650> you<00:05:38.160> saw<00:05:39.090> might<00:05:39.330> people<00:05:39.510> might<00:05:39.840> be<00:05:39.960> able
