this<00:00:28.500> solution<00:00:30.050> there's<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.140> big<00:00:31.320> discussion

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
this solution there's a big discussion

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.139 
this solution there's a big discussion
on<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> website<00:00:32.340> which<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.550> will<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> link

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
on the website which I will have a link

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.270 
on the website which I will have a link
on<00:00:33.480> my<00:00:33.660> blog<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:34.350> will<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.800> linked<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.160> this

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
on my blog that will be linked to this

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.590 
on my blog that will be linked to this
video<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:37.370> to<00:00:38.370> where<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.180> read<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> lot<00:00:39.480> of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
video on to where you can read a lot of

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.680 
video on to where you can read a lot of
that<00:00:39.690> stuff<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.170> will<00:00:40.440> say<00:00:41.210> not<00:00:42.210> only<00:00:42.390> does<00:00:42.660> it

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
that stuff I will say not only does it

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.260 
that stuff I will say not only does it
fix<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.649> cause<00:00:43.890> 2<00:00:44.160> but<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> also<00:00:44.820> increases

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
fix just cause 2 but it also increases

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.720 
fix just cause 2 but it also increases
overall<00:00:45.930> performance<00:00:47.090> by<00:00:48.260> forty<00:00:49.260> percent<00:00:49.730> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
overall performance by forty percent the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.439 
overall performance by forty percent the
computer<00:00:51.210> runs<00:00:52.430> one<00:00:53.430> hundred<00:00:53.820> percent<00:00:53.850> better

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
computer runs one hundred percent better

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.029 
computer runs one hundred percent better
I<00:00:54.840> mean<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.800> completely<00:00:56.360> ridiculous<00:00:57.360> so

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
I mean it's completely ridiculous so

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.709 
I mean it's completely ridiculous so
here's<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.190> FLL<00:00:59.460> xr2<00:01:00.000> we're<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.570> going<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
here's the FLL xr2 we're just going to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.200 
here's the FLL xr2 we're just going to
run<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:00.960> cause<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.160> from<00:01:02.850> steam

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
run just cause so you can see from steam

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.200 
run just cause so you can see from steam
that<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.899> does<00:01:04.080> work<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.790> after<00:01:05.970> doing

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
that it does work this is after doing

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
that it does work this is after doing
the<00:01:06.390> solution<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.170> I'm<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> post<00:01:07.799> with

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the solution that I'm going to post with

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
the solution that I'm going to post with
this<00:01:08.640> video<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> blog<00:01:10.049> post<00:01:10.320> that

I'm going to do with alongside the video
and<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.210> run<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.689> we're

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
and I'm just going to run it and we're

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.679 
and I'm just going to run it and we're
going<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> quick<00:01:16.350> benchmark<00:01:17.689> square

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
going to do a quick benchmark square

going to do a quick benchmark square
enix<00:01:19.520> which<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.640> could<00:01:20.790> skip<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> can

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
enix which I could skip this but you can

invidious<00:01:37.530> driver<00:01:37.860> updates<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.640> mean<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.119> way

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
invidious driver updates I mean the way

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
they need to incorporate those updates

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.480 
they need to incorporate those updates
but<00:01:51.090> they're<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.420> they're<00:01:51.780> taking<00:01:52.140> forever

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
but they're not they're taking forever

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
so i'm going to do a benchmark here

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.170 
so i'm going to do a benchmark here
gonna<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.180> desert<00:01:57.930> sunrise<00:01:58.189> let's<00:01:59.189> uh<00:01:59.430> awesome

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
gonna do desert sunrise let's uh awesome

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.120 
gonna do desert sunrise let's uh awesome
so<00:02:01.170> we're<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> wait<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> load

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
so we're going to wait for this to load

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.830 
so we're going to wait for this to load
and<00:02:02.310> you're<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.759> see<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and you're just going to see this is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.760 
and you're just going to see this is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
performance i'll even pull the plug out

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.440 
performance i'll even pull the plug out
so<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.550> what's<00:02:08.729> doing<00:02:08.879> on<00:02:09.060> battery

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
so you can see what's doing on battery

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.210 
so you can see what's doing on battery
here<00:02:09.660> ok<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.379> on<00:02:10.500> battery

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.650 

so<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:17.200> let's<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.440> know<00:02:17.500> drivers<00:02:18.370> are

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
so just let's you know drivers are

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.780 
so just let's you know drivers are
making<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.750> run<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.290> lot<00:02:21.040> smoother<00:02:21.550> than<00:02:21.730> it

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
making this run a lot smoother than it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.750 
making this run a lot smoother than it
was<00:02:22.060> running<00:02:22.480> on<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.870> dell<00:02:23.080> drivers<00:02:23.760> dell

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
was running on the dell drivers dell

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.870 
was running on the dell drivers dell
really<00:02:25.390> needs<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.660> pick<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.110> slack<00:02:26.230> I

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
really needs to pick up the slack I

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.190 
really needs to pick up the slack I
guess<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:27.940> started<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.300> say<00:02:28.420> before<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.780> called

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
guess I started to say before I called

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.020 
guess I started to say before I called
them<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.410> shoot<00:02:29.800> them<00:02:29.860> out<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.520> got<00:02:30.820> tech

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
them and shoot them out I got tech

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.520 
them and shoot them out I got tech
support<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.510> then<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.750> got<00:02:31.930> forwarded<00:02:32.350> to

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
support and then I got forwarded to

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.590 
support and then I got forwarded to
actually<00:02:33.010> an<00:02:33.100> engineer<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.760> junior<00:02:34.150> engineer

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
actually an engineer a junior engineer

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.840 
actually an engineer a junior engineer

at alienware who's responsible for the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
driver testing and hopefully we should

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.570 
driver testing and hopefully we should
see<00:02:39.580> some<00:02:39.610> driver<00:02:40.180> update<00:02:40.750> soon<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.740> might

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
see some driver update soon that might

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.180 
see some driver update soon that might
prevent<00:02:42.970> us<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.660> lien<00:02:44.290> where<00:02:44.470> users<00:02:44.920> from

prevent us a lien where users from

prevent us a lien where users from
having<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.640> deal<00:02:45.880> with<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:47.320> know<00:02:48.060> workarounds

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
having to deal with you know workarounds

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.620 
having to deal with you know workarounds
in<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.270> future<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:51.270> think<00:02:52.270> that's<00:02:52.420> pretty

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
in the future so I think that's pretty

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.910 
in the future so I think that's pretty
much<00:02:52.780> all<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.990> wanted<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.200> say<00:02:53.290> along<00:02:53.740> with<00:02:53.770> this

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
much all I wanted to say along with this

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.440 
much all I wanted to say along with this

this is not compatible and you're going

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.680 
this is not compatible and you're going

to continue anyway once you do that is

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.030 
to continue anyway once you do that is
going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.960> restart<00:03:44.080> again<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.710> you're<00:03:44.950> going

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
going to restart again and you're going

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.460 
going to restart again and you're going
to<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.820> updated<00:03:45.970> drivers<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.350> is

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
to have the updated drivers and this is

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.400 
to have the updated drivers and this is
going<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.740> work<00:03:48.000> i'm<00:03:49.000> going<00:03:49.210> to<00:03:49.270> show<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.510> one

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
going to work i'm going to show you one

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.860 
going to work i'm going to show you one
more<00:03:50.440> thing<00:03:50.620> before<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:51.160> in<00:03:51.310> this<00:03:51.490> video<00:03:51.790> so<00:03:52.660> let

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
more thing before I in this video so let

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.660 
more thing before I in this video so let
me<00:03:52.900> close<00:03:53.200> out<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.530> here

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.200 

alright

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.760 

this<00:04:01.810> one<00:04:02.050> let's<00:04:02.200> let<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.560> see<00:04:03.330> my<00:04:04.770> driver

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
this one let's let you see my driver

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.140 
this one let's let you see my driver
details<00:04:06.430> maybe<00:04:06.730> go<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:06.940> properties<00:04:07.270> and<00:04:09.150> I'm

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
details maybe go to properties and I'm

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.060 
details maybe go to properties and I'm
not<00:04:10.330> sure<00:04:10.480> if<00:04:10.570> you<00:04:10.630> can<00:04:10.750> see<00:04:10.810> how<00:04:11.080> blurry<00:04:11.830> this

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
not sure if you can see how blurry this

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.830 
not sure if you can see how blurry this
motherfucker<00:04:12.520> is<00:04:12.670> but<00:04:13.120> that<00:04:13.960> is<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.230> 7<00:04:14.890> /<00:04:15.250> 9<00:04:15.840> 2010

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
motherfucker is but that is a 7 / 9 2010

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.410
