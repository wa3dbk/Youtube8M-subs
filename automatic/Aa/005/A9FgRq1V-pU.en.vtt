00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
 I think that Andrei is pretty much anyone 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.360
 Today the mountain and can be 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.930
 the result 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.930
 only you are pretty 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.449
 although I have 0 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.449
 what does that fail ? 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:43.430
 it turned out better played a little cow 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:46.480
 At first, there were errors of advocates especially 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.680
 Ukraine were thrown on the gallery I 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.460
 a little bit 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.780
 the first minutes he got from the sword channel 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.950
 then the guys orienting themselves to 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:02.120
 Well done, well done thanks to them 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.190
 always say yes thank you dedication for 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.020
 selflessness came out 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:12.920
 fought back how could they played as said from 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:22.750
 the absence of Vasiliev and the channel is very very 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:27.830
 serious talking himself benches himself 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:32.240
 I was in the game themselves, so what's not heard 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:36.680
 practice i'm not like on financial matters 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.700
 Well, talk is different but not yet 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.810
 see nothing yet 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.490
 that is, in the same suspension condition there 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.330
 conversations encouraging while we are nothing 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.330
 yes nothing yet 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:13.410
 in general, it was too much but we tried 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.510
 adapt to this 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.970
 have to play through the solution 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.400
 naturally were artificially 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.190
 dedication 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.540
 super claims and who does not have principle 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.930
 how long could you lie 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:34.230
 there were still years a moment in which not 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.230
 implemented nadakhan in general say 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.160
 say that they lost glasses I think that everything 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.930
 the children were at a very high level 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.510
 like hunger the hosts training dirty 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.610
 dirty games including when was 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.200
 the first of our kind entered violation 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.769
 against mushroom picker 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.799
 I'm not talking about you now 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.959
 legality invisible moment and 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.030
 meter but very dirty games were 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.780
 omitted including in what national 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.970
 center breaking the attack and for it did not get 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.019
 the second mustard plaster is therefore here a lot 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.780
 many complaints 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.470
 but he did not show that at some point 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.079
 Here I think 1 cm3 played enough 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.850
 harmoniously interesting and after the downtrodden 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.090
 ball work team calmed down and 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.190
 some time a drawing got lost and 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.049
 the team may be due to the fact that not 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.910
 happened replacements never started their 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.810
 football 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.579
 the point is that the opponent sang about a finger 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.620
 we had to go very big 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.100
 by forces 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.190
 move back 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.910
 This is the one who lost the attacker's build. 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.760
 action moreover there the first house was 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.420
 large enough gap and the top 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.630
 attacking players could not take 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.230
 decision share the pressure of these i stood there 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.230
 long away 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:16.200
 contagion why do guys fight for more 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:22.310
 nothing all formalities in the organization 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.310
 discreetly guys old game emotions
