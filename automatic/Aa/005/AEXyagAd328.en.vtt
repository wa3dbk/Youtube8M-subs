00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.689
 friend 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:17.390
 welcome once again to my channel are 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.460
 erick and modern warfare 3 again that 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.160
 it's strange and you know that my channel is going 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.349
 directed to only modern warfare 3 not only 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.800
 but more to modern warfare 3 than other 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.900
 thing to be exact again in done 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.390
 but today we are in mourning for 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.170
 teams to snyder to sniper like 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.460
 they prefer to call it what I bring and today 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.610
 I bring a tremendous departure 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.440
 sniper in fact I thought about climbing 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.610
 a good sniper game and of 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.489
 serious fact a few games 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.110
 better than sniper better 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.059
 is that I think that everyone can 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.760
 get a better game than this one say 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.850
 that out but that very very negative 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.010
 you know that franco I do not use it just 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.110
 he used it on the playstation3 the truth 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.150
 he used it too much he used it 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.619
 more than now by the competitive 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.439
 and all these public good things 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.220
 like to go to sack to go with small arms or 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.140
 only the acr the only wta I use 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.030
 and sniper in modern warfare 3 lapse the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.409
 first you open cross that I am 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.580
 using the first time I'm 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.250
 using 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.920
 with handle in this case is the l11 that 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.020
 I get my ass and you'll see in this 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.910
 game I have another gameplay that I thought 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.610
 leave it in the background in terminal but for 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.560
 I'm a little more bored because 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.050
 there are a few campers killed more 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.270
 you have gameplay to say that that 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.090
 game place a poop in fact it's over 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.910
 this game and I thought hitting a leg 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.860
 from the xbox but it tells me eric controls t 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.450
 here is going to be the first scene 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.390
 so I wanted to put a leg of 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.520
 eric controls what I prefer to go to 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.140
 comment on this game that surely I 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.910
 will like and this gameplay that today I will 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.670
 talk about snipers here what 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.260
 you have seen I do not miss a predictor 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.800
 how eric opens his mouth that you 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.690
 you eat triple low and I did not get it 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.430
 kill that I understand some co 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.770
 incredible in the game I hope that you 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.750
 like me the truth that opened me 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.250
 too much not only for that you will already see 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.820
 many more things here 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.550
 that you just saw I have not scored almost 8 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.260
 meters or things like that and we're going to continue 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.990
 party and let's start putting it right that 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.330
 I commented before I started 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.150
 I wanted to put a little dot I did not want to put 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.860
 two little things you do not know I'm not a 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.390
 program with shooter that I dedicate to 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.709
 other things so comments 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.410
 directed to him and that you are a 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.030
 sniper jubilate well I do not care 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.630
 because his brother frank or inspiring 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.850
 not done and the other was that he wanted me 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.010
 I want you to think that many people do not 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.080
 upload more games to youtube because 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.030
 it's not very very seen no and in fact 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.300
 I also preferred to upload this game that 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.700
 I like more than the other heading 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.290
 that was in terminal that is that killed 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.700
 new but in for me it is very boring 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.430
 but I think it has a lot of action 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.070
 has something that many of October will 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.320
 always missing things always go up 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.030
 they raise good games and never raise their 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.010
 worst de facto games for me this is 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.570
 one of the worst sniper and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.040
 now we start with the topic that I wanted 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.000
 deal with today what was your best weapon 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.890
 they will be with a shooter which is your best 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.050
 modern warfare sniper 3 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.480
 activist attempts on a flat disk I am 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.220
 very bad I am very bad will allow to teach 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.390
 Well, I leave it in the comments do not 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.040
 that today's topic is the same 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.350
 sniper is your favorite which is the 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.390
 better first what is the best 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.950
 sniper that if you can leave me 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.770
 in the comments I would appreciate it 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.510
 I want to know if anyone is 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.100
 agree with this comment that I am 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.080
 seeing right now in 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.540
 screen and if you are not seeing it and only 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.500
 listening, I'm telling you, I'm telling you 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.960

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.670
 with a greeting and I asked for twitter 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.780
 I said today the subject I had deal with is the 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.730
 what are you seeing now and I 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.200
 responded a few people but 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:03.040
 the one I liked the most was about altÃ¡i with the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.320
 the answer was l 11 for pros msrc 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.840
 micros and barrett newbies others 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.360
 honestly mounted for me 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.709
 I agree I want to know your 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.930
 opinion I want to know what is your best 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.930
 sniper I do not know if you've seen 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.420
 a quiz copy that I do that I do jean-marc 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.859
 it was for nothing 5 centimeters are things 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.660
 So many Actually yes yes 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.370
 cabrio I do not know if you have seen it already 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.380
 although I was reading the comment of 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.800
 twitter and well I do not know if we will be 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.990
 agreement l 11 for pros msrc my prost and 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.760
 barrett for novices the truth that 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.040
 moderated parts in playstation3 yo 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.919
 I played more with the bar and it took me 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.260
 tremendous games with the bar for me 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.470
 the barrier we can throw three what 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.560
 is the best because because of the use and 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.350
 instead the 11th the msc also me 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.450
 like 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.020
 quite and killed quite a lot in my chest with 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:57.140
 a competitive one more be boring me the 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.990
 challenge is easy I have the msr in class 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.720
 personalized and I think for me the a 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.460
 barrett and the msr are the best 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.040
 game though the barrett in all 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.050
 call of duty games has been the best 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.360
 - blank external I think it was not 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.240
 he probably was not there or was not like that 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.010
 that I want to know that which is your best 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.950
 modern warfare sniper 3 which 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.870
 is your favorite and why if you think that the 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.270
 Comment that I tell you on twitter 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.870

 and for you what is the best weapon of 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.590
 modern sniper before a 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.060
 I say goodbye, remember to go to the 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.670

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.770

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.660
