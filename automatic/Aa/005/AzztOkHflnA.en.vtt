00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.150
 Welcome to another episode 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.280
 small kitchen big dreams in the middle of april 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.869
 we have meanwhile and with the result 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.640
 Here I will stop my videos 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.070
 by numbering so i think so 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.370
 have now video 79 or so 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.870
 turned and now I'm with too 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.160
 the numbers because somehow that is 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.570
 beknackt a video to turn then number 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.920
 to distribute and remember these numbers 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.660
 to have to hold because that ensures 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.289
 that I wait only two months 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.300
 can 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.289
 after I've shot a video until 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.960
 I publish it 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.210
 and the reason that I agree 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.359
 I decided that is now the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.399
 first asparagus in the store is asparagus 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.960
 is there I show you today like mine 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.249
 sauce hollandaise makes and wanted 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.629
 Finally, now know where the asparagus 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:55.649
 It's not just in two months 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.269
 if he is already gone, so yes 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.739
 those of you who are not from 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.079
 praise the current asparagus 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.969
 to be put off I fast at the front 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.390
 get heartbeat when I'm loading 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.280
 almost twelve euros for just under three quarters 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.850
 kilo asparagus should pay 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.689
 that's news price so 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.119
 growth conditions this year 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.460
 very optimally therefore little asparagus there 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.740
 or the demand, of course, how 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.810
 Of course, the price is big 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.520
 dressed accordingly but that one has 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.020
 then my wallet bad 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.479
 Well, what's the problem ? 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.109
 have nevertheless made fun so should 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.640
 This is very delicious by the way, so I 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.039
 I do not have to say it asparagus 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.719
 my wife is doing it and she meant why 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.579
 but this the so delicious you can 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.310
 Almost without asparagus 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.869
 So a pretty compliment and me 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.409
 I must also say that right now 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.479
 forgot to take a picture but 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.570
 I think with yours 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.670
 imagination quite united 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.920
 Once a picture to imagine where 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.880
 little asparagus and seeks to get over it 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.990
 this is you manage well then 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.649
 as we come to the ingredients directly 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.649
 a next episode 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.510
 So here's the look at the ingredients and 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.890
 As you can see, the whole thing is very simple 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.060
 you can do it alone 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.799
 realize that this time I'm peppering salt 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.439
 and sugar with what I've set up here 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.180
 I do not usually do that 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.379
 but with this recipe I thought doing 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.890
 I was even otherwise sees the 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.180
 says yes completely empty so salt 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.720
 I already have pepper sugar 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.269
 then mentions the most important the mother 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.889
 we need some lemon juice yolk 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.750
 three pieces 123 some white wine and in the 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:43.970
 school here a bit inconspicuous 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.769
 this is a brewed cube that is still 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.540
 something left over from 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.669
 Homemade brühl and we are here 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.500
 just a tablespoon of broth needs 

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.760
 This is down to the homemade 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.889
 it also tastes better in the end 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.599
 a bit better , that was good 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.690
 again the ingredients then it goes off in 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.730
 the kitchen 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.300
 arrived there we grab as 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.100
 First a pot that needs to be added later 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.800
 could be rebuilt in a water bath 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.959
 so i have a big pot here and 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.209
 according to this little area 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.690
 That's why I fit in very well 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.230
 me for this pot and that's what i have 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.070
 already packed on the one hand my 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.320
 tablespoon of brühl 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:29.770
 There you are in it a tablespoon of white wine 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.480
 and a tablespoon of load with lemon juice 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.400
 everything in here 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.270
 besides , could already 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.360
 joking 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:45.070
 those are on the one hand sugar comes one 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.070
 sprinkle some sugar with salt and pepper 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.440
 our 3 yolks of demir 1 broken 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:01.120
 but that is just broken 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.120
 make tunnel close again 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:09.370
 that comes to me all in and now 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:12.799
 beaten foamy with the snow 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.340
 and then back with you 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.320
 now continues and so does my 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.109
 mix it up here that's all 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.510
 become calm and I am in the today 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.760
 in the meantime, the water bath before 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.350
 with butter sauces, there is still one 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.630
 a little something to tell and indeed 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.790
 are not boiled and should the 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.440
 do not warm up too long or warm 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.190
 better said and not again 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.010
 heat up 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.790
 and that's why there is such a thing 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.260
 something to consider 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.270
 So we do not work directly in the pot 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.289
 but just in the water that has the 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.419
 advantage that we have the temperature 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.479
 control much more precisely 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.430
 and the mother should already be up 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.160
 but not melted either 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.870
 be hot this is also important that you can 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.910
 you as I did this in 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.460
 microwave make of the times when you 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.350
 But then please turn the wattzahl 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.860
 under a microwave provided 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.440
 supports our mikrowelt as 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.720
 high performance 900 watts I have you 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.770
 first placed on 300 and then 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.150
 just a few minutes 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.750
 really need until the butter has 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.180
 melted and the water bath that should 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.240
 be nice and warm, but also 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.150
 do not cook so here at the 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.190
 actually put it in and out already 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:30.979
 now comes the pot with the 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.349
 lemon juice white wine brühl mixture and 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.300
 the first animal a little something again 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:38.199
 that's going to get done soon 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:45.680
 until the time starts to stop 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:46.970
 after that ended so we will see that will be 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.729
 really nice click here 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:56.300
 times at the spot where the from the 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:58.069
 water bath out that comes that makes you 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.960
 Of course, please not if we are with the 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.539
 Ceranfeld works but this is one 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.370
 induction cooker that suits the lux and 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.380
 At this point, the butter comes now 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.830
 like I said I can not 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.750
 Hot should only be lukewarm 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.159
 coming here now down spoonfuls 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.409
 So I have a little here 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.900
 Ladle and now comes here 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.759
 spoonwise at the beginning a bit 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.279
 slower came to the end that may be 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:26.169
 faster the butter recognizes underneath 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:28.460
 mother beaten 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:33.099
 and if the spoon in it is beautiful 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.099
 but is still processed a bit 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.650
 then it goes on to the next one 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:42.860
 spoon and we stop so long 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.300
 until all the butter and at the place 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.129
 is then actually the sauce 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.639
 hollandaise already comes closer 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:53.479
 you do not go in and then you go 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:55.400
 That's why I'm going to save it 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:57.919
 video here also actually danone part 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.710
 Earn number because I still shot 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:03.349
 meanwhile has 80 parts I do not know 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.270
 which part is currently online 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:11.690
 So this video comes in between 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:13.970
 because he was just having fun then 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.190
 imitate what do you think as well as im 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.979
 basic and maybe a few words 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:23.960
 to read I once had a curry sauce 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:27.530
 made based on a kind of 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.310
 hollandaise they were a bit lower in fat 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.169
 I say 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.940
 that was much easier 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:33.650
 there was still strength in there 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.199
 and you could then also 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.340
 adapt with curry powder or something and that 

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.789
 you can of course also with the role 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.349
 So the make we like to have time 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:43.880
 play and if you do that then 

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:46.219
 He told me the best 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.190
 below in the comments or just as well 

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:52.449
 the corresponding facebook page then 

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.449
 I have it again
