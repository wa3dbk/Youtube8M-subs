the<00:00:27.630> controller<00:00:28.170> currently<00:00:29.099> works<00:00:29.460> they<00:00:29.760> said

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
the controller currently works they said

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.659 
the controller currently works they said
the<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> controller<00:00:31.410> itself<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.160> analog

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
the the controller itself the analog

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.600 
the the controller itself the analog
sticks<00:00:33.030> were<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.960> too<00:00:34.230> twitchy<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.890> so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
sticks were just too twitchy and so

with you um you know whenever I first
got<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> console<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.130> hadn't<00:01:11.640> been<00:01:11.790> playing

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
got the console I hadn't been playing

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.179 
got the console I hadn't been playing
the<00:01:12.299> 360<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> while<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> had<00:01:13.470> moved<00:01:13.799> over<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the 360 in a while I had moved over to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.520 
the 360 in a while I had moved over to
PC<00:01:14.610> primarily<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.049> had<00:01:16.229> been<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> while

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
PC primarily so it had been a while

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.679 
PC primarily so it had been a while
since<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.040> had<00:01:17.100> picked<00:01:17.490> up<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.759> controller<00:01:18.119> but

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
since I had picked up a controller but

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.710 
since I had picked up a controller but
I've<00:01:18.810> noticed<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.650> taking<00:01:20.220> me<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.759> bit

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
I've noticed that it's taking me a bit

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.140 
I've noticed that it's taking me a bit
longer<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.770> used<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.820> seems<00:01:24.060> like

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
longer to get used to this it seems like

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.149 
longer to get used to this it seems like
than<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.600> did<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.990> 360<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> just

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
than it did with a 360 like it just

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.760 
than it did with a 360 like it just
didn't<00:01:26.460> feel<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.909> accurate<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.720> me<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.619> was

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
didn't feel as accurate to me and I was

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.200 
didn't feel as accurate to me and I was
beginning<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.189> wonder<00:01:29.340> if<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.180> because

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
beginning to wonder if it's just because

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.420 
beginning to wonder if it's just because
I'm<00:01:30.509> getting<00:01:30.750> older<00:01:31.140> if<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.650> got<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.220> kind<00:01:32.310> of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
I'm getting older if I got some kind of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.910 
I'm getting older if I got some kind of
like<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:33.240> logical<00:01:33.780> disorder<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.740> something

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
like your logical disorder or something

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.950 
like your logical disorder or something
that's<00:01:35.159> causing<00:01:35.579> my<00:01:35.729> fingers<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> twitch<00:01:36.810> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
that's causing my fingers to twitch a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.560 
that's causing my fingers to twitch a
little<00:01:37.170> bit<00:01:37.290> more<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.070> anyway<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:38.880> hoping

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
little bit more so anyway I'm hoping

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.710 
little bit more so anyway I'm hoping
that<00:01:40.130> maybe<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.460> was<00:01:41.700> indeed<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.210> controller

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
that maybe it was indeed the controller

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.179 
that maybe it was indeed the controller
and<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.990> wasn't<00:01:43.409> me<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.860> didn't<00:01:44.100> see

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and it wasn't me because I didn't see

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.710 
and it wasn't me because I didn't see
him<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.490> lot<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.880> other<00:01:45.000> people<00:01:45.210> complaining

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
him a lot of other people complaining

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.359 
him a lot of other people complaining
about<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.649> didn't<00:01:46.890> want<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.100> bring<00:01:47.310> it

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
about it and I didn't want to bring it

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.460 
about it and I didn't want to bring it
up<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> said<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.420> hadn't<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.350> know

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
up because like I said I hadn't you know

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.870 
up because like I said I hadn't you know
playing<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> controller<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.549> while<00:01:50.700> so

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
playing with a controller in a while so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.359 
playing with a controller in a while so
I<00:01:50.970> didn't<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.270> if<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.450> was<00:01:51.540> me<00:01:51.750> or<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:52.079> but

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
I didn't know if it was me or what but

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.889 
I didn't know if it was me or what but
apparently<00:01:53.369> other<00:01:53.579> people<00:01:53.939> thought<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.720> it

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
apparently other people thought that it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.660 
apparently other people thought that it
wasn't<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.470> precise<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.159> could<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.340> as

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
wasn't as precise that it could be as

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.690 
wasn't as precise that it could be as
well<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.420> hopefully<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:58.409> will<00:01:58.649> improve<00:01:59.159> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
well so hopefully this will improve that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.520 
well so hopefully this will improve that
