00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.000
 even more 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.569
 in the dressing room backstage deals I 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.819
 I see a wardrobe little by little after 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.010
 wait for you to say the gift of 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:20.840
 the merits of the color orange we can not 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.569
 capture what you want to last two days 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.849
 nothing else or what thing she can 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.430
 if you know what the curse of color is 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.469
 orange they already told you and you're 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.769
 willing to put on I prefer that you 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.969
 put is that they always say that there is 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.099
 someone who must break with the 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.379
 stigma of this wardrobe and look but 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.099
 begins the bikini personera can be 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.099
 better yes or no 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.739
 If you go to the beach to a child 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.280
 I believe that this man is the one who 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.150
 it deserves to have put I am today 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.150
 the moralist 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.879
 and what bad vibes from the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.040
 you need because we are a team and 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.030
 we must support ourselves by opening 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.030
 getting a special fabric 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:30.500
 if he left let her choose 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.569
 what color you choose the day or the 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.360
 orange dress just talked the 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.820
 captain 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.390
 I remember you have history there are children 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:43.440
 that have lasted only one day 4 in the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.440
 public pins 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.530
 pink 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.140
 I think it's better to choose another 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.530
 Messer's wardrobe color and he's 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.750

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.750
