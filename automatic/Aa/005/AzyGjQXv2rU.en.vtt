00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.569
 good day my ladies and gentlemen if 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.280
 you first on the violin in the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.599
 beginning phase are on the way we say 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.599
 then in the first year then you know 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.519
 that problem determines that you have it 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.020
 just can not make it right 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.619
 fingers the right notes 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.199
 to grab 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.800
 surely they started that way 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.570
 you have learned the first handle art 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.539
 that would be the first finger of the one 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.150
 All over the empty page then stands 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.859
 the second finger again in the whole 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.160
 already removed from the first and the third 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.129
 finger then halftone distance and it 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.590
 then looks in the finger position 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.940
 So look and be the first grip art 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.070
 they are called that the middle ones 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.260
 both fingers are close together 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 halftone distance this is this first 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.219
 someone always learns and certainly 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.750
 Do you know that one there first 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.149
 plays once and wonders 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.899
 How am I somehow clean 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.030
 I would like to give you three today 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.489
 important basic requirements show the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.630
 they need it to work 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.090
 Can and you will see it can 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.260
 work if you just these three 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.229
 heed things 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.240
 The first thing you need is your hand 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.270
 They really bring that form into their mold 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 have to feel this shape in the hand and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.310
 They do that best by doing that 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.100
 First, the hand in the first 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:32.009
 position so that they are the third 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:36.060
 finger on the a side on the debut and 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.500
 compare that to the side it must 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.930
 an octave can give 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.790
 and if you now have the second finger on the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.439
 third finger close one 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.299
 halftone distance and the first something 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.299
 should move away the lesson 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.799
 directly on the fourth finger 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.819
 show put again the handle so 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:06.619
 he looks and he grabbed that 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.619
 they should really internalize 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:15.390
 in the process, the fingers have to do their best 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.250
 learning about each other and the distances 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.340
 create your finger through it 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.150
 always in the complete form of the hand 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.760
 put on 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.760
 There is the following exercise they change 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.750
 a blank page off with the first one 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.370
 finger and then they attack with two 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.140
 Fingern and I say explicitly 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.150
 two do not finger the second 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.670
 finger alone but with both 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.810
 fingers in their distance on the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.810
 so have to come 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.580
 get 3 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.269
 and even four fingers and they see that 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.180
 the hand gets used to it in the 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.579
 complete form here on the fingerboard 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.030
 to stand that is first of all 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.290
 important that you hear the sounds at all and 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.890
 keep meeting 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.970
 the second point is we call it 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.670
 put the tunnel in the hands of the children 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.000
 her fingers on so that 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.010
 foremost joints of the fingers curved 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.260
 These are the fingers upright on the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.420
 They stand side by side that sees why 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.060
 you reached the tunnel because that's the way it is 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.000
 now see well with my first finger 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.220
 under the finger a tunnel is created 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.480
 are they here behind the finger 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.970
 a small tunnel emerges and in 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.909
 This tunnel may be the next higher one 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.290
 side cantilever not so much so 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.420
 I'm attacking on the b-side right now 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.549
 they see that and now I want to 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.010
 the a side and you can see that 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:48.079
 sound at the same time 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.459
 although I put up my finger 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:55.010
 I would go too flat on them 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.569
 nothing more like the most prestigious of the 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.549
 finger must be so that the 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.989
 always side though the finger the side 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.849
 holding down free can swing that 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.840
 You can now use this again 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.459
 jump out that they win their 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.819
 finger correct and you something like that 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.819
 do we 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.829
 I do not love my fingers 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.069
 high because I play the a side 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.690
 but the finger stays in spite of that 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:27.690
 stroked the a-side so 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:39.169
 note that this position if you 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.000
 they then have the basis 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.139
 that's why they 're going too fast after all 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.729
 can grab 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.220
 You can not do that if you like that 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.930
 with flattened fingers need it 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.880
 it way too much energy to be so high 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.720
 get on time that will always 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.360
 become difficult 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.620
 but if you have the tunnel ribbon then 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.580
 put them right in the right place 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:02.900
 form so i had a third one for them 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.110
 Opportunity announced which is important 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.910
 to play clean it 's about how 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.680
 I bring my fingers to another 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:15.080
 still hold your fingers over 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.030
 the right sounds how do I do that 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.220
 already they time I now go forth 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.360
 would and would grab on the b-side 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.850
 I want and I put my fingers 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.830
 just like that, they're that through that 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.810
 stretch the fingers would be the now 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.880
 not in the right place are the 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.470
 would stand taller or through 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.539
 do not contract to a higher one 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:36.650
 Side wants that does not work 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:38.900
 really what you need to make the mistake 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.460
 to place on another page 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.350
 I'm going very far then then 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.960
 you can see this in bavaria 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.940
 that you move to another 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.700
 always do it with your whole arm 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.919
 and, so to speak, through the elbow 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.610
 move the whole hand across the 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.340
 fingerboard move you notice that that 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.229
 it is necessary for you to be here 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.660
 different sides can grab clean 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.490
 leave the elbow free for it 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.010
 swing then you will realize that 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.060
 her fingers on all sides on the 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.440
 right places are 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.440
 you can, for example, take care of it 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.620
 Hello 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.250
 decent as always gone over 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.370
 and that's how I bring my fingers up 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:36.070
 clean the other side if they are 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.340
 master that then they have the best 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.530
 basis laid around a first key 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.510
 to play on the violin 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.190
 I do not have to mention money now 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.910
 that in principle in the industry 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.700
 it works the same way 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.440
 there is also a key with there 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.990
 which works very well, but 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.630
 I'll tell them about it the next time 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:59.550
 Sometimes they make a lot of success 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.550
 good bye to your experiments
