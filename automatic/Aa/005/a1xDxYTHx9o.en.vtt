 hi it's marco and open today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.080
 little unpacking video of sony xperia 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.269
 tablet's or more precisely from the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.380
 week experia thesis chart since 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.900
 of course, as its name indicates 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.429
 it's a touch pad so everything 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.350
 just a little unpacking video of 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.779
 this tablet that I will present 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.490
 very soon in a video that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.410
 will also be posted on our channel 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.660
 youtube and on our blog you get 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.949
 strong on iphone point fr so 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.420
 today it's a very modest video 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.859
 unpacking but that will allow you 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.050
 here is to report to you what I 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.059
 say is present with the famous salad 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.559
 in his famous packaging series so 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.260
 there we have the famous woodside package 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.360
 besides that knee did not show up 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.800
 as usual on sony packagings 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.360
 we are on something that is 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.399
 square rectangular format anyway 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.629
 but who is very fine so always the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.329
 sony boxes it's really the design 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.100
 sony assured packaging on the facade 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.890
 obviously we have to globo but 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.030
 also the visual of the product some 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.280
 number of informations 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.350
 two names actually no it's choosing a 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.550
 heel of the training actually does either 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.640
 early actually the packaging is rather 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.640
 sober earlier rather minimalist a 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.460
 reading term of which sometimes 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.310
 that opens his famous boxes must 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.960
 obviously the inevitable 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.220
 tablet which is protected so in 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.220
 his little film the stic parents of the little 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.229
 transparent bag here I am going 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.090
 allow to remove we find the 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.710
 tablet in itself a very beautiful 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.360
 table is a very nice design 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.800
 very accomplished so that I you 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.869
 will present very possible very 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.640
 soon forgive in a test so 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.340
 on our blog and on our channel 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.479
 youtube we find the inevitable 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.470
 documentation here's a guide to 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.030
 quick setup 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.479
 that's good when you want to start 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.740
 very quickly your first first 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.950
 installation first collection made 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.619
 with the tablet we find under this 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.009
 famous cardboard cradle or the 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.140
 documentation still documentation 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.539
 further documentation 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.149
 here we also find then under 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:06.939
 this second version is inside 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:09.729
 even from this little box then a 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.269
 must-have must-have adapter 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.940
 sector 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.070
 by the way which is in two parts 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.070
 since he is in the first part with a 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.650
 party power adapter cable so 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.299
 with a usb cable that also serves as 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.600
 synchronization in a synchronization cable 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.310
 so just here and there 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.630
 also finds the other side 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.700
 of the AC adapter in the last 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.209
 electrical plugs she herself a 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.850
 take too late 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.500
 so that's it's at least seven merit 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.970
 to be simple and maybe it's even 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.260
 extremely minimalist but hey it takes 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.570
 know that it does not take more to so 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.920
 it's a mains adapter in two 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.709
 parties do the same in three parts 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.049
 on you sees with this new usb cable 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.220
 of which 14 have a little more on the 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.420
 tablet in itself since finally 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.820
 it's more interesting because we 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.200
 discover a product in a packaging 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.190
 so very very beautiful very big screen 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.560
 diagonal so the game 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.900
 between air very soon forgiveness in 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.640
 a test video at the back so well 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.620
 here we have this little touch 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.530
 a little studied design at sony 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.090
 with this little return to the earth of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.720
 small plastic return product 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.800
 metal that is behind 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.170
 So here is a product after all 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.180
 friendly enough bof where are we going to say in 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.400
 any case with a rather studied design 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.290
 rather work and so we go 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.880

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.540
