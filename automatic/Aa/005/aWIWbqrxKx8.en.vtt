00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.790
 From the bottom 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.900
 good people from youtube how are you? 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:17.360
 Facundo in this new channel video 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:20.810
 first video of gta 5 what do I do and 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.660
 I wanted to teach 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.220
 something that everyone sure wants to do 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.990
 and sure they can not is like entering the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.660
 airport 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.790
 Internal international airport 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.579
 the saints without being persecuted 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.870
 police not because every time we enter 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:45.470
 what happens to us I already discovered 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.230
 I already had one of the first finals 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.750
 the other two endings are still missing 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.340
 but it's like they gave me the money 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.440
 of the latest version then what 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.800
 we are going to have to do it first 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:03.040
 get a car and come here 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.040
 it would be the first one 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.770
 the first of the main door 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.250
 main entrance of the airport that is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.300
 where is the guard and the barrier d 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.940
 that when we enter when we approach 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.400
 the guard tells us to get away if 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.400
 on the side of a door that when 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.180
 when we enter automatically we 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.480
 three stars appear 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.460
 and what we have to do to be able 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.090
 get in 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.190
 are two things it is very easy you could 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.659
 say they are 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.969
 two pavadas this 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.770
 the first option we have two options 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:56.789
 the first is to do all the tests of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.209
 the flight school that would be this 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.640
 here would be flight school we have to 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:07.160
 hit all the school tests 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.879
 flight voice and do not have to buy 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:15.690
 a hangar at the airport I give you the 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:18.690
 second option and I bought with with silver 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.910
 with the money until they give you one of 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.910
 the latest missions grab and buy a 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.230
 an Andalusian that I already have already I have one of 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.800
 these private jets 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.980
 by name 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.519
 d 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.440
 so I can go to the airport 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.409
 I quietly think that a hangar goes out 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.950
 one million and a million and a half I think that 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.720
 I am a walk 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.240
 those are 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.000
 the only two options we have for 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.710
 enter without appearing stars 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.700
 then there are those who are 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.430
 What are they 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.720
 the commands that we have to press that 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.100
 why 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.900
 disappear the stars but with this 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:13.690
 what we do directly or appear 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:17.060
 then what would be the flight school 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.970
 serious we have to enter here 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.390
 not where it's good the subject is that it's 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.360
 down we have to go and we have to go to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.640
 that celestial poster we have to go up 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.160
 the ladder and go to the celestial poster that 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.319
 is there I believe that today by the fifth 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.709
 test or something like that but 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.180
 good 66 touches easier until what 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.180
 we are going to have to do is throw ourselves 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.940
 and I told them that when we entered 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.910
 here we automatically appear three 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.650
 stars and this policeman is the one that 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.500
 date and if not the other option that we have 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.770
 it's jumping around but when we buy 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.300
 a walk we come and 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.620
 to open me thanks 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.920
 and let us automatically and longer 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.740
 once inside the airport we can 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.720
 grab and see where our hangar is 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.600
 that is going to be the one that will mark us here 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:22.290
 and let's go and we're going to fall 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.290
 it would 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.419
 to see but now 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.020
 I am a rebel 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:40.279
 the mother point because it broke a plane 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.990
 good good the subject is this we are 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:50.200
 arriving at the walk and just when 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.310
 grab the police that hopefully we will not 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.220
 do not get caught 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.030
 in euros they are following us 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.010
 a plane point of zero crosses so 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.280
 well let's see if we find out if 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.670
 are in our plane who buys the 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.450
 employment and if this plane is no longer 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:14.080
 escapes very directly on the plane and 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.080
 here it is 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.290
 and we run as fast as we can and 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.050
 We get into the airplane 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.050
 once inside we do not have to 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.669
 worry about cops or anything we go 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.669
 good to fuck 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:38.089
 and how the cops think we're 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:43.219
 inside the hangar still 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:43.219
 quietly we can not we can go 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.630
 and we do not go on our always 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.330
 private 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:56.050
 or private plane like you misfortune 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:59.110
 so well those are the only two 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:04.070
 ways that we have to enter the 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:07.249
 airport without us without us 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:09.229
 and stars appear 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:12.859
 in the next video I'm going to show you 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:15.169
 how to enter the force zancudo that would be 

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:18.079
 the military base also without us 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:20.419
 stars appear only with 

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:23.559
 this trick that I will teach you in the 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.559
 next episode 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:32.270
 we will not be able to spend much time in 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:35.090
 the one in the military base we have to enter 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.330
 to grab the plane we want and leave 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.520
 directly because we are going to be going to 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.550
 continue until they kill us 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.710
 and then when we get off the 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:50.300
 vehicle that I will show you later 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:53.960
 so it's good but we're going to leave 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.599
 the video here I hope you have them 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.840
 liked leave a line do not let them 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:03.229
 cost nothing to comment and subscribe for 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.320
 more gta 5 videos and more videos than 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:09.110
 upload 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.110
 good luck see you next
