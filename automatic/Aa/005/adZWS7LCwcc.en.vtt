reasons<00:02:29.330> why<00:02:29.510> I've<00:02:30.020> never<00:02:30.500> dyed<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:31.010> down<00:02:31.220> to

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
reasons why I've never dyed it down to

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.790 
reasons why I've never dyed it down to
four<00:02:32.150> percent<00:02:32.330> body<00:02:32.750> fat<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.350> know<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.560> mean

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
four percent body fat you know I mean

four percent body fat you know I mean
I've<00:02:34.190> always<00:02:34.610> died<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.060> dad's<00:02:35.209> about<00:02:35.630> an

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
I've always died and dad's about an

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.630 
I've always died and dad's about an
eighth<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.440> lower<00:02:36.680> side<00:02:36.980> ever<00:02:37.190> went<00:02:37.489> was<00:02:37.580> a

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
eighth the lower side ever went was a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.550 
eighth the lower side ever went was a
six<00:02:38.030> that's<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.570> lower<00:02:38.780> than<00:02:38.900> ever<00:02:39.230> been<00:02:39.410> in<00:02:39.530> my

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
six that's a lower than ever been in my

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.360 
six that's a lower than ever been in my
whole<00:02:39.620> life

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370

you<00:02:40.910> know<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.120> mean<00:02:41.300> that's<00:02:41.900> partly<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:42.620> reason

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
you know I mean that's partly the reason

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.120 
you know I mean that's partly the reason
why<00:02:43.220> I'm<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:44.570> thick<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.110> dense<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.680> my

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
why I'm so thick and dense and my

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.560 
why I'm so thick and dense and my
muscles<00:02:46.580> are<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:46.820> mature

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
muscles are so mature

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.470 
muscles are so mature
it's<00:02:47.840> because<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.590> pretty<00:02:49.160> much<00:02:49.280> maintain<00:02:50.120> them

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
it's because I pretty much maintain them

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.500 
it's because I pretty much maintain them
they're<00:02:50.720> all<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.080> muscle<00:02:51.470> I've<00:02:51.800> ever<00:02:52.160> gained

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
for about four years

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.380 
for about four years
the<00:04:35.440> guy<00:04:35.710> who's<00:04:36.070> been<00:04:36.100> limping<00:04:36.520> for<00:04:36.850> about<00:04:37.060> ten

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
the guy who's been limping for about ten

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.120 
the guy who's been limping for about ten
years<00:04:37.419> it's<00:04:38.260> going<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.620> look<00:04:38.710> a<00:04:38.770> whole<00:04:38.890> lot

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
years it's going to look a whole lot

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.010 
years it's going to look a whole lot
better<00:04:39.400> than<00:04:39.970> that<00:04:40.450> guy<00:04:40.690> who's<00:04:40.900> been

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
better than that guy who's been

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.870 
better than that guy who's been
listening<00:04:41.320> for<00:04:41.440> four<00:04:41.620> years<00:04:41.919> if<00:04:42.460> he's<00:04:42.669> been

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
listening for four years if he's been

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.490 
listening for four years if he's been
doing<00:04:43.240> what<00:04:43.360> he's<00:04:43.480> both<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.780> do<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.350> know<00:04:44.470> I

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
doing what he's both to do you know I

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.590 
doing what he's both to do you know I
mean<00:04:44.560> because<00:04:45.010> his<00:04:45.340> muscles<00:04:45.820> are<00:04:45.970> gonna<00:04:46.330> be

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
mean because his muscles are gonna be

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.470 
mean because his muscles are gonna be
mature<00:04:46.900> he's<00:04:47.590> got<00:04:47.770> to<00:04:47.860> be<00:04:47.950> real<00:04:48.190> vascular<00:04:48.970> he's

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
mature he's got to be real vascular he's

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.690 
mature he's got to be real vascular he's
gonna<00:04:49.720> be<00:04:49.960> harder<00:04:50.500> looking<00:04:50.919> he's<00:04:51.310> gonna<00:04:51.520> be

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
gonna be harder looking he's gonna be

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.150 
gonna be harder looking he's gonna be
fuller<00:04:52.090> looking<00:04:52.690> he's<00:04:53.140> even<00:04:53.560> probably<00:04:53.980> gonna

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
fuller looking he's even probably gonna

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.780 
fuller looking he's even probably gonna
be<00:04:54.400> more<00:04:54.640> striated<00:04:55.480> so<00:04:56.470> mature<00:04:56.800> muscle<00:04:57.610> is

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
be more striated so mature muscle is

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.530 
be more striated so mature muscle is
always<00:04:58.630> better<00:04:59.020> than<00:04:59.200> new<00:04:59.470> muscle<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:01.030> when

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
always better than new muscle and when

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.330 
always better than new muscle and when
you<00:05:01.690> like<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:01.960> said<00:05:02.169> it<00:05:02.260> when<00:05:02.350> your<00:05:02.470> diet<00:05:02.710> the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
you like I said it when your diet the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.930 
you like I said it when your diet the
first<00:05:03.669> muscle<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.240> go<00:05:04.390> is<00:05:04.960> their<00:05:05.260> new<00:05:05.500> month<00:05:05.940> so

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
first muscle to go is their new month so

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.930 
first muscle to go is their new month so
if<00:05:07.419> you<00:05:07.630> have<00:05:07.720> muscles<00:05:08.080> on<00:05:08.200> mature<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.980> little

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
if you have muscles on mature a little

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.420 
if you have muscles on mature a little
more<00:05:10.270> mature<00:05:10.660> you're<00:05:11.320> less<00:05:11.590> likely<00:05:11.620> to<00:05:12.130> lose

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
more mature you're less likely to lose

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.720 
more mature you're less likely to lose
it<00:05:12.730> so<00:05:12.940> soon<00:05:13.270> you<00:05:13.810> know<00:05:13.930> when<00:05:14.770> you<00:05:14.860> die<00:05:15.070> you<00:05:15.580> got

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
it so soon you know when you die you got

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.270 
it so soon you know when you die you got
to<00:05:15.820> lose<00:05:16.000> muscle<00:05:16.240> anyway<00:05:16.780> but<00:05:17.350> mature<00:05:17.740> muscle

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
to lose muscle anyway but mature muscle

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.000 
to lose muscle anyway but mature muscle
is<00:05:18.640> more<00:05:19.000> stubborn<00:05:19.390> it's<00:05:19.930> not<00:05:20.169> gonna<00:05:20.320> burn<00:05:20.650> off

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
is more stubborn it's not gonna burn off

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.950 
is more stubborn it's not gonna burn off
as<00:05:21.160> easy

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
as easy

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.320 
as easy
as<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.289> new<00:05:22.500> growth<00:05:22.800> wheel<00:05:23.069> so<00:05:23.819> I<00:05:23.850> got<00:05:24.090> seen

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
as the new growth wheel so I got seen

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.450 
as the new growth wheel so I got seen
its<00:05:25.139> best<00:05:25.470> in<00:05:25.650> my<00:05:25.800> opinion

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
its best in my opinion

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.510 
its best in my opinion
