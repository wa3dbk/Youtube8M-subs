00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 mister gizi let's go now to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.960
 Russia considers you a supporter of Putin 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.469
 Russia pulled off a large number of soldiers 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.269
 borders of Ukraine about 20,000 did you know 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.460
 what are your plans for Putin and does he want 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.730
 seize Ukraine and face Ukraine 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.470
 invasion I know with Putin not 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.850
 talked but talked with others I 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.830
 always criticized Putin 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.650
 I always said that joining the Crimea 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.570
 was a violation of international law but 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.580
 I also always said that I was with her 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.439
 played a significant role in exacerbating this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.840
 conflict that really is me 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.489
 I think no, I was told the following and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.559
 Bundestag president and others they 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.329
 They said that if Russia join 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.280
 imagine another part of Ukraine east 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.879
 Ukraine, the same processes will begin 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.590
 his all former soviet republics 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.230
 if they start everywhere there and such processes 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.600
 then it gets out of control and they tell me 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.440
 said that if Putin rejects something 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.660
 then these are uncontrollable processes 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.329
 I think there is no other possibility 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.340
 this conflict between east and west 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.799
 Ukraine is not new, he was already in the second 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.080
 world war they must now friend with 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.150
 friend to negotiate a military solution 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.760
 the conflict that maintains Poroshenko 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.650
 wrong is the mistake the invasion of russia was 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.659
 would be a bigger mistake i hope that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.880
 all this can be avoided and finally 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.710
 start negotiations know me in 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.630
 This is most worried about the last 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.850
 the years are always thinking in terms of war 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.890
 resorts to military means why so 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.420
 rarely think about peaceful conflict resolution 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.640
 by conflict conflict in Ukraine 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.619
 can not be solved by force not the president 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.840
 Ukraine this can not so-called 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.880
 separatists are not Putin they are not over with we 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.750
 must finally again learn each with 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 friend talk 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.040
 unfortunately the facts speak of something else 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.990
 you know that the Ukrainian army is real 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.520
 moment trying to liberate all forces 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.380
 from the separatists city of Donetsk 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.000
 Is it not legitimate that Kiev 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.829
 the government now say so 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.960
 trying to protect the sovereignty of the country yes 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.180
 but in our country it is strictly forbidden to 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.520
 with internal unrest used by the army 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.280
 this conflict is not resolved by military means 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.110
 they have to negotiate because the Russians 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.030
 also humiliated in Ukraine need again 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.280
 start talking to each other this is not 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.289
 decide by military 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.690
 this lady today I have already talked about the new 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.760
 eastern politics and with can i say that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.770
 I think about this big 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.200
 advantage and with is that 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.360
 strange consisting in and with economically and 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.150
 politically so related to each other that 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.190
 wars between them are generally impossible or 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.950
 would this be complete and rationalism 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.510
 why we can not stop from Russia 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.860
 same close political and 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.830
 economic and social relations 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.860
 instead of sanctions and then the war between 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.330
 Russia and Europe would be impossible 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.580
 if we set such close 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.230
 relations with Russia, then you could 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.540
 impact such processes in 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.209
 Russia as the development of freedom of democracy and 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.950
 attitude to lesbians and blue if we 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.540
 we isolate Russia, then we do nâ€™t 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.340
 we can influence her Europe not 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.080
 may be the peace and security of heaven 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.209
 Russia is not against Russia, we finally 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.800
 must understand yes but our influence in 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.630
 Russia has never been particularly large 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.580
 Foil Cowder called the Party of the Left 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.750
 army Putin propaganda because you 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.100
 so sharply criticize politics 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.230
 government of germany regarding 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.510
 Russia tell me what Merkel is doing 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.640
 wrong because what arguments 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.260
 uses mister cauter noticeably 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.090
 how much we stepped on him 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.400
 sore spot otherwise he wouldn't use 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.140
 such stupid shameful arguments Putin 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.030
 anyone but not a man of the left 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.860
 views and in Russia is not socialism 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.079
 state capitalism so this 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.120
 already explains everything about us and Putin 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.070
 what makes the yardstick wrong is this 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.930
 that she gives in to obama obama says 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.790
 economic sanctions but below will not hit 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.380
 understands America if Putin 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.040
 really raise gas prices and 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.900
 oil 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.120
 if Putin ban now import vegetables 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.799
 and fruits not only from Poland but also from 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.870
 Germany as a response to Western sanctions 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.579
 know how it will hit the federal 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.799
 Mecklenburg and other regions 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.329
 it is precisely this that cannot be done the same funny 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.239
 and childly these sanctions 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.010
 we will punish him he will punish us in return 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.840
 then again we will apply new sanctions 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.609
 un again applied the response to sanctions to 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.200
 what will it lead who then removes these 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.299
 sanctions oh my god let's 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.890
 listen to the voice of reason and get down 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.450
 to dialogue with each other and discharge 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.450
 the situation is important now 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.109
 mister gizi we promised to return to 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.700
 weapons export vice chancellor 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.170
 promised to introduce export restrictions 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.910
 weapons and with the rest 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.160
 building a training ground in Russia 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.320
 who built German firms you with this 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.060
 agree 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.739
 yes I was always against the export of weapons and 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.770
 in Russia, too, although they are not at all 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.080
 need but what is interesting in russia is it 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.030
 stopped exporting a supply to algeria 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.440
 tank factory he says 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.919
 what contracts you need 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.620
 follow 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.090
 why in this case should also be 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.730
 opportunities to stop delivery i 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.040
 again do you know then after five years 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.630
 will be in algeria power and what will happen with 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.730
 this tank factory 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.740
 Saudi Arabia received tanks from us 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.250
 and below they invaded the next 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.440
 country 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.720
 you know we are ranked third in the world 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.280
 on arms exports we had to after 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.840
 World War II decide what we 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.880
 never will earn more 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.620
 money for warriors you know i want us 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.450
 no longer supply weapons to the neighbor 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.460
 east like in the arab world from attacks and in 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.530
 Qatar I want to not supply weapons 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.660
 in a conflict region and so you don't 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.900
 supplying weapons to countries from dictatorship 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.580
 Well we do not know what they are doing there with him. 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.240
 This is the bad luck of Germany around the world 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:17.090
 sell weapons but partner for it all 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.770
 same supply yes i know that this is all 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.510
 equally goes further though I am very distressed 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.280
 about turkey because turkey 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.630
 allows you to freely pass through your 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.640
 territory to all these terrorists 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.410
 Islamic militants but true too 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.060
 unbelievable and why not indignation 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.100
 faded whether obama why they don't say 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.080
 Erdogan that he went too far 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.490
 more for an ally to why they are 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.490
 silent and I expect this from them
