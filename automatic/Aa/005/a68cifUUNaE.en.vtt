 The evergreen jasmine is a rustic plant, which can be grown safely in the garden, as it doesn't fear cold weather 

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:30.495
 it is placed in the ground in the ground or even in a vase, providing however a large flowerbed or a large container 

00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:35.094
 since it is a climber, it produces a quite conspicuous root system 

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:54.367
 therefore it needs a good amount of soil to sink the roots into 

00:00:54.903 --> 00:00:58.903
 We prepare a good rich soil mixed with mature manure 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:56.740
 The branches of jasmine are fickle and flexible, and tend to develop a lot, even in a single vegetative season 

00:01:57.913 --> 00:02:08.910
 the young plants must necessarily be placed near a trellis, to which to secure the first low branches, so that growing they tend to climb on the support provided 

00:02:26.682 --> 00:02:36.680
 During the vegetative season the plant should be watered only when the soil is dry, and at least a couple of times a year spread around the stem of slow release granular fertilizer 

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:51.410
 After flowering the excessively long branches are shortened, so as to better contain the exuberance of the plant
