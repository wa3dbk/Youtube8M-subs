did<00:03:12.310> turn<00:03:12.520> it<00:03:12.670> up<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.820> little<00:03:13.000> bit<00:03:13.090> when<00:03:13.300> i<00:03:13.330> went

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
did turn it up a little bit when i went

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.360 
did turn it up a little bit when i went
to<00:03:13.600> curl<00:03:13.930> my<00:03:13.990> hair<00:03:14.140> now<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:16.410> has<00:03:17.410> like<00:03:17.620> ridges

to curl my hair now this has like ridges

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.830 
to curl my hair now this has like ridges
and<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:19.150> almost<00:03:19.450> like<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:20.490> brush<00:03:21.490> type<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:22.000> feel

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
and it almost like a brush type of feel

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.980 
and it almost like a brush type of feel
but<00:03:23.620> with<00:03:23.890> that<00:03:23.920> i<00:03:24.220> felt<00:03:24.640> as<00:03:24.760> if<00:03:24.790> my<00:03:24.940> hair<00:03:25.450> moved

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
but with that i felt as if my hair moved

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.500 
but with that i felt as if my hair moved
through<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:26.530> much<00:03:26.920> easier<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.850> i<00:03:28.180> was<00:03:28.330> able

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
through it much easier and i was able

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.570 
through it much easier and i was able
just<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.870> take<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.290> small<00:03:29.620> piece<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.280> I'm<00:03:30.460> not

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
just to take a small piece and I'm not

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.220 
just to take a small piece and I'm not
gonna<00:03:30.670> do<00:03:30.820> it<00:03:30.880> right<00:03:30.970> now<00:03:31.120> but<00:03:31.330> I<00:03:31.540> would<00:03:32.020> take

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
gonna do it right now but I would take

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.200 
gonna do it right now but I would take
it<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.620> roll<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.550> was<00:03:33.700> able<00:03:33.940> to

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
it and I roll it and I was able to

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.060 
it and I roll it and I was able to
actually<00:03:34.390> roll<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.560> whole<00:03:35.740> thing<00:03:36.040> very

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
actually roll the whole thing very

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.900 
actually roll the whole thing very
easily<00:03:36.790> with<00:03:37.090> this<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:38.530> feel<00:03:39.070> as<00:03:39.220> if<00:03:39.370> this

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
easily with this and I feel as if this

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.020 
easily with this and I feel as if this
actually<00:03:40.150> works<00:03:40.800> way<00:03:41.800> better<00:03:41.830> than<00:03:42.520> the<00:03:42.850> one<00:03:43.000> I

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
actually works way better than the one I

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.090 
actually works way better than the one I
have<00:03:43.300> like<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.600> one<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.750> have<00:03:43.990> is<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.770> now

doesn't<00:03:47.260> hardly<00:03:47.590> work<00:03:47.830> in<00:03:48.010> comparison<00:03:48.520> now

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
doesn't hardly work in comparison now

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.210

this<00:03:49.330> thing<00:03:49.600> just<00:03:49.630> really<00:03:49.990> works<00:03:50.590> very<00:03:51.100> very

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
this thing just really works very very

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.700 
this thing just really works very very
well<00:03:51.460> for<00:03:51.790> me<00:03:51.910> it<00:03:52.090> has<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.540> nice<00:03:52.750> feel<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.410> I

loops you see in my hair and I did find
that<00:04:34.740> this<00:04:34.830> stayed<00:04:35.280> a<00:04:35.310> little<00:04:35.669> bit<00:04:35.910> longer<00:04:36.150> I

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
that this stayed a little bit longer I

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.150 
that this stayed a little bit longer I
don't<00:04:36.780> know<00:04:36.930> what<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.139> process<00:04:37.770> would<00:04:38.099> be

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
don't know what that process would be

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.010 
don't know what that process would be
because<00:04:38.550> my<00:04:38.580> Hot<00:04:39.240> Tools<00:04:39.449> has<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.660> temperature

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
because my Hot Tools has a temperature

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.350 
because my Hot Tools has a temperature
dial<00:04:40.319> on<00:04:40.500> it<00:04:40.620> as<00:04:40.770> well<00:04:40.919> can<00:04:41.819> I<00:04:41.910> put<00:04:42.120> them<00:04:42.240> both

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
dial on it as well can I put them both

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.469 
dial on it as well can I put them both
at<00:04:42.569> about<00:04:42.780> 400<00:04:43.849> but<00:04:44.849> I<00:04:45.240> definitely<00:04:45.900> think<00:04:46.560> that

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
at about 400 but I definitely think that

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.629 
at about 400 but I definitely think that
this<00:04:48.479> held<00:04:49.259> the<00:04:49.530> curls<00:04:49.800> better<00:04:50.039> in<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.430> heat

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
this held the curls better in the heat

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.330 
this held the curls better in the heat
right<00:04:50.880> now<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.360> way<00:04:51.449> that<00:04:52.039> humidity<00:04:53.039> has

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
right now and the way that humidity has

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.710 
right now and the way that humidity has
been<00:04:53.550> this<00:04:53.789> seemed<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.150> work<00:04:54.270> better<00:04:54.330> when<00:04:54.660> i

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
been this seemed to work better when i

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.930 
been this seemed to work better when i
use<00:04:54.900> my<00:04:55.139> Hot<00:04:55.349> Tools<00:04:55.590> even<00:04:56.520> with<00:04:56.669> hairspray
