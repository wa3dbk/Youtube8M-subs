00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:08.450 

hi<00:00:02.909> guys<00:00:03.179> so<00:00:05.720> last<00:00:06.720> year<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.350> stood<00:00:08.010> here<00:00:08.189> we

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
hi guys so last year I stood here we

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.299 
hi guys so last year I stood here we
showed<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> video<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.620> this<00:00:10.620> crazy<00:00:11.010> game

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
showed you a video of this crazy game

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.120 
showed you a video of this crazy game
we're<00:00:11.519> making<00:00:11.550> called<00:00:12.120> no<00:00:12.269> man's<00:00:12.420> sky<00:00:13.130> this

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
we're making called no man's sky this

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.279 
we're making called no man's sky this
year<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.790> guess<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.540> really<00:00:15.780> just<00:00:15.960> wanted<00:00:16.230> to

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
year I guess I really just wanted to

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:25.170 
year I guess I really just wanted to
show<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.560> how<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.949> plays

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.939 

so<00:00:26.180> this<00:00:26.330> is<00:00:26.510> a<00:00:26.570> giant<00:00:27.080> sandbox<00:00:27.349> that<00:00:27.830> were

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
so this is a giant sandbox that were

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.290 
so this is a giant sandbox that were
making<00:00:28.400> a<00:00:28.609> universe<00:00:29.480> size<00:00:29.750> sandbox<00:00:31.150> it's<00:00:32.150> full

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
making a universe size sandbox it's full

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.670 
making a universe size sandbox it's full
of<00:00:32.419> choices<00:00:34.989> like<00:00:35.989> here<00:00:36.290> we're<00:00:36.500> at<00:00:36.559> the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
of choices like here we're at the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.259 
of choices like here we're at the
boundary<00:00:37.160> between<00:00:37.340> two<00:00:37.879> warring<00:00:38.150> factions<00:00:38.930> I

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
boundary between two warring factions I

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.950 
boundary between two warring factions I
could<00:00:41.269> join<00:00:41.480> in

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
could join in

00:00:41.960 --> 00:01:03.120 
could join in
I<00:00:41.989> could<00:00:42.379> take<00:00:42.559> sides

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.080 

so<00:01:04.130> that's<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.370> tiny<00:01:04.760> glimpse<00:01:05.150> of<00:01:05.360> space<00:01:05.690> combat

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
so that's a tiny glimpse of space combat

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.430 
so that's a tiny glimpse of space combat
but<00:01:08.090> I've<00:01:08.180> only<00:01:08.270> got<00:01:08.420> three<00:01:08.840> better<00:01:09.050> -<00:01:09.260> there's

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
but I've only got three better - there's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.510 
but I've only got three better - there's
loads<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:09.890> want<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.130> show<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.750> like<00:01:11.750> this

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
loads that I want to show you like this

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.010 
loads that I want to show you like this
so<00:01:13.520> this<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.730> the<00:01:14.030> solar<00:01:14.270> system<00:01:14.750> that<00:01:14.930> we're

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
so this is the solar system that we're

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.140 
so this is the solar system that we're
currently<00:01:15.170> at<00:01:15.410> that's<00:01:15.800> where<00:01:16.100> that<00:01:16.670> battle<00:01:17.060> is

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
currently at that's where that battle is

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.270 
currently at that's where that battle is
taking<00:01:17.330> place<00:01:17.660> but<00:01:18.020> battles<00:01:18.500> like<00:01:18.710> that<00:01:18.980> are

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
taking place but battles like that are

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.250 
taking place but battles like that are
taking<00:01:20.060> place<00:01:20.180> across<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.870> universe<00:01:23.140> if<00:01:24.140> I

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
taking place across the universe if I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.080 
taking place across the universe if I
pull<00:01:24.470> back<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.680> little<00:01:24.980> bit<00:01:25.190> you<00:01:27.160> could<00:01:28.160> see<00:01:28.430> the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
pull back a little bit you could see the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.300 
pull back a little bit you could see the
other<00:01:29.210> stars<00:01:29.630> nearby<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:30.650> can<00:01:30.890> reach<00:01:31.070> with

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
other stars nearby that I can reach with

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.150 
other stars nearby that I can reach with
my<00:01:31.460> current<00:01:31.670> hyperdrive<00:01:32.680> and<00:01:33.680> I'm<00:01:33.920> going<00:01:34.100> to

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
my current hyperdrive and I'm going to

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.920 
my current hyperdrive and I'm going to
pull<00:01:34.369> back<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.610> little<00:01:34.790> bit<00:01:35.119> more<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.690> give<00:01:35.840> you

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
pull back a little bit more to give you

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.560 
pull back a little bit more to give you
a<00:01:35.960> sense<00:01:36.290> to<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.619> size<00:01:36.890> of<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.220> game<00:01:37.540> when<00:01:38.540> I

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
a sense to the size of the game when I

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.620 
a sense to the size of the game when I
do<00:01:38.690> I<00:01:38.869> really<00:01:39.200> need<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.979> keep<00:01:40.970> in<00:01:41.180> mind<00:01:41.420> to

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
do I really need you to keep in mind to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.480 
do I really need you to keep in mind to
understand<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.470> every<00:01:43.070> one<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.280> these

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
understand that every one of these

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.900 
understand that every one of these
points<00:01:43.759> of<00:01:44.000> light<00:01:44.060> is<00:01:44.479> a<00:01:45.410> Sun<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:46.640> every<00:01:46.759> one

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
points of light is a Sun and every one

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.410 
points of light is a Sun and every one
of<00:01:46.940> those<00:01:47.090> Suns<00:01:47.509> has<00:01:48.410> its<00:01:48.619> own<00:01:48.800> solar<00:01:49.220> system

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
of those Suns has its own solar system

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.270 
of those Suns has its own solar system
with<00:01:50.420> planet<00:01:51.140> sized<00:01:51.350> planets<00:01:51.860> orbiting

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
with planet sized planets orbiting

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.990 
with planet sized planets orbiting
around<00:01:52.400> it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
around it

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.710 
around it
those<00:01:53.869> have<00:01:54.080> life<00:01:54.880> ecology

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:09.930 

and<00:02:01.720> I<00:02:01.900> can<00:02:02.020> either<00:02:02.110> go<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.350> little<00:02:02.530> faster

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.140 

now<00:02:10.510> most<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.900> these<00:02:11.020> places<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:12.640> never<00:02:12.940> been

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
now most of these places have never been

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.990 
now most of these places have never been
visited<00:02:13.770> many<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.950> them<00:02:15.100> never<00:02:15.280> will<00:02:15.520> be<00:02:21.000> over

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
visited many of them never will be over

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.810 
visited many of them never will be over
there<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.050> distance<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.340> center<00:02:24.730> of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
there in the distance is the center of

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.300 
there in the distance is the center of
the<00:02:24.880> galaxy<00:02:25.590> that's<00:02:26.590> where<00:02:26.800> we're<00:02:26.950> all<00:02:27.070> trying

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the galaxy that's where we're all trying

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.950 
the galaxy that's where we're all trying
to<00:02:27.370> get<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:31.120> I'm<00:02:31.300> going<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.570> do<00:02:31.690> something

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
to get to and I'm going to do something

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.920 
to get to and I'm going to do something
really<00:02:32.170> stupid

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
really stupid

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.150 
really stupid
I've<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.140> got<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.410> pick<00:02:35.530> one<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.830> these<00:02:35.920> at

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
I've just got to pick one of these at

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.270 
I've just got to pick one of these at
random<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.700> we<00:02:39.790> can<00:02:39.940> go<00:02:40.090> there<00:02:40.360> now<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:42.040> was

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
random and we can go there now this was

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.130 
random and we can go there now this was
okay<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:42.910> rehearsal<00:02:43.450> otherwise<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.990> would<00:02:44.110> be

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
okay in rehearsal otherwise it would be

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.880 
okay in rehearsal otherwise it would be
here<00:02:44.530> but<00:02:45.600> if<00:02:46.600> anything<00:02:47.020> horrible<00:02:47.200> goes<00:02:47.620> wrong

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
here but if anything horrible goes wrong

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.100 
here but if anything horrible goes wrong
just<00:02:48.220> keep<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.490> mind<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.970> I've<00:02:49.750> not<00:02:49.960> been

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
just keep in mind that I've not been

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.800 
just keep in mind that I've not been
here<00:02:50.260> before

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.800 

cool<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:03.220> here<00:03:03.400> we<00:03:03.520> are<00:03:03.550> in<00:03:03.880> an<00:03:04.060> undiscovered

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
cool so here we are in an undiscovered

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.050 
cool so here we are in an undiscovered
solar<00:03:05.170> system<00:03:05.710> probably<00:03:06.400> no<00:03:06.550> one's<00:03:06.700> ever<00:03:06.910> been

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
solar system probably no one's ever been

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.560 
solar system probably no one's ever been
here<00:03:07.210> before

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
here before

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
here before
I<00:03:07.780> can<00:03:08.350> do<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.470> scan<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.720> when<00:03:13.960> I<00:03:13.990> do<00:03:14.110> you'll<00:03:14.410> see

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
I can do a scan and when I do you'll see

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.860 
I can do a scan and when I do you'll see
some<00:03:14.800> points<00:03:15.070> of<00:03:15.160> interest<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:16.450> red<00:03:16.660> one

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
some points of interest that red one

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.070 
some points of interest that red one
down<00:03:17.080> there<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:18.070> beacon<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.690> I've<00:03:22.780> made<00:03:23.020> it

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
down there is a beacon and I've made it

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.720 
down there is a beacon and I've made it
so<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.590> there's<00:03:23.770> always<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.100> beacon<00:03:24.520> near

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
so that there's always a beacon near

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:39.460 
so that there's always a beacon near
where<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.120> warp<00:03:25.420> in<00:03:25.630> just<00:03:25.870> for<00:03:26.020> this

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.550 

so<00:03:40.470> beacons<00:03:41.069> are<00:03:41.250> where<00:03:41.430> you

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.449 

beacons<00:03:46.790> where<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.910> upload<00:03:48.270> discoveries

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
beacons where you upload discoveries

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.470 
beacons where you upload discoveries
that's<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.670> over<00:03:50.879> there<00:03:50.910> behind<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.840> rock

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
that's it over there behind that rock

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.670 
that's it over there behind that rock
and<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.690> is<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> planet<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.290> we've<00:03:55.500> just

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
and this is a planet that we've just

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.339 
and this is a planet that we've just
found<00:03:56.060> just<00:03:57.060> an<00:03:57.209> alien<00:03:57.599> world<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:58.050> we<00:03:58.140> found

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
found just an alien world that we found

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:04.520 
found just an alien world that we found
together<00:03:58.739> this<00:03:58.920> is<00:03:59.129> Planet<00:03:59.849> III<00:04:03.200> and<00:04:04.200> it's<00:04:04.349> not

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
together this is Planet III and it's not

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.380 
together this is Planet III and it's not
like<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:05.010> prettiest<00:04:05.610> planet<00:04:06.000> I've<00:04:06.180> seen

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
like the prettiest planet I've seen

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.839 
like the prettiest planet I've seen
better<00:04:06.599> but<00:04:08.030> I've<00:04:09.030> also<00:04:09.269> seen<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.690> lot<00:04:09.750> worse<00:04:10.849> so

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
better but I've also seen a lot worse so

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.930 
better but I've also seen a lot worse so
I<00:04:11.880> could<00:04:12.120> do<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.299> scan<00:04:13.549> and<00:04:16.549> as<00:04:17.549> luck<00:04:17.760> would<00:04:17.790> have

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
I could do a scan and as luck would have

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.789 
I could do a scan and as luck would have
it<00:04:18.060> there's<00:04:18.299> no<00:04:18.419> alien<00:04:18.780> life<00:04:18.959> but<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.620> could

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
it there's no alien life but I could

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.850 
it there's no alien life but I could
show<00:04:19.950> you<00:04:19.979> this<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:21.209> every<00:04:22.079> planet<00:04:22.530> in<00:04:22.620> every

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
show you this so every planet in every

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:33.879 
show you this so every planet in every
solar<00:04:23.100> system<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.760> fully<00:04:24.150> destructible

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.370
