um<00:00:37.100> I've<00:00:38.100> seen<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.460> car<00:00:38.670> compared<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.090> dad

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
but I think this card is so much better

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.400 
but I think this card is so much better
because<00:00:41.309> oh<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:42.270> card's<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.660> three<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.200> this

because oh this card's at three and this
card<00:00:43.649> has<00:00:43.770> no<00:00:44.010> limiting<00:00:45.350> summoning

even four times if you have a sanctuary
in<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> sky<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.770> card<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.520> um

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
in the sky so this card is really um

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.120 
in the sky so this card is really um
amazing<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.320> think<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:24.390> fairy<00:01:24.979> structure<00:01:25.979> deck

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
amazing I think the fairy structure deck

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.210 
amazing I think the fairy structure deck
is<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:26.909> good<00:01:27.380> enum<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.909> TCG

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
is going to be really good enum the TCG

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.560 
is going to be really good enum the TCG
so<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.520> give<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.820> card<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.210> five

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so I'm going to give this card a five

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.249 
so I'm going to give this card a five
out<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> five<00:01:35.450> I'm<00:01:36.450> surprised<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.049> car

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
out of five I'm surprised this car

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.130 
out of five I'm surprised this car
didn't<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.590> limited<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:38.540> like<00:01:39.540> it's

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
didn't get limited because like it's

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.490 
didn't get limited because like it's
obviously<00:01:40.740> more<00:01:41.610> powerful<00:01:42.329> than<00:01:42.509> dark<00:01:43.110> armed

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
obviously more powerful than dark armed

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.810 
obviously more powerful than dark armed
and<00:01:45.049> quite<00:01:46.049> possibly<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.460> could<00:01:47.670> just

and quite possibly like you could just
open<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.720> an<00:01:48.810> amazing<00:01:49.290> hand<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:50.390> go
