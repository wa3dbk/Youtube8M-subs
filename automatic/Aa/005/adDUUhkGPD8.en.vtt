00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.130
 Good morning guys and today in the garage minute. 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.200
 tide turbo cauc quite successful by 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.960
 here generated several comments 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:39.400
 this turkey, as you know, enjoy the turkey 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:42.970
 It's quite an original mandate arrived at 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 the end of the 90s causing 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.830
 making noise in the national market the 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.510
 bank the detail is that it gives 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.610
 car that's cool 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.610
 something interesting keychain on the turbine 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.320
 with who 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:10.300
 detail here of miniature police 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:14.710
 Italian at the time I mentioned the sea ​​is in 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.600
 precisely because it is a car of 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.840
 somehow wronged in the market 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.840
 national 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.690
 look at the economy his panel is more 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.690
 top is very curious 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.840
 We can already hear a 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.900
 feature that is very interesting 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.050
 in this car from inside the car you 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.050
 can hear the turbine pretty cool 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.160
 moré has an interesting career is the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.580
 turbo five-cylinder engine 182 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.580
 horses and turbine on 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.920
 sensational 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.800
 I say he was a justice car 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.950
 because fiat put the oil change to 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.660
 every 30,000 kilometers and more 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.980
 difficulty in maintaining finished 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.220
 complicating the lives of 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.220
 owners 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.579
 a very interesting thing about that car 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.890
 that you accelerate it can hear beyond 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.900
 working turbine she has a certain 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.540
 if you can get a certain sound as if a 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.439
 priority valve but does not have to 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.540
 serial 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.930
 It's not the priority priority either, but it's 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.930
 Something very similar 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.120
 then a certain tendency to leave 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.210
 forward is that it is interesting because it 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.920
 you have 182 horses in one is not any 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:55.160
 power is so great right? 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:59.080
 at the time was something sensational and continues 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.080
 being fun to walk without a doubt 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:11.870
 nowadays the cars at 1,750 are already 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:16.450
 very full of walking 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.450
 especially a new copy like this 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.769
 It makes a difference 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.470
 It's a turkey that 's cooler. 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.420
 We did a story with this car. 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.090
 there is a cool time it has a sunroof 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.310
 also complete is very conserved 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.320
 detail of the owner's caprice for 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.940
 the carpets to so I said omar is the 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.680
 justice because he has many qualities 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.320
 huh 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.380
 Only it ended up falling into the wrong hands, huh? 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:05.040
 the mechanic the bad ones and of some exchange 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.400
 well staggered 2 700 full turbine but 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.400
 a fantastic car 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.860
 wilson 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.850
 You can stay very clear. 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.550
 is this there soon more things 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:57.760
 fun here in the garage 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.760
