00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 where does any work on the bag begin 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.490
 simple and on the bag and desirable at all 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.490
 this start in pairs work and when on 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.440
 the bag with the setting of the shock arm that is 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.240
 shock limbs meaning people go out 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 immediately begin to box there some 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.500
 there is already a distant close range 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.080
 combinations but always the first round 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.650
 It is desirable to do as I always carried 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.240
 I tell them guys and myself for that 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.699
 setting in this surface that is 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.279
 become and just single blows beat 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.260
 so that his two knuckles get that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.510
 wrists correctly bent ie 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.670
 you need to target the music 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.520
 each tool will be disassembled on a tune 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.399
 and went to play master never 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.300
 starts not built did not listen 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.129
 played our guitar correctly 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.530
 the same thing here that is gotta become 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.059
 always adjust if i work in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.710
 a couple then I'll take me down 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.899
 correct position fist out i 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.730
 felt knuckle a little wrist then 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.980
 I already have a feeling for a couple 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.229
 is because if i didn't 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.220
 or somewhere wrong I'll beat here not 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.439
 I will follow this 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.630
 or somewhere I hit my hand somewhere 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.549
 will move out and it turns out to be a trauma to me later 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.400
 I will not be able to work much more therefore 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.650
 she bags in general any work on the bags 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.140
 must be and shoots a vile round 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.689
 I like how it's done for himself and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.720
 represents steel and there the easiest 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.299
 punch with him first i find the sensation 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.790
 fist just starting to beat single 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.729
 blows where it forces the floor here and look for it here 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.200
 The correct position is such that I am 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.140
 could beat in full force 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.720
 I didn't feel any discomfort 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.390
 here in those that is here i started here 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.430
 from here to look for this position she 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.260
 slowly adjusted to adapt 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.560
 i start if i feel that i have 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.470
 okay i'm on a full cube feeling 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.620
 ok left left that also went 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.840
 from here time you are looking for this position 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:04.300
 shot 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.710
 found lateral the same is possible 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.320
 you can not follow the technique that mount 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:15.700
 canvas but the most important thing is the feeling 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:18.970
 fist there straight and body still strikes 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.890
 different things happen 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.959
 beat right somewhere here in something wrong and 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.470
 each time over it represents water 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.860
 Pray, and then you can already hitting on 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.810
 connect to already give you a twist 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.080
 constant so and so and so we begin 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.570
 make no game hit different for from here 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.430
 so from here so from here and so hands 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.140
 they are obtained in different ways and you need to 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.980
 any time had time to do it exactly 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.570
 correct position 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.230
 we start a little more complicated 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:54.040
 start from the bottom side but the easiest I 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.769
 already rotate rotate forearm and hand 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:03.130
 I should just as well 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:04.770
 say goodbye and here you start and this 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:10.290
 position 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.150
 from here on this you have 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.580
 lyrical intro general how to work 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.330
 on the bag is to ensure that we are now beginning 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.610
 We will work and to even desirable 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.620
 before couples don't do that anyway 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.270
 to make you feel correctly according to science 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.910
 every time I was attached leaders in the balance 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.540
 from shoot on the bag you have super 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.780
 starred bear they partner, I determined not to 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.730
 the bag I set up my position plan 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.530
 then brush and then we'll become pairs I 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.100
 to know how to love this feeling already so she 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.980
 on the shelf 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.500
 it remains at first just a blow from below one 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.830
 hit just looking for shooting yours 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.270
 task so you can start full force 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.820
 start beating but you have no 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.320
 no discomfort was on my 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.450
 glance this error may be someone on 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:59.490
 heaps but when they break the arm we remember 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.560
 They said when we beat, she should go ahead 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.920
 pass through the partner if the side 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:10.500
 there is a head there through and through it does not go 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:13.890
 back many drink her hand goes back a 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.690
 The hand must go clearly ahead and 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.030
 when she finds back she is already relaxed 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.359
 that is, I see all the power will get what 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.120
 the difference here is two things as one because 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.520
 that I hit me sesila where I went 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.070
 I take back all their distributional hand 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.130
 energy sent there if i take a step u 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.040
 me for tense and tense me here 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.750
 I spend my strength back to return 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.850
 and why this is the second time when I'm there 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.740
 I already have a serial work 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.260
 a little breaks it turns out like 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.570
 single blows what is a series I'm 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.020
 hit and when i have this arm back 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.370
 leaves he will already find this serial work 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.770
 and if single 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.110
 you can do like two blows but it 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.150
 two single blows get as young as 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.130
 you're somewhere out there just to get there and leave 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.290
 also to stitched slower the prize you 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.590
 missed you do not successfully do not know will return 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:17.820
 a hand to protect is there is no there is not 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:19.830
 necessarily when I bark as far as I am 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.870
 I will go there to hit my hand has 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.150
 relax 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.940
 i hit all the power who i put 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.340
 relaxed takin back no example no 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.380
 on runners when they run a professional with them 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.020
 here is one leg raking it already 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.680
 relaxing it again guys this already 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.620
 relaxes 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.420
 I also have it so far 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.350
 relaxes it goes tense 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:46.050
 and here I am still counting myself spring 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.050
 tired of the muscles of those I'm for what the point is as 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.850
 would disable extra muscle antagonist 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.250
 if i turn me on strike speed 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.350
 the prince of his blow is healed 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.930
 my stamina will increase correctly 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.660
 if i lose my muscles 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.810
 of all sports how to get on board 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:08.190
 to do longer to do more efficiently 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:10.200
 less tired and off principle 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.960
 the most important thing is to turn these threads off 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.330
 muscle antagonists strike energy again 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.720
 same look here i have hit energy and y 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.690
 I went energy moved there and only 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.550
 then I take it and if I have time energy 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.410
 still goes I handed over a part and took 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.840
 back accordingly my punch becomes 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.290
 not so strong anger effect tired 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.070
 dancing 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:34.020
 Well, a whip and it is also good 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.670
 then it is more such that it has less 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.650
 chances to us in my opinion 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.750
 my opinion because it was burning i saw how 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.870
 boxing masters beat and why yes 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.870
 yes yes here I am not knocked out with this 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.880
 it would not be absolute but in my opinion 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.430
 it's better to do this for me 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.620
 there were no students who were well 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.410
 compilation which worked and 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.840
 didn't have a knockout punch like me all 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.370
 these coaches can boast I 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.889
 because I know there is a trainer they burn 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.810
 knockout blow can not be put this 

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:06.180
 nature that is to someone yes but to someone 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.610
 no alone coaches say knockout 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.300
 a blow can be put to any one 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:23.820
 there is everything differently I think that his 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:26.310
 you can put yourself there 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.169
 exception there units but I did not have 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.120
 no little ones that didn't beat 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:32.010
 knockout punch could be in this 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.110
 trick i don't know then maybe something 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.600
 friends friends subscribe to the channel 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.919
 Combat nerds I think this topic is all 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.479
 very interesting how to put 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.120
 knockout blow ruslan he 's with us 

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:45.260
 will share sometime someday 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.260
 near future
