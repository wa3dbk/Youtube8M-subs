00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello my name is jim rumen and you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.230
 see battlefield 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.269
 today with the u 100 mk5 that's it 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.710
 very first lmg that the provider to 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.330
 has and that is of course one 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.620
 entry-level weapon that means within 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.420
 I show you some of this series 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.890
 little things how to use the weapon on 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.660
 Best I can handle what I get from the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.779
 weapon he does not get accurate 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.670
 presents she gets no precise analyzes 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.960
 How this weapon works best 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.210
 and which direction moves away and so on 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.010
 next no I am in the principle of me 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.240
 I can say casual gamer 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.130
 would call me a good one 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.660
 average player every now and then I have 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.010
 I'll get it off quite often 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.270
 he gets on his mouth too well 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.350
 to see every now and again when I am at 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.969
 a live stream on the face 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.500
 but overall I feel 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.969
 in battlefield very very very well indeed 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.280
 and very at home and that's why there are 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.750
 from me this series yes this is not from 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.910
 I'm sure you'll have it with me 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.739
 level cap like or other youtube 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.329
 I saw that, too, of course 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.980
 here but it does not matter what we do 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.600
 You can always do everything in principle 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.800
 1000 maries icon that means if you 're upset 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.079
 you have to make your own series 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.359
 the new addons like always means 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.210
 that just tells us where that is 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.220
 whole thing is so back to the beginning 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.479
 chimpanzee of this weapon noel us 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.979
 played so completely without 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.479
 any attachments to it 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.250
 look like the whole part is dennis 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.140
 People still shout shit after that 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.790
 dlc weapons they are all a lot 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.470
 I think more completely honest 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.970
 personally not at all and this 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.299
 weapon , the patch is the perfect 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.009
 example is therefore over 100 mk 5 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.170
 a very very strong and very precise 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.729
 In comparison to many others 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.080
 one does not go so iced up 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.240
 But she does not have that much for that 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.189
 Ammunition so much ammo in the year 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.560
 visor or because of the im 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.180
 Magazine is the whole thing hersel 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.920
 storm is not exactly the right one here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.720
 best map to demonstrate this or 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.729
 to show too, especially in this one 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.770
 We had some rounds in the opposing team 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.939
 Sniper only on the edge 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.490
 have and they have me reasonably 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.020
 You can do it well 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.810
 but not my playing style would be 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.280
 at least not but 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.990
 Your seat is working naturally 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.640
 sometimes very well in between 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.500
 what should you do with this weapon 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.960
 I think you can with the thing you can 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.700
 Advance as well as defend 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.409
 means that is a very good euro and 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.030
 Threw in comparison to many other lng 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.710
 it would rather defend me with that 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.269
 So of course you can also 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.979
 then attack in question 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.170
 the thing is finally lead balls 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.540
 forward Klugscheißer it is for the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.480
 comments write but so panse that 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.280
 are not any lead balls yes okay no 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.840
 we can bring her to talk about her 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.569
 can there completely enlighten me what 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.640
 because now really out of book 100 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.700
 Firing the front is shit me 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.920
 So 100 is just like already said lmg 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.060
 relatively little in arrears so if you have it 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.640
 would be with others , for example 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.680
 machine guns with other light weight 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.000
 machine guns stop I compare 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.230
 personally have now as well as at 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.819
 Last video also played that is 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.260
 a bit passive not so great 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.880
 have always been so aggressive on the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.620
 minimap looked where are currently 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.330
 the opponents did not try that 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.340
 attack frontally if that 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.349
 in between times is clearly possible 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.150
 you do not fight back but it is 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.640
 In my opinion, better if you are 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.049
 the opponents are always flanked by the side 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.120
 An attacking shot in the back 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.769
 something like that enforce that 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.570
 works with this weapon too 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.310
 much better why the whole thing 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.959
 relatively low rate of fire is 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.100
 but more or less precise 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.750
 I have already a few times before 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.170
 I can not say it clearly enough 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.489
 his 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.200
 even opponents on the other side 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.400
 the map could be seen here now 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.400
 I'm reasonably good with one 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.540
 turn off the ironside is yes how should 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.040
 you say it is a bit 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.870
 getting used to but honestly 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.400
 there are many much worse ones so much 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.079
 the thing the user part, I have 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.850
 relatively quickly used what I like 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.260
 is that if you are here now once short 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.930
 in the created weapon equal 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.000
 Looks are not really much space 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.530
 away this weird red ring is yes 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.180
 all this weird black ring and 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.069
 here, of course, crisis 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.190
 countdown what the shit 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.450
 Please do not really I hate that 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.370
 with the counter I found that on 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.750
 the beginning so great and now I could 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.730
 each time puke knife 1 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.740
 he is immediately in the counter animation 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.510
 and willing 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.980
 am opposing position and immediately the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.750
 right button at the right time, the 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.460
 perfect timing pressures it happens yes 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.600
 I would always be measured so if you 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.490
 can measure me on the 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.810
 battlefield from the front or something like that 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.880
 You do not have to make an effort, yes 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.230
 I'm never working on the internet 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.340
 and then I should do it 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.140
 na so the lmg this is great in 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.910
 compared to the other lnbs has 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.760
 for me various small advantages such as 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.950
 For example, the precision of hunting 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.959
 this not particularly strong travel 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.340
 is of course mean and just as synonymous 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.810
 that you can relatively quickly after a few 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.190
 I have the exact times now 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.900
 Of course not in the head but in the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.130
 compared to the other lmg it well 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.540
 then only a complete drum or 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.640
 whatever will be pasted under it 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.740
 must work is much better 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.510
 So the thing is still for me 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.740
 One of the lmg is that I really like it 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.380
 Of course, a pack is also a few 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.810
 others but that's just a weapon 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.760
 one has free at the beginning and that should 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.200
 you also use the thing plays in all 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.220
 calm up I must now also one 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.320
 few kills make me mine 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.030
 500 come and mastertalk day in 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.170
 to come this week is when he 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.030
 me in the next few days on the 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.590
 Battlefield sees this weapon here 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.170
 then you know everything clearly 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.520
 The up is just making his 500 kills full 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.540
 Much more I want to the thing 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.400
 actually do not even say 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.560
 At the beginning I really thought that 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.480
 things super chunky is not fun and 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.370
 I mean during the beta I have myself 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.050
 but very very positive already there 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.460
 expressed then if you then in 1 2 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.960
 has played round immediately 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.080
 Gosh 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.700
 the thing is really traveling away what we are 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.470
 still knew that from battlefield 3 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.760
 In principle, one has in principle 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.170
 middle distance already almost 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.730
 nothing hit if you do not like two 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.200
 lay on the ground and at this time 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.610
 I would say they have that choice 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.630
 a good job made the blood 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.040
 balance 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.360
 you do not really have much ammo 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.060
 in there compared to another 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.800
 lng the part is relatively precisely despite 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.110
 well, I'm finally gone 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.850
 very curious how the whole after the 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.500
 september update looks like you know 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.790
 also after the september update 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.860
 All weapons a little bit 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.360
 adapted that means every weapons guide 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.800
 who came out by then 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.660
 should actually be new again 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.310
 be written so the round goes 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.600
 also right at the end 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.580
 There really is not much happening here now 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.050
 you see here you come here too 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.310
 also murder 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.990
 so a bit so he down there has 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.710
 still a very good moerser attempt 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.720
 clean up 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.610
 whether that is very good or very bad 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.050
 but is tip of my side 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.940
 not great with the thing 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.379
 aggressively pay attention to where they are 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.180
 opponents are on your mini med 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.460
 it always stops and lets it go 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.740
 Run in the beauty simply have 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.310
 no chance if you are halfway 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.960
 right 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.699
 Of course, you should always too
