00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
installing our refractory brick the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.430 
installing our refractory brick the
ceramic<00:00:12.120> fiber<00:00:12.330> back<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:13.049> either<00:00:13.139> go<00:00:13.349> with

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
ceramic fiber back we can either go with

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.829 
ceramic fiber back we can either go with
a<00:00:13.500> straight<00:00:13.920> brick<00:00:14.190> or<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> herringbone<00:00:14.849> you've

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
a straight brick or a herringbone you've

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.540 
a straight brick or a herringbone you've
chosen<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.320> go<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> straight<00:00:17.039> brick<00:00:17.340> and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
chosen to go with the straight brick and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.420 
chosen to go with the straight brick and
then<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.449> going<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.720> set<00:00:19.109> our<00:00:19.439> grates<00:00:20.010> and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
then we're going to set our grates and

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.580 
then we're going to set our grates and
our<00:00:21.000> end<00:00:21.210> irons<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.810> can<00:00:21.960> set<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.230> our<00:00:22.350> logs

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
our end irons and we can set up our logs

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.990 
our end irons and we can set up our logs
so<00:00:23.010> what<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.279> you're<00:00:23.400> putting<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.820> logs

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
so what when you're putting in the logs

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.210 
so what when you're putting in the logs
again<00:00:24.240> there<00:00:24.510> you're<00:00:24.630> just<00:00:24.660> kind<00:00:25.019> of

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
again there you're just kind of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.380 
again there you're just kind of
artistically<00:00:26.220> arranging<00:00:26.760> them<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.180> looks

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
artistically arranging them so it looks

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.779 
artistically arranging them so it looks
like<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:28.080> half-burned<00:00:28.949> fireplace<00:00:29.609> or

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
like a half-burned fireplace or

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.999 
like a half-burned fireplace or
something<00:00:30.090> yes<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> logs<00:00:31.560> we'll<00:00:31.859> be

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
something yes and with the logs we'll be

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.940 
something yes and with the logs we'll be
setting<00:00:32.369> some<00:00:32.790> glowing<00:00:33.510> embers<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.410> some

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
setting some glowing embers and some

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.400 
setting some glowing embers and some
cool<00:00:35.850> Nuggets<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.719> help<00:00:36.899> give<00:00:37.140> us<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
cool Nuggets to help give us the

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.740 
cool Nuggets to help give us the
realistic<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.340> an<00:00:38.460> actual<00:00:38.790> fire<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.510> once

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
realistic look of an actual fire so once

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.119 
realistic look of an actual fire so once
we<00:00:39.899> get<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.230> done<00:00:40.410> then<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.800> put<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
we get that done then we can put the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:41.900 
we get that done then we can put the
front<00:00:41.340> die

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
front die

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.240 
front die
yeah<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.450> can<00:00:42.510> put<00:00:42.780> our<00:00:42.899> glass<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.500> put

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
yeah then we can put our glass and put

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.639 
yeah then we can put our glass and put
the<00:00:44.460> arch<00:00:44.820> front<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.390> you've<00:00:45.600> gone<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the arch front that you've gone with and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.139 
the arch front that you've gone with and
I<00:00:46.800> know<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.160> had<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> lot<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.700> different<00:00:48.000> options

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
I know we had a lot of different options

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.180 
I know we had a lot of different options
in<00:00:48.510> terms<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.050> more<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.530> rectangle<00:00:50.100> but

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
in terms of the more of a rectangle but

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.889 
in terms of the more of a rectangle but
yeah<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.489> decided<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> go<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.600> arched

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
yeah we decided to go with the arched

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.450 
yeah we decided to go with the arched
curve<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.410> guess<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:52.649> call<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.070> artisan

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
curve I guess they call that the artisan

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.250 
curve I guess they call that the artisan
yeah<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.270> think<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:54.809> looks<00:00:54.989> really

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
yeah I think that just looks really

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.660 
yeah I think that just looks really
elegant<00:00:55.289> we're<00:00:55.680> keeping<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:55.980> fairly<00:00:56.219> simple

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
elegant we're keeping it fairly simple

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.880 
elegant we're keeping it fairly simple
going<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.149> wrought<00:00:57.660> iron<00:00:57.690> look<00:00:58.260> although

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
going with a wrought iron look although

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.369 
going with a wrought iron look although
it<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.699> possible<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.270> do<00:01:00.449> some<00:01:00.750> fairly

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
it is possible to do some fairly

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.619 
it is possible to do some fairly
intricate<00:01:01.859> design<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.969> mean<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:03.420> it's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
intricate design so I mean it's it's

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.329 
intricate design so I mean it's it's
just<00:01:03.809> great<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> lot<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.040> lot<00:01:05.280> of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
just great to have a lot of a lot of

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.649 
just great to have a lot of a lot of
different<00:01:05.700> options<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> work<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.479> or

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
different options to work with or

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.030 
different options to work with or
something<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.229> yeah<00:01:07.560> that's<00:01:07.770> what

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
something like that yeah that's what

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.219 
something like that yeah that's what

well that was my next question hey which
the<00:03:00.180> nice<00:03:00.360> thing<00:03:00.630> about<00:03:00.660> being<00:03:01.080> able<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.440> have

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
the nice thing about being able to have

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.070 
the nice thing about being able to have
a<00:03:01.680> standing<00:03:02.250> pilot<00:03:02.460> system<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:03.990> the

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
a standing pilot system is that in the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.440 
a standing pilot system is that in the
wintertime<00:03:04.380> when<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.860> gets<00:03:05.010> quite<00:03:05.250> cold<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.970> lot

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
wintertime when it gets quite cold a lot

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.120 
wintertime when it gets quite cold a lot
of<00:03:06.570> cold<00:03:06.930> air<00:03:07.080> will<00:03:07.290> come<00:03:07.470> into<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.860> firebox

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
of cold air will come into the firebox

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.490 
of cold air will come into the firebox
so<00:03:08.700> if<00:03:08.790> it's<00:03:08.910> 20<00:03:09.300> below<00:03:09.420> zero<00:03:09.780> outside<00:03:09.990> it's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
so if it's 20 below zero outside it's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.200 
so if it's 20 below zero outside it's
going<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.680> be<00:03:10.740> 20<00:03:11.070> below<00:03:11.340> zero<00:03:11.460> inside<00:03:12.030> that

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
going to be 20 below zero inside that

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.720 
going to be 20 below zero inside that
box<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.810> by<00:03:12.930> keeping<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.440> pilot<00:03:14.010> on<00:03:14.160> it

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
box and by keeping that pilot on it

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.190 
box and by keeping that pilot on it
keeps<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.060> little<00:03:15.210> more<00:03:15.450> temperate<00:03:15.870> in<00:03:16.020> there

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
keeps a little more temperate in there

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.570 
keeps a little more temperate in there
so<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.380> when<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.710> do<00:03:16.860> introduce<00:03:17.280> fire

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
so that when you do introduce fire

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.980 
so that when you do introduce fire
you're<00:03:18.209> not<00:03:18.360> going<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.570> get<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.720> lot<00:03:18.840> of

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
you're not going to get a lot of

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.630 
you're not going to get a lot of
condensation<00:03:19.830> on<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.950> inside<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.490> the

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
condensation on the inside of the

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.699
