00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.360 

use<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.329> combination<00:02:43.810> square<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.799> extend<00:02:45.250> the

use a combination square to extend the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:03:25.860 
use a combination square to extend the
marks<00:02:45.670> across<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.269> entire<00:02:46.599> shell

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.290 

now<00:03:26.500> we'll<00:03:26.769> mark<00:03:27.040> out<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.370> mount<00:03:27.610> locations

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
now we'll mark out the mount locations

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.350 
now we'll mark out the mount locations
for<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.660> lugs<00:03:29.220> measure<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.430> screw<00:03:30.700> spacing

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
for the lugs measure the screw spacing

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.990 
for the lugs measure the screw spacing
then<00:03:31.660> measure<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.170> height<00:03:32.349> of<00:03:32.379> your<00:03:32.650> drum

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
then measure the height of your drum

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.740 
then measure the height of your drum
split<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.120> difference<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.629> these

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
split the difference of these

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.600 
split the difference of these
measurements<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.560> set<00:03:35.800> your<00:03:35.920> combination

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
measurements to set your combination

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:52.699 
measurements to set your combination
square

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.740 

now<00:03:53.709> use<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.190> square<00:03:54.550> to<00:03:54.940> mark<00:03:55.090> all<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.569> lug

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
now use the square to mark all the lug

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.839 
now use the square to mark all the lug
locations<00:03:56.440> on<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.800> top<00:03:57.040> and<00:03:57.280> bottom<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.730> the

locations on the top and bottom of the

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:46.570 
locations on the top and bottom of the
drum

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.130 

next<00:04:47.580> time<00:04:47.730> make<00:04:47.910> a<00:04:47.940> mark<00:04:48.270> one<00:04:48.600> inch<00:04:48.810> from<00:04:48.990> the

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
next time make a mark one inch from the

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.810 
next time make a mark one inch from the
bottom<00:04:49.320> on<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.770> center<00:04:50.190> line<00:04:50.400> for<00:04:50.700> the

bottom on the center line for the

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.940 
bottom on the center line for the
strainer<00:04:51.210> this<00:04:51.660> is<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.020> location<00:04:52.440> of<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.830> air

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
strainer this is the location of the air

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.680 
strainer this is the location of the air
bin<00:04:55.430> it's<00:04:56.430> not<00:04:56.670> very<00:04:56.910> important<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.450> measure

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
bin it's not very important to measure

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.450 
bin it's not very important to measure
the<00:04:57.960> holes<00:04:58.200> of<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.440> strainer<00:04:58.860> since<00:04:59.250> there's

the holes of the strainer since there's

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.000 
the holes of the strainer since there's
only<00:04:59.670> one<00:04:59.930> simply<00:05:00.930> Center<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.410> on<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.560> shell

only one simply Center it on the shell

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.430 
only one simply Center it on the shell
then<00:05:02.430> tip<00:05:02.670> it<00:05:02.820> on<00:05:02.880> its<00:05:03.090> side<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.750> place<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.050> mark

at<00:05:04.620> both<00:05:04.860> screw<00:05:05.280> holes<00:05:06.680> finally<00:05:07.680> we<00:05:07.890> need<00:05:08.010> to

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
at both screw holes finally we need to

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.900 
at both screw holes finally we need to
lay<00:05:08.310> out<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.670> snare<00:05:08.970> beds<00:05:10.190> make<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.220> mark<00:05:11.550> one
