00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
some new performance features to the ski

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
some new performance features to the ski
so<00:00:42.510> let's<00:00:42.719> talk<00:00:43.170> about<00:00:43.230> what<00:00:43.620> we've<00:00:43.770> done<00:00:43.800> this

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
so let's talk about what we've done this

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.250 
so let's talk about what we've done this
year<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.489> particular<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.300> ski<00:00:45.600> let's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
year in particular to one ski let's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.959 
year in particular to one ski let's
start<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.770> looking<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.340> whole<00:00:47.670> line

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
start out looking at the whole line

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.660 
start out looking at the whole line
we'll<00:00:48.809> start<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> GS<00:00:49.829> Rd<00:00:50.250> that's<00:00:50.489> what

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
we'll start with the GS Rd that's what

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.240 
we'll start with the GS Rd that's what
you<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:51.079> Lindsey<00:00:52.079> Vonn<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.800> on<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
you see Lindsey Vonn out there on you

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.010 
you see Lindsey Vonn out there on you
see<00:00:53.430> ted<00:00:53.670> Ligety<00:00:53.879> went<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.420> about<00:00:54.719> every

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
see ted Ligety went in just about every

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.110 
see ted Ligety went in just about every
GS<00:00:55.320> race<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> season<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:56.940> this

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
GS race and then in the season on this

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.410 
GS race and then in the season on this
ski<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.320> some<00:00:58.590> some<00:00:59.420> distinct

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
ski and we use some some distinct

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.060 
ski and we use some some distinct
technologies<00:01:01.050> within<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.530> ski<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> first

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
technologies within this ski the first

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.009 
technologies within this ski the first
one<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.430> intelligence<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.570> that's<00:01:03.750> why<00:01:03.870> we

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
one is intelligence and that's why we

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.859 
one is intelligence and that's why we
call<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.439> i<00:01:04.650> GS<00:01:05.220> Rd<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.210> intelligence

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
call it the i GS Rd that intelligence

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.380 
call it the i GS Rd that intelligence
technology<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.100> piezo<00:01:08.549> electric<00:01:08.820> fiber

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
technology is a piezo electric fiber

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
technology is a piezo electric fiber
system<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.110> use<00:01:10.320> right<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:10.979> front<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.310> the

that's kinetic energy recovery system we

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.080 
that's kinetic energy recovery system we
use<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> tail<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> skis<00:01:38.520> that's

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
use that in the tail of the skis that's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.539 
use that in the tail of the skis that's
also<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> piezo<00:01:39.930> electric<00:01:40.259> driven<00:01:40.950> technology

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
also a piezo electric driven technology

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.179 
also a piezo electric driven technology
but<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.090> use<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> chip<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.110> manage<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> energy

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
but we use a chip to manage the energy

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.850 
but we use a chip to manage the energy
that<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.520> put<00:01:45.180> into<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.570> fibers<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that we put into the fibers so in the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.889 
that we put into the fibers so in the
tail<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> turn<00:01:47.640> when<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.030> chip<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.479> full

the ski that we've actually changed for
1415<00:02:35.379> this<00:02:36.159> ski<00:02:36.459> we've<00:02:36.939> added<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.299> little<00:02:37.599> bit

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
1415 this ski we've added a little bit

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.440 
1415 this ski we've added a little bit
more<00:02:38.019> width<00:02:38.230> in<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.530> tip<00:02:39.090> narrowed<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.239> tail

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
more width in the tip narrowed the tail

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.660 
more width in the tip narrowed the tail
by<00:02:40.659> about<00:02:40.900> one<00:02:41.170> millimeter<00:02:41.500> added<00:02:42.159> about<00:02:42.370> four

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
by about one millimeter added about four

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.819 
by about one millimeter added about four
millimeters<00:02:42.909> in<00:02:43.329> the<00:02:43.359> tip<00:02:43.659> we're<00:02:44.139> still<00:02:44.530> using

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
millimeters in the tip we're still using

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.839 
millimeters in the tip we're still using
the<00:02:45.579> FIS<00:02:46.150> specific<00:02:46.950> turn<00:02:47.950> radius<00:02:48.190> but<00:02:48.670> we've

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
the FIS specific turn radius but we've

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.300 
the FIS specific turn radius but we've
gone<00:02:49.090> about<00:02:49.440> achieving<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.530> turn<00:02:50.769> radius<00:02:50.980> in

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
gone about achieving that turn radius in

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.800 
gone about achieving that turn radius in
a<00:02:51.370> different<00:02:51.730> way<00:02:51.819> by<00:02:52.030> adding<00:02:52.450> more<00:02:52.569> within

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
a different way by adding more within

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.110 
a different way by adding more within
the<00:02:52.989> tip<00:02:53.260> narrowing<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.220> tail<00:02:54.400> we've<00:02:54.909> often

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
the tip narrowing the tail we've often

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.629 
the tip narrowing the tail we've often
also<00:02:55.480> softened<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.709> flex<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.159> the<00:02:57.280> tail<00:02:57.459> of

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
also softened the flex and the tail of

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.819 
also softened the flex and the tail of
the<00:02:57.730> ski<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.450> it's<00:02:58.599> not<00:02:58.810> quite<00:02:59.470> as<00:02:59.620> reactive

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
the ski so it's not quite as reactive

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.679 
the ski so it's not quite as reactive
out<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.370> the<00:03:00.430> tail<00:03:00.609> it<00:03:00.760> doesn't<00:03:01.030> kick<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.299> back

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
out of the tail it doesn't kick you back

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.509 
out of the tail it doesn't kick you back
quite<00:03:02.319> as<00:03:02.439> much<00:03:02.620> allows<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.069> to<00:03:03.159> stay<00:03:03.340> more

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
quite as much allows you to stay more

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.119 
quite as much allows you to stay more
centered<00:03:04.090> on<00:03:04.359> a<00:03:04.659> ski<00:03:04.959> like<00:03:05.439> a<00:03:05.500> slalom<00:03:05.799> ski
