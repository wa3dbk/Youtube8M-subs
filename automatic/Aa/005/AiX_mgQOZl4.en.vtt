00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 and then people doing the video here 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.710
 maintenance in the car is for who has 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.299
 doubt about the installation and the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.520
 uses the horns to flirt then 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.050
 I was having a problem in my life. 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.640
 she was not working correctly 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.460
 her crying was very strange 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.480
 so I went to check the installation here 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.279
 I saw that it was like some problem 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.510
 So I searched the internet and found 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.309
 No video for what I'm doing. 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.559
 this video here to demonstrate how 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.309
 is the tautou installation using here in 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.219
 le le le traditional horn 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:55.430
 We have the framework to mark only what you want. 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:55.430

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.670
 drums 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.149
 No 86 in 2000 that comes from the button that 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.289
 the horn on the steering wheel which is the 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.710
 Earth 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:32.189

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.619

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.110
 at 86 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:56.229
 goes the positive that the one triggered 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:02:04.390
 horn in 87 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.390
 I'm going to turn on the horn horn. 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.440
 if the sale here is the positive that is 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.200

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.970
 land that is wrong here on the body 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.640
 of the car then just recapping here in the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.840
 30th place the positive who is the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.740
 Direct positive battery charge 85 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.130
 it's on 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:41.050
 the hot earth will come back from the horn 86 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.960
 connected to the buzzer and 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.260
 87 positive that is the senate that goes 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.830
 release signal and functional little mouth of 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.830
 pet bottle 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.890
 but he had a problem here I 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.960
 I noticed that the right national failed 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:09.340
 I pressed the horn trigger here 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:11.560
 it was already the relay in the front and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.430
 when the dog bound together 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.430
 they will do the text 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.640
 there with you you saw that stopped there 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.200
 work perfectly 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.220
 That's it, people conclude the video and 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.230
 showing that sometimes most of the 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.330
 Things you can do without even having 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.890
 than to pay a manpower and that in the 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.900
 of this horn when I bought the car and 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.010
 asked to install and not installed 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.680
 correctly 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.330
 because of that she was with problems 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.690
 of operation 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.700
 so learn to do it yourself and 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.820
 times is better than you pay a 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.600
 person for doing what is just a hug until 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.600
 the next video
