00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.120
 and 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.540
 [Music] 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.660
 that everyone is watching me 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.129
 and that's that is very nice also for 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.960
 I personally do not think that my 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.990
 reference can always be the killer whale 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.720
 I've always liked how he plays, not a 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.180
 Total idol here in Paraguay it's my turn 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.180
 Now I hope to do things well 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.070
 and so the doors and illusions arrive 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.050
 in robin who in turn knows that of the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.820
 responsibility that already charges 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.800
 goals have not reached the team 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.680
 pumas and he is like one of the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.350
 references in the attack 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.500
 so here is played faster 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.520
 it feels more 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:53.400
 I think the fans press more and more and 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.650
 it goes more on the court when I left 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.290
 it did not go very well thank god with 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:03.340
 tolima that of my goal to succeed more 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.730
 and learn many more things 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.130
 and nothing I think to put the batteries and 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.810
 I hope God wants room all right with 23 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.310
 years the December dates follow 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.190
 being part of a family custom 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.060
 in this 2012 will have to leave a 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.670
 side we know that's a little hard 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.579
 but good is what I like to me is what 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.740
 that I want to follow and we have to 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:31.000
 endure many things but thanks to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.660
 god super handle all that I need 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.500
 in misuse we went ahead and that's what 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.750
 what I want 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.729
 robyn a promise of solutions for 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.950
 pumas that both the fans and the 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.900
 managers waiting for fruit soon 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.330
 Well, it could make the difference between 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.760
 continuity or cutting a project to 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.210
 sine of the good auriazul team 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.119
 I'm here to prepare physically in what 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.610
 football and I hope to leave everything inside 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.030
 of the field and hopefully not leave 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.030
 dual carriageway 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.200
 yes
