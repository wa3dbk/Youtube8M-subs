 of spring and today I come to 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.030

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.170
 prepare with margarine let's start 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.800
 with margarine let's add 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.450
 two tablespoons in our pot and let's 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.900
 begin to melt once our 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.750
 margarine is melted let's add 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.380
 the peace and the benefit of preparing it with 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.900
 spring is that they are going to have a soup 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 with a lot of flavor without so much fat I'm going to 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:41.129
 go leaving a little to brown and while 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.500
 so I'm going to start preparing the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.940
 caldillo I have onion I have a garlic and the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.390
 tomato 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.760
 we put everything inside the blender and 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.430
 let's add some water to 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.280
 form a puree if you want in 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.760
 this moment we can add a cube of 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 broth 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.540
 and we are going to liquefy perfectly well 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.080
 I'm going to book it here 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.920
 the pasta is almost ready 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.890
 I would love for you to see in the background of 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.880
 the pot that I do not have that much fat 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.000
 in addition spring margarine does not burn 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.670
 very good now I am going to add 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.570
 caldillo to prepare just the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.570
 let's go colando 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.980
 and to extract all the flavor of the pulp 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.460
 of tomato here I will add the rest 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.460
 of water 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.860
 let's let it boil a few minutes 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.810
 what I just did is a process 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.810
 to finish cooking the tomato 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.130
 and now I'm going to finish the soup by adding 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.980
 the remaining water 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.130
 we let boil again 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:15.560
 and we already have a soup recipe from 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.560
 noodles to pamper our 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.450
 so you already know how to spoil the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.970
 noodles with your traditional noodle soup 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.540
 with the exquisite touch of margarine 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.540
 spring
