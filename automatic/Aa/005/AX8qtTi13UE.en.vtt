which is the Jumbo hair and as you can
see<00:02:57.530> this<00:02:57.710> hair<00:02:57.950> is<00:02:58.100> definitely<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.640> lot

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
see this hair is definitely a lot

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.450 
see this hair is definitely a lot
thicker<00:02:59.180> than<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.050> original<00:03:00.710> braiding<00:03:01.250> hair

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
thicker than the original braiding hair

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.580 
thicker than the original braiding hair
again<00:03:02.270> I'm<00:03:02.390> going<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.660> separate<00:03:03.230> this<00:03:03.380> hair

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
again I'm going to separate this hair

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.470 
again I'm going to separate this hair
into<00:03:03.980> two<00:03:04.190> sections<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.940> then<00:03:05.090> I'm<00:03:05.180> going<00:03:05.420> to

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
into two sections and then I'm going to

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.570 
into two sections and then I'm going to
make<00:03:05.930> one<00:03:06.260> large<00:03:06.470> twist

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.760 

so<00:03:11.580> once<00:03:11.820> your<00:03:12.000> twist<00:03:12.300> is<00:03:12.480> all<00:03:12.930> finished<00:03:13.380> as

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
so once your twist is all finished as

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.260 
so once your twist is all finished as
you<00:03:13.830> can<00:03:14.100> see<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.340> twist<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.760> definitely<00:03:15.240> a

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
you can see this twist is definitely a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.880 
you can see this twist is definitely a
lot<00:03:15.420> bigger<00:03:15.630> I'm<00:03:16.230> going<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.470> be<00:03:16.560> using<00:03:16.770> the

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
lot bigger I'm going to be using the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.220 
lot bigger I'm going to be using the
rubber<00:03:17.310> band<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.820> came<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.720> actual

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
rubber band that came with this actual

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.840 
rubber band that came with this actual
hair<00:03:19.500> if<00:03:19.710> you<00:03:19.860> don't<00:03:20.040> have<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> rubber<00:03:20.400> band<00:03:20.670> you

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
hair if you don't have a rubber band you

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.820 
hair if you don't have a rubber band you
can<00:03:20.970> always<00:03:21.180> pin<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.810> hair<00:03:22.050> into<00:03:22.290> place<00:03:22.530> but

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
can always pin this hair into place but

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.040 
can always pin this hair into place but
the<00:03:23.340> rubberband<00:03:23.730> was<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> lot<00:03:24.120> easier<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:24.840> I

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
the rubberband was a lot easier so I

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.830 
the rubberband was a lot easier so I
just<00:03:25.560> kind<00:03:25.710> of<00:03:25.770> wrapped<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.100> around<00:03:26.160> my<00:03:26.490> bun<00:03:26.840> so

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
just kind of wrapped it around my bun so

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.660 
just kind of wrapped it around my bun so
the<00:03:28.050> reason<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.350> like<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.530> use<00:03:28.680> jumbo<00:03:29.280> hair<00:03:29.520> in

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
the reason I like to use jumbo hair in

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.430 
the reason I like to use jumbo hair in
the<00:03:29.760> front<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.120> because<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.420> want<00:03:30.750> my<00:03:30.870> twist<00:03:31.260> to

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
the front is because I want my twist to

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.320 
the front is because I want my twist to
be<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.620> lot<00:03:32.010> bigger<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.550> I<00:03:32.820> want<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.210> be<00:03:33.300> a

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
be a lot bigger and I want it to be a

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.080 
be a lot bigger and I want it to be a
lot<00:03:33.540> thicker<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.500> even<00:03:34.980> if<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.190> twist<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.760> really

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
lot thicker so even if I twist it really

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.700 
lot thicker so even if I twist it really
tight<00:03:36.330> as<00:03:36.570> you<00:03:36.720> can<00:03:36.870> see<00:03:37.050> it's<00:03:37.290> still<00:03:37.680> very

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
tight as you can see it's still very

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.360 
tight as you can see it's still very
large<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:39.180> here<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.780> can<00:03:39.930> make<00:03:40.050> it<00:03:40.260> as<00:03:40.470> tight

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
large so here you can make it as tight

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.220
