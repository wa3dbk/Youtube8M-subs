in<00:00:01.079> our<00:00:01.230> next<00:00:01.410> lesson<00:00:01.680> on<00:00:01.979> protein<00:00:02.399> structure

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
in our next lesson on protein structure

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.309 
in our next lesson on protein structure
in<00:00:02.939> chapter<00:00:03.330> 4<00:00:03.600> we<00:00:03.929> want<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.200> look

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
in chapter 4 we want to look

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.309 
in chapter 4 we want to look
specifically<00:00:04.859> at<00:00:04.980> tertiary<00:00:05.339> structure<00:00:06.319> we

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
specifically at tertiary structure we

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.810 
specifically at tertiary structure we
find<00:00:07.620> it's<00:00:07.799> often<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.340> most<00:00:08.490> stable

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
find it's often the most stable

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.730 
find it's often the most stable
conformation<00:00:09.360> under<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> given<00:00:10.290> set<00:00:10.620> of

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
conformation under a given set of

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.009 
conformation under a given set of
condition<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.610> involves<00:00:12.090> some<00:00:12.269> weak<00:00:12.509> forces

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
condition and involves some weak forces

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.560 
condition and involves some weak forces
such<00:00:13.230> as<00:00:13.259> hydrogen<00:00:13.950> bonds<00:00:14.400> some<00:00:14.940> hydrophilic

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
such as hydrogen bonds some hydrophilic

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.689 
such as hydrogen bonds some hydrophilic
and<00:00:15.660> hydrophobic<00:00:16.020> forces<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:17.430> there<00:00:17.609> are

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
and hydrophobic forces but there are

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.730 
and hydrophobic forces but there are
also<00:00:18.029> stronger<00:00:18.539> bonds<00:00:18.900> involved<00:00:19.410> such<00:00:19.710> as

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
also stronger bonds involved such as

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.700 
also stronger bonds involved such as
ionic<00:00:20.279> bonds<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.970> disulfide<00:00:21.150> bonds<00:00:22.080> remember

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
ionic bonds and disulfide bonds remember

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.859 
ionic bonds and disulfide bonds remember
most<00:00:23.160> proteins<00:00:23.670> are<00:00:23.850> globular<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.570> their

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
most proteins are globular in their

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.200 
most proteins are globular in their
overall<00:00:25.380> structure<00:00:25.890> here<00:00:26.580> we<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.820> triose

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
overall structure here we have triose

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.540 
overall structure here we have triose
phosphate<00:00:27.449> isomerase<00:00:28.010> we<00:00:29.010> have<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.279> space

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
phosphate isomerase we have the space

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.550 
phosphate isomerase we have the space
filling<00:00:29.820> model<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.599> top<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.990> our<00:00:31.140> figure

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
filling model on the top of our figure

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.470 
filling model on the top of our figure
and<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.800> gives<00:00:32.369> us<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.640> pretty<00:00:32.820> good<00:00:32.940> idea<00:00:33.210> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
and that gives us a pretty good idea of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.120 
and that gives us a pretty good idea of
the<00:00:33.600> size<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.290> hard<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> distinguish

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
the size but it's hard to distinguish

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.370 
the size but it's hard to distinguish
the<00:00:35.309> secondary<00:00:35.850> structure<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.170> need

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the secondary structure for that we need

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.950 
the secondary structure for that we need
the<00:00:37.530> ribbon<00:00:38.160> diagram<00:00:38.340> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> bottom<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.809> can

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.270 
structures that we will look at whether
it's<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.660> space-filling<00:00:48.989> model<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:50.039> these

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it's a space-filling model or these

ribbon<00:00:50.670> diagrams<00:00:51.210> these<00:00:51.449> all<00:00:51.750> came<00:00:52.140> from

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
ribbon diagrams these all came from

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.830 
ribbon diagrams these all came from
crystal<00:00:53.850> structures<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.539> we're<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.780> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
crystal structures and we're going to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.450 
crystal structures and we're going to
refer<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> little<00:00:55.739> bit<00:00:55.890> later<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.340> this

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
refer to that a little bit later in this

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.810 
refer to that a little bit later in this
chapter<00:00:57.710> so<00:00:58.710> proteins<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.489> different

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
chapter so proteins can have different

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.369 
chapter so proteins can have different
combinations<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.690> these<00:01:00.750> patterned

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
combinations of these patterned

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.460 
combinations of these patterned
structures<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.550> Part<00:01:03.359> A<00:01:03.629> here<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.290> have<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
structures in Part A here we have a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.969 
structures in Part A here we have a
protein<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:05.400> alpha<00:01:05.880> helix<00:01:06.420> B<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.619> all

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
protein that's all alpha helix B is all

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.940 
protein that's all alpha helix B is all
beta<00:01:08.250> sheets<00:01:08.640> C<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> combination<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.710> alpha

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
beta sheets C is a combination of alpha

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.760 
beta sheets C is a combination of alpha
and<00:01:11.280> beta<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.790> D<00:01:12.479> has<00:01:12.689> very<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.170> secondary

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
and beta and D has very little secondary

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
and beta and D has very little secondary
structure<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.270> there's<00:01:15.540> very

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
structure so you can see there's very

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.429 
structure so you can see there's very
many<00:01:16.710> possibilities<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:18.000> now<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.140> each<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
many possibilities here now in each of

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.130 
many possibilities here now in each of
these<00:01:19.740> cases<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.670> some<00:01:20.939> irregular<00:01:21.600> part

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
these cases there is some irregular part

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.899 
these cases there is some irregular part
to<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> structure

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
to the structure

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.969 
to the structure
so<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.719> loops<00:01:25.020> connecting<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> alpha

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
so we have loops connecting the alpha

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.950 
so we have loops connecting the alpha
helixes<00:01:26.399> here<00:01:26.850> these<00:01:27.030> are<00:01:27.149> the<00:01:27.270> green<00:01:27.539> ribbons

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
helixes here these are the green ribbons

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440 
helixes here these are the green ribbons
here<00:01:28.409> also<00:01:28.740> loops<00:01:29.579> connecting<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.240> beta

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
here also loops connecting the beta

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.649 
here also loops connecting the beta
strands<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:32.009> these<00:01:32.189> are<00:01:32.460> not<00:01:32.700> disordered

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
strands now these are not disordered

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.139 
strands now these are not disordered
they're<00:01:34.170> simply<00:01:34.680> irregular<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.789> to<00:01:35.970> say

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
they're simply irregular that is to say

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.880 
they're simply irregular that is to say
they<00:01:36.299> don't<00:01:36.420> fit<00:01:36.780> into<00:01:36.929> a<00:01:37.079> pattern<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.710> an

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
they don't fit into a pattern like an

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.340 
they don't fit into a pattern like an
alpha<00:01:38.250> helixes<00:01:38.759> or<00:01:38.969> a<00:01:39.000> beta<00:01:39.210> sheet<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:40.229> it's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
alpha helixes or a beta sheet but it's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.800 
alpha helixes or a beta sheet but it's
part<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.920> regular<00:01:41.460> ordered<00:01:42.090> structure<00:01:42.720> of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
part of the regular ordered structure of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.929 
part of the regular ordered structure of
the<00:01:42.899> protein<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the protein and we know that because it

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.300 
the protein and we know that because it
always<00:01:45.450> folds<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.439> same<00:01:46.679> way<00:01:46.710> they

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
always folds up in the same way they

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.029 
always folds up in the same way they
fold<00:01:47.549> up<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.909> very<00:01:48.149> specific<00:01:48.450> very<00:01:49.319> consistent

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
fold up in very specific very consistent

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.940 
fold up in very specific very consistent
ways<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.179> means<00:01:51.569> that<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.350> fold<00:01:52.649> is

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950

very<00:02:26.040> much<00:02:26.340> solvent<00:02:26.790> exposed<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:28.410> find

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
very much solvent exposed so we find

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.199 
very much solvent exposed so we find
that<00:02:28.799> this<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.040> driven<00:02:29.370> not<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:29.880> much<00:02:30.030> by

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
that this is driven not so much by

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.900 
that this is driven not so much by
hydrogen<00:02:30.810> bonding<00:02:31.170> as<00:02:31.350> by<00:02:31.859> that<00:02:32.100> hydrophobic

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
hydrogen bonding as by that hydrophobic

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.360 
hydrogen bonding as by that hydrophobic
effect<00:02:33.269> so<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.930> has<00:02:34.109> a<00:02:34.140> great<00:02:34.410> impact<00:02:34.590> on

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.729

almost<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.390> biological<00:02:36.870> molecules

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739

we<00:02:40.829> find<00:02:41.069> proteins<00:02:41.549> can<00:02:41.819> fold<00:02:42.060> up<00:02:42.209> into

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
we find proteins can fold up into

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.449 
we find proteins can fold up into
distinct<00:02:43.019> domains<00:02:43.530> even<00:02:43.829> within<00:02:44.189> the<00:02:44.430> same

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459

distinct domains even within the same
polypeptide<00:02:45.450> chain<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.079> this<00:02:46.469> is<00:02:46.650> often

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
polypeptide chain and this is often

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.740

because<00:02:47.189> different<00:02:47.909> domains<00:02:48.299> within<00:02:48.659> the

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
because different domains within the

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:51.689 
same protein have different functions so

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.509 
same protein have different functions so
here<00:02:51.989> in<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.409> we<00:02:52.620> have<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.799> single<00:02:53.189> polypeptide
