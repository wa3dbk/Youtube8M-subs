all right that's what naturally happens
with<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:47.399> beta<00:00:47.670> builds<00:00:48.089> they<00:00:48.600> rise<00:00:48.870> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
with these beta builds they rise and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.259 
with these beta builds they rise and
fall<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.769> ebb<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.100> flow<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.609> they<00:00:50.879> are<00:00:51.089> as

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
fall and ebb and flow as they are as

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.419 
fall and ebb and flow as they are as
they're<00:00:51.569> released<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.739> new<00:00:52.979> ones<00:00:53.190> come

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
they're released and as new ones come

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:54.799 
they're released and as new ones come
onto<00:00:53.609> the<00:00:53.640> horizon<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.239> there's<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.479> couple<00:00:54.719> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
onto the horizon and there's a couple of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.479 
onto the horizon and there's a couple of
other<00:00:54.929> reasons<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.319> are<00:00:55.469> equally<00:00:55.949> important

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
other reasons that are equally important

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.309 
other reasons that are equally important
and<00:00:56.999> so<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.420> you've<00:00:57.600> been<00:00:57.749> living<00:00:57.929> under<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
and so if you've been living under a

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:59.750 
and so if you've been living under a
rock<00:00:58.409> you<00:00:58.769> might<00:00:58.979> not<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.249> realized<00:00:59.460> that

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
rock you might not have realized that

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.989 
rock you might not have realized that
battlefield<00:01:00.179> 3<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> modern<00:01:01.920> warfare<00:01:02.100> 3<00:01:02.309> were

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
battlefield 3 and modern warfare 3 were

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.679 
battlefield 3 and modern warfare 3 were
released<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> first<00:01:04.409> few<00:01:04.769> weeks<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.689> also

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
released in the first few weeks and also

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.719 
released in the first few weeks and also
even<00:01:06.719> bigger<00:01:07.649> than<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> guess<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
even bigger than that I guess is that

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.450 
even bigger than that I guess is that
Skyrim<00:01:09.719> was<00:01:09.899> released<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.799> looking<00:01:11.250> down

everyone's just playing these other
games<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:23.130> clear<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.610> they've

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
games and that's clear because they've

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.160 
games and that's clear because they've
just<00:01:24.000> been<00:01:24.119> released<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.600> their<00:01:24.719> awesome

games so on that's where everyone's out
and<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> final<00:01:28.469> reason<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> lack<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.789> NSO

new one got a whole lot of hardware
order<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:41.219> starting<00:01:41.609> to<00:01:41.640> put<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.000> all

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
order and starting to put it all

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.789 
order and starting to put it all
together<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> aim<00:01:43.079> behind<00:01:43.289> that<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
together and the aim behind that is to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.919 
together and the aim behind that is to
get<00:01:44.039> you<00:01:44.189> guys<00:01:44.429> probably<00:01:44.700> more<00:01:45.030> jet<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.780> you

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
get you guys probably more jet get you

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.649 
get you guys probably more jet get you
guys<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.170> videos<00:01:46.679> so<00:01:47.240> contrary<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.479> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
guys more videos so contrary to what you

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.569 
guys more videos so contrary to what you
might<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.929> thinking<00:01:49.109> and<00:01:49.679> that<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.979> well<00:01:50.340> when

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
might be thinking and that is well when

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.919 
might be thinking and that is well when
is<00:01:50.700> 2<00:01:50.820> HD<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.270> putting<00:01:51.479> any<00:01:51.600> videos

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
is 2 HD is not putting any videos

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.139 
is 2 HD is not putting any videos
therefore<00:01:52.799> he's<00:01:52.950> giving<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.609> or<00:01:53.789> something

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
therefore he's giving up or something

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.300 
therefore he's giving up or something
it's<00:01:54.899> absolutely<00:01:55.020> quite<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> opposite<00:01:55.859> I'm

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it's absolutely quite the opposite I'm

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.950 
it's absolutely quite the opposite I'm
investing<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.880> lot<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.299> my<00:01:57.390> own<00:01:57.539> money<00:01:57.719> in

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
investing a lot of my own money in

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.980 
investing a lot of my own money in
putting<00:01:58.409> together<00:01:58.499> a<00:01:58.710> raging<00:01:59.670> rig<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.570> be<00:02:00.600> able

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
putting together a raging rig to be able

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.160 
putting together a raging rig to be able
to<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.520> guys<00:02:02.759> are<00:02:03.090> more<00:02:03.359> videos<00:02:03.780> by

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
to get you guys are more videos by

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.050 
to get you guys are more videos by
faster<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.070> that's<00:02:05.249> what's<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
faster so that's what's going on it's a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.789 
faster so that's what's going on it's a
combination<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.719> all<00:02:06.810> those<00:02:06.929> reasons<00:02:07.140> why<00:02:07.499> in

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
combination of all those reasons why in

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.609 
combination of all those reasons why in
sh<00:02:08.550> t<00:02:08.729> is<00:02:08.849> slow

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
sh t is slow

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.589 
sh t is slow
at<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.190> moment<00:02:10.369> but<00:02:10.670> of<00:02:10.789> course<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.150> will<00:02:11.269> pick

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
at the moment but of course it will pick

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.410 
at the moment but of course it will pick
up<00:02:11.720> again<00:02:11.989> as<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.379> always<00:02:12.650> does<00:02:13.099> as<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:14.180> has

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
up again as it always does as it has

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.899 
up again as it always does as it has
over<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> past<00:02:15.170> year<00:02:15.409> and<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.530> half<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.159> don't

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
over the past year and a half so don't

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.330 
over the past year and a half so don't
worry<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.390> will<00:02:17.750> happen<00:02:18.290> anyway<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.860> think<00:02:19.040> I'll

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
worry it will happen anyway I think I'll

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.680 
worry it will happen anyway I think I'll
