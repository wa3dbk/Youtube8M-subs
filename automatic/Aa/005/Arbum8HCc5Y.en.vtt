00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.949 

it's<00:01:46.619> got<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> complete<00:01:47.189> motor<00:01:47.429> I<00:01:47.959> haven't

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
it's got a complete motor I haven't

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.859 
it's got a complete motor I haven't
tried<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.229> start<00:01:49.529> it<00:01:49.759> it's<00:01:50.759> not<00:01:50.909> seized<00:01:51.270> or

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
tried to start it it's not seized or

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.620 
tried to start it it's not seized or
anything<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.969> seriously<00:01:53.969> doubt<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.509> kind

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
anything but I seriously doubt it's kind

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.480 
anything but I seriously doubt it's kind
of<00:01:54.659> run<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.670> some<00:01:57.889> daylight<00:01:58.889> I<00:01:59.130> think

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
of run you can see some daylight I think

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.440 
of run you can see some daylight I think
through<00:01:59.700> their<00:01:59.849> own<00:01:59.999> maybe<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:02.209> but<00:02:03.209> there's

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
through their own maybe not but there's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.160 
through their own maybe not but there's
a<00:02:03.509> lot<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.689> rust<00:02:05.659> obviously<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> lot<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.899> rust

the tube the convertible top hardware

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.670 
the tube the convertible top hardware
seems<00:02:43.609> to<00:02:43.760> all<00:02:43.879> be<00:02:44.060> in<00:02:44.090> place<00:02:45.790> maybe<00:02:46.790> missing<00:02:47.180> a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
seems to all be in place maybe missing a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.259 
seems to all be in place maybe missing a
natural<00:02:48.680> bolt<00:02:48.890> here<00:02:49.459> there<00:02:49.700> but<00:02:49.849> I<00:02:49.879> think<00:02:50.150> all

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
natural bolt here there but I think all

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.229 
natural bolt here there but I think all
of<00:02:50.299> that<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:51.290> main<00:02:51.470> components<00:02:52.069> are<00:02:52.189> there

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:06.690 

the<00:02:56.239> steering<00:02:56.569> wheels<00:02:56.750> in<00:02:56.959> good<00:02:57.109> shape<00:03:02.049> gauges

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:16.089 

radio<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.720> by<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.930> time<00:03:15.079> you<00:03:15.290> get<00:03:15.470> here<00:03:15.769> to

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
radio so by the time you get here to

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.220 
radio so by the time you get here to
drop<00:03:16.310> off<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.579> 71<00:03:17.359> I'm<00:03:17.689> gonna<00:03:17.930> have<00:03:18.079> this

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
drop off that 71 I'm gonna have this

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.530 
drop off that 71 I'm gonna have this
thing<00:03:18.700> emptied<00:03:19.700> out<00:03:19.849> a<00:03:19.879> bit<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.299> can<00:03:20.420> get<00:03:20.510> a

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
thing emptied out a bit so you can get a

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.129 
thing emptied out a bit so you can get a
better<00:03:20.689> look<00:03:20.810> at<00:03:21.109> the<00:03:21.230> inside<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.590> it

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.390 

but<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:28.370> can<00:03:28.519> already<00:03:28.700> tell<00:03:28.819> it's<00:03:30.099> it's<00:03:31.099> kind

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
but you can already tell it's it's kind

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.009 
but you can already tell it's it's kind
of<00:03:31.459> a<00:03:31.579> 50/50<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.299> don't<00:03:32.510> really<00:03:32.660> know<00:03:32.810> whether

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
of a 50/50 I don't really know whether

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.409 
of a 50/50 I don't really know whether
to<00:03:33.230> try<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.280> restore<00:03:34.639> it<00:03:34.819> or<00:03:34.910> just<00:03:35.060> part<00:03:35.329> it

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
to try and restore it or just part it

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.289 
to try and restore it or just part it
out<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:37.430> that's<00:03:37.609> where<00:03:37.760> I'd<00:03:37.879> kind<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.150> like

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
out and that's where I'd kind of like

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.440 
out and that's where I'd kind of like
your<00:03:38.480> expertise<00:03:39.019> on<00:03:39.260> it
