the size I mean they like to say this

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.119 
the size I mean they like to say this
it's<00:00:48.090> about<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.450> size<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.899> an<00:00:49.020> iPhone<00:00:49.260> 5<00:00:49.920> in

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
it's about the size of an iPhone 5 in

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.680 
it's about the size of an iPhone 5 in
terms<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> amount<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.000> space<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.420> takes<00:00:51.510> up

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
terms of the amount of space it takes up

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.720 
terms of the amount of space it takes up
on<00:00:51.840> your<00:00:51.960> desk<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.379> obviously<00:00:52.860> it's<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.610> little

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
on your desk but obviously it's a little

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.970 
on your desk but obviously it's a little
bit<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> thicker<00:00:54.719> side<00:00:54.870> compared<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> an

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
bit on the thicker side compared to an

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.650 
bit on the thicker side compared to an
iPhone<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> guess<00:00:57.000> they're<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.420> about

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660

iPhone but I guess they're right about
it<00:00:57.840> being<00:00:57.870> about<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.440> size<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.039> has<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.190> metal

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
it being about that size it has a metal

do the listening tests I should probably

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.010 
do the listening tests I should probably

that you can actually charge the thing

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.740 
that you can actually charge the thing
alright<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:06.580> if<00:03:06.670> you've<00:03:06.850> ever<00:03:07.180> paired<00:03:07.630> a

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.750 
alright so if you've ever paired a
Bluetooth<00:03:08.170> device<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.560> anything<00:03:09.220> then<00:03:09.459> you'll

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
Bluetooth device to anything then you'll

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.720 
Bluetooth device to anything then you'll
be<00:03:09.880> able<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.120> set<00:03:10.300> this<00:03:10.450> up<00:03:10.510> fairly<00:03:10.930> easily<00:03:11.050> I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
be able to set this up fairly easily I

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.210 
be able to set this up fairly easily I
realized<00:03:12.730> very<00:03:12.970> early<00:03:13.420> actually<00:03:14.110> once<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:15.040> was

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
realized very early actually once I was

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.190 
realized very early actually once I was
listening<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.850> thing<00:03:16.090> why<00:03:16.510> they<00:03:17.020> went

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
listening to the thing why they went

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.590 
listening to the thing why they went
with<00:03:17.380> such<00:03:17.709> Vickey<00:03:18.610> rubber<00:03:18.910> for<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.269> bottom

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
with such Vickey rubber for the bottom

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.870 
with such Vickey rubber for the bottom
and<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.810> reason<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.709> if<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.489> allowed

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
and the reason is that if it is allowed

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.520 
and the reason is that if it is allowed
to<00:03:21.910> vibrate<00:03:22.630> on<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.900> surface<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.380> it's

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
to vibrate on the surface that it's

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.190 
to vibrate on the surface that it's
sitting<00:03:23.800> on<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.130> significantly<00:03:24.970> degrades<00:03:25.600> the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
sitting on it significantly degrades the

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.170 
sitting on it significantly degrades the
listening<00:03:26.530> experience<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.820> fact<00:03:28.060> that

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
listening experience so the fact that

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.150 
listening experience so the fact that
they<00:03:28.390> put<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.989> care<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.380> attention<00:03:29.500> into

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
they put the care and attention into

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.220 
they put the care and attention into
doing<00:03:30.400> something<00:03:30.640> like<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:30.940> means<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.840> lot<00:03:32.050> to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
doing something like that means a lot to

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.710 
doing something like that means a lot to
me<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.590> does<00:03:32.950> sound<00:03:33.580> particularly<00:03:34.090> at<00:03:34.480> about

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
me it does sound particularly at about

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.949 
me it does sound particularly at about
70<00:03:35.140> to<00:03:35.230> 80<00:03:35.260> percent<00:03:35.709> volume<00:03:36.310> better<00:03:37.180> balanced

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
70 to 80 percent volume better balanced

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.570 
70 to 80 percent volume better balanced
than<00:03:38.290> something<00:03:38.530> like<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.800> ultimate<00:03:39.310> ears

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
than something like the ultimate ears

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.040 
than something like the ultimate ears
boom<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:40.090> I'm<00:03:40.150> gonna<00:03:40.269> stick<00:03:40.510> with<00:03:40.630> this<00:03:40.810> for

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
boom and I'm gonna stick with this for

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.420 
boom and I'm gonna stick with this for
the<00:03:41.110> main<00:03:41.260> point<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.620> comparison<00:03:41.950> just

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
the main point of comparison just

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.800 
the main point of comparison just
because<00:03:42.730> we<00:03:42.880> feel<00:03:43.060> it's<00:03:43.239> pretty<00:03:43.450> similar<00:03:43.780> to

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
because we feel it's pretty similar to

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.930 
because we feel it's pretty similar to
the<00:03:44.019> sp1<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.769> it's<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.370> much<00:03:45.519> more<00:03:45.700> mainstream

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
the sp1 and it's a much more mainstream

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.550 
the sp1 and it's a much more mainstream
brand<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:46.660> you're<00:03:46.810> more<00:03:46.930> likely<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.290> have<00:03:47.530> a

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
brand so you're more likely to have a

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.229 
brand so you're more likely to have a
point<00:03:47.860> of<00:03:47.920> reference<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.250> mean<00:03:48.400> okay<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:48.910> for

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
point of reference I mean okay so for

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.910 
point of reference I mean okay so for
context<00:03:49.720> jam<00:03:49.930> box<00:03:50.140> by<00:03:50.320> jawbone<00:03:50.560> there's

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
context jam box by jawbone there's

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.259 
context jam box by jawbone there's
nowhere<00:03:51.130> near<00:03:51.280> any<00:03:51.430> of<00:03:51.580> these<00:03:51.610> things<00:03:51.880> like

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
nowhere near any of these things like

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.600 
nowhere near any of these things like
like<00:03:52.510> not<00:03:52.690> anything<00:03:52.810> not<00:03:53.140> even<00:03:53.320> close<00:03:53.470> so<00:03:53.739> it

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
like not anything not even close so it

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.670 
like not anything not even close so it
was<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:54.820> more<00:03:55.090> balanced<00:03:55.750> overall<00:03:56.170> sound<00:03:56.440> with

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
was a more balanced overall sound with

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.110 
was a more balanced overall sound with

respect to highs mids and lows we're

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.880 
respect to highs mids and lows we're
still<00:03:58.330> talking<00:03:58.660> about<00:03:58.720> tiny<00:03:59.110> drivers<00:03:59.590> inside

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
still talking about tiny drivers inside

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.440 
still talking about tiny drivers inside
a<00:03:59.920> tiny<00:04:00.130> enclosure<00:04:00.489> that's<00:04:00.700> battery<00:04:01.060> powered

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
a tiny enclosure that's battery powered

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.900 
a tiny enclosure that's battery powered
but<00:04:01.989> better<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.860> still<00:04:03.190> better<00:04:03.430> with<00:04:03.730> that

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
but better is still better with that

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.120 
but better is still better with that
said<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.480> doesn't<00:04:04.930> get<00:04:05.050> as<00:04:05.170> loud<00:04:05.470> as<00:04:05.709> the<00:04:05.920> boom

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
said it doesn't get as loud as the boom

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.550 
said it doesn't get as loud as the boom
not<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.640> lot<00:04:07.090> quieter<00:04:07.420> but<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.110> little<00:04:08.440> bit

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
not a lot quieter but a little bit

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.190 
not a lot quieter but a little bit
quieter<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.340> found<00:04:09.640> that<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.360> quality<00:04:10.810> of

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
quieter and I found that the quality of

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.380 
quieter and I found that the quality of
the<00:04:11.350> sound<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.709> more<00:04:11.980> dependent<00:04:12.370> on<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:13.090> the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
the sound is more dependent on the the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.420 
the sound is more dependent on the the
directionality<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.739> way<00:04:15.130> that<00:04:15.160> it's

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
directionality of it the way that it's

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.550 
directionality of it the way that it's
facing<00:04:15.670> so<00:04:16.269> if<00:04:16.330> you<00:04:16.450> were<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.660> put<00:04:16.900> this<00:04:17.080> sort

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
facing so if you were to put this sort

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.719 
facing so if you were to put this sort
of<00:04:17.650> in<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.830> middle<00:04:18.100> of<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.310> room<00:04:18.489> where<00:04:18.700> people

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
of in the middle of a room where people

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.219 
of in the middle of a room where people
are<00:04:18.940> gonna<00:04:19.090> be<00:04:19.239> all<00:04:19.390> around<00:04:19.570> it<00:04:19.930> something

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
are gonna be all around it something

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.110 
are gonna be all around it something
like<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.500> boom<00:04:20.709> might<00:04:20.950> perform<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.520> little<00:04:21.850> bit

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
like the boom might perform a little bit

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.320 
like the boom might perform a little bit
better<00:04:22.180> from<00:04:23.020> behind<00:04:23.350> whereas<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.880> simple

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
better from behind whereas the simple

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.970 
better from behind whereas the simple
audio<00:04:25.419> go<00:04:25.930> will<00:04:26.440> be<00:04:26.470> more<00:04:26.740> sad

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
audio go will be more sad

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.560 
audio go will be more sad
spying<00:04:27.280> in<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.550> corner<00:04:27.880> of<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.150> room<00:04:28.180> where

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.200 
people happen to be or at the beach
you'd<00:04:30.280> want<00:04:30.460> it<00:04:30.550> kind<00:04:30.700> of<00:04:30.760> in<00:04:30.880> front<00:04:31.030> of

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
you'd want it kind of in front of

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.970 
you'd want it kind of in front of
everyone<00:04:31.540> as<00:04:31.690> opposed<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.140> right<00:04:32.740> in<00:04:32.890> the

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
middle of the group one thing that's

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.630 
middle of the group one thing that's
cool<00:04:34.930> is<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.440> does<00:04:35.680> tie<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.100> volume

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
cool is that it does tie the volume

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.880 
cool is that it does tie the volume

there's actually quite a wide variety of
them<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.570> think<00:04:53.200> that's<00:04:53.380> pretty<00:04:53.620> much<00:04:53.800> all

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980
