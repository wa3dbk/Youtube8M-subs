00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
out okay I see how it is so anyways we

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.550 
out okay I see how it is so anyways we
order<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.689> security<00:01:37.110> guy<00:01:37.259> didn't

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560

really say anything after that so he

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.359 
really say anything after that so he
probably<00:01:40.320> think<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.920> don't<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.189> any

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
probably think that we don't have any

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.929 
probably think that we don't have any
money<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.930> yeah<00:01:43.070> why<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.130> their<00:01:44.430> cultural

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
money so yeah why is their cultural

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.710 
money so yeah why is their cultural
separation<00:01:45.689> between<00:01:46.560> bill<00:01:47.280> ms<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.909> filipinos

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
separation between bill ms and filipinos

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.530 
separation between bill ms and filipinos
new<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> US<00:01:49.939> well<00:01:50.939> i<00:01:50.970> think<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
new in the US well i think that's a

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.359 
new in the US well i think that's a
cultural<00:01:51.930> separate<00:01:52.320> us<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.829> grew<00:01:53.009> up<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.280> a

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
cultural separate us we grew up in a

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.709 
cultural separate us we grew up in a
different<00:01:53.399> environment<00:01:55.340> you<00:01:56.340> know<00:01:56.719> they're

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
different environment you know they're

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.109 
different environment you know they're
in<00:01:57.840> America<00:01:58.320> we're<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> Philippines<00:01:59.189> so

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
in America we're in the Philippines so

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.719 
in America we're in the Philippines so
we<00:02:00.390> expect<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.960> our<00:02:01.439> upbringing<00:02:02.430> is

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
we expect that our upbringing is

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.149 
we expect that our upbringing is
slightly<00:02:03.390> different<00:02:03.689> or<00:02:04.079> maybe<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.950> big

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
slightly different or maybe it's a big
