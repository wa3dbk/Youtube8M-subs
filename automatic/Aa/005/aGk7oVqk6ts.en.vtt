00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
going to start by removing these seven

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.929 
going to start by removing these seven
screws<00:01:04.379> there's<00:01:04.979> one<00:01:05.339> right<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:06.200> here<00:01:07.200> here

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
screws there's one right here here here

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
screws there's one right here here here
same<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.180> side<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.689> then<00:01:10.229> there's<00:01:10.409> one

right behind this sticker so just peel

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.280 
right behind this sticker so just peel
it<00:01:13.799> up<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:16.049> bit

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it up and then you can get and this bit

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.420 
it up and then you can get and this bit
is<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.470> Torx<00:01:17.130> t8<00:01:18.650> it's<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.040> security

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
is a Torx t8 it's actually a security

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.760 
is a Torx t8 it's actually a security
bit<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.729> has<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.049> hole<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.409> end<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
bit it has a hole in the end of the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.840 
bit it has a hole in the end of the
driver<00:01:23.009> here<00:01:24.200> probably<00:01:25.200> can't<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.850> but

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
driver here probably can't see that but

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.460 
driver here probably can't see that but
there's<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.869> hole<00:01:28.080> there<00:01:28.110> these<00:01:29.100> screws<00:01:29.490> have

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
there's a hole there these screws have

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:39.140 
there's a hole there these screws have
little<00:01:31.470> prongs<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:35.430> can't<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:38.150> yeah

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150

don't worry all right you can't I
usually<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.299> break<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.780> off<00:01:42.930> with<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> really

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
usually just break it off with a really

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.179 
usually just break it off with a really
small<00:01:43.680> flat<00:01:44.490> head<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:46.320> sent<00:01:46.619> me<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.890> in

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
small flat head but they sent me this in

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
small flat head but they sent me this in
package<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.689> now<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> don't<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.320> worry

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
package so now I don't have to worry

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.810 
package so now I don't have to worry
about<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.420> get<00:01:51.420> these<00:01:51.540> undone<00:01:52.340> okay<00:01:53.340> screws

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
about it I get these undone okay screws

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
about it I get these undone okay screws
removed<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:56.759> controller<00:01:57.469> comes<00:01:58.469> apart

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
removed and the controller comes apart

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.160 
removed and the controller comes apart
like<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.509> all<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.689> buttons<00:02:00.930> are<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
like this all the buttons are going to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:12.930 
like this all the buttons are going to
fall<00:02:01.350> out<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:02.130> worry<00:02:02.250> about<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:04.040> okay

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:25.720 

so<00:02:13.940> I'm<00:02:14.060> solid<00:02:14.420> somewhere<00:02:20.470> all<00:02:21.470> right<00:02:24.730> pretty

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
so I'm solid somewhere all right pretty

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.630 
so I'm solid somewhere all right pretty
sure<00:02:26.000> they<00:02:26.209> actually<00:02:26.630> sent<00:02:26.959> me<00:02:27.110> an<00:02:27.640> old

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
sure they actually sent me an old

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.949 
sure they actually sent me an old
version<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.120> controller<00:02:29.510> it's<00:02:29.720> not<00:02:29.840> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
version the controller it's not the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.320 
version the controller it's not the
matrix<00:02:30.319> version<00:02:30.680> would<00:02:30.830> have<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.330> block

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
matrix version would have a block

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.199 
matrix version would have a block
resistor<00:02:32.870> right<00:02:33.110> up<00:02:33.319> there<00:02:36.489> but<00:02:37.489> apparently

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
resistor right up there but apparently

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.850 
resistor right up there but apparently
it's<00:02:38.840> never<00:02:38.989> going<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.230> i'm<00:02:39.380> not<00:02:39.500> too<00:02:39.650> worried

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
it's never going to i'm not too worried

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.259 
it's never going to i'm not too worried
about<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:41.420> still<00:02:41.840> new<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:42.970> just<00:02:43.970> take<00:02:44.120> that

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
about it is still new I just take that

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.229 
about it is still new I just take that
off<00:02:45.280> some<00:02:46.280> letters<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:47.510> kind<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.840> lift<00:02:48.050> it<00:02:48.230> up

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
off some letters just kind of lift it up

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.259 
off some letters just kind of lift it up
out<00:02:50.239> of<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.390> case<00:02:54.430> come<00:02:55.430> on<00:02:55.580> and<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:55.880> one<00:02:56.060> hand

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
out of the case come on and do one hand

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.040 
out of the case come on and do one hand
in<00:02:56.390> there<00:02:56.569> it<00:02:56.660> goes<00:02:58.120> all<00:02:59.120> right<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.480> can<00:02:59.510> set

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
in there it goes all right you can set

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.400 
in there it goes all right you can set
these<00:03:00.230> side<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.890> not<00:03:01.250> need<00:03:01.489> them<00:03:02.140> except<00:03:03.140> for

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
these side and not need them except for

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:11.670 
these side and not need them except for
make<00:03:03.950> sure<00:03:05.019> get<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.760> don't<00:03:07.760> need<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:09.370> okay

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
make sure get that don't need that okay

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.930 
make sure get that don't need that okay
next<00:03:12.680> let<00:03:13.459> replace<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:15.430> triggers<00:03:16.430> first

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
next let replace the triggers first

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.729 
next let replace the triggers first
it'll<00:03:17.360> be<00:03:17.540> easier<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.110> way<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:19.549> have<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
it'll be easier that way so have the

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:36.539 
it'll be easier that way so have the
smoke<00:03:21.739> colored<00:03:24.640> triggers<00:03:33.609> so<00:03:34.959> replace<00:03:35.959> this

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
smoke colored triggers so replace this

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.270 
smoke colored triggers so replace this
whole<00:03:37.549> second<00:03:38.560> okay<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:39.620> I've<00:03:39.829> already<00:03:39.950> remove

the rest of this will slide forward

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.279 
the rest of this will slide forward
where<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:15.950> can<00:04:16.419> kind<00:04:17.419> of<00:04:17.539> grab<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.900> spring

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
where you can kind of grab the spring
