 Korea Meteorological Administration and Korean Model Numerical App 5 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.660
 Held 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.439
 Hi all around the US Weather 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.759
 I've already been in 3 weeks in July. I am on the hottest corridor of the year 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.710
 I'm here. 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:36.450
 Chobok duplicated in Lunar June to adoring spacing between July Malbok into three so 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.480
 In order to supplement your physical strength, 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.310
 You can think of a lot of 3 papas in a bar. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.290
 But calories per serving is 930 calories, half of the recommended daily amount for an adult woman 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.360
 It's close to the level. 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:56.280
 Packed in a high-calorie, but out of this camp you like about 4p a burden boyangshik the summer 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.280
 Why do not you try some soy sauce that will help you regain your energy ? 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.739
 Even a knife in and around Eve Calories. 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:10.200
 You can do that while high-protein supplement their water to Hong broth 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:13.110
 Also, if shed a lot of land, lack of water and a typical seasonal fruits watermelon 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.920
 It is good to supplement minerals 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.060
 In addition , to recover fatigue in the summer to eat a lot of vitamins 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.009
 It's important. 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:28.170
 Half of the tomatoes contain a recommended daily dose of vitamin c 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.450
 It is necessary to have a summer meal in summer but it is rather high in calories. 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.990
 It might make a problem of surplus am 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.229
 I hope you have a healthy summer with a clever baby meal. 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.999
 The third week of July Weather 5 Starts the news 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:46.229
 July 16 Meteorological Agency and Korean Type Numerical Forecasting Model Development Project 2 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:50.969
 Policy briefing was held at the Meteorological Agency's spokesman's office 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.459
 This policy briefing is the result of the Korean Sochi e-Bo model development and future plans 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:57.959
 It was conducted under the theme of " 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:02:03.119
 I announced the development status and prospects of the Korean model 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:08.340
 When this model is completed, it is possible to obtain a unique numerical value suitable for delay and weather conditions in Korea . 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:13.349
 The model can overcome the limitations of foreign numerical models, 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:18.209
 I believe that it will contribute to the upbringing and creation of related industry jobs. 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:22.980
 In addition, industrial land is a finite number of Hongseong beam model development of the Korean figure 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:29.210
 Contributing to Korea's weather development and providing better weather information to the people 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.210
 I hope that the efforts of the Korea Meteorological Administration 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.900
 tool 5 lead lead 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.390
