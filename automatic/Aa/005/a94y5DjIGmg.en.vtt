wonderful sound not too too bright how
that<00:00:28.080> happens<00:00:28.439> eq'd<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.760> bass<00:00:29.910> drum

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179

specifically okay but you can try these
things<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.369> other<00:00:32.550> things<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.910> maybe<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> cello

nature<00:00:39.540> okay<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:41.010> 602<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.700> 602<00:00:42.739> now<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:44.100> think

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
nature okay this 602 of 602 now I think

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.240 
nature okay this 602 of 602 now I think
I'm<00:00:44.640> thinking<00:00:44.879> about<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.210> bass<00:00:45.420> drum<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:46.039> new<00:00:47.039> one

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
I'm thinking about a bass drum a new one

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.380 
I'm thinking about a bass drum a new one
that<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:49.170> e<00:00:49.219> 901<00:00:50.219> now<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.149> was<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that we have is the e 901 now this was a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
that we have is the e 901 now this was a
condenser<00:00:51.989> microphone<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.710> need<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> send

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
condenser microphone so you need to send

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.360 
condenser microphone so you need to send
48<00:00:53.879> phantom<00:00:54.270> into<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.980> very

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
48 phantom into this one so it's a very

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.290 
48 phantom into this one so it's a very
sensitive

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
sensitive

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.229 
sensitive
it's<00:00:57.899> eq'd<00:00:58.379> from<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> bass<00:00:58.920> drum<00:00:59.250> what<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> like

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
it's eq'd from the bass drum what I like

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.000 
it's eq'd from the bass drum what I like
about<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.260> lay<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.590> one

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
about this one is I can lay this one

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
about this one is I can lay this one
right<00:01:02.280> into<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> bass<00:01:02.879> drum<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.170> want

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
right into a bass drum and if I want

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.050 
right into a bass drum and if I want
more<00:01:04.530> attack<00:01:04.890> I'll<00:01:05.189> get<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.430> closer<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.909> them

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
more attack I'll get it closer to them

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.730 
more attack I'll get it closer to them
through<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> mallet<00:01:06.720> somewhat<00:01:07.260> less<00:01:07.439> attack

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
through the mallet somewhat less attack

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.950 
through the mallet somewhat less attack
I'll<00:01:07.920> pull<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.130> back<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.760> lot<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> times<00:01:09.600> what

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
I'll pull it back a lot of times what

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.230 
I'll pull it back a lot of times what
I'll<00:01:10.049> do<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.409> I'll<00:01:10.560> take<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.979> one<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
I'll do is I'll take this one and the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
I'll do is I'll take this one and the
combination<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.049> one<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.130> I

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
combination of this one as well so I

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
combination of this one as well so I
have<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> sound<00:01:15.090> hole<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.840> then

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
have this one at the sound hole and then

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.929 
have this one at the sound hole and then
this<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.320> I'll<00:01:16.380> put<00:01:16.650> inside<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.490> bass<00:01:17.670> drum

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
this one I'll put inside the bass drum

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.870 
this one I'll put inside the bass drum
and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:19.220> separate<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> word<00:01:20.549> where<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and then separate in the word where it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
and then separate in the word where it
sounds<00:01:21.030> best<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.409> got<00:01:22.680> two

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
sounds best and then I got two

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.300 
sounds best and then I got two
microphones<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.060> drum<00:01:24.299> Oh

microphones on that on that drum Oh
change<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.430> levels<00:01:26.880> accordingly<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.600> see

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
change of levels accordingly to see

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.899 
change of levels accordingly to see
what's<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.200> mix<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> bass<00:01:28.740> together<00:01:29.040> so

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
what's going to mix the bass together so

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.580 
what's going to mix the bass together so
a<00:01:29.939> great<00:01:30.240> way<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:31.049> what's<00:01:31.409> nice<00:01:31.530> about

a great way to go now what's nice about

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.700 
a great way to go now what's nice about
this<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.189> too<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.780> some<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> competition

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
this one too is some of the competition

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.490 
this one too is some of the competition
have<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.130> free<00:01:35.600> ta<00:01:36.600> 3<00:01:36.960> connector<00:01:37.380> on

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
have a little free ta 3 connector on

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.130 
have a little free ta 3 connector on
here<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:38.700> were<00:01:38.790> able<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> electronics

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
here we were able to do the electronics

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.620 
here we were able to do the electronics
inside<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.220> put<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> full<00:01:41.729> XLR<00:01:42.270> into

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
inside it so you can put a full XLR into

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.870 
inside it so you can put a full XLR into
the<00:01:42.750> back<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> send<00:01:43.799> 48<00:01:44.159> them<00:01:44.520> into<00:01:44.729> it

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the back of it and send 48 them into it

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.969 
the back of it and send 48 them into it
this<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> pressure<00:01:45.930> zone<00:01:46.229> microphone<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
this is a pressure zone microphone the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.350 
this is a pressure zone microphone the
pressures<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.460> microphone<00:01:47.909> means<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
pressures on microphone means that

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.510 
pressures on microphone means that
there's<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> capsule<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.500> here<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.220> instead<00:01:50.460> of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
there's a capsule in here and instead of

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.690 
there's a capsule in here and instead of
flat<00:01:50.759> plate<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> lot<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.700> frequencies

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
flat plate so a lot of the frequencies

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.830 
flat plate so a lot of the frequencies
that<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.820> coming<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.240> from<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.450> bass<00:01:54.600> drum

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that are coming in from the bass drum

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.749 
that are coming in from the bass drum
are<00:01:54.990> coming<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.500> bouncing<00:01:56.189> off<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.340> plate

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
are coming in bouncing off that plate

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.910 
are coming in bouncing off that plate
and<00:01:57.030> coming<00:01:57.540> into<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> castle<00:01:58.320> okay<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
and coming into the castle okay and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.410 
and coming into the castle okay and
that's<00:01:59.070> how<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.250> pressure<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.790> microphone

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
that's how the pressure is on microphone

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.990 
that's how the pressure is on microphone
works<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> very<00:02:01.380> efficient<00:02:01.860> system<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
works it's a very efficient system and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.590 
works it's a very efficient system and
gives<00:02:03.180> you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
gives you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.990 
gives you
again
