00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
but that's so important people don't

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.740 
but that's so important people don't
really<00:03:20.060> think<00:03:20.180> about<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.450> um<00:03:22.389> wash<00:03:23.389> your<00:03:23.599> face

after you work out I think that's pretty
common<00:03:26.870> sense<00:03:27.260> but<00:03:28.569> yeah<00:03:29.569> just<00:03:29.900> in<00:03:30.019> case<00:03:30.049> you

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
common sense but yeah just in case you

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.780 
common sense but yeah just in case you
didn't<00:03:30.799> think<00:03:30.889> about<00:03:31.010> that's<00:03:31.370> important<00:03:33.790> oh

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
didn't think about that's important oh

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.809 
didn't think about that's important oh
