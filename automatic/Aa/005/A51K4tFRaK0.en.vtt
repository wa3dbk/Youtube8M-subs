00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.390
 to bring you the balance of the 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.220
 attributes we will only see few because if 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.690
 they want the whole list would be the video very 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.540
 long so the one who wants it completes 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.280
 is in the inscription with the link to 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.260
 the facebook page of james that are 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.820
 all is that we are going to it for 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.230
 start that an attribute is an attribute 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.670
 is what makes your digimon strong 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.079
 in this case for example the vaccine is 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.059
 strong against the virus the virus against 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.350
 the data the data against the vaccine and then 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.929
 I work more or less the same always 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.850
 then differentiating for example the one from the 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:42.190
 light 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.350
 fruit of the water and the wind group I 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.690
 He showed me a table that started like this 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.579
 lemon name the general attribute the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.050
 general natural attribute and that of the 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.289
 skills being the latter too 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.170
 affected we'll see why because there 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.519
 a drawing that was pretty weird which was 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.079
 the said we have been dicked in this line and 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.180
 which seems better to me for the time being 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.100
 I would be like it, obviously not 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.619
 for the ryder or nothing for that but for 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.000
 the starter and because his whole line is 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.400
 it went from being a virus to doing 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.290
 unknown means this is strong 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.660
 against all what happens with this is that 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.250
 devil mont no change of attribute because 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.620
 if it changes that it would also have to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.300
 change the raid that is in cannon but 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.530
 it would be like a dislike more or less 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.800
 leave it to me in the comments and test that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.080
 they think and it would be the right then post more or 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.600
 p surpassing even what would come 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.650
 being data moon in the Mudejar let me 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.810
 know in the comments what 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.880
 they think because for me it would be like that if 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.500
 ex acts the same as the mastercard that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.170
 they use the same files as the 10 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.090
 of lemon original so they do not 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.560
 it would be clear to him would be that he is stronger 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.080
 against all this one has different 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.550
 percentage in different stages but 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.290
 Well, it's still strong 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.880
 another one of the affected lemons would be in 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.890
 this case also ride in a were of 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.600
 lemon that was good for those who finish 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.960
 to begin with the fact that it was 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.820
 good but now I change from being a fairy 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.880
 is doing a little mediocre now 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.730
 that there are not so many vaccines except for 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.380
 leo moon that would be 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.180
 I mean we have that strong 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.280
 against it not that they are 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.530
 strong against we have and another that was 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.440
 also quite affected was imperial 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.960
 dramatic in dragon mode and mode 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.110
 fighter since he changed from being a fire to 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.210
 be what would come being light and you can 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.730
 keep being vaccinated another one because 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:32.460
 example would be that this one we have left 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.220
 from being a prisoner pardon to be data 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.520
 also in a skill in the mega step of 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.050
 be what would remain of tree 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.380
 water that's pretty weird 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.200
 sorry and the lemon that for me would be 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.380
 rather easier to relieve good for 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.410
 the new ones would be that ramÃ³n by the fact 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.350
 that is good in all its line and 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.110
 apart, it would be fine since it does not 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.630
 we will have weakness against any lemon 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.640
 in a stage and nothing more kids tell me 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.350
 what do they think about this balance 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.350
 take care see you
