00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.259
 this entry as the main gate 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.920
 where the road and the wagons enter 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.920
 loading 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:28.939
 curious fact there the permanent way 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:32.040
 highlighted for the moment does not have 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:36.120
 vestiges of works there to restore the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.660
 Restoration has no worker 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 of the ll nothing in weeding and the stretch here is 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.629
 It's okay to leave as before.

 now we're feeling oswaldo cruz and 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.340
 here too, right? 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.400
 example of what we heard in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.560
 pompeia about a possible thirst who 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.370
 exchanged has no trace yet 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.980
 no rolling stock to go on a 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.930
 permanent track equipment and people 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.160
 Do not know where you are staying 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.250
 these people housed and the station 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.250
 she has the whole roof torn off is just 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.330
 on the frame and the yard continues 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.720
 like unused and only the grass and he was 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.869
 It was all James, people can come here. 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.030
 which also clean the patio in view of 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.750
 other locations and other regions in 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.750
 another city 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.530
 It's nice that this part of the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.140
 Tupa side the marilia 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.250
 Just cool, this stretch after the curve. 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.390
 has a slight descent in a pop ahead 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.490
 on here 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:56.510
 g2 installed 1.8 staff this bar

 tile is a 45 in the steel company 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.910
 Brazilian national and this one in the soul 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.750
 the United States and we ahmad 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.580
 difference of the one of the boleto billet one 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.090
 little wider than she wants Brazilian 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:20.420
 and the patio is also a little larger but 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:22.940
 also dealt with the same author of wheat is 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.569
 That's it you are closing in 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.200
 city ​​of tupã 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.999
 nothing new here and uplifting 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.829
 and that's where it's here 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:34.260
 the next few days in something I 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.249
 happened because this video was 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.249
 discouraging
