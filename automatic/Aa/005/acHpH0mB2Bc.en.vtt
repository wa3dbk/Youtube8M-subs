 kind of aroused skool shoplog i know 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.269

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.289

 Get school supplies and then get it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.529
 you are a little early so you 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.620
 I have all the nice things because I have it 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.120
 also had a number of times in the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.180
 pants because all the fun things are already gone 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.190
 and that of course she didn't seem either 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.989
 I've been to the Hema and I think so 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.989
 and you can now so much you can such 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.440
 know how creative fun original 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.750
 we pay attention to something 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.399
 for everyone 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.719
 so I succeeded very well there and 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.890
 of course the most important thing is you 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.170
 agenda 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.730

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.620
 helmond I'll buy one but 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.739
 can use it completely 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.900
 not but yes I thought from now on I go to 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.310
 a new school and probably find it 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.590
 I like it so much that I just really like my 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.840
 track tool planning and precisely 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.119
 want to know what I want or need on date 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.520
 have a chance something i can do one 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.979
 buy expensive ones that are absolutely beautiful 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.310
 are so but can also just be a boring one 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.930
 groups that can just go themselves 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.970
 to decorate 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.299
 this one is just yes find it grow it 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.110
 must mention but this style and so here 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.980
 sets 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.200
 count feathers and 2015 so not such 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.670
 go all the way like a lot of other ones 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.890
 just a whole year port 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.440
 visible This is a school schedule 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.270
 school where your school year 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.260
 and van ben you rightly overlook wiseguy 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.270
 but yes i just want to be nice in your could 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.210
 nice go pimping myself so I think 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.450
 it comes laughing to him 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.190
 bought these washi tips because I am going 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.630
 not just for that 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.030
 yes go to use but also for 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.580
 other nice things this earth 250 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.590
 each where I will just prices 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.209
 penny somewhere in the picture 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.739
 because your price is just different 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.090
 I happen to know about this particular one 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.610
 price 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.350
 yes very nice to add is here 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.360
 same principle in the reading room and me 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.590
 like it so much that it probably then 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.940
 often that I probably have him more often 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.100
 so I will use this one too 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.470
 stickers bought these are years ahead 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.150
 your books say do 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.280
 I do n't need you to really cover it 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.980
 because I bought them that says mine 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.750
 but I think that's still going on 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.510
 and in it sticker is nice for 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.410
 do not expect to use galen from trousers 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.220
 to buy us the sheet and I am sitting 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:49.160
 here differ from facts 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.170
 also to continue with that kind 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.270
 I have this or this booklet of stickers 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.850
 bought but sticky notes 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.380
 no that they do the intro for you then 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.640
 I always be funny 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.140
 unfortunately these are not 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.920
 full stickers so you have to 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.710
 Just something fun with no place to be 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.570
 for the rest of sparta super fun 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.130
 This offer of drink or 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.320
 this little book think it has van der 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.200
 not to do with school but with 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.840
 are the daily things not do 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.209
 just nice print again with flowers 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.610
 inside state matters and to 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.100
 find blog funny i don't really make it 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.070
 often lists but I want to go 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.050
 do it because I want it to be green too 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.430
 keep things moon and then I get the 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.440
 journey to my own ideas 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.850
 things faster I was also allowed this one 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.150
 two nice ones 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.530
 I always bought notebooks for this 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.230
 of those gadgets only those who like how 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.530
 stars are broken by how much less 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.239
 nice ali they are slightly stronger this van 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.910
 a bendable one 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.880
 gave you but she will sit firmly there too 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.180
 of ribbon in what you can 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.680
 yes determine where you were or so so 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.680
 at every class you would did 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.850
 date that you can add for the 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.700
 rest just see 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.410
 and this one just has a hard cover 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.660
 not usable but nice nice thick 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.959
 so i'm sure this is just yes 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.730
 just last a long time and so you see 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.260
 on the inside 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.060
 seemed to me because because here needs may 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.730
 you then, for example, just a subject 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.170
 to write to the few years below 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.940
 taking notes is what I thought 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.800
 handy 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.270
 I do now that everyone can go quickly 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.510
 is going to see 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.160
 oh it is it is stronger than that 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.740
 like I said before, I will read my books 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.030
 van kaften yes i am i don't want to 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.680
 they keep beautiful for how long and it looks good too 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.450
 just a little bit nicer 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.130
 obviously because I occasionally still very cheerful 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.960
 some have left over from last year 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.230
 it only bought two wools and I have too 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.500
 not so many books so i guess i do 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.960
 here both belongs to me more that crazy 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.300
 reminds me of wood or something like that 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.410
 which and it is kind of an old-fashioned 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.200
 or so 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.300
 So those that I was there, I think you 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.050
 also with all kinds of fun 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.780
 signs with arrows and 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.560
 flowers and 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.560
 lyrics of really looking expensive today 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.700
 the loom chair and so on 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.410
 and then we are already at the latter 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.480
 thing arrived and that is this fun one 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.250
 something i didn't need this i had 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.750
 None of this needed according to and 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.120
 then actually go but I always come 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.240
 with several things at home than the 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.400
 intention is reimbursed her why not 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.480
 so this something who likes shirt 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:39.330
 proposal 8 there so powerful per hope that he 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.560
 good always seems awkward with such 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.320
 kind of colors with your nice details 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:50.910
 and the inside is just that 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.450
 symbol is no fuck your case 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.160
 so that and then this was my cup cool 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.350
 shoplog probably I'll go again 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.240

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.190

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.500
 I need things going but this is what I do 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.780
 for now i'm very happy with it 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.389

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.910
