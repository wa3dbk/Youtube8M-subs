would<00:00:35.700> first<00:00:35.940> draw<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> picture<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.809> Raul<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
would first draw a picture of Raul and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.830 
would first draw a picture of Raul and
his<00:00:38.100> shadow

his shadow

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.650

we<00:00:39.840> know<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.170> Raul<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.980> 6<00:00:41.670> feet<00:00:41.969> tall<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:44.660> he

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
we know that Raul is 6 feet tall and he

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.709 
we know that Raul is 6 feet tall and he
casts<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> shadow<00:00:46.399> that's<00:00:47.399> 5<00:00:47.850> feet<00:00:47.879> long<00:00:50.719> next

casts a shadow that's 5 feet long next

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.479 
casts a shadow that's 5 feet long next
let's<00:00:52.110> draw<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.440> picture<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.160> school

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
let's draw a picture of the school

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.799 
let's draw a picture of the school
building<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.149> its<00:00:54.600> shadow

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.200 

we<00:01:03.590> know<00:01:03.800> that<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.129> shadow<00:01:04.430> cast<00:01:04.850> by<00:01:05.059> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
we know that the shadow cast by the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.850 
we know that the shadow cast by the
school<00:01:05.659> building<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.290> 30<00:01:07.100> feet<00:01:07.490> long<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.860> were

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
school building is 30 feet long and were

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.730 
school building is 30 feet long and were
asked<00:01:10.190> how<00:01:10.400> tall<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.000> building<00:01:11.390> is<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.440> we<00:01:12.590> can

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
asked how tall the building is so we can

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.100 
asked how tall the building is so we can
use<00:01:12.950> X<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.670> represent<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.450> height<00:01:14.690> of<00:01:14.990> the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
use X to represent the height of the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.140 
use X to represent the height of the
building

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
building

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.760 
building
notice<00:01:17.150> that<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.479> two<00:01:17.690> triangles<00:01:18.440> that<00:01:18.530> we've

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
notice that the two triangles that we've

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.520 
notice that the two triangles that we've
drawn<00:01:19.100> are<00:01:19.369> similar<00:01:19.909> because<00:01:20.840> they<00:01:20.990> both<00:01:21.200> have

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
drawn are similar because they both have

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.830 
drawn are similar because they both have
right<00:01:21.920> angles<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:25.610> shadows<00:01:26.060> are<00:01:26.240> cast<00:01:26.450> at

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
right angles and the shadows are cast at

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.910 
right angles and the shadows are cast at
the<00:01:27.110> same<00:01:27.380> angle<00:01:28.990> so<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.140> triangles<00:01:30.770> are

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
the same angle so the triangles are

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.600 
the same angle so the triangles are
similar<00:01:30.970> by<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.140> angle-angle<00:01:33.140> similarity

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
similar by the angle-angle similarity

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.820 
similar by the angle-angle similarity
postulate<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.320> remember<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:36.500> if<00:01:36.619> two

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
postulate and remember that if two

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.639 
postulate and remember that if two
triangles<00:01:37.580> are<00:01:37.700> similar<00:01:38.020> then<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.200> lengths

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
triangles are similar then the lengths

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.950 
triangles are similar then the lengths
of<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.920> corresponding<00:01:40.729> sides<00:01:41.060> are<00:01:41.450> in

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
of the corresponding sides are in

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.590 
of the corresponding sides are in
proportion<00:01:42.759> so<00:01:43.759> we<00:01:43.909> can<00:01:44.060> set<00:01:44.300> up<00:01:44.330> the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
proportion so we can set up the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.540 
proportion so we can set up the
proportion<00:01:45.310> six<00:01:46.310> is<00:01:46.580> two<00:01:46.940> x<00:01:48.399> as<00:01:50.679> five<00:01:51.679> is<00:01:52.130> two

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
proportion six is two x as five is two

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:00.550 
proportion six is two x as five is two
30<00:01:56.440> solving<00:01:57.440> from<00:01:57.679> here<00:01:58.069> we<00:01:58.700> have<00:01:58.940> 6<00:01:59.600> times<00:02:00.080> 30

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
30 solving from here we have 6 times 30

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.680 
30 solving from here we have 6 times 30
or<00:02:01.450> 180<00:02:02.649> equals<00:02:03.649> x<00:02:04.490> times<00:02:05.000> five<00:02:05.509> or<00:02:06.250> 5x<00:02:07.690> and

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
or 180 equals x times five or 5x and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:18.370 
or 180 equals x times five or 5x and
dividing<00:02:09.290> both<00:02:09.470> sides<00:02:09.530> by<00:02:09.950> 5<00:02:12.489> 36<00:02:13.630> equals<00:02:14.630> x<00:02:17.380> so

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
dividing both sides by 5 36 equals x so

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.440 
dividing both sides by 5 36 equals x so
the<00:02:18.530> school<00:02:18.860> building<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.630> 36<00:02:20.630> feet<00:02:21.019> tall
