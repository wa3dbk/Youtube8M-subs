it's an action sports cam much in the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.000 
it's an action sports cam much in the
ilk<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.619> GoPro<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.500> it<00:00:22.500> comes<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.920> a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.089 
ilk of GoPro and the like it comes in a
similar<00:00:23.460> sort<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.789> waterproof<00:00:24.570> case<00:00:24.949> which<00:00:25.949> is

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
similar sort of waterproof case which is

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.189 
similar sort of waterproof case which is
kind<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.369> iconic<00:00:26.730> now<00:00:27.000> from<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.750> those<00:00:27.900> sort

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
kind of iconic now from for those sort

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.170 
kind of iconic now from for those sort
of<00:00:28.260> cameras<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.750> we'll<00:00:30.750> open<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.050> guy<00:00:31.260> up<00:00:32.180> get

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
of cameras so we'll open this guy up get

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.709 
of cameras so we'll open this guy up get
around<00:00:33.800> you'll<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.719> slightly

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
around you'll see it's slightly

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.209 
around you'll see it's slightly
different<00:00:37.110> shape<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.469> sort<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> other

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
different shape to sort of the other

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.020 
different shape to sort of the other
cameras<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.860> probably<00:00:41.640> about<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> same

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
cameras but it's probably about the same

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.510 
cameras but it's probably about the same
mass<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.780> total<00:00:43.340> it's<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.579> full<00:00:45.149> 1080p<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:47.160> 720p

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
mass in total it's a full 1080p to 720p

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.299 
mass in total it's a full 1080p to 720p
and<00:00:48.270> obviously<00:00:48.770> 960<00:00:49.770> those<00:00:49.920> sort<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> things

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
and obviously 960 those sort of things

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.080 
and obviously 960 those sort of things

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
notice um she got lens here if we just

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.660 
notice um she got lens here if we just
said<00:01:19.860> she<00:01:19.979> might<00:01:20.130> as<00:01:20.220> well<00:01:20.250> get<00:01:20.430> around<00:01:20.580> the

said she might as well get around the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.580 
said she might as well get around the
rest<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:20.970> hardware<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> regular

so you can set it to record when there's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.440 
so you can set it to record when there's
a<00:01:41.220> noise<00:01:41.430> above<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> certain<00:01:42.119> threshold

obviously one major addition which you

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.030 
obviously one major addition which you
don't<00:01:54.509> see<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:56.130> GoPros<00:01:56.670> for<00:01:56.939> sure<00:01:57.350> is<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
don't see on the GoPros for sure is the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.370 
don't see on the GoPros for sure is the
if<00:01:59.610> there's<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> viewfinder<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.960> actually

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
if there's a viewfinder you can actually

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.490 
if there's a viewfinder you can actually
see<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:01.890> you're<00:02:01.920> recording<00:02:03.229> whilst<00:02:04.229> you're

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
see what you're recording whilst you're

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.020 
see what you're recording whilst you're
recording<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.009> basically<00:02:05.399> which<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.790> novel

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
recording it basically which is a novel

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.869 
recording it basically which is a novel
idea<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:07.020> let's<00:02:07.229> switch<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.879> power

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
idea so let's switch it on power

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.369 
idea so let's switch it on power
indicator<00:02:09.179> there<00:02:09.599> resolves<00:02:09.959> he<00:02:10.050> also<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
indicator there resolves he also a

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.880 
indicator there resolves he also a
record<00:02:11.009> indicator<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.810> there<00:02:13.200> we<00:02:13.319> are

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
record indicator and there we are

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.390 
record indicator and there we are
see<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:15.420> got<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.690> little<00:02:15.780> viewfinder<00:02:16.500> you've

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
see you got a little viewfinder you've

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.270 
see you got a little viewfinder you've
got<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:17.730> sort<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.090> touch<00:02:18.330> interface<00:02:18.900> here

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
which is it works just plainly fine but

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.830 
which is it works just plainly fine but
you've<00:02:23.190> got<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.640> open<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.970> case<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.480> do<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.750> you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
you've got to open the case to do it you

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.360 
you've got to open the case to do it you
can't<00:02:25.020> navigate<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.590> from<00:02:25.800> within<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.160> case

can be a little tricky to list so you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.900 
can be a little tricky to list so you
bring<00:02:36.540> up<00:02:36.720> as<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.140> see<00:02:37.320> it's<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> pretty<00:02:37.560> basic

you've got the set recording capture but
this<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.860> more<00:03:02.670> like<00:03:02.730> video<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.480> pictures<00:03:04.080> so

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
this is more like video and pictures so

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.650 
this is more like video and pictures so
if<00:03:04.769> we<00:03:06.170> click<00:03:07.170> in<00:03:07.350> there<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:08.540> there's<00:03:09.540> a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
if we click in there and there's a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.190 
if we click in there and there's a
picture<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:10.050> I've<00:03:10.560> already<00:03:10.800> taken<00:03:12.050> come<00:03:13.050> to

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
picture that I've already taken come to

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.620 
picture that I've already taken come to
back<00:03:13.380> out<00:03:16.250> so<00:03:17.250> let's<00:03:17.430> see<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.850> very<00:03:18.030> basics<00:03:18.450> of

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
back out so let's see the very basics of

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.090 
back out so let's see the very basics of
the<00:03:19.620> camera<00:03:20.010> itself<00:03:20.570> just<00:03:21.570> stitch<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.870> off<00:03:22.100> put

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
the camera itself just stitch it off put

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.240 
the camera itself just stitch it off put
it<00:03:23.130> back<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:24.720> waterproof<00:03:25.170> case<00:03:25.380> this<00:03:26.040> is

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
it back in the waterproof case this is

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.780 
it back in the waterproof case this is
how<00:03:26.400> you'll<00:03:26.730> see<00:03:28.100> see<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.160> most<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.579> time

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
how you'll see see it most of the time

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.120 
how you'll see see it most of the time
of<00:03:29.910> course<00:03:30.380> you<00:03:31.380> know<00:03:31.500> it's<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.769> slightly

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
of course you know it's a slightly

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.729 
of course you know it's a slightly
larger<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:33.030> terms<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.630> sort<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.900> surface<00:03:34.350> area

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
larger in terms of sort of surface area

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.900 
larger in terms of sort of surface area
I<00:03:34.860> think<00:03:35.100> but<00:03:35.360> weight-wise<00:03:36.360> it's<00:03:36.989> not<00:03:37.170> too<00:03:37.350> bad

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
I think but weight-wise it's not too bad

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.030 
I think but weight-wise it's not too bad
in<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.060> box<00:03:39.239> up<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.690> get<00:03:39.870> as<00:03:40.200> per<00:03:40.500> usual<00:03:40.709> a

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
in the box up so you get as per usual a

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.380 
in the box up so you get as per usual a
dizzying<00:03:41.489> array<00:03:41.700> of<00:03:43.220> accessories<00:03:44.269> that<00:03:45.269> you

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
dizzying array of accessories that you

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.300 
dizzying array of accessories that you
will<00:03:45.540> never<00:03:45.989> ever<00:03:46.560> get<00:03:46.799> back<00:03:46.920> in<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.130> box

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
will never ever get back in the box

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.800 
will never ever get back in the box
again<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.670> can<00:03:47.910> promise<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.540> not<00:03:48.720> in

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
again I can promise you that and not in

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.390 
again I can promise you that and not in
the<00:03:48.870> same<00:03:49.049> way<00:03:49.230> anyway<00:03:49.530> but<00:03:50.040> obviously<00:03:50.280> all

these sort of things typical mounts this
is<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.970> little<00:03:54.150> break<00:03:54.299> here<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.540> actually<00:03:54.660> have

is a little break here you actually have
to<00:03:54.989> take<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.230> case<00:03:55.410> off<00:03:55.590> for<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:55.829> one<00:03:55.890> but

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
to take the case off for this one but

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.240 
to take the case off for this one but
there's<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.400> tripod<00:03:57.239> screw<00:03:58.170> so<00:03:58.799> it'll<00:03:59.070> hold

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
there's a tripod screw so it'll hold

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.400 
there's a tripod screw so it'll hold
really<00:03:59.730> really<00:03:59.910> solid<00:04:00.090> regular<00:04:00.959> clips<00:04:01.170> these

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
really really solid regular clips these

that's the important thing

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.119

I've<00:04:57.219> already<00:04:57.580> heard<00:04:57.849> it<00:04:58.030> so<00:04:58.860> let's<00:04:59.860> get<00:05:00.009> this

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:00.129 
I've already heard it so let's get this

I've already heard it so let's get this
guy<00:05:00.340> out<00:05:00.520> again<00:05:00.849> just<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.840> prove<00:05:02.110> it<00:05:02.289> I<00:05:02.409> suppose

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.350 

pairing<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.699> pretty<00:05:06.909> easy<00:05:07.030> there's

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
pairing is pretty easy there's

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.249 
pairing is pretty easy there's
instructions<00:05:07.599> in<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.379> manual<00:05:08.409> but<00:05:10.139> it's<00:05:11.139> all

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
instructions in the manual but it's all

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.980 
instructions in the manual but it's all
set<00:05:11.469> up<00:05:11.530> so<00:05:12.099> here<00:05:12.789> we<00:05:12.879> are<00:05:12.909> and<00:05:13.270> if<00:05:13.719> you<00:05:13.840> press

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
set up so here we are and if you press

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.129 
set up so here we are and if you press
record<00:05:14.969> and<00:05:15.969> there<00:05:16.090> you<00:05:16.150> go<00:05:16.330> it's<00:05:16.659> recording

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
record and there you go it's recording

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.119 
record and there you go it's recording
and<00:05:17.669> then<00:05:18.669> I'll<00:05:19.120> see<00:05:19.330> you<00:05:19.389> press<00:05:19.599> stop<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.129> it

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
and then I'll see you press stop and it

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.659 
and then I'll see you press stop and it
stops<00:05:21.599> so<00:05:22.599> that's<00:05:22.900> another<00:05:23.169> major<00:05:23.349> advantage

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
stops so that's another major advantage

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.670 
stops so that's another major advantage
viewfinder<00:05:24.669> and<00:05:25.270> remote<00:05:25.599> control<00:05:26.050> those<00:05:26.500> are

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
viewfinder and remote control those are

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.559 
viewfinder and remote control those are
pretty<00:05:26.800> two<00:05:27.310> big<00:05:27.759> ones<00:05:27.909> as<00:05:28.180> far<00:05:28.210> as<00:05:28.419> I'm

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
pretty two big ones as far as I'm

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.409 
pretty two big ones as far as I'm
concerned<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:29.560> is<00:05:29.620> waterproof<00:05:30.039> up<00:05:30.520> to<00:05:30.669> 60

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
concerned it is waterproof up to 60

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.089 
concerned it is waterproof up to 60
meters<00:05:31.750> we've<00:05:32.020> tested<00:05:32.289> that<00:05:32.590> there's<00:05:32.800> a<00:05:32.860> video

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
meters we've tested that there's a video

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.399 
meters we've tested that there's a video
to<00:05:33.340> show<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.669> not<00:05:34.300> quite<00:05:34.509> to<00:05:34.659> 60<00:05:34.960> meters<00:05:35.199> but

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
to show it not quite to 60 meters but

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.430 
to show it not quite to 60 meters but
it's<00:05:35.529> getting<00:05:35.770> wet<00:05:35.889> nonetheless<00:05:36.659> and<00:05:37.659> you<00:05:38.229> can

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
it's getting wet nonetheless and you can

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.200 
it's getting wet nonetheless and you can
I<00:05:38.650> said<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:38.919> can't<00:05:39.069> operate<00:05:39.279> the<00:05:39.520> menus<00:05:40.000> but

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
I said you can't operate the menus but

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.570 
I said you can't operate the menus but
of<00:05:40.330> course<00:05:40.509> you<00:05:40.659> can<00:05:40.840> say<00:05:41.020> that<00:05:41.139> recording

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
of course you can say that recording

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.570 
of course you can say that recording
from<00:05:42.580> from<00:05:43.569> the<00:05:43.949> outside<00:05:44.949> or<00:05:45.190> with<00:05:45.310> the<00:05:45.400> case

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
from from the outside or with the case

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.790 
from from the outside or with the case
if<00:05:45.789> you<00:05:45.879> like<00:05:46.029> and<00:05:46.419> there's<00:05:47.199> a<00:05:47.259> tripod<00:05:47.589> mount

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
if you like and there's a tripod mount

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.749 
if you like and there's a tripod mount
again<00:05:48.370> within<00:05:48.759> that<00:05:48.909> I<00:05:49.060> think<00:05:49.889> also<00:05:50.889> adds<00:05:51.639> to

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
again within that I think also adds to

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.149 
again within that I think also adds to
usefulness<00:05:52.389> of<00:05:52.509> it<00:05:52.659> so<00:05:53.050> yes<00:05:53.229> this<00:05:53.469> is<00:05:53.830> the

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
usefulness of it so yes this is the

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.510 
usefulness of it so yes this is the
