00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.960
 Good day to all with you Brian 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.780
 today I would like to tell you more 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.179
 two new mounts although probably more accurate 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.760
 say this one small here already looking for 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.680
 what fraction do you play if you play 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.000
 for alliance then we are talking about 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.720
 ghost horse 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.830
 and if you play for a horde you can 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.510
 get hold of ghost wolf if you 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.700
 representative of the alliance then you need 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 go to the peninsula toolbar your 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.670
 camp here is your trader and if you 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.820
 play for the horde then you need to go 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.640
 slightly to another part of the peninsula 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.230
 that's where the merchant you are 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.379
 to get this mount to you 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.600
 first need to farm 165 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.820
 recommendable badges then a beard and 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.739
 pump the reputation of the faction 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.840
 if you play for an alliance then your 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.660
 faction defenders tol barad 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.180
 if for the horde hellfire battalion and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.760
 badges and reputation by using 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.070
 dailies first pack up to or you can 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.619
 take your camp here is absolutely unimportant 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.960
 who controls tol bard of this deli 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.540

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.290

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.780

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.020
 get three more badges and one more 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.299
 a quest that can bring you three 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.490
 points in my opinion he is called something 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.829
 sort of win over both for the sake of it is taken 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.689

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.549
 every three or four days something 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.740
 that is, he is definitely not every 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.780

 about 20 points or even 20 plus 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.660
