00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
being at the end of a test writing

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.529 
being at the end of a test writing
period<00:04:36.830> and<00:04:37.039> you<00:04:37.580> know<00:04:37.820> you're<00:04:38.000> just<00:04:38.120> looking

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539

through<00:04:38.810> and<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.470> spot<00:04:39.830> what<00:04:40.130> is<00:04:40.280> what<00:04:40.789> you

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
through and you spot what is what you

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.150 
through and you spot what is what you
think<00:04:41.120> is<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.330> mistake<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:42.080> you<00:04:42.560> panic<00:04:42.979> and

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
think is a mistake and you panic and

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.510 
think is a mistake and you panic and
change<00:04:43.490> your<00:04:43.669> answer<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.830> later<00:04:45.830> on<00:04:46.070> you<00:04:46.250> find

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
change your answer and later on you find

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.640 
change your answer and later on you find
out<00:04:46.699> that<00:04:46.729> you<00:04:47.060> changed<00:04:47.600> a<00:04:47.810> right<00:04:48.050> answer<00:04:48.259> to<00:04:48.620> a

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
out that you changed a right answer to a

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.879 
out that you changed a right answer to a
wrong<00:04:48.919> answer<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:49.820> make<00:04:50.660> sure<00:04:50.690> when<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.620> time

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
wrong answer so make sure when the time

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.570 
wrong answer so make sure when the time
starts<00:04:52.160> ticking<00:04:52.669> down<00:04:52.940> that<00:04:53.479> you<00:04:54.289> stay<00:04:55.220> calm

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.360 
starts ticking down that you stay calm
and<00:04:55.880> make<00:04:56.509> sure<00:04:56.539> you<00:04:56.870> consider<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.979> question

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
and make sure you consider the question

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.240 
and make sure you consider the question
carefully<00:04:58.910> because<00:04:59.389> as<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.930> time<00:05:00.740> ticks<00:05:01.009> down

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
carefully because as the time ticks down

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.490 
carefully because as the time ticks down
and<00:05:01.639> your<00:05:01.789> mind<00:05:02.030> begins<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.539> rush<00:05:03.020> a<00:05:03.050> little
