temples first off the very first temple
is<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.070> you're<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.910> get

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
is right here so you're going to get

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.299 
is right here so you're going to get
diamonds<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.899> spot<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.950> look<00:00:50.129> into

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
diamonds at the spot if you look into

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.470 
diamonds at the spot if you look into
the<00:00:50.460> temple<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:50.820> there's<00:00:51.000> almost<00:00:51.180> always

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the temple because there's almost always

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.750 
the temple because there's almost always
diamonds<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> temple<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.399> don't<00:00:53.610> get

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
diamonds in the temple if you don't get

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
diamonds in the temple if you don't get
diamonds<00:00:54.030> there<00:00:54.449> that's<00:00:54.930> perfectly<00:00:55.260> okay

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
diamonds there that's perfectly okay

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.110 
diamonds there that's perfectly okay
because<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> other<00:00:56.100> ones<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.489> far<00:00:56.850> away<00:00:56.940> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
because the other ones not far away you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.670 
because the other ones not far away you
can<00:00:57.360> actually<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.719> go<00:00:57.930> straight<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.530> this

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
can actually just go straight up this

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.700 
can actually just go straight up this
river<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.399> follow<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.000> way<00:01:00.570> down

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
river just follow it all the way down

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.779 
river just follow it all the way down
and<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.039> tell<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> distance<00:01:02.699> you

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
and as you can tell in the distance you

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.729 
and as you can tell in the distance you
can<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:03.870> there<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
can see that one is right there so

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.010 
can see that one is right there so
literally<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.369> spawn<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.210> two<00:01:06.540> huge

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
literally at the spawn you have two huge

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.990 
literally at the spawn you have two huge
chances<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.979> diamond<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:08.909> you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
chances to get diamond so if you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.310 
chances to get diamond so if you
actually<00:01:09.150> go<00:01:09.330> down<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.810> look<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> chest

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
actually go down and look in the chest

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.570 
actually go down and look in the chest
in<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:11.010> might<00:01:11.220> actually<00:01:11.369> be

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
in there there might actually be

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.000 
in there there might actually be
diamonds<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.680> don't<00:01:13.920> get

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
diamonds in there and if you don't get

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.800 
diamonds in there and if you don't get
diamonds<00:01:14.460> there<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:14.970> always<00:01:15.390> venture

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
diamonds there you can always venture

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.020 
diamonds there you can always venture
this<00:01:15.990> way<00:01:16.049> which<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.070> easily<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.790> within

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this way which you can easily do within

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.760 
this way which you can easily do within
the<00:01:18.210> time<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.600> takes<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.930> survive<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.500> very

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the time it takes to survive your very

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.289 
the time it takes to survive your very
first<00:01:19.950> day<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.580> if<00:01:20.670> you're<00:01:20.790> playing<00:01:21.000> against

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
first day so if you're playing against

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.359 
first day so if you're playing against
survival<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.170> easily<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> all<00:01:23.009> three

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
survival you can easily get to all three

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.010 
survival you can easily get to all three
of<00:01:23.400> these<00:01:23.580> before<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.030> even<00:01:24.180> turns<00:01:24.479> nighttime

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
of these before it even turns nighttime

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.050 
of these before it even turns nighttime
and<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.560> wood<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> way<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.820> build

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and have wood and have a way to build

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.370 
and have wood and have a way to build
yourself<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> little<00:01:27.600> bunker<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> night

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
yourself a little bunker for the night

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.950 
yourself a little bunker for the night
so<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.369> all<00:01:29.610> really<00:01:29.970> really<00:01:30.450> quick<00:01:30.720> stuff

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
so this is all really really quick stuff

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.210 
so this is all really really quick stuff
to<00:01:31.079> get<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.920> tell<00:01:31.950> there's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to get and as you can tell there's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980 
to get and as you can tell there's
actually<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> village<00:01:33.299> over<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.869> that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
actually a village over here so that

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.319 
actually a village over here so that
gives<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.259> another<00:01:34.740> opportunity<00:01:35.159> if<00:01:35.939> there's

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
gives you another opportunity if there's

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.789 
gives you another opportunity if there's
a<00:01:36.420> blacksmith<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.140> remember<00:01:37.380> yeah<00:01:37.650> there

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
a blacksmith I don't remember yeah there

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.069 
a blacksmith I don't remember yeah there
is<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> blacksmith<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.299> there<00:01:39.840> might

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
is a blacksmith so I think there might

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.440 
is a blacksmith so I think there might
actually<00:01:40.380> be<00:01:40.790> just<00:01:41.790> maybe<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> look

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
actually be just maybe see you look

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.120 
actually be just maybe see you look
