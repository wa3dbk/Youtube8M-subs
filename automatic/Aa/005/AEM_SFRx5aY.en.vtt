round roller rink I will be the red

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.100 
round roller rink I will be the red
player<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:42.000> purpose<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.600> catch<00:00:42.840> that

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
sphere avoid the guide pummeling you or
pummeling<00:00:46.620> him<00:00:46.980> back<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.489> he<00:00:47.610> gets<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> ball

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
pummeling him back if he gets the ball

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.270 
pummeling him back if he gets the ball
and<00:00:48.149> put<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> goal<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:50.039> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and put it in the goal just like that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.029 
and put it in the goal just like that
you<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.879> saw<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.289> but<00:00:52.289> there's<00:00:52.500> no<00:00:52.649> sound

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
you just saw it but there's no sound

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.979 
you just saw it but there's no sound
really<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.239> needs<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.809> little

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
really so what it needs is a little

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.010 
really so what it needs is a little
boost

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.319 

I<00:01:00.020> kept<00:01:00.470> all<00:01:00.649> that<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.550> you<00:01:01.610> got<00:01:01.730> a<00:01:01.760> smack<00:01:02.150> him

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
I kept all that so you got a smack him

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.960 
I kept all that so you got a smack him
in<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.450> head<00:01:02.630> a<00:01:02.660> couple<00:01:02.720> of<00:01:02.989> times<00:01:03.729> the<00:01:04.729> game

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
in the head a couple of times the game

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.420 
in the head a couple of times the game
is<00:01:05.150> very<00:01:05.180> reminiscent<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.260> hat-trick<00:01:07.159> which

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
is very reminiscent of hat-trick which

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.460 
is very reminiscent of hat-trick which
is<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.640> hockey<00:01:07.970> version<00:01:08.540> of<00:01:08.690> pretty<00:01:09.080> much<00:01:09.290> the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
is a hockey version of pretty much the

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.270 
is a hockey version of pretty much the
same<00:01:09.800> idea<00:01:10.180> except<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:11.300> isn't<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:11.630> futuristic

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
same idea except it isn't so futuristic

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:21.660 
same idea except it isn't so futuristic
not<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:13.490> is<00:01:13.670> very<00:01:13.880> futuristic<00:01:14.300> come<00:01:14.750> on<00:01:14.900> man

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.580 

all<00:01:22.330> is<00:01:22.540> kind<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:22.869> randomized<00:01:23.380> which<00:01:23.619> is<00:01:23.770> cool

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.679 

you<00:01:27.159> got<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.429> pick<00:01:27.549> up<00:01:27.670> your<00:01:27.789> momentum<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.630> can

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
you got to pick up your momentum you can

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.480 
you got to pick up your momentum you can
get<00:01:28.929> hung<00:01:29.170> up<00:01:29.320> on<00:01:29.469> the<00:01:29.560> walls<00:01:29.799> it<00:01:30.009> slows<00:01:30.280> you

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
get hung up on the walls it slows you

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.300 
get hung up on the walls it slows you
down<00:01:30.719> so<00:01:31.719> there's<00:01:32.649> a<00:01:32.710> lot<00:01:32.859> of<00:01:32.890> friction

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
down so there's a lot of friction

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.520 
down so there's a lot of friction
involved<00:01:33.969> which<00:01:34.119> is<00:01:34.149> good<00:01:34.570> makes<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.380> game

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
involved which is good makes the game

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.889 
involved which is good makes the game
very<00:01:35.770> interesting<00:01:38.520> ha<00:01:39.520> ha<00:01:39.729> I<00:01:39.909> know<00:01:40.509> you<00:01:40.659> don't

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
very interesting ha ha I know you don't

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.410

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:02:00.560 

yes<00:01:51.510> this<00:01:51.690> is<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:52.050> they<00:01:52.200> pull<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.650> break<00:01:59.570> back

yes this is what they pull up break back

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.840 
yes this is what they pull up break back
to<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> action<00:02:01.350> folks<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:02.070> right<00:02:02.130> let's<00:02:02.640> try

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
to the action folks all right let's try

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.469 
to the action folks all right let's try
it<00:02:02.940> again

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
it again

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:11.270 
it again
you've<00:02:03.930> got<00:02:04.110> 30<00:02:04.410> seconds<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.070> clock<00:02:10.280> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
you've got 30 seconds on the clock it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.980 
you've got 30 seconds on the clock it
seems<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.940> there<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.240> a<00:02:12.360> slight<00:02:12.810> advantage

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
seems that there is a slight advantage

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.600 
seems that there is a slight advantage
to<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.590> computer<00:02:14.990> or<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.020> could<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:17.130> be<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.340> bad

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
to the computer or I could just be a bad

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.080 
to the computer or I could just be a bad
player<00:02:17.970> which<00:02:18.330> I'm<00:02:18.720> sure<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.530> would<00:02:19.680> agree

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
player which I'm sure you would agree

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.840 
player which I'm sure you would agree
all<00:02:21.090> right<00:02:21.420> come<00:02:21.660> on<00:02:21.720> let's<00:02:22.080> do<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.790> now<00:02:23.790> you

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
all right come on let's do it now you

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.640 
all right come on let's do it now you
get<00:02:24.060> points<00:02:24.450> for<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.750> grabbing<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.260> ball<00:02:25.470> as

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
get points for just grabbing the ball as

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.300 
get points for just grabbing the ball as
well

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
well

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.250 
well
but<00:02:27.819> of<00:02:27.940> course<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.420> point<00:02:28.720> of<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:28.870> game<00:02:29.080> is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
but of course the point of the game is

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.600 
but of course the point of the game is
to<00:02:29.380> get<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.920> goal

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
to get it in the goal
