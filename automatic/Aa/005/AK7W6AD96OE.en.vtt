 is the default file storage 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.570
 we have available 15 gigabytes we can 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.700
 buy additional space 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.380

 I have no documents here now 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.620

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.920
 go back 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.100

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.979
 parameter synchronization all that 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.590
 concerns synchronization 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.110
 here we can all customize by 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.479
 the default here are all options with regards to us 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.220
 synchronization is included that is 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.820
 sync parameters on this 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.760
 computer 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.010
 personalization settings ie those 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.330
 the settings that we are here 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.810
 directly set up in the operating room 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.880

 avatars of screensavers on the home screen and 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.570
 so on we can transfer all this to 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.270
 another computer 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.820
 literally a couple of times by clicking the mouse 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.360
 application and other parameters 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.430
 In general, by default everything is completely here. 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.190
 enabled and further limit on and connection 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.949
 what is it if we have traffic 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.770
 our internet traffic is limited here we are 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.530
 all this can customize 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.320
 not to overpay extra 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.370
 money for being there roaming and so 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:28.430
