00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.790
 I did not know about the titles of 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.019
 gmexico of the world began commenting 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.900
 a minecraft videotutorial 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.639
 and good that we are going to do today we are going to 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.400
 make some hidden stairs as you see 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.810
 here we press the lever and leave 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.300
 our stairs only missing the 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.390
 hide this but nothing of laziness to 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.669
 you already with them and good to see how 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.590
 see we support the lever and no one who gives 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.700
 note that there is a disk result if 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.750
 you want to hide a little more 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.070
 the lever so that nobody notices 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.670
 what do I do to your liking 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:39.030
 so we activate and as you see, they do not go up 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.719
 so let's see how it's done 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.829
 we're going to need good ingot 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.290
 Any material is about 64 mm or 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.649
 need sticky or sticky pistons 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.050
 pistons with start a lever do not let 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.890
 reddish stone and repeaters if they do 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.600
 Too big 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.370
 and well let's start 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.640
 let's put what they are here 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.299
 a little picture here and so on 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.970
 let's do 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.060
 ok slats facing here if 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.060
 we 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.880
 the 23 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.880
 equal to 100 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.009
 to these a little bit more 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.570
 here here and here good I'll do it 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.380
 this jump height now I want that 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.380
 be my ladder 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.440
 so then you know what we're going to 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.750
 have will be more or less like this 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.510
 at that height we will create our 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.810
 stairs 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.780
 which follows which ones where where to the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.450
 height that is the last piston we are going to 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.720
 fill here on the wall as if it were type 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.720
 wall 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.740
 at the height of the last piston all that 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.890
 I be here last are then 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.040
 we follow up 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.070
 and so on until this is finished 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.310
 there is then we would have this 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.920
 our wall would not 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.989
 now here I recommend you do other 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.940
 two little squares to hide what would be 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.650
 our red stone circuit them 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.450
 I recommend and if you want me not to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.970
 do not hide the circuit in the problem 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.239
 sent until our rockets that 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.489
 more or less like that ok 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.860
 good and having that we are going to put in 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.560
 here back next to each piston we go 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.020
 to put a bucket ok or good a small 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.510
 of the material that we want 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.870
 until I have it like that 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.450
 then we grab our reddish skin and 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.700
 let's go down this 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.520
 now you have to designate the place where 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.110
 we want our lever 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.610
 for example I can put the lever 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.800
 for example 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.660
 well here in the heights we 're going to 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.420
 put it on the ground so they know 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.130
 you how to hide the circuits and 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.860
 I'm going to put it here 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.870
 then let's see here here and here 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.580
 so let's go down our circuit 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.930
 to the place where our 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.210
 lever 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.660
 from here we are going to finish one 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.760
 down and here two this is not going to 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.630
 do to lower our circuit 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.670
 turbo remove a moment 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.930
 and good as you see here is ours with 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.370
 the ncaa then 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.510
 let's leave this box in which 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.400
 is holding our lever what 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.730
 let's leave this and the one below 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.570
 let's remember ok then we grab 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.470
 our redstone and we put it here 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.190
 well here goes another 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.890
 I have removed it to be able to go down and ready 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.230
 then now we will leave 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.150
 there was my lever then we set 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.300
 to where is the last reston 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.160
 it would then be our poblana 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.380
 here is our lever and as you see what 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.830
 we activate and automatically activate the 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.590
 circuit ok then we're not going to miss 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.840
 cover this 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.290
 here and a machine sorry excuse me 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.470
 because they plug in the circuit ok 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.620
 ready already having this the last thing that goes 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.930
 to stay will be to adorn it to our 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.370
 taste as we want to cover it by 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.310
 here is why over there where 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.360
 we want because as you see 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.310
 we have our hidden stairs 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.430
 and well I hope you liked this 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.129
 tutorial that is quite quite useful and 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.139
 pretty original in couple 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.629
 and good as you see there are our 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.860
 stairs in this view on this occasion 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:50.219
 of iron 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.810
 we go activate the lever and ready 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:56.350
 we have our stairs 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.030
 well and good minecraft but the friends of
