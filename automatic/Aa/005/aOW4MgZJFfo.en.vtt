00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
consumer lineup we have something

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.480 
consumer lineup we have something
similar<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.369> this

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
similar to this and and what this

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.730 
similar to this and and what this
basically<00:01:53.729> does<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.810> set<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
basically does is you can set the the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.069 
basically does is you can set the the
volume<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> preset<00:01:56.790> level<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.420> whenever

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
volume at a preset level and whenever

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.380 
volume at a preset level and whenever
the<00:01:58.409> recorder<00:01:58.829> senses<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.490> sound<00:01:59.880> at<00:02:00.180> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the recorder senses that sound at this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.060 
the recorder senses that sound at this
level<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.960> will<00:02:01.079> automatically<00:02:01.590> record

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
level it will automatically record

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.289 
level it will automatically record
without<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.460> having<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.820> hit<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.180> record

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
without you having to hit the record

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.480 
without you having to hit the record
button<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.409> essentially<00:02:04.950> if<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.369> have

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
button so essentially if you just have

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.190 
button so essentially if you just have
this<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.790> your<00:02:05.880> pocket<00:02:06.119> or<00:02:06.570> you're<00:02:06.840> somewhere

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
this in your pocket or you're somewhere

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.610 
this in your pocket or you're somewhere
out

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
out

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.410 
out
show<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:08.070> you<00:02:08.130> don't<00:02:08.310> need<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:08.940> want<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.330> your

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
show and you don't need or want in your

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
show and you don't need or want in your
hands<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> hit<00:02:10.140> record<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.830> soon<00:02:11.100> as<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
hands the hit record as soon as it

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.010 
hands the hit record as soon as it
senses<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.760> sound<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> level<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.780> set

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
senses the sound that the level you set

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.690 
senses the sound that the level you set
it<00:02:13.110> at<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.620> will<00:02:13.800> automatically<00:02:14.370> start

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
it at it will automatically start

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.340 
it at it will automatically start
recording<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.630> will<00:02:15.750> stop<00:02:16.020> recording

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
recording and it will stop recording

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.870 
recording and it will stop recording
when<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.770> gets<00:02:16.920> down<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.340> level<00:02:17.610> below

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
when it gets down to the level below

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.650 
when it gets down to the level below
that<00:02:18.270> preset<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.050> haven't<00:02:19.380> said<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:20.660> disk

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
that preset that you haven't said a disk

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.900 
that preset that you haven't said a disk
space<00:02:21.990> for<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.500> dead<00:02:22.710> air<00:02:22.890> if<00:02:23.130> your<00:02:23.340> say

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
space for just dead air if your say

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.220 
space for just dead air if your say
you're<00:02:24.060> writing<00:02:24.480> figuring<00:02:24.870> something<00:02:25.050> out

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
you're writing figuring something out

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
you're writing figuring something out
trying<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.680> record<00:02:25.950> some<00:02:26.190> licks<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.700> have

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
trying to record some licks and you have

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.960 
trying to record some licks and you have
to<00:02:26.910> stop<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.390> think<00:02:27.690> which<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.470> do<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.650> lot<00:02:28.970> it'll

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
to stop and think which I do a lot it'll

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.420 
to stop and think which I do a lot it'll
stop<00:02:30.300> yep<00:02:30.750> absolutely<00:02:30.960> yeah<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.980> depending

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
stop yep absolutely yeah so it depending

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.950 
stop yep absolutely yeah so it depending
on<00:02:32.550> whatever<00:02:32.730> level<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.240> said<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.660> don't

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960

on whatever level you said it I don't
automatically<00:02:34.470> record<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.010> stop<00:02:35.190> on<00:02:35.400> its<00:02:35.520> own

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
automatically record and stop on its own

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.030 
automatically record and stop on its own
so<00:02:35.760> yeah<00:02:36.030> at<00:02:36.120> these<00:02:36.330> power<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:37.290> stays<00:02:37.530> memory

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
so yeah at these power it stays memory

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.530 
so yeah at these power it stays memory
and<00:02:38.280> everything<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.850> like<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:39.240> said<00:02:39.420> it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
and everything and like you said it

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.270 
and everything and like you said it
stops<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.020> dead<00:02:40.230> noise<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.710> between<00:02:41.010> if<00:02:41.190> you

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
stops the dead noise in between if you

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.220 
stops the dead noise in between if you
don't<00:02:41.460> want<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.090> listen<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.690> know<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> huge

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
don't want to listen to you know a huge

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.620 
don't want to listen to you know a huge
long<00:02:43.470> file<00:02:43.830> other<00:02:44.670> great<00:02:45.060> things<00:02:45.330> with<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
long file other great things with the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.180 
long file other great things with the
file<00:02:45.870> length<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.500> we<00:02:46.620> have<00:02:46.770> index

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
file length is that we have index

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.880 
file length is that we have index
marking<00:02:47.610> an<00:02:47.730> npc<00:02:48.300> can<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.630> PCM<00:02:49.110> mode<00:02:49.350> so

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
marking an npc can in a PCM mode so

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.520 
marking an npc can in a PCM mode so
basically<00:02:50.430> if<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.820> are<00:02:51.270> recording<00:02:51.630> or<00:02:52.200> during

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
basically if you are recording or during

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.140 
basically if you are recording or during
playback<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:53.190> can<00:02:53.370> actually<00:02:53.730> hit<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> button

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
playback you can actually hit a button

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.390 
playback you can actually hit a button
that<00:02:54.300> will<00:02:54.450> insert<00:02:54.930> an<00:02:55.080> index<00:02:55.500> mark<00:02:55.800> into<00:02:56.130> here

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
that will insert an index mark into here

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.370 
that will insert an index mark into here
and<00:02:56.610> what<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.270> will<00:02:57.540> do<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.750> if<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.230> have<00:02:58.350> a

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
and what that will do is if you have a

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.860 
and what that will do is if you have a
50-minute<00:02:59.010> file<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.610> you<00:02:59.910> had<00:03:00.030> put<00:03:00.240> an<00:03:00.480> index

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
50-minute file and you had put an index

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.290 
50-minute file and you had put an index
mark<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.350> there<00:03:01.560> during<00:03:01.950> recording<00:03:02.370> or<00:03:02.970> while

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
mark in there during recording or while

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.790 
mark in there during recording or while
you're<00:03:03.390> listening<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.930> back<00:03:04.110> anytime<00:03:04.470> you

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
you're listening to it back anytime you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.560 
you're listening to it back anytime you
want<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.010> revert<00:03:05.250> back<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.490> that<00:03:05.820> spot<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
want to revert back to that spot in the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.750 
want to revert back to that spot in the
file<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.590> hit<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.890> index<00:03:08.250> button<00:03:08.640> and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
file you just hit the index button and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.880 
file you just hit the index button and
it'll<00:03:08.850> go<00:03:09.000> back<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.420> find<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.840> for<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.860> you
