00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
couldn't be any simpler than that

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.499 
couldn't be any simpler than that
so<00:01:13.290> you've<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:14.760> big<00:01:14.909> pebbles<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.420> the

so you've put the big pebbles in the
bottom<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.409> allow<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.860> drainage<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.460> it

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
bottom to allow for drainage so it

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.130 
bottom to allow for drainage so it
drains<00:01:17.880> away<00:01:18.060> we've<00:01:18.479> got<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> drain<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
drains away we've got a drain the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.109 
drains away we've got a drain the
waterway<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.799> likes<00:01:20.009> moist<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.759> stamp

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
waterway it likes moist it like stamp

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.810 
waterway it likes moist it like stamp
but<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.659> doesn't<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.320> wet<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.490> let<00:01:23.700> the
