tubing<00:01:59.040> motion<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.939> you've<00:02:00.090> learned<00:02:00.299> well

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
tubing motion that you've learned well

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.620 
tubing motion that you've learned well
Chester<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> there's<00:02:03.210> really<00:02:03.270> nothing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
Chester be so there's really nothing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.480 
Chester be so there's really nothing
that<00:02:03.659> I'm<00:02:03.930> not<00:02:04.079> much<00:02:04.229> different<00:02:04.619> than<00:02:04.770> your

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that I'm not much different than your

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.399 
that I'm not much different than your
bending<00:02:05.759> backwards<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> little<00:02:06.270> bit<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:07.259> also

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
bending backwards a little bit you also

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.300 
bending backwards a little bit you also
don't<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.069> hundred<00:02:08.129> percent

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
don't have to be one hundred percent

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.010 
don't have to be one hundred percent
flat<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.940> don't<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.869> know

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
flat so you don't have to be you know

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.960 
flat so you don't have to be you know
here<00:02:10.440> but<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.580> know<00:02:11.670> get<00:02:11.849> yourself

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
here but you know get yourself

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.470 
here but you know get yourself
is<00:02:13.090> table<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.660> bottom<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:16.890> hoopers<00:02:17.890> is

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
is table to bottom and that hoopers is
