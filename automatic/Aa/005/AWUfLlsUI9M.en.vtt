[Laughter]
carefully<00:01:48.509> I'd<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:48.990> thing<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> has

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
carefully I'd like this thing it has

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.460 
carefully I'd like this thing it has
spikes<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.310> over<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:51.509> there's<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.170> point

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
spikes all over and then there's a point

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.050 
spikes all over and then there's a point
there's<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.890> point<00:01:53.130> there<00:01:53.399> at<00:01:53.490> some<00:01:53.670> points<00:01:53.970> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
there's a point there at some points and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.289 
there's a point there at some points and
there<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> point<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.290> mean<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.700> has<00:01:56.969> no

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
there is a point and I mean it has no

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.859 
there is a point and I mean it has no
edge<00:01:57.630> at<00:01:58.200> all<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.979> looks<00:01:59.640> like<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.210> has<00:02:00.420> one

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
edge at all it looks like it has one

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.219 
edge at all it looks like it has one
because<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.799> seems<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> hollow<00:02:04.079> grind

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
because it seems to have a hollow grind

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.869 
because it seems to have a hollow grind
here<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.280> no<00:02:06.240> there's<00:02:07.200> no<00:02:07.560> edge<00:02:07.890> at<00:02:08.340> all<00:02:08.520> it

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
here but no there's no edge at all it

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.170 
here but no there's no edge at all it
just<00:02:08.910> fools<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.050> into<00:02:10.080> thinking<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
just fools you into thinking that it it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.460 
just fools you into thinking that it it
is<00:02:12.360> some

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.570 
supposed to be it kind of fools you
because<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.530> looks<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.920> little<00:03:02.070> bit<00:03:02.370> like

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
because it looks a little bit like

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.680 
because it looks a little bit like
you're<00:03:02.820> supposed<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.840> kind<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.470> hold<00:03:05.310> it

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
you're supposed to kind of hold it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.680 
you're supposed to kind of hold it
somehow<00:03:06.690> like<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.709> because<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:09.209> might

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
somehow like this because it this might

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.820 
somehow like this because it this might
look<00:03:10.110> like<00:03:10.170> finger<00:03:11.130> holes<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.910> some<00:03:12.270> variety

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
look like finger holes of some variety

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.340 
look like finger holes of some variety
but<00:03:13.830> if<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.580> try<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.600> would<00:03:15.720> break<00:03:16.080> your

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
but if you try that you would break your

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.440 
but if you try that you would break your
fingers<00:03:16.920> I'm<00:03:17.250> sure<00:03:17.640> so<00:03:18.360> there<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.380> no<00:03:20.010> step<00:03:20.640> no

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
fingers I'm sure so there is no step no

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.270 
fingers I'm sure so there is no step no
way<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:22.080> all<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.709> holding<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.519> thing<00:03:23.780> none<00:03:25.280> so

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
way at all of holding this thing none so

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.850 
way at all of holding this thing none so
you<00:03:26.970> can't<00:03:27.480> hold<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.870> here<00:03:28.260> because<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.709> has

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
you can't hold it here because it has

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.740 
you can't hold it here because it has
plenty<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:30.290> spikes<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.560> teeth<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.250> stuff<00:03:32.790> you

plenty of spikes and teeth and stuff you
can't<00:03:34.530> hold<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.519> here<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.760> guess<00:03:35.940> with<00:03:36.120> one

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
can't hold it here I guess with one

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.240 
can't hold it here I guess with one
finger<00:03:36.630> but<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.200> can't<00:03:37.739> hold<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.070> like<00:03:38.220> this

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
finger but you can't hold it like this

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.750 
finger but you can't hold it like this
you<00:03:38.850> can't<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.709> can't<00:03:40.709> hold<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.100> in<00:03:41.220> any<00:03:41.430> way

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
you can't you can't hold it in any way

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.150 
you can't you can't hold it in any way
this<00:03:42.660> would<00:03:42.810> be<00:03:42.930> better<00:03:43.410> at<00:03:43.650> some<00:03:43.830> kind<00:03:44.010> of

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
this would be better at some kind of

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.440 
this would be better at some kind of
face<00:03:44.489> mask<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:46.070> mean<00:03:47.070> yeah<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.640> get<00:03:48.090> it

face mask I mean yeah I get it
this<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.380> obviously<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.940> rant<00:03:51.390> just<00:03:51.780> for

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
this is obviously just a rant just for

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.680 
this is obviously just a rant just for
entertainment<00:03:52.920> purposes<00:03:53.760> because<00:03:54.180> this<00:03:54.570> is

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
entertainment purposes because this is

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.740 
entertainment purposes because this is
obviously<00:03:55.170> not<00:03:55.410> meant<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:56.070> be<00:03:56.459> holding<00:03:57.390> or<00:03:57.600> are

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
obviously not meant to be holding or are

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.039 
used in any way shape or form even
though<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:02.070> blade<00:04:02.549> is<00:04:02.760> actually<00:04:03.030> sharp<00:04:03.720> I

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
though the blade is actually sharp I

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.150 
though the blade is actually sharp I
have<00:04:04.200> no<00:04:04.440> idea<00:04:04.830> why<00:04:06.470> this<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.620> obviously<00:04:08.070> just

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
have no idea why this is obviously just

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.770 
have no idea why this is obviously just
meant<00:04:08.640> to<00:04:08.910> hang<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.330> wall<00:04:10.130> but<00:04:11.130> I<00:04:11.780> just

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
meant to hang on the wall but I just

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.430 
meant to hang on the wall but I just
can't<00:04:13.080> help<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.560> whenever<00:04:13.920> I<00:04:14.010> see<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.700> blade

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
can't help it whenever I see a blade

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.780 
can't help it whenever I see a blade
especially<00:04:16.440> one<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.620> is<00:04:16.830> sharp<00:04:17.280> also<00:04:17.760> I

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
especially one that is sharp also I

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.140 
especially one that is sharp also I
think<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.540> is<00:04:18.989> meant<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.890> be<00:04:20.130> used<00:04:20.519> at<00:04:20.910> just

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
think that is meant to be used at just

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.370 
think that is meant to be used at just
how<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.599> think<00:04:22.820> but<00:04:23.820> there<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.570> no<00:04:24.840> way<00:04:25.110> this

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
how I think but there is no way this

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.970 
how I think but there is no way this
thing<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.800> just

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
remember the good old times where blades

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:55.070 
remember the good old times where blades
actually<00:04:46.770> had<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.400> purpose<00:04:49.730> yeah<00:04:50.730> I<00:04:53.720> mean<00:04:54.720> yeah

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
like this is also completely bad as a

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.620 
like this is also completely bad as a
spider<00:05:01.410> with<00:05:01.860> knife<00:05:02.280> legs<00:05:02.790> a<00:05:03.060> good<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.300> have

spider with knife legs a good I have
this<00:05:03.900> man<00:05:06.830> but<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:08.430> me<00:05:08.610> it's<00:05:08.760> just<00:05:08.820> an

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
this man but to me it's just an

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:18.560 
this man but to me it's just an
abomination<00:05:09.600> it's<00:05:11.720> seriously<00:05:15.530> if<00:05:17.570> Freddy

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
abomination it's seriously if Freddy

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.760 
abomination it's seriously if Freddy
Krueger's<00:05:19.610> knife<00:05:20.610> glove<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.540> gimmicky<00:05:21.990> and<00:05:22.380> it

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
Krueger's knife glove is gimmicky and it

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.120 
Krueger's knife glove is gimmicky and it
is<00:05:23.420> that<00:05:24.420> thing<00:05:24.720> would<00:05:25.620> be<00:05:25.770> completely

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
is that thing would be completely

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:35.170 
is that thing would be completely
useless<00:05:27.230> this<00:05:28.230> is<00:05:28.440> just<00:05:28.680> ludicrous

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.560 

maybe<00:05:36.180> I'm<00:05:36.360> just<00:05:36.390> a<00:05:36.720> killjoy<00:05:36.990> like<00:05:37.530> that<00:05:37.740> but

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
maybe I'm just a killjoy like that but

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.700 
maybe I'm just a killjoy like that but
if<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:39.840> ever<00:05:40.050> bleed<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:41.010> wanted<00:05:41.790> to<00:05:42.120> be

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
if I ever bleed I wanted to be

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.880 
if I ever bleed I wanted to be
functional<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.920> wanted<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:45.000> make<00:05:45.180> sense<00:05:45.890> and

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
functional I wanted to make sense and

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.550 
functional I wanted to make sense and
this<00:05:49.890> is<00:05:50.340> definitely<00:05:51.030> the<00:05:51.660> last<00:05:51.690> thing<00:05:52.410> on

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
this is definitely the last thing on

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.820 
this is definitely the last thing on
earth<00:05:52.590> that<00:05:53.250> makes<00:05:53.460> sense
