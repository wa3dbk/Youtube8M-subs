that ended up a video there is a lot of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.089 
that ended up a video there is a lot of
questions<00:00:24.779> asked<00:00:25.230> about<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.619> differences

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
questions asked about the differences

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.070 
questions asked about the differences
between<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.699> two<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:26.939> course<00:00:27.300> we're<00:00:27.900> going<00:00:28.019> to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
between the two of course we're going to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.700 
between the two of course we're going to
cover<00:00:28.199> everything<00:00:28.560> in<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.130> full<00:00:29.519> review<00:00:29.730> but

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
cover everything in the full review but

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.200 
cover everything in the full review but
one<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.309> main<00:00:32.520> questions<00:00:32.969> was

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
one of the the main questions was

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.850 
one of the the main questions was
whether<00:00:33.480> or<00:00:33.750> not<00:00:33.840> one<00:00:34.079> device<00:00:34.410> actually

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
whether or not one device actually

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.270 
whether or not one device actually
reboots<00:00:35.489> faster<00:00:35.969> than<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> other<00:00:36.860> I've<00:00:37.860> done

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
reboots faster than the other I've done

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.790 
reboots faster than the other I've done
a<00:00:38.309> few<00:00:38.399> tests<00:00:39.090> already<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.840> kind<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.440> what

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
a few tests already I kind of know what

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.310 
a few tests already I kind of know what
the<00:00:41.160> answer<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.480> also<00:00:42.690> know<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.020> it's

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the answer is but I also know that it's

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.490 
the answer is but I also know that it's
kind<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.530> variable<00:00:44.129> as<00:00:44.370> well<00:00:44.670> too<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.379> let's<00:00:46.379> go

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
kind of variable as well too so let's go

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.410 
kind of variable as well too so let's go
ahead<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.800> give<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.610> shot<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.090> before<00:00:48.390> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
ahead and give it a shot and before I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.959 
ahead and give it a shot and before I
get<00:00:48.629> started<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:49.230> now<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.250> did<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:50.730> ahead<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
get started here now I did go ahead and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.500 
get started here now I did go ahead and
reboot<00:00:51.420> both<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.960> these<00:00:52.020> devices<00:00:52.460> beforehand

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
reboot both of these devices beforehand

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.880 
reboot both of these devices beforehand
they're<00:00:54.510> both<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> exact<00:00:55.350> same<00:00:55.530> battery

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
they're both at the exact same battery

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.369 
they're both at the exact same battery
capacity<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.699> well<00:00:56.940> both<00:00:57.690> running<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
capacity as well both running on the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.189 
capacity as well both running on the
exact<00:00:58.710> same<00:00:58.949> OS<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.820> well<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.670> 668<00:01:03.199> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
exact same OS as well which is 668 the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.690 
exact same OS as well which is 668 the
only<00:01:04.379> difference<00:01:04.680> between<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.159> two<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
only difference between the two is of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
only difference between the two is of
course<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.150> LTE<00:01:07.040> has<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.310> updated

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
course one LTE has that updated

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.760 
course one LTE has that updated
processor<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.630> there's<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> couple<00:01:10.350> of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
processor and there's a couple of

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.820 
processor and there's a couple of
additional<00:01:11.670> languages<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.229> doubt

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
additional languages on this one I doubt

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.640 
additional languages on this one I doubt
that<00:01:14.070> will<00:01:14.340> love<00:01:14.810> make<00:01:15.810> any<00:01:16.020> difference<00:01:16.290> in

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that will love make any difference in

00:01:16.650 --> 00:02:37.210 
that will love make any difference in
the<00:01:16.770> long<00:01:16.920> run<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:18.710> let's<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:19.860> ahead<00:01:19.890> here

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:03:01.720 

taking<00:02:38.220> your<00:02:38.520> time

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.190 

go

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:41.250 

you

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:04:05.710 

I'm<00:03:41.439> taking<00:03:42.250> your<00:03:42.519> time

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.220 

here<00:04:06.720> we<00:04:06.780> go

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:31.520 

and

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.490 

and<00:04:32.530> there<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.310> have<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.720> 4G<00:04:34.720> LTE<00:04:34.960> version

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
and there you have it 4G LTE version

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.879 
and there you have it 4G LTE version
took<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.190> one<00:04:36.430> but<00:04:37.419> again<00:04:37.659> I've<00:04:37.990> tried<00:04:38.289> it<00:04:38.409> a

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
took that one but again I've tried it a

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.219 
took that one but again I've tried it a
couple<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.550> different<00:04:39.909> times<00:04:39.940> down<00:04:40.449> probably

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
couple of different times down probably

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.909 
couple of different times down probably
5-6<00:04:41.530> times<00:04:42.479> most<00:04:43.479> cases<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:44.050> LTE<00:04:44.379> one<00:04:44.680> does

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
5-6 times most cases the LTE one does

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.670 
5-6 times most cases the LTE one does
come<00:04:45.190> up<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.580> little<00:04:46.120> bit<00:04:46.240> faster<00:04:46.750> but<00:04:47.139> as<00:04:47.349> you

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
come up a little bit faster but as you

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.770 
come up a little bit faster but as you
guys<00:04:47.800> saw<00:04:48.099> on<00:04:48.250> the<00:04:48.400> film<00:04:48.580> it's<00:04:48.849> not<00:04:49.060> really

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
guys saw on the film it's not really

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.890 
guys saw on the film it's not really
anything<00:04:50.199> hugely<00:04:51.069> drastic<00:04:51.729> to<00:04:51.879> make<00:04:52.060> you<00:04:52.810> know

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
anything hugely drastic to make you know

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.170 
anything hugely drastic to make you know
that<00:04:53.110> much<00:04:53.289> of<00:04:53.409> a<00:04:53.530> difference<00:04:54.030> that's<00:04:55.030> it<00:04:55.150> for

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
that much of a difference that's it for

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.360 
that much of a difference that's it for
now<00:04:55.449> again<00:04:55.960> we'll<00:04:56.289> have<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.650> full<00:04:56.830> review<00:04:57.099> up
