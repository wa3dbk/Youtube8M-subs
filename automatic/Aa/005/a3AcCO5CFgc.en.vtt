00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:12.000
 the project was born about two years ago 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.559
 almost for fun to challenge a bit 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.179
 prove to ourselves what 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.130
 we were able to do some for 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.609
 to show the world that made in Italy 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.320
 it is still one of the sayings of quality 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.210
 that we Italians can have 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 then we are committed to trying to 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.720
 find the tools especially the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.700
 ability also through our boys 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.129
 young people studying at the university whose 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.230
 we can also give him a future and do him 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.540
 believe in what our fathers 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.309
 our parents taught us 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.660
 this project is the project of a 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.489
 bicylindrical av of 90 degrees of 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.230
 derivation and all artisan from 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.010
 full ie from industrial processing 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.649
 of the raw material and we say 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.840
 made exclusively with 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.579
 high quality materials with 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.219
 specific treatments for each type of 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.379
 material for which we have construction 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.649
 in the realization of these prototypes 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.110
 that we are saying we are all creating 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.259
 exclusively from the full the materials that 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.479
 we still use are exclusively ergal 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.000
 titanium and carbon their 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.320
 technical features and let's say 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.780
 mechanics allow us to have one 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.869
 lightness that can create a 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.640
 product that is very competitive both a 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.030
 competitive level is also at the level 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.030
 of prestige 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.730
 we started with this twin 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.120
 which at the beginning we are making with 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:46.010
 a displacement of 1000 cc that we are 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.670
 already evolving to 1,100 1,200 cc c with 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.760
 cascade distribution of gears 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.260
 valves with beryllium seats e 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.830
 separate lubrication for how much 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.410
 regards the gearbox clutch and the engine the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.460
 gearbox is derived from racing so 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.190
 a removable gearbox 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.250
 a change that can be replaced 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.470
 quickly and with three types of 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.130
 ratios 4 5 6-speed chassis is a 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.100
 frame is always in ergal built 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.490
 entirely with 5-axis machining 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.670
 so there are six pieces of let 's say 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.160
 ergal welded together via a 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.110
 masking for which there is no type 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.750
 of mold or as regards the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.360
 frame or engine 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.870
 all parts we call electronic 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.110
 they have been studied through a 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.230
 Swedish company and components 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.330
 as for the speech 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.730
 of aesthetics and all made in 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.830
 carbon for katy rear-view mirrors and so on 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.080
 this we rely on companies 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.060
 I am exclusively Italian for Italy 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.280
 as regards the capacity of 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.950
 have an Italian design your own 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.560
 aluminum tank previously 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.209
 we had made carbon for one 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.799
 question of lightness for the matter 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.570
 of prestige 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.459
 then for a practical matter of 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.530
 homologation etc. we have achieved 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.360
 in aluminum however we have not taken a 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.890
 aluminum and we have printed 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.840
 made the classic tank we went 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.549
 in an always Italian company there 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.160
 we are done by hand on our own 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.269
 drawing on our directives and we have 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.730
 made this tank 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.430
 completely in aluminum that has a 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.840
 slightly higher weight than what 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.489
 is 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.410
 that of carbon, however, with all the 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.060
 technical features needed 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.000
 precisely for the various approvals 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.940
 road also for what concerns the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.530
 speech of the braking system 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.500
 we use the brembo you know for 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.959
 all the company for which he succeeded we succeed 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.840
 to have a product that in the first the 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.049
 first prototype has a weight of about 145 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.209
 kg thing that today no home 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.209
 manufacturer has managed to achieve 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.770
 we don't stop with just one model 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.650
 let's say we started with this 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.970
 model is also a matter of 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.620
 practicality 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.410
 the first model we made 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.560
 it's a naked bike for a naked bike 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.330
 versatile that 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.130
 say drivable by all then we have 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.930
 we are already making the second one 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.090
 model that will be a street bike 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.730
 fairing that can be used either 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.160
 for competitive use on the track and for both 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.890
 normal daily and later road use 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.310
 we are planning and we are starting 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.520
 to make one another bike that 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.810
 will be a version of a road enduro more 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.630
 travel by more by da touring than 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.110
 will certainly have the engine which 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.420
 a little bigger a little more we say 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.220
 drivable a little more resistant because 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.230
 it will be a bike designed to do 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.230
 kilometers that will have a frame in tubes 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:59.290
 titanium and aluminum cross-linked for 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.870
 where even there we will have an evolution 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.240
 what about the chassis that will be 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.060
 very different from these two previous ones 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.520
 because precisely for the use since ne 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.770
 will be done is not that we are already good 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.540
 point because we are only finishing 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.690
 the aesthetic parts because of how much 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.340
 regards the mechanics of the chassis 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.500
 we can say we have finished 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.110
 we are finalizing the aesthetic parts and the 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.540
 electronic parts in the sense of i 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.390
 mappings that we can put in in 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.610
 this in this motorcycle for which i 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.440
 I predict that we will say the first 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.800
 official presentation and will go into 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.870
 spring spring 2014 we will have to 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.730
 officially present what 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.070
 could be the one that will be one 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.750
 naked and maybe even the road 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.460
 as regards the version instead 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.080
 from tourism we say that it will take a while 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.320
 more time because that is what we are 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.320
 developing
