00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.580
 treated like a feather for years 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.380
 well i am very released 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.060
 actually I have myself indicated that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.100
 I am still with panel builder and we 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.010
 have been there for weeks in the everywhere 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.650
 camps assembled and cut and so 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.330
 I think there's some future you a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.230
 Long career can always have that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.630
 The training program we get you into 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.860
 different markets can look at and 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.870
 then was told as a new 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.250
 program and that seemed perfect to me 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.649
 I didn't know exactly what I was 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.520
 wanted was a bit searching and then 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.960
 we go for the opportunity 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.649
 different departments 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.910
 see 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.800
 nothing will be remembered here either 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.210
 any way you want 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.309
 and if you want you with your projects 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.960
 look at the loop at that moment then 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.480
 you just make that you can make arrangements with 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.700
 colleagues and just go along to 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.229
 see what we do all wise and what 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.320
 what happened on location at the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.320
 customer 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.590
 and I am busy between one year 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.240
 actually started as a trainee while 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.799
 has walked around with soul 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.619
 zephyr what yes what does it like 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.479
 actually in that what sell both how 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.210
 is that in one or was put together 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.260
 then at and for 10 weeks 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.000
 Inland shipping weather or problem is in 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.560
 millings on the Rhine may work as 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.119
 mechanic 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.290
 we find very important and often one too 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.479
 essential part of it 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.619
 training course from you that you just 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.470
 experience what what what it means to be one 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.470
 weather and wind and installation somewhere 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.970
 dealing with each other and chain 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.500
 are eating a sandwich 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.150
 is part of the programs 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.770
 will be very important to our people 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.630
 often understand that 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.550
 yes it is it is especially that very fascinating 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.880
 is the technology behind the ships 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.650
 can learn this for a long time because of their 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.770
 ship is just enormously complex at 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.240
 all kinds of marine where I put the divorce 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.860
 you can really really go deep in over 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.330
 technology and creative very long 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.890
 develop that is what my watt meter 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.149
 if you look at the club where i am 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.410
 active and therefore all my smoothie 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.850
 nijmegen 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.870
 there you have the director 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.820
 business unit director 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.620
 yeah that's just someone who 's door 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.270
 open the inside you walk as you 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.110
 an item apple of your improvements that 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.180
 wants 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.010
 of course he also has the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.390
 talks but moment a door 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.140
 open times won in then 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.880
 say dude 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.620
 Peter de knows this in this proposal for this 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.400
 to bump can talk about that 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.470
 to talk 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.200
 through the side of engineering or 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.060
 project management or sales 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.860
 the commercial side of the box 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:43.050
 we can see all those facets 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.000
 also show and I think that is exactly 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.390
 whatever we want here must come from you 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.850
 feeling 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.740
 make a choice there they are 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.930
 energy to get each other to continue 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.150

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.090
 develop strong internationally 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.590

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.390
 complex issues that are being dealt with 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.560
 increasingly complex from our customers 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.290
 well i think we developed 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.820
 have as a company to a level that 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.320
