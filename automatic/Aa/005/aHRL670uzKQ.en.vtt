00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
human being now I kind of thought about

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.940 
human being now I kind of thought about
it<00:00:31.600> for<00:00:31.780> a<00:00:31.810> second<00:00:32.140> and<00:00:32.259> I<00:00:32.349> was<00:00:32.439> like<00:00:32.590> I<00:00:32.710> really

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
don't think that that's true and one of

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.380 
don't think that that's true and one of

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
the main reasons is because of the mind

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.510 
the main reasons is because of the mind
games<00:00:37.690> that<00:00:37.899> occur<00:00:38.200> when<00:00:38.800> two<00:00:39.010> people<00:00:39.309> are

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520

games that occur when two people are
actually<00:00:39.820> dueling<00:00:40.390> across<00:00:40.690> from<00:00:40.899> each<00:00:40.929> other

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199

they're in a better position than what

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.990 
they're in a better position than what
they<00:01:04.870> actually<00:01:05.110> are<00:01:05.500> this<00:01:06.490> works<00:01:06.700> with<00:01:06.850> both

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
they actually are this works with both

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.130

duelists that you play against on a

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.990 
duelists that you play against on a
regular<00:01:08.500> basis<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.070> those<00:01:09.400> that<00:01:09.670> you<00:01:09.790> don't

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.830 
and Bluff your opponent out by just
setting<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.700> lot<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:36.940> cards<00:01:37.210> in<00:01:37.360> your<00:01:37.390> back<00:01:37.660> row

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
setting a lot of cards in your back row

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.180 
setting a lot of cards in your back row
immediately<00:01:38.440> that's<00:01:38.620> gonna<00:01:38.740> put<00:01:39.010> them<00:01:39.160> a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
immediately that's gonna put them a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.860 
immediately that's gonna put them a
little<00:01:39.280> bit<00:01:39.640> on<00:01:39.760> edge<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.270> then<00:01:40.600> if<00:01:40.750> you're

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
little bit on edge and then if you're

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.690 
little bit on edge and then if you're
really<00:01:41.080> confident<00:01:41.470> you're<00:01:41.650> like<00:01:41.770> oh<00:01:41.920> don't

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
really confident you're like oh don't

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.730 
really confident you're like oh don't
worry<00:01:42.910> they're<00:01:43.360> all<00:01:43.390> Bluffs<00:01:43.870> of<00:01:44.140> course

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
worry they're all Bluffs of course

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.930 
worry they're all Bluffs of course
they're<00:01:44.950> not<00:01:45.070> gonna<00:01:45.280> really<00:01:45.490> believe<00:01:45.910> that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
they're not gonna really believe that

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.150 
they're not gonna really believe that
especially<00:01:46.720> if<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.900> have<00:01:47.050> one<00:01:47.470> good<00:01:47.680> car<00:01:47.950> back

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
especially if you have one good car back

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.740 
especially if you have one good car back
there<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.640> you're<00:01:49.000> able<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.270> counter<00:01:49.660> the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
there and you're able to counter the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.360 
there and you're able to counter the
first<00:01:49.990> move<00:01:50.260> that<00:01:50.290> they<00:01:50.530> make<00:01:50.770> on<00:01:50.950> their<00:01:51.130> turn

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
first move that they make on their turn

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.190 
first move that they make on their turn
they're<00:01:51.790> gonna<00:01:51.910> really<00:01:52.540> be<00:01:52.690> a<00:01:52.720> little<00:01:52.990> bit

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
they're gonna really be a little bit

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.320 
they're gonna really be a little bit
more<00:01:53.410> on<00:01:53.620> edge<00:01:53.830> than<00:01:53.860> they<00:01:54.280> would<00:01:54.430> like<00:01:54.460> so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
more on edge than they would like so

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.820 
more on edge than they would like so
obviously<00:01:55.870> this<00:01:56.020> doesn't<00:01:56.200> work<00:01:56.440> quite<00:01:56.620> as

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
obviously this doesn't work quite as

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.990 
obviously this doesn't work quite as
well<00:01:56.860> against<00:01:57.340> people<00:01:57.580> that<00:01:57.730> you<00:01:57.820> don't

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
well against people that you don't

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.790 
well against people that you don't
normally<00:01:58.180> duel<00:01:58.570> against<00:01:58.900> so<00:01:59.290> if<00:01:59.470> you're<00:01:59.620> going

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
normally duel against so if you're going

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.050 
normally duel against so if you're going
to<00:01:59.860> some<00:02:00.040> kind<00:02:00.220> of<00:02:00.280> big<00:02:00.490> event<00:02:00.790> like<00:02:01.000> a

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
to some kind of big event like a

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.260 
to some kind of big event like a
regional<00:02:01.660> or<00:02:01.870> an<00:02:02.200> arg<00:02:02.680> or<00:02:02.830> ycs<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.909> person

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
regional or an arg or ycs the person

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.610 
regional or an arg or ycs the person
they<00:02:04.390> get<00:02:04.570> paired<00:02:04.810> up<00:02:04.900> against<00:02:05.260> will<00:02:05.380> most

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
they get paired up against will most

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.380 
they get paired up against will most
likely<00:02:05.830> not<00:02:06.490> be<00:02:06.670> someone<00:02:07.000> that<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.150> usually

someone<00:02:23.590> really<00:02:24.340> on<00:02:24.460> edge<00:02:24.640> because<00:02:24.910> most

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
someone really on edge because most

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.120 
someone really on edge because most
duelists<00:02:25.810> really<00:02:26.170> hate<00:02:26.380> delaying<00:02:26.770> against

duelists really hate delaying against

duelists really hate delaying against
any<00:02:27.310> kind<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:28.150> troll<00:02:28.600> deck<00:02:28.810> like<00:02:28.990> burn<00:02:29.200> or

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
any kind of a troll deck like burn or

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.720 
any kind of a troll deck like burn or
exodia<00:02:29.920> or<00:02:30.130> something<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.610> nature

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
exodia or something of that nature

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.550 
exodia or something of that nature
because<00:02:31.240> it's<00:02:31.510> not<00:02:31.630> exactly<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.140> same<00:02:32.350> as

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
because it's not exactly the same as

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.350 
because it's not exactly the same as
doing<00:02:32.800> against<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.250> meadow<00:02:33.520> or<00:02:33.610> even<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.090> rogue

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
doing against a meadow or even a rogue

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.880 
doing against a meadow or even a rogue
deck<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:34.780> got<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.990> completely<00:02:35.290> change<00:02:35.620> your

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
deck you got to completely change your

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.630 
deck you got to completely change your
playstyle

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
playstyle

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.680 
playstyle
so<00:02:36.820> now<00:02:36.910> your<00:02:37.030> opponent<00:02:37.120> has<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.390> decide

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
so now your opponent has to decide

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.910 
so now your opponent has to decide
whether<00:02:37.900> or<00:02:38.020> not<00:02:38.110> they're<00:02:38.290> gonna<00:02:38.410> base<00:02:38.680> their

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
whether or not they're gonna base their

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.530 
whether or not they're gonna base their
first<00:02:39.130> move<00:02:39.400> around<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> deck<00:02:39.970> that<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.210> told

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
first move around the deck that you told

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.510 
first move around the deck that you told
them<00:02:40.750> they're<00:02:40.930> dueling<00:02:41.200> against<00:02:41.530> or<00:02:41.830> whether

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
them they're dueling against or whether

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.740 
them they're dueling against or whether
they're<00:02:42.700> gonna<00:02:42.790> play<00:02:43.000> their<00:02:43.210> deck<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.600> way

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
they're gonna play their deck the way

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.750 
they're gonna play their deck the way
they<00:02:43.930> would<00:02:44.110> normally<00:02:44.590> set<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:44.980> up<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.400> it

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
they would normally set it up and it

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.520 
they would normally set it up and it
kind<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.030> really<00:02:46.210> puts<00:02:46.570> them<00:02:46.780> at<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.170> huge

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
kind of really puts them at a huge

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.920 
kind of really puts them at a huge
disadvantage<00:02:47.830> so<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:48.820> believe<00:02:49.270> mine<00:02:49.630> games

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
disadvantage so I believe mine games

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.200 
disadvantage so I believe mine games
whether<00:02:50.260> they<00:02:50.470> be<00:02:50.530> intentional<00:02:51.310> or<00:02:51.490> not<00:02:51.670> do

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
whether they be intentional or not do

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.810 
whether they be intentional or not do
