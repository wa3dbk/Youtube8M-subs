00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 amber and the future in short we hope has us 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.370
 started from July 10th in short when there 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.059
 we are found again 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.530
 when we tried to rebuild 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:16.220
 a team that last year had 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:20.220
 a difficult year we are growing 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.680
 I don't know where we are at that point 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.080
 we are improving game by game 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.670
 training after training is clear 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.490
 that tomorrow we start 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.600
 I have always asked to wait 31 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.980
 August to make judgments and I feel that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.579
 team is ready the team has worked 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.670
 well then unfortunately the field will decide 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.840
 if we were better than Lazio 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.360
 certainly not a lot 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.010
 difficult though I think even for the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.289
 others come to play at San Siro against 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 of us may be a problem 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.360
 I don't know I don't know but I want to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.949
 thank the president because he is me 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.800
 always been very close in this 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.050
 period in short I was 4 5 times ad 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.870
 arcore came twice for two 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.479
 Friday in a row here to meet the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.350
 players and I think his presence 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:12.180
 is something very very much 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.600
 motivational for kids to hear 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.180
 this is his desire to be close to us 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.340
 he really has a nice word for 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.009
 all and especially when one has 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.049
 need he is always there 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.479
 so this makes us very happy 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.159
 and hopefully tomorrow together with the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.890
 team to give him a good game 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.900
 because if it deserves it in the meantime it is not there 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.070
 still official 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.930
 We know that Milan has arrived 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.310
 do medical examinations and if everything goes 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.150
 well if torres will become a player 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.299
 of Milan 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.290
 we would all be happy if e 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.899
 because all the components of the milan 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.030
 of coach to the managers we have 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.119
 thought he was a player there 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.409
 in short, he could give a great hand 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.990
 I certainly don't find torres 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.479
 I the only thing that I informed and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.119
 on how to train and what attitude 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.680
 had because the Milan must start from 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.360
 this when I was told that it is 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.280
 always first to get to training 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.190
 who always trains great 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.960
 professional 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.450
 for me I am 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.900
 they have removed all the doubts that there are 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.900
 they could be
