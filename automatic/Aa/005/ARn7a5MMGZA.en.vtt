00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
I'm excited for it so this it whenever I

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.770 
I'm excited for it so this it whenever I
first<00:03:32.209> started<00:03:32.660> doing<00:03:33.350> this<00:03:33.739> it<00:03:34.220> made<00:03:34.520> this

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
first started doing this it made this

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.990 
first started doing this it made this
awful<00:03:35.780> sound<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:37.100> sounds<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:37.430> nails<00:03:37.760> on

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
awful sound and it sounds like nails on

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.729 
awful sound and it sounds like nails on
a<00:03:38.060> chalkboard<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:40.640> just<00:03:40.940> didn't<00:03:41.600> like<00:03:42.110> the

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
a chalkboard and I just didn't like the

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.210 
a chalkboard and I just didn't like the
noise<00:03:43.010> at<00:03:43.130> all<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.760> what<00:03:44.239> I<00:03:44.510> do<00:03:44.570> since<00:03:45.470> it<00:03:45.680> hurts

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
noise at all so what I do since it hurts

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.670 
noise at all so what I do since it hurts
my<00:03:47.030> jaw<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:47.540> everything<00:03:48.080> and<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.380> hurts<00:03:48.560> my

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
my jaw and everything and it hurts my

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.240 
my jaw and everything and it hurts my
ears

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
ears

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.900 
ears
I<00:03:49.370> just<00:03:49.640> put<00:03:49.850> earbuds<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.230> then<00:03:51.350> just

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
I just put earbuds in and then just

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.949 
I just put earbuds in and then just
start<00:03:52.910> scratching<00:03:53.870> away<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.560> it's<00:03:54.650> amazing

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
start scratching away and it's amazing

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.810 
start scratching away and it's amazing
now<00:03:56.959> a<00:03:56.989> tip<00:03:57.380> that<00:03:57.680> they<00:03:57.830> give<00:03:58.040> you<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.550> back

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
now a tip that they give you on the back

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.259 
now a tip that they give you on the back
is<00:03:59.500> as<00:04:00.500> you're<00:04:00.800> scratching<00:04:01.220> away<00:04:01.640> that<00:04:01.850> paint

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
is as you're scratching away that paint

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.790 
is as you're scratching away that paint
and<00:04:02.570> it<00:04:02.750> starts<00:04:03.050> to<00:04:03.200> building<00:04:03.620> up<00:04:03.830> on<00:04:04.780> the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
and it starts to building up on the

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.009 
and it starts to building up on the
surface<00:04:06.800> as<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:08.000> can<00:04:08.269> see<00:04:08.420> I'm<00:04:08.510> wiping<00:04:08.900> it

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
surface as you can see I'm wiping it

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.060 
surface as you can see I'm wiping it
away<00:04:09.110> it<00:04:09.590> says<00:04:10.130> to<00:04:10.880> grab<00:04:11.239> a<00:04:11.600> damp<00:04:12.019> cloth<00:04:12.500> and

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
away it says to grab a damp cloth and

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.670 
away it says to grab a damp cloth and
just<00:04:13.760> go<00:04:14.120> over<00:04:14.150> your<00:04:14.480> image<00:04:14.989> and<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.350> will<00:04:15.410> pick

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
just go over your image and it will pick

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.640 
just go over your image and it will pick
up<00:04:15.830> all<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.250> stray<00:04:17.000> paint<00:04:17.419> but<00:04:18.290> I<00:04:18.470> don't

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
up all that stray paint but I don't

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.259 
up all that stray paint but I don't
really<00:04:18.830> do<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.130> because<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.609> didn't<00:04:20.000> really

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
really do that because I didn't really

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.380 
really do that because I didn't really
think<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.600> was<00:04:20.750> necessary<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:21.620> just<00:04:22.310> kind<00:04:23.120> of

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
think it was necessary I just kind of

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.870 
think it was necessary I just kind of
wipe<00:04:25.390> it<00:04:25.570> away<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.920> only<00:04:27.100> downside<00:04:27.850> of

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
wipe it away and the only downside of

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.330 
wipe it away and the only downside of
that<00:04:28.000> is<00:04:28.150> you<00:04:28.600> get<00:04:28.780> little<00:04:29.380> stray<00:04:30.040> pieces

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
that is you get little stray pieces

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.130 
that is you get little stray pieces
everywhere<00:04:30.820> but<00:04:31.180> that's<00:04:31.360> okay<00:04:31.720> because<00:04:31.750> you

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
everywhere but that's okay because you

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.750 
everywhere but that's okay because you
can<00:04:32.170> just<00:04:32.560> clean<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:32.890> up<00:04:33.010> with<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.340> baby<00:04:33.490> wipe

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
can just clean it up with the baby wipe

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.620 
can just clean it up with the baby wipe
later<00:04:34.440> so<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:36.430> pretty<00:04:36.790> much<00:04:36.910> is<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.420> for

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
later so that pretty much is it for

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.850 
later so that pretty much is it for
today<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.290> please<00:04:39.840> leave<00:04:40.840> some<00:04:41.020> comments<00:04:41.320> or
