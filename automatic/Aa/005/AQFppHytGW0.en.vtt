replay<00:00:17.789> using<00:00:18.270> morphtronic<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.199> let's<00:00:19.710> get

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
replay using morphtronic so let's get

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.210 
replay using morphtronic so let's get
started<00:00:20.570> alright<00:00:21.570> he's<00:00:22.410> able<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.740> get<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
started alright he's able to get the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.009 
started alright he's able to get the
strongest<00:00:23.580> combo<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.090> morons<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
strongest combo that morons can do and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.140 
strongest combo that morons can do and
that<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> cell<00:00:26.189> phone<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.699> then<00:00:26.910> having

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
that is a cell phone and then having

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.820 
that is a cell phone and then having
machine<00:00:27.480> duplication<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.470> get<00:00:28.560> three

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
machine duplication so you can get three

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.349 
machine duplication so you can get three
of<00:00:28.920> them<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.849> course<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:30.210> you're<00:00:30.330> not

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
of them and of course if you're not

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
of them and of course if you're not
familiar<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.810> more<00:00:31.080> tronic<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.650> fun<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.070> able

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
familiar with more tronic so fun is able

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.979 
familiar with more tronic so fun is able
to<00:00:32.579> roll<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> dice<00:00:33.180> whatever<00:00:33.540> number<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.780> get

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
to roll the dice whatever number you get

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.540 
to roll the dice whatever number you get
you<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.590> check<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> card<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> top<00:00:35.250> your<00:00:35.399> deck

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you can check the card to top your deck

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.620 
you can check the card to top your deck
and<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:35.969> special<00:00:36.149> summon<00:00:36.300> morphtronic

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and then special summon morphtronic

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.440 
and then special summon morphtronic
among<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.010> i<00:00:38.100> easy<00:00:38.610> waves<00:00:39.000> form<00:00:39.239> field

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
among them so i easy waves form field

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.139 
among them so i easy waves form field
and<00:00:39.540> get<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> morphtronic<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> need<00:00:41.149> so

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
and get a morphtronic that you need so

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.580 
and get a morphtronic that you need so
you're<00:00:42.450> saying<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.899> he's<00:00:43.079> gonna<00:00:43.230> use<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
you're saying that he's gonna use that

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.069 
you're saying that he's gonna use that
effect<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:44.010> all<00:00:44.070> three<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.430> them<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.079> of

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
effect for all three of them and of

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.959 
effect for all three of them and of
course<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.530> getting<00:00:46.890> scope<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.700> he's<00:00:47.820> able

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
course with getting scope and he's able

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.850 
course with getting scope and he's able
to<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.600> hyper<00:00:48.840> librarian<00:00:48.989> which<00:00:49.440> sets<00:00:49.710> up

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
to go for hyper librarian which sets up

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860 
to go for hyper librarian which sets up
a<00:00:49.950> lot<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> plays<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.629> when

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
a lot of the plays for this because when

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.910 
a lot of the plays for this because when
you<00:00:51.930> have<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> field<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
you have that on the field all the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.799 
you have that on the field all the
synchro<00:00:53.579> something<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.149> gonna<00:00:54.360> allow

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
synchro something you do is gonna allow

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.200 
synchro something you do is gonna allow
you<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> draw<00:00:55.199> more<00:00:55.440> cards<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.520> he<00:00:56.610> gets<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
you to draw more cards so he gets to you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.520 
you to draw more cards so he gets to you
know<00:00:57.239> from<00:00:57.480> using<00:00:57.719> formula<00:00:57.960> synchron<00:00:58.230> it's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
know from using formula synchron it's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.110 
know from using formula synchron it's
kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.859> same<00:00:59.010> thing<00:00:59.190> you've<00:00:59.309> seen<00:00:59.550> from

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
kind of the same thing you've seen from

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.349 
kind of the same thing you've seen from
like<00:01:00.270> basically<00:01:01.079> synchron's<00:01:01.699> is<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:03.000> he's

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
like basically synchron's is how he's

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.520 
like basically synchron's is how he's
using<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> reminds<00:01:04.019> me<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.170> how<00:01:04.350> we've

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
using this it reminds me of how we've

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.560 
using this it reminds me of how we've
shown<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.220> Synchron<00:01:05.729> otk<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.299> it's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
shown that Synchron otk so it's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.179 
shown that Synchron otk so it's
basically<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> same<00:01:07.229> stuff<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
basically the same stuff going on and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.070 
basically the same stuff going on and
even<00:01:08.640> using<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.150> d'<00:01:09.330> synchro<00:01:09.720> i<00:01:09.840> thought<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
even using a d' synchro i thought that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
even using a d' synchro i thought that
was<00:01:10.200> kind<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.380> cool<00:01:10.500> cuz<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> don't<00:01:10.799> think<00:01:11.010> I've

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
was kind of cool cuz I don't think I've

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.890 
was kind of cool cuz I don't think I've
ever<00:01:11.220> seen<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.400> card<00:01:11.700> being<00:01:11.939> used<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.390> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
ever seen that card being used and it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.570 
ever seen that card being used and it
really<00:01:13.020> helped<00:01:13.229> him<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.979> allowed<00:01:14.340> him<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
really helped him out it allowed him to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.570 
really helped him out it allowed him to
draw<00:01:14.729> two<00:01:14.909> more<00:01:14.939> cards<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.930> very<00:01:16.500> useful<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
draw two more cards so very useful and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.980 
draw two more cards so very useful and
of<00:01:17.700> course<00:01:17.850> getting<00:01:18.000> formula<00:01:18.299> synchron<00:01:18.630> again

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
of course getting formula synchron again

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.330 
of course getting formula synchron again
just<00:01:19.259> drawing<00:01:19.470> more<00:01:19.650> cards<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.070> everything

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
just drawing more cards and everything

pretty cool card it's also Tuner monster
so<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> helps<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.430> go<00:01:32.549> on

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
so it helps that with this that go on

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.240 
so it helps that with this that go on
not<00:01:34.170> being<00:01:34.320> able<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.650> something<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.009> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
not being able to do something like this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.039 
not being able to do something like this
i<00:01:35.549> guess<00:01:37.009> or<00:01:38.009> junk<00:01:38.310> box<00:01:38.490> gets<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.090> fun<00:01:39.420> back

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
i guess or junk box gets so fun back

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.749 
i guess or junk box gets so fun back
again<00:01:40.619> being<00:01:41.040> able<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.310> bring<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.610> more

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
again being able to bring out more

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.120 
again being able to bring out more
monsters<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.140> got<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:43.439> quasar<00:01:43.950> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
monsters it really got one quasar to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.800 
monsters it really got one quasar to
which<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.909> scary<00:01:45.210> enough<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.659> it

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
which is that's just scary enough as it

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.539 
which is that's just scary enough as it
is<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:46.530> forecast<00:01:46.979> or<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.430> already

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
is going forecast or you can already

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.060 
is going forecast or you can already
tell<00:01:47.759> what's<00:01:48.000> happening<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.720> for<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> second

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
tell what's happening going for a second

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.740 
tell what's happening going for a second
quasar<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:50.820> even<00:01:51.090> forbidden<00:01:51.390> Lintz

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
quasar and then even forbidden Lintz

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.080 
quasar and then even forbidden Lintz
face<00:01:51.930> down<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.649> really<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> mean<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.640> GG

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
face down so really I mean it's just GG

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.580 
face down so really I mean it's just GG
right<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.509> don't<00:01:54.720> really<00:01:54.869> know<00:01:55.110> many

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
right there I don't really know many

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.230 
right there I don't really know many
things<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.040> could<00:01:56.159> do<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.820> could<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:57.119> out

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
things you could do that could get out

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.340 
things you could do that could get out
of<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:57.840> he<00:01:57.930> goes<00:01:58.079> for

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
of this as you can see he goes for

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080 
of this as you can see he goes for
number<00:01:58.619> 101<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.310> try<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.579> do<00:01:59.790> something

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
number 101 to try to do something

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.179 
number 101 to try to do something
instead<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.110> mean<00:02:01.439> there's<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.890> really

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
instead but I mean there's just really

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.459 
instead but I mean there's just really
nothing<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.270> yeah<00:02:03.960> hope<00:02:04.380> you

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
nothing you can do on that yeah hope you

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.600 
nothing you can do on that yeah hope you
guys<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.680> enjoyed<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:05.009> kind<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.369> short

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
guys have enjoyed this kind of a short

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.789 
guys have enjoyed this kind of a short
replay<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.240> now<00:02:06.930> let's<00:02:07.140> get<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.649> deck

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
replay and now let's get to the deck

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.050 
replay and now let's get to the deck
that<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> use<00:02:08.129> because<00:02:08.340> he<00:02:08.399> also<00:02:08.520> sent<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
that I use because he also sent that to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.240 
that I use because he also sent that to
me<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.450> now<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> necklace<00:02:10.500> first<00:02:10.950> off<00:02:11.129> we

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
me and now for the necklace first off we

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.710 
me and now for the necklace first off we
have<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:11.700> redox

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
have one redox

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.990 
have one redox
then<00:02:12.900> we<00:02:13.350> have<00:02:13.590> three<00:02:13.980> electronic<00:02:14.460> stapling<00:02:14.850> a

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
then we have three electronic stapling a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.220 
then we have three electronic stapling a
pretty<00:02:15.240> good<00:02:15.390> card<00:02:15.630> -<00:02:15.840> it's<00:02:15.990> one<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.140> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
pretty good card - it's one of the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.450 
pretty good card - it's one of the
better<00:02:16.320> more<00:02:16.470> chronic<00:02:16.620> cipher<00:02:16.920> got<00:02:17.040> kind<00:02:17.370> of

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
better more chronic cipher got kind of

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.220 
better more chronic cipher got kind of
about<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.790> car<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.000> remember<00:02:18.330> when<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.110> came

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
about this car I remember when it came

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.360 
about this car I remember when it came
out<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.410> forgot<00:02:19.590> its<00:02:19.830> effects<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.250> it's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
out I forgot its effects so it's

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.280 
out I forgot its effects so it's
actually<00:02:20.490> pretty<00:02:20.670> useful<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.300> then<00:02:21.990> we<00:02:22.080> have

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
actually pretty useful and then we have

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.440 
actually pretty useful and then we have
to<00:02:23.010> sling<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.520> sling<00:02:23.820> into<00:02:23.970> really<00:02:24.240> good<00:02:24.360> one

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
to sling and sling into really good one

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.870 
to sling and sling into really good one
because<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.690> can<00:02:24.750> use<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.520> contribute

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
because you can use it to you contribute

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.800 
because you can use it to you contribute
when<00:02:26.970> you're<00:02:27.090> more<00:02:27.180> chronic<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.480> destroy<00:02:27.780> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
when you're more chronic to destroy a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.230 
when you're more chronic to destroy a
card<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.500> field<00:02:28.710> then<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.310> boom<00:02:29.670> box<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.060> one

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
card on the field then a boom box in one

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.610 
card on the field then a boom box in one
of<00:02:30.330> my<00:02:30.390> favorite<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.930> morphtronics<00:02:31.500> to

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
of my favorite to the morphtronics to

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.530 
of my favorite to the morphtronics to
get<00:02:31.740> two<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.920> those<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.550> then<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> three

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
get two of those and then a three

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.090 
get two of those and then a three
scoping<00:02:34.080> scope<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.530> once<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.830> defense

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
scoping scope and once in defense

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.560 
scoping scope and once in defense
becomes<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.460> little<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.790> tuner<00:02:36.090> monster<00:02:36.450> so

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
becomes a little for tuner monster so

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.600 
becomes a little for tuner monster so
that<00:02:36.660> helps<00:02:36.930> out<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> lot<00:02:37.290> with<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.620> deck<00:02:37.860> then

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
that helps out a lot with this deck then

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.210 
that helps out a lot with this deck then
after<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:38.970> we<00:02:39.180> have<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> three<00:02:39.900> remoten<00:02:40.470> then

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
after that we have a three remoten then

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.550 
after that we have a three remoten then
one<00:02:41.550> lambtron<00:02:41.940> lambtron<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.780> another<00:02:43.080> level

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
one lambtron lambtron is another level

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.840 
one lambtron lambtron is another level
one<00:02:43.680> tuner<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.280> help<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.520> go<00:02:44.640> for

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
one tuner that can help you go for

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.100 
one tuner that can help you go for
formula<00:02:45.150> synchron<00:02:45.480> so<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:45.750> pretty<00:02:45.870> useful

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
formula synchron so it's pretty useful

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.590 
formula synchron so it's pretty useful
on<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.910> three<00:02:47.910> morphtronic<00:02:48.330> smart

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
on that and three morphtronic smart

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.240 
on that and three morphtronic smart

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
one of the newer cards came out too so I

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.540 
one of the newer cards came out too so I
was<00:02:52.320> glad<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.530> see<00:02:52.740> new<00:02:52.860> support<00:02:53.190> coming<00:02:53.430> out

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
was glad to see new support coming out

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.880 
was glad to see new support coming out
for<00:02:53.850> morphtronics<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.720> yeah<00:02:55.410> it's<00:02:55.560> able<00:02:55.800> to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
for morphtronics and yeah it's able to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.860 
for morphtronics and yeah it's able to
add<00:02:56.010> more<00:02:56.280> Tronics<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.360> your<00:02:57.480> hand<00:02:57.630> we're

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
add more Tronics to your hand we're

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.660 
add more Tronics to your hand we're
trying<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.110> cards<00:02:58.470> do<00:02:58.650> not<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:59.010> monsters<00:02:59.400> and

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
trying to cards do not just monsters and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.670 
trying to cards do not just monsters and
then<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.300> main<00:03:00.480> card<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:00.990> this<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.470> I'm

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
then the main card for this is I'm

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.140 
then the main card for this is I'm
electronic<00:03:02.040> cell<00:03:02.220> phone<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.580> using<00:03:02.850> three<00:03:03.060> of

was<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.620> video<00:03:07.890> after<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.910> we<00:03:09.120> have<00:03:09.209> one

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
was in this video after that we have one

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.520 
was in this video after that we have one
for<00:03:09.480> one<00:03:09.630> you're<00:03:09.810> more<00:03:09.930> likely<00:03:10.140> gonna<00:03:10.350> use

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
for one you're more likely gonna use

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.310 
for one you're more likely gonna use
this<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.709> smart<00:03:11.160> fun<00:03:11.370> then<00:03:12.090> d<00:03:12.450> synchro<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.050> was

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
this for smart fun then d synchro I was

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.690 
this for smart fun then d synchro I was
kind<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.500> skeptical<00:03:13.800> about<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.190> but<00:03:14.430> he<00:03:14.490> made

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
kind of skeptical about this but he made

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.270 
kind of skeptical about this but he made
it<00:03:14.730> actually<00:03:15.240> a<00:03:15.270> really<00:03:15.600> useful<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.739> in

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
it actually a really useful in this in

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.340 
it actually a really useful in this in
this<00:03:17.430> replay<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.180> pretty<00:03:18.690> cool<00:03:18.840> then<00:03:19.110> when<00:03:19.290> you

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
this replay so pretty cool then when you

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.320 
this replay so pretty cool then when you
use<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.560> like<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.680> then<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.519> three<00:03:20.910> jump<00:03:21.120> pops

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
use it like that then a three jump pops

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.550 
use it like that then a three jump pops
which<00:03:21.720> can<00:03:21.989> help<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:22.200> bring<00:03:22.350> back<00:03:22.530> a

combo helps you get three them on the
field<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:33.989> then<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.260> can<00:03:34.350> just<00:03:34.470> start<00:03:34.650> a

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
field and then you can just start a

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.110 
field and then you can just start a
hoping<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.489> get<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.790> right<00:03:35.910> I'm
