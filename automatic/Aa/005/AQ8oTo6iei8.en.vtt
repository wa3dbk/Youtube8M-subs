00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.650
 very good I came from a video more to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.360
 channel today I'm going to show you this is my 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.060
 change of look 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.940
 quite radical as you can see the 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.160
 past a chestnut to have it 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.970
 Californian women have some spots 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.190
 little wrinkles and now to this 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.640
 I really wanted to do a 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.840
 change well 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.840
 why 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.559
 we will have to make a change if 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:48.250
 I have not done something so radical for a long time 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.809
 so special and I in my time of 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.680
 student I think I wanted to change 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.230
 a lot of hairstyle cut and I during 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.180
 so long 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.000
 I wanted to do something different and remarkable 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.710
 different and this color combination 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.979
 be a chain that had him 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.400
 very much you want so it has encouraged me and 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.400
 here it is 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.400
 we will leave photos and the list with the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.370
 links and everything I buy the products 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.720
 where can you get them 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.420
 that is also a link to an old 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.070
 poster a week or so in which 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.460
 it was talked about the ideas that there have been 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.210
 looking and he intended to do less 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.910
 and before a principle the idea of ​​the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.220
 number that is a cooperation based on 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.050
 the script is and so on that so 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.909
 We are leaving very healthy and very careful 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.460
 so that is a pretty correction 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.939
 has a high price let's say it like that 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.799
 then I have chosen to look for some 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.380
 more economical alternative options 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.049
 and so I do not have to talk about 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:59.450
 having me so much is not what it is or has 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:03.859
 been get and 201 pink fuchsia and other 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.929
 violet of the mark arrangement and of the 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.759
 same brand has masks of 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.039
 color they are called ultra color then in 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.500
 you and I think they're called multicolored and 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.110
 because they are very good to keep as 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.720
 insistently this term is something 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.780
 that I want to keep for months and 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.740
 months for a year for example but 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.750
 that we had tried here 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.340
 at least until then because in 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.900
 summer keep colors like this is very 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.180
 complicated and more me that I love 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.620
 get in the pool and on the beach and in 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.210
 everywhere 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.040
 then while you will see I do not have it 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.080
 perfect and if I win if it starts to go no 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.780
 it is important to say that I would not go back to 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.240
 ereros in you I fell in love with a seat 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.800
 my own hair but I searched for that 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.810
 option because I can keep the color 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.350
 several durantes more and more I wanted 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.670
 buy the small size that is a tube 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.210
 there is one that is bigger that is like a 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.840
 bum and this size gives for four uses 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.030
 then how really are two shades 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.880
 the two volumes come out as well 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.980
 appears even for eight let's say so 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.660
 that keep the color as much as you can 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.160
 with that but the number go back to 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.490
 add is not going to use again 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.740
 dye itself 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.580
 that's how it is once it has been discolored 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.160
 quite strong with 40 volumes and 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.440
 decoration with a blue hue that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.240
 soft deco flame as I said I leave it 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.950
 everything in the information box you have 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.900
 a link to go see all the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.450
 products in depth and that explained 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.120
 very well what is each one for and where 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.549
 you can get it 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.980
 I do not know what the packages do not know if you like 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.050
 if I do not know if I do not tell it a bit too 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.750
 you how do you see it 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.820
 but it grows and this has always been my 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.410
 example theory grow then if the 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.250
 hair grows your questions to be able to do 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.840
 things and crazy of do when and good 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.060
 because on the rise I'm still tired or what 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:00.030
 be back to a chestnut and point 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.950
 without anything there is nothing a little I'm going to 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.290
 how much is the head with this 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.020
 may not like it or can it be so clear that 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.790
 I love it, I liked it very much 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.150
 it's true that pink is not so pink 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.560
 how I wanted 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.609
 but well in fact purple I was just going to 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.719
 be purple 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.719
 this layer down here 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.889
 this was just going to be purple 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.860
 and finally I got more purple because 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.199
 It was painful and I was not climbing very 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.759
 strong as I like it are not dyes 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.759
 with the ones he uses other times 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.530
 that already directly the cream has that 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.000
 strong color but they are inks that the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.250
 cream is the color white and is catching 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.249
 color was being oxygenated so 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.349
 tell 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:53.669
 but it is taking color as it goes 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:54.929
 oxygenated so that already there has given me a 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.449
 impression of having to stay so 

00:04:54.929 --> 00:05:00.029
 bright the color as I wanted 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:02.729
 the model so hot has failed a 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:04.829
 little if you see I had to discolor the 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.359
 tips I climbed a lot and I get a lot 

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:08.519
 plus two tips last night say one 

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:11.099
 decoration the joints that go almost 

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:12.779
 white is where more intense in 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.449
 colors projected old hair 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:19.349
 more bleached over white and going to 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:22.289
 a rough yellow to a blonde in clear 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:24.569
 do not see darker and brown and my color 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.129
 of natural hair is what I wanted that already 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.950
 that left like a degraded one also 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:31.260
 that does not make all the tone 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.480
 you are a new one the clearer you 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.880
 have kept then I did not want you not 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.650
 I like the nor with a chestnut I like 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.660
 that all the 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.110
 Same color I like to be more 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.360
 natural with contours plus strands so 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.130
 more credits than others then at 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.840
 also mix in the two colors but 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.210
 I quite like how the 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.710
 mix that they look like that they are all 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.540
 the rites on quite more than the 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.120
 stew 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.370
 purple with pink and with a coral rose there 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.080
 that has become clear 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.090
 and good 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.520
 I know that I will like it more as I go 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.800
 fading the color a little 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.379
 I explain when I was looking at ideas 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.340
 putting pictures / interest in the graphic 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.620
 of painters, ladies and gentlemen 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.360
 the looks that I like most 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.540
 results that I like the most in 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.460
 ticos pies but 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.680
 has more than color 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.070
 very much practically white everything 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.070
 so 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.070
 but I have seen several girls who 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.770
 they are putting as the process not from 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.920
 that only dye they go negative so 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.820
 I 'm re pineapple until the hair goes 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.260
 losing color and I liked it more 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.330
 after several prints that just 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.360
 I love it like that but I know I'm going to 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.560
 Like more as you lose a little 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.320
 of alcohol colors like more 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.350
 worn out so to speak 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.330
 or if I would update you within a month 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.640
 two months as you see how the thing goes 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.960
 to tell you how the color goes and how 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.479
 goes 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.639
 and wearing out to see if I like how 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:05.650
 I think and also that the 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.990
 masks that I'm going to use these ones that 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.310

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.650

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:17.740
 remained of staunch lovers to this look and 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.509
 I see total haters to what 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.490

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:23.620

 something temporary to follow for fun 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:33.190
