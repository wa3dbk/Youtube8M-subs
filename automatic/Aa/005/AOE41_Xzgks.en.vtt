great it still works for what it's
required<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.620> do<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.579> still<00:02:50.790> usable<00:02:51.000> when

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360

programs don't take long to load but one

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.069

issue<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:02.459> faced<00:03:02.819> was<00:03:03.239> lag<00:03:03.599> when<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.930> had

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
issue I faced was lag when I had

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.660 
issue I faced was lag when I had
multiple<00:03:04.590> programs<00:03:05.010> open<00:03:05.220> with<00:03:05.579> the

multiple programs open with the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.339 
multiple programs open with the

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
simultaneous downloads going on at the

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.830 
simultaneous downloads going on at the
same<00:03:07.560> time<00:03:07.739> but<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.639> lag<00:03:08.819> only<00:03:09.120> lasted<00:03:09.569> for<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
same time but the lag only lasted for a

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.870 
same time but the lag only lasted for a
couple<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.200> seconds<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.769> was<00:03:11.099> lag<00:03:11.340> free<00:03:11.579> after

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
couple of seconds and was lag free after

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.750 
couple of seconds and was lag free after
that<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:12.329> wasn't<00:03:12.599> too<00:03:12.630> bad<00:03:13.519> gaming<00:03:14.519> on<00:03:14.639> this

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
of the apps are made for tablets and so

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.659
