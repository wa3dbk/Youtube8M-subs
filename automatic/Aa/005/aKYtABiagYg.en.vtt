about<00:00:35.220> six<00:00:35.519> foot<00:00:35.760> deep<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.720> makes<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.199> big

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559

they call the big jetty or the big pass
that<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:46.890> or<00:00:47.159> the<00:00:47.309> deepest<00:00:47.790> pass<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
that one or the deepest pass in the

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.719 
that one or the deepest pass in the
United<00:00:48.989> States<00:00:49.290> right<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.309> at<00:00:50.400> the<00:00:50.519> tip

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
United States right here at the tip

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:53.780 
United States right here at the tip
right<00:00:51.720> inside<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> past<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.799> about<00:00:53.190> 80<00:00:53.460> foot

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
right inside the past is about 80 foot

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.310 
right inside the past is about 80 foot
deep<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:55.019> what<00:00:55.140> you've<00:00:55.290> got<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:57.140> almost<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
deep so what you've got is almost a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.130 
deep so what you've got is almost a
highway<00:00:58.830> of<00:00:59.489> deep<00:00:59.879> water<00:01:00.150> passage<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.019> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
maybe a mile apart or so we're a large
