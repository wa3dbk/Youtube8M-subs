00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.760
 the safety of a livestock should be 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.120
 an important point if we from 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.710
 small we stumble our animals 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.580
 we will avoid accidents among themselves 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.940
 or to any of our operators 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.880
 today or stepping on our cattle has been 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:29.180
 become a necessity so much for 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.059
 aesthetics as by handling an easy way 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.520
 to trip the animals is to do it 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.400
 when they just have a few days of 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.610
 born between the third and fifth day 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.059
 we can do it using pasta is 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.640
 Cutter this system is very simple 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.860
 so that something without experience 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.150
 you could do it 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.070
 just follow these steps and you'll get it 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.820
 first locate the head of the calf 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.230
 where are the body buttons 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.260
 proceeds to trim the hair that 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.350
 covers revealing each one 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.670
 that the whole area is clear 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.670
 do it widely 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.979
 once uncovered with a glove, 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.689
 to apply it abundantly tries that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.689
 be over the body 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.840
 if by accident the pasta is watered 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.689
 outside the area that you have cleared 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.119
 proceeds to clean the conagua to avoid 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:41.659
 that the skin is eaten and can cause 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.509
 some injury leave it if possible 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.959
 moored just so they do not call it the 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:52.450
 pasta or he himself remove it by scratching 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.450
 so both tread will be successful 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.080
 it may be that the horn can return to 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.350
 leaving in a while means that 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.780
 we have failed in the previous process and 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.250
 we can no longer use the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.250
 pasta again 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.900
 there are two ways that I use to 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.210
 upholster the calves either the days of 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.700
 born with corn dough loves or more 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.380
 forward with the hot iron these 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.690
 two ways guaranteed you that 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.880
 animals will not give you any risk 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.230
 handle them later in a next 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.230
 opportunity with more tips
