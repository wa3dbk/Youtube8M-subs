00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
cut out a bunch of curved edges sort of

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.580 
cut out a bunch of curved edges sort of
like<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.230> shape<00:00:23.480> pieces<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.230> we're<00:00:25.500> gonna

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
like I shape pieces and what we're gonna

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.980 
like I shape pieces and what we're gonna
do<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.980> we're<00:00:26.130> gonna<00:00:26.189> layer<00:00:26.580> them<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.660> that

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
do is we're gonna layer them so that

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.189 
do is we're gonna layer them so that
they<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.699> they<00:00:29.910> create<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:31.080> an

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
they so that they create like an

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.190 
they so that they create like an
armadillo<00:00:31.529> shell<00:00:32.690> alright<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:33.960> I'm<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
armadillo shell alright so I'm going to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.930 
armadillo shell alright so I'm going to
start<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.250> was<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.640> bottom

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
start with this one was just the bottom

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.990 
start with this one was just the bottom
piece<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> lay<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.690> around<00:00:37.309> like<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
piece and lay it around like this it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.250 
piece and lay it around like this it
helps<00:00:39.270> if<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.750> score<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:41.180> which<00:00:42.180> means<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
helps if you score it which means to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.459 
helps if you score it which means to
make<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:44.309> marks<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.690> bottom<00:00:46.079> we're<00:00:46.289> at

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
make little marks in the bottom we're at

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.790 
make little marks in the bottom we're at
the<00:00:46.590> connecting<00:00:47.129> point<00:00:48.320> now<00:00:49.320> we're<00:00:49.440> gonna<00:00:49.530> put

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the connecting point now we're gonna put

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.729 
the connecting point now we're gonna put
another<00:00:49.890> layer<00:00:50.399> take<00:00:50.730> our<00:00:50.850> next<00:00:51.000> layer<00:00:51.270> and

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
another layer take our next layer and

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.319 
another layer take our next layer and
wrap<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.949> around<00:00:53.600> just<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.870> top<00:00:56.030> all<00:00:57.030> right<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
wrap it around just on top all right and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
wrap it around just on top all right and
now<00:00:57.510> our<00:00:57.660> top<00:00:57.870> layer<00:00:58.050> our<00:00:58.320> top<00:00:58.559> layer<00:00:58.710> should

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
now our top layer our top layer should

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.200 
now our top layer our top layer should
be<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.160> little<00:00:59.399> bit<00:00:59.550> longer<00:00:59.789> than<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> other

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
be a little bit longer than the other

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.790 
be a little bit longer than the other
layers<00:01:00.570> because<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.620> need<00:01:01.739> to

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
layers because it's going to need to

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.469 
layers because it's going to need to
curve<00:01:02.219> more<00:01:03.090> toward<00:01:03.920> toward<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> front<00:01:05.479> we're

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
curve more toward toward the front we're

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.469 
curve more toward toward the front we're
gonna<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.780> now<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:06.930> create<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.830> an<00:01:07.979> edge<00:01:11.479> at

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
gonna do now is create like an edge at

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.550 
gonna do now is create like an edge at
the<00:01:12.689> bottom<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.869> by<00:01:16.049> sort<00:01:16.439> of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the bottom and you do that by sort of

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.490 
the bottom and you do that by sort of
cutting<00:01:16.950> out<00:01:19.850> another<00:01:20.850> sort<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.689> half<00:01:21.930> circle

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
cutting out another sort of half circle

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.330 
cutting out another sort of half circle
and<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:23.939> we're<00:01:24.119> gonna<00:01:24.210> make<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.479> head<00:01:25.340> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and now we're gonna make the head the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.130 
and now we're gonna make the head the
head<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.500> it's<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.619> an<00:01:28.770> oval<00:01:29.689> that's<00:01:30.689> a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
head is like it's like an oval that's a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.800 
head is like it's like an oval that's a
little<00:01:31.770> bit<00:01:31.979> fatter<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:32.939> side<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.509> sort

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
little bit fatter on one side and sort

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.440 
little bit fatter on one side and sort
of<00:01:33.930> pointy<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> other<00:01:35.090> alright<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.299> now

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
of pointy on the other alright so now

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.590 
of pointy on the other alright so now
we've<00:01:36.600> got<00:01:36.780> our<00:01:36.810> head<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.180> scrap

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
we've got our head and I have a scrap

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.020 
we've got our head and I have a scrap
piece<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:42.320> flat<00:01:43.320> stuff<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> cut<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
piece of flat stuff that I cut so I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.609 
piece of flat stuff that I cut so I
rolled<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.600> out<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.079> cut<00:01:46.290> those<00:01:46.409> pieces

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
rolled it out and then cut those pieces

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.679 
rolled it out and then cut those pieces
out<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.040> had<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> scrap<00:01:47.520> piece<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.600> I'm

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
out and I had a scrap piece and what I'm

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.510 
out and I had a scrap piece and what I'm
going<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.259> use<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:50.009> make<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.909> ears

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
going to do is use that to make the ears

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.469 
going to do is use that to make the ears
so<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> ears<00:01:53.820> are<00:01:54.649> again<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.680> sort<00:01:56.009> of

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
so the ears are again that sort of

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.880 
so the ears are again that sort of
semicircle<00:01:57.479> shape

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.520 

but<00:02:04.840> folded<00:02:05.840> into<00:02:06.049> itself<00:02:07.040> at<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.399> bottom<00:02:08.530> I'm

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
but folded into itself at the bottom I'm

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:27.790 
but folded into itself at the bottom I'm
going<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.860> tuck<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:11.980> under<00:02:12.980> here

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.930 

and<00:02:30.130> now<00:02:31.130> I'm<00:02:31.280> going<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.790> make<00:02:31.970> some<00:02:33.250> some<00:02:34.250> legs

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
and now I'm going to make some some legs

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.930 
and now I'm going to make some some legs
for<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.480> some<00:02:36.170> claws<00:02:36.800> really<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.460> mean<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.730> legs

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
for it some claws really I mean the legs

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.860 
for it some claws really I mean the legs
are<00:02:38.090> sort<00:02:38.330> of<00:02:38.390> buried<00:02:38.780> under<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.170> shell<00:02:40.870> and

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
are sort of buried under the shell and

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.030 
are sort of buried under the shell and
the<00:02:41.990> way<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.230> I'm<00:02:42.320> going<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.530> do<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.800> is

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
the way that I'm going to do that is

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.750 
the way that I'm going to do that is
roll<00:02:43.370> out<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.880> sort<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.330> oval<00:02:44.600> piece<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.140> then

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
roll out a sort of oval piece and then
