paint<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.060> definitely<00:01:57.180> wanna<00:01:57.510> shake<00:01:57.750> well

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
paint so you definitely wanna shake well

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.290 
paint so you definitely wanna shake well
after<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> shake<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.210> initially<00:02:00.210> you're

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
after you shake it initially you're

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.110 
after you shake it initially you're
gonna<00:02:00.420> depress<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.229> tip<00:02:01.470> down<00:02:01.710> keep<00:02:02.580> shaking

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
gonna depress the tip down keep shaking

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.880 
gonna depress the tip down keep shaking
it<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.360> then<00:02:03.900> a<00:02:04.080> few<00:02:04.320> different<00:02:04.620> times<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
it and then a few different times you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.460 
it and then a few different times you
want<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.100> push<00:02:05.240> down<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:07.050> gonna<00:02:07.140> take<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> few

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
want to push down it's gonna take a few

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.770 
want to push down it's gonna take a few
times<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.159> you<00:02:08.879> can<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.509> get<00:02:09.659> it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
times to get that you can see to get it

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.069 
times to get that you can see to get it
to<00:02:09.869> dispense<00:02:10.760> okay<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.969> then<00:02:12.540> what<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.840> found

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
to dispense okay and then what I found

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.080 
to dispense okay and then what I found
was<00:02:13.439> because<00:02:14.159> of<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.340> fatness<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.879> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
was because of the fatness of the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.380 
was because of the fatness of the
tip<00:02:15.300> I'm<00:02:16.200> able<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.769> really<00:02:17.160> easily<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.000> neatly

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
tip I'm able to really easily and neatly

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.750 
tip I'm able to really easily and neatly
go<00:02:18.930> around<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:21.060> outside<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.760> thing

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
go around the the outside of the thing

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.390 
go around the the outside of the thing
I'm<00:02:24.060> not<00:02:24.540> because<00:02:25.050> it's<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.290> raised<00:02:25.530> point<00:02:26.099> I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
I'm not because it's a raised point I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.000 
I'm not because it's a raised point I
just<00:02:26.730> let<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.239> tip<00:02:27.599> kind<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.230> rest<00:02:28.739> me

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
just let that tip kind of rest me

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.839 
just let that tip kind of rest me
carefully<00:02:29.879> on<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.420> raised<00:02:31.069> letter<00:02:32.069> spots

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
carefully on that raised letter spots

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.800 
carefully on that raised letter spots
and<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.810> seems<00:02:34.049> to<00:02:34.319> do<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> pretty<00:02:35.250> good<00:02:35.340> job

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
and it seems to do a pretty good job

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.470 
and it seems to do a pretty good job
outlining<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.760> mean<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.030> takes<00:02:39.390> some

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
outlining it I mean it takes some

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.289 
outlining it I mean it takes some
patience<00:02:40.019> it<00:02:40.260> takes<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.590> steady<00:02:40.799> hand<00:02:41.299> neither

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
patience it takes a steady hand neither

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.990 
patience it takes a steady hand neither
of<00:02:42.510> which<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:44.370> I'm<00:02:44.489> doing<00:02:44.519> is

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
of which I have but what I'm doing is

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.319 
of which I have but what I'm doing is
kind<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.340> slowly<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.579> then<00:02:47.760> I'm<00:02:47.880> not<00:02:47.970> forcing

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
kind of slowly and then I'm not forcing

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.550 
kind of slowly and then I'm not forcing
and<00:02:48.540> I'm<00:02:48.599> gonna<00:02:48.690> come<00:02:48.900> back<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:49.200> I'm<00:02:49.290> gonna<00:02:49.410> do

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
and I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna do

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.930 
and I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna do
a<00:02:49.590> couple<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.010> coats<00:02:50.750> but<00:02:51.750> if<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.380> look<00:02:52.940> for

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
a couple of coats but if you look for

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.759 
a couple of coats but if you look for
the<00:02:54.030> first<00:02:54.620> coat<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.880> went<00:02:57.569> on<00:02:57.660> fast<00:02:58.019> it<00:02:58.590> went

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
the first coat it went on fast it went

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.490 
the first coat it went on fast it went
on<00:02:58.920> pretty<00:02:59.190> clean<00:02:59.549> and<00:02:59.879> it<00:03:00.810> gave<00:03:00.959> me<00:03:01.110> enough<00:03:01.349> of

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
on pretty clean and it gave me enough of

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.750 
on pretty clean and it gave me enough of
a<00:03:01.620> base<00:03:01.829> that<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:04.110> can<00:03:04.319> come<00:03:04.560> back<00:03:04.769> with<00:03:04.829> in<00:03:05.489> a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
a base that I can come back with in a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.619 
a base that I can come back with in a
little<00:03:06.000> bit<00:03:06.209> into<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.200> second<00:03:07.650> coat<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.629> get

you<00:03:51.599> can<00:03:51.750> see<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.440> don't<00:03:52.560> force<00:03:52.919> it<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.280> first

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
you can see you don't force it the first

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.849 
you can see you don't force it the first
time<00:03:53.730> out<00:03:53.970> it's<00:03:54.630> still<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.870> light<00:03:55.049> coat<00:03:55.349> still

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
using the fat tip right now on these and

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.940 
using the fat tip right now on these and
I'm<00:04:00.030> gonna<00:04:00.180> wait<00:04:00.359> a<00:04:00.389> little<00:04:00.540> bit<00:04:00.690> let<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.739> dry

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
I'm gonna wait a little bit let it dry

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.979

and<00:04:02.160> then<00:04:02.310> add<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.549> second<00:04:02.910> layer<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.269> three

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
and then add a second layer to three

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.690 
and then add a second layer to three
coats<00:04:04.139> later<00:04:04.470> probably<00:04:05.130> three<00:04:05.400> little

coats later probably three little

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.129 
coats later probably three little

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
touch-ups here and there this is the end

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.430 
back from gold rush bars back in the
garage<00:04:40.940> now<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.600> I<00:04:41.660> wanted<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:41.900> follow<00:04:42.050> up<00:04:42.230> on

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
garage now and I wanted to follow up on

garage now and I wanted to follow up on
something<00:04:42.710> on<00:04:42.920> a<00:04:43.010> project<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:43.460> I<00:04:43.520> did

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
something on a project that I did

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.000 
something on a project that I did
basically<00:04:44.330> here's<00:04:45.170> what<00:04:45.440> we've<00:04:45.590> got<00:04:45.620> after

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
basically here's what we've got after

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.080 
basically here's what we've got after
driving<00:04:46.340> about<00:04:46.730> 1,200<00:04:47.480> miles<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:48.850> we're<00:04:49.850> rain

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
driving about 1,200 miles and we're rain

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.880 
driving about 1,200 miles and we're rain
and<00:04:50.450> some<00:04:50.600> other<00:04:50.720> stuff<00:04:51.020> here<00:04:51.230> as<00:04:51.440> you<00:04:51.560> can<00:04:51.710> see

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
and some other stuff here as you can see

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.030 
and some other stuff here as you can see
they've<00:04:52.460> definitely<00:04:52.730> have<00:04:53.570> yellowed<00:04:53.990> but<00:04:54.920> we

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
they've definitely have yellowed but we

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.350 
they've definitely have yellowed but we
talked<00:04:55.310> about<00:04:55.490> that<00:04:55.790> and<00:04:55.970> thought<00:04:56.120> that<00:04:56.300> that

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
talked about that and thought that that

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.350 
talked about that and thought that that
might<00:04:56.630> be<00:04:56.660> something<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:57.050> be<00:04:57.460> expected<00:04:58.460> looks

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
might be something to be expected looks

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.760 
might be something to be expected looks
like<00:04:59.510> there<00:04:59.690> is<00:04:59.720> some<00:04:59.900> like<00:05:00.050> cracking<00:05:00.470> in

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
like there is some like cracking in

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.940 
like there is some like cracking in
there<00:05:00.950> as<00:05:01.130> well<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:03.020> haven't<00:05:03.470> tried<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:03.710> wash

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
there as well I haven't tried to wash

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.250 
there as well I haven't tried to wash
them<00:05:04.220> or<00:05:04.370> do<00:05:04.430> anything<00:05:04.730> to<00:05:04.940> them<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:05.990> I've<00:05:06.110> left

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
them or do anything to them so I've left

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.030 
them or do anything to them so I've left
them<00:05:06.440> like<00:05:06.620> this

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
them like this

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.130 
them like this
you<00:05:07.550> can<00:05:07.730> see<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.120> same<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.630> proxy's

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
you can see the same on the proxy's

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.910 
you can see the same on the proxy's
about<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.560> same<00:05:09.770> condition<00:05:10.310> but<00:05:11.080> well<00:05:12.080> I<00:05:12.320> mean

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
about the same condition but well I mean

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.560 
about the same condition but well I mean
overall<00:05:13.190> not<00:05:13.400> too<00:05:13.430> bad<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:14.060> I<00:05:14.150> was<00:05:14.270> wondering

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
overall not too bad and I was wondering

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.090 
overall not too bad and I was wondering
now<00:05:14.660> if<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:14.900> go<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:15.110> touch<00:05:15.290> up<00:05:15.500> on<00:05:15.650> top<00:05:15.830> of<00:05:16.010> this

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
now if I go and touch up on top of this

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.440 
now if I go and touch up on top of this
what<00:05:16.280> they're<00:05:16.400> gonna<00:05:16.490> look<00:05:16.700> like<00:05:16.760> kind<00:05:17.390> of

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
what they're gonna look like kind of

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.440 
what they're gonna look like kind of
might<00:05:17.600> be<00:05:17.750> my<00:05:17.870> next<00:05:17.930> experiment
