do have the bishop pair that does count
for<00:01:58.100> something<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:59.439> if<00:02:00.439> instead<00:02:00.799> of<00:02:01.130> pawn

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
for something and if instead of pawn

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.760 
for something and if instead of pawn
takes<00:02:02.180> Knight<00:02:02.420> if<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.689> bishop<00:02:02.990> plays<00:02:03.200> here<00:02:03.619> we

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
takes Knight if the bishop plays here we

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.429 
takes Knight if the bishop plays here we
can<00:02:04.009> be<00:02:04.159> developing<00:02:04.790> like<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.780> if<00:02:06.080> Bishop

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
can be developing like so if Bishop

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.710 
can be developing like so if Bishop
takes<00:02:06.860> were<00:02:07.100> there<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.400> recapture<00:02:07.820> it's<00:02:08.569> an

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
takes were there to recapture it's an

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.069 
takes were there to recapture it's an
interesting<00:02:09.229> position<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.629> if<00:02:11.629> the<00:02:11.779> bishop

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
interesting position and if the bishop

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.890 
interesting position and if the bishop
goes<00:02:12.260> home<00:02:12.620> this<00:02:13.279> is<00:02:13.489> one<00:02:13.669> that<00:02:13.819> I<00:02:13.849> thought<00:02:14.659> to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
goes home this is one that I thought to

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.300 
goes home this is one that I thought to
be<00:02:15.379> quite<00:02:15.680> interesting

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
be quite interesting

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.970 
be quite interesting
as<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.520> was<00:02:16.700> reviewing<00:02:16.970> for<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.540> video<00:02:17.810> we<00:02:18.800> can

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
as I was reviewing for this video we can

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.640 
as I was reviewing for this video we can
take<00:02:19.190> on<00:02:19.370> d5<00:02:20.050> allow<00:02:21.050> our<00:02:21.230> Knight<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.530> be

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
take on d5 allow our Knight to be

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.470 
take on d5 allow our Knight to be
captured<00:02:22.130> because<00:02:22.489> we<00:02:22.760> have<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> counter

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
captured because we have a counter

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.880 
captured because we have a counter
attack<00:02:23.569> on<00:02:23.989> g5

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
attack on g5

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.160 
attack on g5
so<00:02:25.700> if<00:02:25.849> pawn<00:02:26.090> takes<00:02:26.360> Knight<00:02:26.599> Queen<00:02:26.630> takes

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
so if pawn takes Knight Queen takes

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.330 
so if pawn takes Knight Queen takes
Knight<00:02:27.380> if<00:02:27.800> Bishop<00:02:28.610> takes<00:02:28.940> pawn<00:02:29.060> King<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.690> d8

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
Knight if Bishop takes pawn King to d8

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.860 
Knight if Bishop takes pawn King to d8
something<00:02:31.340> needs<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.580> be<00:02:31.670> done<00:02:31.760> about<00:02:32.030> g2<00:02:32.599> if

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
something needs to be done about g2 if

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.440 
something needs to be done about g2 if
castles<00:02:33.500> there's<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.310> few<00:02:34.670> interesting<00:02:35.180> moves

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
castles there's a few interesting moves

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.870 
castles there's a few interesting moves
for<00:02:35.720> black<00:02:35.930> here<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.580> one<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.819> I

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
for black here this is the one that I

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.449 
for black here this is the one that I
found<00:02:38.180> most<00:02:38.450> interesting<00:02:38.690> Bishop<00:02:39.470> b7<00:02:40.130> because

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
found most interesting Bishop b7 because

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.479 
found most interesting Bishop b7 because
it's<00:02:40.640> setting<00:02:40.940> up<00:02:41.060> something<00:02:41.330> very<00:02:41.690> deadly

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
it's setting up something very deadly

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.360 
it's setting up something very deadly
the<00:02:43.489> best<00:02:43.700> move<00:02:43.940> is<00:02:44.090> probably<00:02:44.510> Queen<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.989> f3

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
the best move is probably Queen to f3

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.559 
the best move is probably Queen to f3
looks<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.459> little<00:02:46.580> bit<00:02:46.790> scary<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.209> place<00:02:47.420> it

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
looks a little bit scary to place it

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.449 
looks a little bit scary to place it
opposite<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.080> bishop<00:02:48.410> but<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:49.370> to

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
opposite the bishop but just to

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.610 
opposite the bishop but just to
highlight<00:02:49.880> how<00:02:50.150> bad<00:02:50.420> things<00:02:50.720> can<00:02:51.080> get<00:02:51.380> for

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
highlight how bad things can get for

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.920 
highlight how bad things can get for
white<00:02:51.799> something<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:53.030> natural<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.569> Knight<00:02:53.780> to
