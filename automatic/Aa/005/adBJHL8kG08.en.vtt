00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.100 
four different data plans available and
so<00:01:31.829> how<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.280> manage<00:01:32.700> their<00:01:32.729> data<00:01:33.119> will<00:01:33.780> allow

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
so how they manage their data will allow

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.780 
so how they manage their data will allow
how<00:01:34.439> much<00:01:34.619> money<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:35.009> really<00:01:35.280> want<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> spend

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
how much money they really want to spend

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.340 
how much money they really want to spend
them<00:01:35.909> excellent<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.570> allow<00:01:36.869> them<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> have

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
them excellent but allow them to have

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.020 
them excellent but allow them to have
thumbnails<00:01:37.829> which<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.369> an<00:01:38.490> example<00:01:38.759> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
thumbnails which this is an example of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.090 
thumbnails which this is an example of
thumbnails<00:01:39.360> from<00:01:39.869> your<00:01:40.079> individual<00:01:40.680> camera

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
thumbnails from your individual camera

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.310 
thumbnails from your individual camera
so<00:01:41.700> right<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:41.939> I've<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.600> ability<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.200> go

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
so right now I've got the ability to go

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.690 
so right now I've got the ability to go
ahead<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.740> these<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> ones<00:01:44.610> that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
ahead and these are the ones that

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.210 
ahead and these are the ones that
uploaded<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.450> recently<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.619> uploads<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
uploaded just recently so it uploads a

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
uploaded just recently so it uploads a
couple<00:01:47.520> times<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.909> day<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> four<00:01:48.689> times<00:01:48.899> a

couple times a day or up to four times a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
couple times a day or up to four times a
day<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.530> right<00:01:50.009> now<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.490> had<00:01:50.579> activity

less than five cameras they've been each

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.679 
less than five cameras they've been each
individual<00:02:25.280> plan<00:02:25.549> but<00:02:26.090> once<00:02:26.299> you<00:02:26.420> get<00:02:26.540> that
