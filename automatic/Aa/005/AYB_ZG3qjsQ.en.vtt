00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 the center for clinical skills 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.670
 the veterinary college of Hanover 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.680
 poses in this video 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.050
 subcutaneous injection in dogs and 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.650
 cat because the exercise is on a model 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.450
 and that made a material 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.670
 a syringe needs a cannula 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.740
 the injection solution as well as a 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.670
 disposal container and when needed 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.670
 swabs and disinfectants 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.360
 All materials should be within reach 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.880
 lie 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.070
 In practice, the animal ideally becomes 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.560
 fixed by another person and 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.450
 At first the tip gets distracted 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.400
 taken their packaging and that 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.400
 calculated volume wound up 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.540
 is air in the syringe must exist 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.280
 these are removed 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.190
 Following this, the cannula will open 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.070
 the syringe set 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.290
 the infection takes place under the skin 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.680
 lower third of the lateral thorax 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.680
 wall 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.270
 with the three finger thumb thumb 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.829
 index finger middle finger with one 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.049
 raised skin fold 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.810
 The injection will now be in slow motion 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.970
 The cannula is now shown in 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.520
 this created space with a 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.950
 short and fast movement introduced 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.170
 At this point is checked whether 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.110
 The cannula is free to move under the skin 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.350
 is the skin fold is released and 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.759
 the cone is fixed with the fingers 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.509
 before that was a free movement of the 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.970
 cannula is possible first aspirated 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.060
 and if no blood is allowed to be injected 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.060
 become 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.899
 After injection, the cannula becomes 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.299
 removed and disposed of at this point 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.929
 will tip the correct disposal of tips 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.969
 objects demonstrated in connection 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.119
 Disposal will be in slow motion 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.369
 Repeatedly the protective cap lies on the 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.649
 The table with one hand is now the 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.709
 syringe with the attached cannula in 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.750
 this cap pushed forward and this 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.090
 recorded 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.459
 the protective cap is firmly attached and 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.459
 disposed of with the cannula in the container
