00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
you want in apt right so if we take

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.550 
you want in apt right so if we take
these<00:01:18.330> off<00:01:19.100> and<00:01:20.540> let's<00:01:21.540> say<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
these off and let's say we just want to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.270 
these off and let's say we just want to
add<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.729> app<00:01:23.880> store<00:01:24.110> calculator<00:01:25.110> clock<00:01:26.009> and

add the app store calculator clock and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
add the app store calculator clock and
compass<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.689> swipe<00:01:27.900> down<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
compass so then when we swipe down it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.399 
compass so then when we swipe down it
looks<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.400> got<00:01:29.520> some<00:01:29.549> more<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:29.939> here
