hey<00:00:16.700> guys<00:00:17.240> Chad<00:00:17.600> Roth<00:00:17.870> kerbin<00:00:18.230> here<00:00:18.440> in<00:00:19.250> this

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
hey guys Chad Roth kerbin here in this

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.970 
hey guys Chad Roth kerbin here in this
lesson<00:00:19.850> we're<00:00:20.630> gonna<00:00:20.750> focus<00:00:21.050> in<00:00:21.440> on<00:00:21.650> the

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
lesson we're gonna focus in on the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.420 
lesson we're gonna focus in on the
different<00:00:22.430> symbol<00:00:23.029> types<00:00:23.529> now<00:00:24.529> what<00:00:25.190> are

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
different symbol types now what are

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.900 
different symbol types now what are
symbols<00:00:26.090> exactly<00:00:27.040> well<00:00:28.040> they<00:00:28.640> basically

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
symbols exactly well they basically

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.710 
symbols exactly well they basically
allow<00:00:29.450> us<00:00:29.869> to<00:00:30.500> draw<00:00:30.950> out<00:00:31.190> objects<00:00:31.790> or<00:00:31.970> import

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
allow us to draw out objects or import

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.250 
allow us to draw out objects or import
objects<00:00:33.370> convert<00:00:34.370> them<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:34.850> then<00:00:35.540> store<00:00:36.050> them

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
objects convert them and then store them

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.350 
objects convert them and then store them
in<00:00:36.470> our<00:00:36.620> library<00:00:37.220> so<00:00:37.879> that<00:00:38.000> we<00:00:38.090> can<00:00:38.210> have

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
in our library so that we can have

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.840 
in our library so that we can have
access<00:00:38.629> to<00:00:39.080> them<00:00:39.230> in<00:00:39.379> the<00:00:39.470> future<00:00:39.850> for

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
access to them in the future for

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.760 
access to them in the future for
instance<00:00:41.300> let's<00:00:41.989> say<00:00:42.199> you're<00:00:42.379> doing<00:00:42.559> an

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
instance let's say you're doing an

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.310 
instance let's say you're doing an
animated<00:00:43.220> cartoon<00:00:43.430> and<00:00:44.059> you<00:00:44.809> draw<00:00:45.080> out<00:00:45.290> a

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
animated cartoon and you draw out a

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.759 
animated cartoon and you draw out a
character<00:00:46.239> you<00:00:47.239> could<00:00:47.570> save<00:00:48.110> this<00:00:48.320> character

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
character you could save this character

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.640 
character you could save this character
as<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:49.070> symbol<00:00:49.489> store<00:00:50.480> in<00:00:50.690> your<00:00:50.839> library<00:00:51.379> and

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
as a symbol store in your library and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.729 
as a symbol store in your library and
then<00:00:52.400> bring<00:00:52.729> him<00:00:52.760> out<00:00:53.089> in<00:00:53.390> a<00:00:53.780> later<00:00:54.110> document

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
then bring him out in a later document

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.860 
then bring him out in a later document
you<00:00:55.280> can<00:00:55.400> simply<00:00:55.760> drag<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:56.330> drop<00:00:56.390> him<00:00:56.839> from

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
you can simply drag and drop him from

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.290 
you can simply drag and drop him from
the<00:00:57.140> library<00:00:57.589> right<00:00:58.220> onto<00:00:58.489> your<00:00:58.610> new<00:00:58.729> document

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
the library right onto your new document

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.770 
the library right onto your new document
so<00:01:00.140> that's<00:01:00.320> one<00:01:00.680> very<00:01:01.129> simple<00:01:01.519> example<00:01:01.729> of<00:01:02.479> how

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
so that's one very simple example of how

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.219 
so that's one very simple example of how
symbols<00:01:03.470> can<00:01:03.650> be<00:01:03.680> beneficial<00:01:04.159> for<00:01:04.370> you

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
symbols can be beneficial for you

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.530 
symbols can be beneficial for you
to<00:01:06.229> begin<00:01:06.409> we're<00:01:07.310> gonna<00:01:07.400> look<00:01:07.670> at<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.210> three

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
to begin we're gonna look at the three

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.390 
to begin we're gonna look at the three
different<00:01:08.570> types<00:01:09.260> of<00:01:09.440> symbols<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:10.220> you'll

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
different types of symbols that you'll

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.210 
different types of symbols that you'll
be<00:01:10.520> using<00:01:10.549> in<00:01:10.970> flash<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.590> get<00:01:12.740> started

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
in flash you'll be using the different

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.919 
in flash you'll be using the different
symbols<00:01:45.109> for<00:01:45.920> different<00:01:46.280> purposes<00:01:46.929> for

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
for instance you are doing a cartoon

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.660 
for instance you are doing a cartoon
that<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:56.990> wish<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.289> convert<00:01:57.829> to<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> video

later not so much a flash file you'll

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.719 
later not so much a flash file you'll
probably<00:02:02.869> be<00:02:03.289> using<00:02:03.530> graphic<00:02:04.130> symbols<00:02:04.549> the

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
probably be using graphic symbols the

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.230 
probably be using graphic symbols the
most<00:02:05.560> graphic<00:02:06.560> symbols<00:02:07.070> follow<00:02:07.999> the

most graphic symbols follow the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.520 
most graphic symbols follow the
hierarchy<00:02:08.869> of<00:02:09.020> your<00:02:09.950> main<00:02:10.460> timeline<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:12.230> if

movie clip symbols are used primarily

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.720 
movie clip symbols are used primarily
for<00:02:32.290> ActionScript<00:02:33.290> they<00:02:34.010> are<00:02:34.220> great<00:02:34.520> for

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
for ActionScript they are great for

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.930 
for ActionScript they are great for
interactive<00:02:35.270> elements<00:02:35.750> they<00:02:36.290> work<00:02:36.680> well<00:02:36.890> with

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
interactive elements they work well with

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.810 
interactive elements they work well with
ActionScript<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.120> they<00:02:38.900> also<00:02:39.110> work

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
ActionScript and they also work

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.360 
ActionScript and they also work
independent<00:02:40.820> of<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.420> main<00:02:41.600> timeline<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:43.130> for

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
independent of the main timeline so for

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.270 
independent of the main timeline so for
instance<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.880> could<00:02:44.000> have<00:02:44.180> 15<00:02:44.750> frames<00:02:45.230> in<00:02:45.620> the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
instance you could have 15 frames in the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.900 
instance you could have 15 frames in the
movie<00:02:46.640> clip<00:02:46.850> symbol<00:02:47.470> 1<00:02:48.470> frame<00:02:48.950> on<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.730> main

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
movie clip symbol 1 frame on the main

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.150 
movie clip symbol 1 frame on the main

timeline and the movie clip would still

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.580 
timeline and the movie clip would still
play<00:02:52.400> regardless<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.330> how<00:02:53.660> many<00:02:53.720> frames<00:02:54.230> are

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
play regardless of how many frames are

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.300 
play regardless of how many frames are
above<00:02:55.280> it<00:02:55.400> in<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.640> main<00:02:55.820> timeline<00:02:57.310> finally

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
above it in the main timeline finally

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.190 
above it in the main timeline finally
the<00:02:58.460> button<00:02:58.790> symbols<00:02:59.360> while<00:02:59.780> becoming

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
the button symbols while becoming

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.090 
the button symbols while becoming
obsolete<00:03:00.560> mainly<00:03:01.460> because<00:03:01.790> now<00:03:02.000> most

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
obsolete mainly because now most

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.010 
obsolete mainly because now most
developers<00:03:04.100> use<00:03:04.370> movie<00:03:04.700> clips<00:03:05.000> as<00:03:05.210> buttons<00:03:05.810> is

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
developers use movie clips as buttons is

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.340 
developers use movie clips as buttons is
programming<00:03:06.980> be<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.400> way<00:03:07.870> buttons<00:03:08.870> allow

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
programming be that way buttons allow

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.000 
programming be that way buttons allow
you<00:03:09.410> to<00:03:09.950> plop<00:03:10.760> in<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.360> symbol<00:03:11.990> and<00:03:12.230> basically

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
you to plop in a symbol and basically

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.850 
you to plop in a symbol and basically
edit<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.580> up<00:03:13.760> over<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.510> down<00:03:14.690> States<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.620> that

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
edit the up over and down States so that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.040 
edit the up over and down States so that
when<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.490> put<00:03:16.700> your<00:03:16.790> mouse<00:03:16.940> button<00:03:17.000> or<00:03:17.750> your

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
when you put your mouse button or your

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.800 
when you put your mouse button or your
mouse<00:03:18.230> cursor<00:03:18.800> over<00:03:18.980> it<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.940> changes<00:03:20.570> when<00:03:20.750> you

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
mouse cursor over it it changes when you

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.950 
mouse cursor over it it changes when you
click<00:03:21.200> on<00:03:21.380> it<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.740> changes<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:22.910> on<00:03:23.090> so

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
click on it it changes and so on so

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.720 
click on it it changes and so on so
those<00:03:24.230> are<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.710> differences<00:03:25.040> between<00:03:25.340> the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
those are the differences between the

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.480 
those are the differences between the
three<00:03:25.760> but<00:03:26.660> now<00:03:26.810> let's<00:03:27.110> go<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.650> do<00:03:28.280> some

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
three but now let's go in and do some

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.490 
three but now let's go in and do some
work<00:03:28.670> on<00:03:28.820> this<00:03:29.180> project<00:03:29.450> so<00:03:29.960> we<00:03:30.080> can<00:03:30.230> see

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
work on this project so we can see

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.150 
work on this project so we can see
exactly<00:03:31.070> what's<00:03:31.430> going<00:03:31.490> on<00:03:31.820> here<00:03:32.920> let's<00:03:33.920> focus

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
exactly what's going on here let's focus

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.130 
exactly what's going on here let's focus
in<00:03:34.520> on<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:35.180> differences<00:03:35.660> between<00:03:35.720> the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
in on the differences between the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.400 
in on the differences between the
graphic<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.830> movie<00:03:37.100> clip<00:03:37.310> symbols<00:03:37.730> first<00:03:38.410> so

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
graphic and movie clip symbols first so

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.650 
graphic and movie clip symbols first so
if<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:39.830> could<00:03:40.070> direct<00:03:40.700> your<00:03:40.970> attention<00:03:41.090> down

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
if you could direct your attention down

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.470 
if you could direct your attention down
to<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.170> bottom<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.950> timeline<00:03:43.489> you'll

in the timeline so now let's back out to
the<00:04:30.740> main<00:04:30.919> timeline<00:04:32.919> now<00:04:33.919> let's<00:04:34.160> play<00:04:34.520> this

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
the main timeline now let's play this

test movie
test<00:04:45.370> you'll<00:04:46.370> notice<00:04:46.700> that<00:04:46.880> when<00:04:47.060> we<00:04:47.150> play

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
test you'll notice that when we play

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.920 
test you'll notice that when we play
this<00:04:47.660> that<00:04:48.650> both<00:04:49.430> of<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:50.330> graphic<00:04:50.810> a

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.550 
movieclip
symbols<00:04:52.160> play<00:04:52.460> exactly<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.570> same<00:04:53.630> and<00:04:54.140> that's

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
symbols play exactly the same and that's

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.170 
symbols play exactly the same and that's
again<00:04:54.920> because<00:04:55.280> we<00:04:55.490> have<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:55.970> matching

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
again because we have the matching

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.380 
again because we have the matching
frames<00:04:56.780> in<00:04:57.170> each<00:04:57.800> symbol<00:04:58.280> as<00:04:58.490> well<00:04:58.790> as<00:04:59.030> the

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
frames in each symbol as well as the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.140 
frames in each symbol as well as the
main<00:04:59.570> timeline<00:05:02.380> now<00:05:03.490> one<00:05:04.490> thing<00:05:04.640> to<00:05:04.700> point<00:05:05.030> out

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
main timeline now one thing to point out

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.640 
main timeline now one thing to point out
too<00:05:05.450> is<00:05:05.660> you'll<00:05:06.230> notice<00:05:06.650> as<00:05:06.860> we<00:05:07.490> page<00:05:07.880> through

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650

this movie with our frames that the
graphic<00:05:15.320> changes<00:05:16.220> depending<00:05:16.760> on<00:05:16.940> where<00:05:17.840> it's

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
graphic changes depending on where it's

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.090 
graphic changes depending on where it's
at<00:05:18.260> in<00:05:18.530> its<00:05:18.740> timeline<00:05:19.340> for<00:05:20.090> instance<00:05:20.510> in<00:05:21.320> this

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
at in its timeline for instance in this

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.790 
at in its timeline for instance in this
graphic<00:05:22.640> symbol<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.660> color<00:05:23.930> changes<00:05:24.590> at

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
graphic symbol the color changes at

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.290 
graphic symbol the color changes at
frame<00:05:25.430> five<00:05:25.730> and<00:05:26.090> we<00:05:26.510> see<00:05:26.840> that<00:05:27.020> reflect<00:05:27.590> on

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
frame five and we see that reflect on

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.180 
frame five and we see that reflect on
the<00:05:29.300> main<00:05:29.510> stage<00:05:29.810> we<00:05:30.200> can<00:05:30.350> visually<00:05:30.860> see<00:05:30.890> that

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
the main stage we can visually see that

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.000 
the main stage we can visually see that
now<00:05:32.180> with<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.480> movie<00:05:32.780> clip<00:05:33.080> even<00:05:33.560> though<00:05:33.740> the

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
now with the movie clip even though the

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.580 
now with the movie clip even though the
same<00:05:34.250> occurs<00:05:34.760> that<00:05:35.480> it<00:05:35.630> changes<00:05:36.050> color<00:05:36.140> on

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
same occurs that it changes color on

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.460 
same occurs that it changes color on
frame<00:05:36.980> five<00:05:37.550> we<00:05:38.390> don't<00:05:38.600> see<00:05:38.930> that<00:05:39.110> on<00:05:39.320> the

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
frame five we don't see that on the

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.870 
frame five we don't see that on the
stage<00:05:39.970> so<00:05:40.970> that's<00:05:41.120> one<00:05:41.450> difference<00:05:41.870> between

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
stage so that's one difference between

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.980 
stage so that's one difference between
graphics<00:05:43.880> and<00:05:44.030> movie<00:05:44.300> clips<00:05:44.570> is<00:05:44.750> that

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
graphics and movie clips is that

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.740 
graphics and movie clips is that
graphics<00:05:45.470> are<00:05:45.620> more<00:05:45.830> visual<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:46.480> movie<00:05:47.480> clips

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
graphics are more visual and movie clips

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.660 
graphics are more visual and movie clips
are<00:05:47.960> not<00:05:48.290> so<00:05:48.530> much<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:48.950> again<00:05:49.280> this<00:05:49.520> is

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
are not so much and again this is

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.070 
are not so much and again this is
because<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.360> movie<00:05:50.630> clips<00:05:51.520> run<00:05:52.520> on<00:05:52.790> their<00:05:53.030> own

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
because the movie clips run on their own

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.930 
because the movie clips run on their own
timeline<00:05:54.080> and<00:05:54.380> they<00:05:54.800> don't<00:05:55.010> depend<00:05:55.220> on<00:05:55.580> the

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
timeline and they don't depend on the

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.159 
timeline and they don't depend on the
main<00:05:56.150> timeline<00:05:57.760> now<00:05:58.760> let's<00:05:59.360> take<00:05:59.660> this<00:05:59.900> a<00:06:00.110> step

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
main timeline now let's take this a step

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:06.640 
main timeline now let's take this a step
further<00:06:01.540> let's<00:06:02.540> remove<00:06:03.260> the<00:06:03.830> frames<00:06:04.220> on<00:06:05.650> this

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
further let's remove the frames on this

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.250 
further let's remove the frames on this
timeline<00:06:07.130> to<00:06:07.430> frame<00:06:07.760> one<00:06:08.240> to<00:06:08.690> demonstrate

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
timeline to frame one to demonstrate

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.250 
timeline to frame one to demonstrate
this<00:06:09.470> a<00:06:09.650> little<00:06:09.980> bit<00:06:10.070> further<00:06:10.810> so<00:06:11.810> take<00:06:12.110> your

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
graphic symbol does not play because we

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.450 
graphic symbol does not play because we
eliminated<00:06:52.789> the<00:06:53.539> main<00:06:53.840> timeline<00:06:54.260> frames

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
eliminated the main timeline frames

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.910 
eliminated the main timeline frames
even<00:06:55.940> though<00:06:56.090> it<00:06:56.270> still<00:06:56.480> contains<00:06:56.930> 13<00:06:57.560> frames

it<00:06:58.220> cannot<00:06:58.700> play<00:06:59.090> if<00:06:59.990> the<00:07:00.200> main<00:07:00.410> timeline

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
it cannot play if the main timeline

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.180 
it cannot play if the main timeline
doesn't<00:07:01.370> have<00:07:01.550> those<00:07:01.760> frames<00:07:02.210> to<00:07:02.450> play<00:07:02.660> it

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
doesn't have those frames to play it

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.610 
doesn't have those frames to play it
meanwhile<00:07:04.190> the<00:07:04.490> movie<00:07:04.760> clip<00:07:05.060> moves

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620 
meanwhile the movie clip moves

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.930 
meanwhile the movie clip moves
independently<00:07:06.620> it<00:07:07.010> just<00:07:07.340> goes<00:07:07.550> through<00:07:07.580> the

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940 
independently it just goes through the

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.230 
independently it just goes through the
cycle<00:07:08.900> no<00:07:09.440> matter<00:07:09.680> how<00:07:10.100> many<00:07:10.280> frames<00:07:10.700> are<00:07:11.000> on

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:14.630 
the main timeline so movie clip symbols

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.320 
the main timeline so movie clip symbols
are<00:07:14.810> great<00:07:15.170> for<00:07:15.410> looping<00:07:15.770> animations<00:07:16.400> well

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330 
are great for looping animations well

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.200 
are great for looping animations well
after<00:07:17.720> the<00:07:17.840> movie<00:07:18.110> has<00:07:18.320> stopped<00:07:19.040> if<00:07:19.430> you<00:07:19.850> stop

after the movie has stopped if you stop

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.940 
after the movie has stopped if you stop
the<00:07:20.420> movie<00:07:20.690> and<00:07:20.840> you<00:07:20.930> want<00:07:21.200> a<00:07:21.470> looping

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:21.950 
the movie and you want a looping

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.220 
the movie and you want a looping
animation<00:07:22.460> to<00:07:22.550> continue<00:07:23.060> that's<00:07:23.840> what<00:07:24.200> a

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
animation to continue that's what a

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.560 
animation to continue that's what a
movie<00:07:24.560> clip<00:07:24.710> would<00:07:25.040> be<00:07:25.190> good<00:07:25.400> for<00:07:25.730> in<00:07:26.030> a

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.570 
movie clip would be good for in a

movie clip would be good for in a
graphical<00:07:27.140> sense
