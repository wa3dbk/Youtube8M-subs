let's<00:00:07.780> show<00:00:07.900> you<00:00:07.960> how<00:00:08.050> to<00:00:08.110> do<00:00:08.320> a<00:00:08.350> provisional

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
let's show you how to do a provisional

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.200 
let's show you how to do a provisional
cast-on<00:00:09.550> and<00:00:09.970> you<00:00:10.540> would<00:00:10.660> use<00:00:10.809> a<00:00:10.840> provisional

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
cast-on and you would use a provisional

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.640 
cast-on and you would use a provisional
time<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.780> needed<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.320> life

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
time you needed to have life

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
at one end of your knitting so that you

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.019 
at one end of your knitting so that you
could<00:00:17.050> add<00:00:17.380> to<00:00:17.920> the<00:00:18.340> other<00:00:18.460> side<00:00:18.730> of<00:00:18.880> your

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
could add to the other side of your

knitting and I'll show you what I mean

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.529 
knitting and I'll show you what I mean
by<00:00:20.800> that<00:00:20.950> in<00:00:21.189> just<00:00:21.220> a<00:00:21.430> few<00:00:21.460> minutes<00:00:21.700> there's<00:00:22.360> a

by that in just a few minutes there's a

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.499 
by that in just a few minutes there's a
lot<00:00:22.869> of<00:00:23.110> different<00:00:23.619> methods<00:00:24.580> for<00:00:24.880> doing<00:00:25.420> a

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
lot of different methods for doing a

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.380 
lot of different methods for doing a

stitch crochet chain stitch I find this
just<00:00:34.120> to<00:00:34.450> be<00:00:34.480> the<00:00:34.660> easiest<00:00:34.930> method<00:00:35.350> but<00:00:35.530> it's

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
just to be the easiest method but it's

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.700 
just to be the easiest method but it's
certainly<00:00:35.950> just<00:00:36.040> personal<00:00:36.640> preference<00:00:37.710> you

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.100 
here's one chain and when you're done
with<00:01:21.070> your<00:01:21.100> crochet<00:01:21.760> chain<00:01:22.030> loop<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.480> like<00:01:22.960> to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
with your crochet chain loop I like to

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.880 
with your crochet chain loop I like to
just<00:01:23.320> take<00:01:23.410> the<00:01:23.770> end<00:01:23.980> of<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:25.270> chain<00:01:25.540> and<00:01:25.890> put

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
just take the end of the chain and put

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.370 
just take the end of the chain and put
it<00:01:27.010> through<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:28.150> last<00:01:28.540> link<00:01:28.900> there<00:01:29.080> just

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
it through the last link there just

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.790 
it through the last link there just
really<00:01:29.740> loosely<00:01:30.040> and<00:01:30.600> don't<00:01:31.600> pull<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.810> tight

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
really loosely and don't pull it tight

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.830 
really loosely and don't pull it tight
because<00:01:33.220> you're<00:01:33.370> gonna<00:01:33.460> need<00:01:33.550> to<00:01:33.820> undo<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.210> but

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
because you're gonna need to undo it but

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.300 
because you're gonna need to undo it but
that<00:01:35.140> just<00:01:35.320> helps<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.830> keep<00:01:35.980> it<00:01:36.160> from

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
that just helps to keep it from

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
that just helps to keep it from
unraveling<00:01:36.550> while<00:01:37.120> you're<00:01:37.330> working<00:01:37.660> on<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:38.040> so

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
unraveling while you're working on it so

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.530 
unraveling while you're working on it so
when<00:01:41.140> we<00:01:41.170> work<00:01:41.620> on<00:01:41.920> our<00:01:42.490> crochet<00:01:42.970> chain<00:01:43.270> loop

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
when we work on our crochet chain loop

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.570 
when we work on our crochet chain loop
we're<00:01:43.810> going<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.020> work<00:01:44.260> in<00:01:44.470> these<00:01:44.620> these<00:01:45.250> back

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
we're going to work in these these back

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.140 
we're going to work in these these back
stitches<00:01:46.540> right<00:01:46.750> here<00:01:47.700> these<00:01:48.700> are<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:48.970> back

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150

stitches<00:05:02.050> over<00:05:02.439> here<00:05:02.740> on<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:02.979> end

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
stitches over here on the end

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.820 
stitches over here on the end
so<00:05:05.500> you'll<00:05:05.979> undo<00:05:06.520> this<00:05:07.029> little<00:05:07.500> safety<00:05:08.500> loop

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
so you'll undo this little safety loop

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.369 
so you'll undo this little safety loop
that<00:05:09.069> we<00:05:09.189> did<00:05:09.400> here<00:05:09.840> you<00:05:10.840> can<00:05:11.020> start

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
that we did here you can start

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.879 
that we did here you can start
unraveling<00:05:11.889> a<00:05:12.250> little<00:05:12.490> bit<00:05:13.319> and<00:05:14.319> it<00:05:14.439> should<00:05:14.740> if

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
unraveling a little bit and it should if

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.110 
unraveling a little bit and it should if
you've<00:05:15.069> done<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.279> correctly<00:05:15.400> through<00:05:16.029> the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
you've done it correctly through the

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.869 
you've done it correctly through the
back<00:05:16.300> loops<00:05:16.680> this<00:05:17.680> waste<00:05:18.219> yarn<00:05:18.460> will<00:05:18.699> just

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
back loops this waste yarn will just

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:21.029 
back loops this waste yarn will just
pull<00:05:19.150> right<00:05:19.180> off<00:05:19.539> so<00:05:20.500> I'm<00:05:20.590> going<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:20.770> catch

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
pull right off so I'm going to catch

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:26.879 
pull right off so I'm going to catch
this<00:05:21.370> first<00:05:21.729> stitch<00:05:22.300> here<00:05:25.139> okay<00:05:26.139> and<00:05:26.500> then<00:05:26.800> I

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
this first stitch here okay and then I

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.629 
this first stitch here okay and then I
just<00:05:27.069> pulled<00:05:27.460> my<00:05:28.169> waste<00:05:29.169> yarn<00:05:29.469> and<00:05:29.830> it<00:05:30.039> freed

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
just pulled my waste yarn and it freed

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.600 
just pulled my waste yarn and it freed
up<00:05:30.669> that<00:05:30.969> stitch<00:05:31.889> I'm<00:05:32.889> gonna<00:05:33.099> go<00:05:33.249> into<00:05:33.490> the

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
up that stitch I'm gonna go into the

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.649 
up that stitch I'm gonna go into the
next<00:05:33.789> stitch<00:05:34.860> pull<00:05:35.860> my<00:05:36.009> waste<00:05:36.219> yarn<00:05:36.490> again<00:05:36.669> and

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
next stitch pull my waste yarn again and

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:42.089 
next stitch pull my waste yarn again and
it'll<00:05:37.870> release<00:05:38.199> that<00:05:38.439> stitch<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:41.620> just<00:05:41.650> keep

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
it'll release that stitch you just keep

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:56.310 
it'll release that stitch you just keep
doing<00:05:42.430> this<00:05:42.580> all<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.240> way<00:05:43.360> down<00:05:43.629> the<00:05:43.810> row

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.260 

sometimes<00:05:57.100> they<00:05:57.280> get<00:05:57.430> a<00:05:57.460> little<00:05:57.700> hung<00:05:57.850> up<00:05:57.970> just

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
sometimes they get a little hung up just

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.880 
sometimes they get a little hung up just
because<00:05:58.420> of<00:05:58.630> all<00:05:58.750> the<00:05:58.870> fuzz<00:05:59.110> in<00:05:59.380> the<00:05:59.470> yard<00:05:59.650> and

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
because of all the fuzz in the yard and

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:15.749 
because of all the fuzz in the yard and
that's

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:18.399 

the<00:06:16.759> last<00:06:16.939> one<00:06:17.149> can<00:06:17.360> be<00:06:17.419> a<00:06:17.539> little<00:06:17.779> bit<00:06:17.989> tricky

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:18.409 
the last one can be a little bit tricky

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.339 
the last one can be a little bit tricky
to<00:06:18.439> find<00:06:18.679> because<00:06:18.949> it<00:06:19.189> tends<00:06:19.519> to<00:06:19.610> get<00:06:20.349> tight

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
to find because it tends to get tight

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:27.850 
to find because it tends to get tight
and<00:06:25.839> I'm<00:06:26.839> gonna<00:06:27.019> pull<00:06:27.169> it<00:06:27.289> this<00:06:27.409> way<00:06:27.469> just

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
and I'm gonna pull it this way just

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.499 
and I'm gonna pull it this way just
because<00:06:28.069> I<00:06:28.189> had<00:06:28.339> a<00:06:28.369> lot<00:06:28.550> of<00:06:28.580> extra<00:06:28.879> stitches<00:06:29.360> in

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509 
because I had a lot of extra stitches in

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:34.269 
because I had a lot of extra stitches in
there<00:06:30.069> so<00:06:31.069> now<00:06:31.389> I've<00:06:32.389> got<00:06:32.779> two<00:06:33.409> sets<00:06:33.769> of<00:06:33.919> live

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
there so now I've got two sets of live

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:38.350 
there so now I've got two sets of live
stitches<00:06:35.169> and<00:06:36.169> the<00:06:36.919> benefit<00:06:37.519> to<00:06:37.699> this<00:06:37.849> is<00:06:38.119> that

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
stitches and the benefit to this is that

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.259 
stitches and the benefit to this is that
now<00:06:38.659> I<00:06:39.050> can<00:06:39.169> add<00:06:39.769> my<00:06:40.189> other<00:06:40.339> two<00:06:40.610> needles<00:06:40.969> my

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:41.269 
now I can add my other two needles my

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:43.089 
now I can add my other two needles my
other<00:06:41.360> two<00:06:41.569> double<00:06:41.899> pointed<00:06:42.199> needles<00:06:42.529> and<00:06:42.949> I

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:43.099 
other two double pointed needles and I

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:44.769 
other two double pointed needles and I
can<00:06:43.279> go<00:06:43.429> ahead<00:06:43.550> and<00:06:43.699> start<00:06:44.089> working<00:06:44.539> in<00:06:44.659> the

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:44.779 
can go ahead and start working in the

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:46.659 
can go ahead and start working in the
round<00:06:44.929> and<00:06:45.379> then<00:06:45.800> this<00:06:45.979> will<00:06:46.129> be<00:06:46.189> the<00:06:46.309> toe<00:06:46.550> of

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
round and then this will be the toe of

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.379 
round and then this will be the toe of
myself<00:06:47.059> I<00:06:48.489> didn't<00:06:49.489> really<00:06:49.699> cast<00:06:49.909> on<00:06:50.149> enough

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
myself I didn't really cast on enough

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.319 
myself I didn't really cast on enough
stitches<00:06:50.659> to<00:06:51.110> show<00:06:52.069> you<00:06:52.129> how<00:06:52.399> to<00:06:52.459> add<00:06:52.639> all<00:06:52.999> four

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:53.329 
stitches to show you how to add all four

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:57.339 
stitches to show you how to add all four
needles<00:06:53.589> but<00:06:55.569> just<00:06:56.569> to<00:06:56.779> show<00:06:56.959> you<00:06:57.050> how<00:06:57.289> you

00:06:57.339 --> 00:06:57.349 
needles but just to show you how you

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:00.159 
needles but just to show you how you
would<00:06:57.559> start<00:06:57.679> knitting<00:06:58.009> on<00:06:58.219> it<00:06:58.719> and<00:06:59.719> then<00:07:00.050> you

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:00.169 
would start knitting on it and then you

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.979 
would start knitting on it and then you
can<00:07:00.579> you<00:07:01.579> know<00:07:01.699> if<00:07:01.879> you<00:07:02.029> are<00:07:02.179> doing<00:07:02.389> the<00:07:02.599> toe<00:07:02.809> of

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:02.989 
can you know if you are doing the toe of

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.769 
can you know if you are doing the toe of
the<00:07:03.019> sock<00:07:03.259> you<00:07:03.559> could<00:07:03.769> do<00:07:04.389> start<00:07:05.389> doing<00:07:05.629> your

00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:05.779 
the sock you could do start doing your

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:10.689 
the sock you could do start doing your
increases<00:07:07.689> and<00:07:08.689> then<00:07:08.929> I<00:07:09.249> would<00:07:10.249> just<00:07:10.279> slide

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:10.699 
increases and then I would just slide

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:15.969 
increases and then I would just slide
this<00:07:10.909> over<00:07:11.300> and<00:07:12.219> knit<00:07:13.219> these<00:07:14.529> and<00:07:15.529> like<00:07:15.679> I<00:07:15.800> said

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:15.979 
this over and knit these and like I said

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:17.169 
this over and knit these and like I said
if<00:07:16.069> you're<00:07:16.189> really<00:07:16.309> doing<00:07:16.519> a<00:07:16.669> toe<00:07:16.849> of<00:07:16.969> the<00:07:16.999> sock

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:17.179 
if you're really doing a toe of the sock

00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:18.429 
if you're really doing a toe of the sock
you're<00:07:17.360> gonna<00:07:17.479> have<00:07:17.689> four<00:07:17.959> needles<00:07:18.169> you're

00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:18.439 
you're gonna have four needles you're

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:19.600 
you're gonna have four needles you're
not<00:07:18.559> gonna<00:07:18.679> have<00:07:18.860> to<00:07:19.039> and<00:07:19.249> you're<00:07:19.339> gonna<00:07:19.429> have

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:19.610 
not gonna have to and you're gonna have

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.669 
not gonna have to and you're gonna have
a<00:07:19.669> lot<00:07:19.819> more<00:07:19.849> stitches<00:07:20.389> but<00:07:20.959> that's<00:07:21.199> just<00:07:21.499> the

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:21.679 
a lot more stitches but that's just the

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:23.619 
a lot more stitches but that's just the
basic<00:07:22.009> premise<00:07:22.909> of<00:07:23.059> how<00:07:23.209> to<00:07:23.269> use<00:07:23.599> a

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:23.629 
basic premise of how to use a

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:25.629 
basic premise of how to use a
provisional<00:07:24.229> cast<00:07:24.439> on<00:07:24.649> and<00:07:25.279> I'll<00:07:25.399> show<00:07:25.610> you

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 
provisional cast on and I'll show you

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.049 
provisional cast on and I'll show you
I've<00:07:25.909> got<00:07:26.089> a<00:07:26.119> project<00:07:26.389> already<00:07:27.229> started<00:07:28.059> this

00:07:29.049 --> 00:07:29.059 
I've got a project already started this

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:31.389 
I've got a project already started this
is<00:07:29.240> a<00:07:29.269> sock<00:07:29.569> I<00:07:29.749> started<00:07:30.139> last<00:07:30.319> night<00:07:30.559> and<00:07:31.219> I

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:31.399 
is a sock I started last night and I

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:34.029 
is a sock I started last night and I
used<00:07:31.639> that<00:07:31.729> provisional<00:07:32.300> cast<00:07:32.569> on<00:07:32.779> so<00:07:33.769> you<00:07:33.860> can

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 
used that provisional cast on so you can

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:38.169 
used that provisional cast on so you can
see<00:07:34.839> how<00:07:35.839> the<00:07:35.899> toe<00:07:36.259> looks<00:07:36.699> you've<00:07:37.699> got<00:07:37.879> a<00:07:37.909> nice
