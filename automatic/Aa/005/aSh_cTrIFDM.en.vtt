 pixar animation company 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.110
 go for the cartoon puzzle 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.150
 originated from the pit when he watched 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.250
 growing up his daughter pete says that 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.070
 could not understand how so a few more years 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.130
 back she was active and cheerful and here I am 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.780
 and 11 it is quiet and closed it 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.690
 interested in the idea of ​​working with 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.610
 abstractions bottom of the brain of the masses of the mind and he 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.020
 decided that this angle would be perfect and 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.970
 just for animation 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.770
 the plot of the cartoon is rather strange on 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.560
 first look because the main character in it 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.420
 not people but emotions in the head of an 11-year-old 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.659
 girl riley and experiencing difficulties 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.010
 transitional age is present 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.049
 headquarters with remote control for 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.330
 who work hard 5 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.640
 emotions their main task to help the hostess 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.320
 survive a difficult period in another city 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.030
 honestly I was very skeptical 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.590
 set up before going to the cartoon but 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.750
 when looked it was crowded 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.909
 I really liked the emotions 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.190
 original pita doctor idea you only 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.320
 think about it, the man thought and set 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.540
 cartoon whose main idea was 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.909
 climb into the head of a little girl and 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.830
 artistically describe everything to the viewer 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.840
 the emotions that she feels in 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.729
 transition age only this already 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.950
 talks about drinking and how about ingenious 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.410
 man and artist as well as a picture of the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.540
 It was presented is just fantastic 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.640
 perfect script 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.560
 almost nothing to complain about well except 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.450
 u to the fact that a person has much more 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.819
 emotions than 5 but it can be easily understood 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.099
 why make porridge out of the picture is enough 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.290
 beat the main screenwriters worked with 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.359
 my neuropathologist and psychologists 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.280
 to better understand how the brain works 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.439
 together with the artists they tried 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.510
 understand how memory works understand 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.579
 principles of human 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.290
 emotions are how they change during 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.689
 growing up they even had their 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.519
 consultant Dr. Kilt World Professor 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:45.040
 psychology which is 25 years of his career 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.109
 devoted to the study of human emotions 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.970
 Kempner helped filmmakers choose 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.220
 emotions that later became 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.439
 the main characters of the movie I really 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.359
 was shocked while watching how much 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.120
 you need to be talented to have a big 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:00.280
 fantasy to realize such an idea and 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.319
 like this artistic striking and 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.090
 reveal the artistic side of the picture 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.280
 very much printed in your head 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.290
 believe me I think many will notice how 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.329
 colorfully worked as a picture 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.919
 changing colors of episodes 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.419
 animators decided even 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.609
 register a separate set of rules 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.560
 the existence of each of the worlds to 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.049
 help viewers to understand exactly which 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.459
 world they are in each of the scenes in 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.709
 to the outer human world they 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.209
 used a range of light tones low 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.069
 color saturation and small 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.349
 contrast to achieve more 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.479
 realism and here the world consciousness was where 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.129
 more colorful bright also to me 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.349
 liked it as worked 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.329
 characters will not be expressive 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.849
 This and so clear emotions same 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.560
 but here it is just like a fairy tale look 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.419
 animators used new technology 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.519
 did not use geometric 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.889
 lighting so that the character is joy 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.260
 more vibrant and and intentionally made 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.419
 glowing from the inside out so she 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.129
 yourself became a light source is it you 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.109
 may notice when she is anything 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.579
 touches turning sketches 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.979
 characters in computer graphics 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.109
 engaged not anyhow who they taught 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.669
 who also worked on characters in 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.099
 king left and aladdine 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.019
 the humor in the picture is beautiful too not stupid 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.479
 quality I have many times well 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.889
 the doctor himself laughed heartily 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.689
 he was lucky to work with him 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.849
 phenomenal actor and many jokes 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.949
 born precisely because of them during 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.560
 filming and until you look wait 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.719
 captions there are also very funny scenes of what 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.190
 only there is a scene with cats still 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:26.330
 I liked how much in the cartoon 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.889
 obvious pronounced metaphors are not 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.840
 for example very much liked with 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.789
 bingo bongo character who was 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.099
 the personification of childhood probably any 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.780
 human and this dramatic turn in 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:38.210
 chasms of oblivion straight to crawl 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.919
 sneaks dramatic side into 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.199
 I even liked the picture 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.110
 more than a funny cartoon will dip you 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:46.460
 in childhood and ride on the warmest 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.620
 memory this picture is generally much 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.930
 closer to an adult than a child 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.909
 an adult will get much more emotion 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.830
 Cartoon very deep it apart 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:56.840
 teenage problems and talks about 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.909
 how hard it is to be a parent about what 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.889
 Parent goal is not to finish off 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.509
 and force your children to 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.460
 guide and hint 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.639
 Trailer by the way does not transmit at all 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.889
 the atmosphere of the cartoon is not content in general 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.569
 this is ingenious emotional deep 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.669
 picture with beautiful humor from 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.919

 modern films much more often 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.090
 bring a lot of emotions anyway 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.949
 The chance that you look some
