00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello welcome to the video channel 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.519
 of the Maggiolina cultural association 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.490
 with this video one night begins 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.950
 new series of our videos 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.590
 which we will call the course of 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.770
 basic computer science ie in these 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.660
 future videos that you can see of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.539
 following 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.820
 we will talk about basic computer then a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.240
 computer course for those who know nothing 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.460
 for those who start from scratch so if you are 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.590
 already used computers this course does not 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.800
 for you but maybe then interest in the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.390
 grandfather to aunt her husband then to all 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.700
 those people who don't know how to use 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.320
 the computer that maybe you already have too 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.149
 tried to teach but in the end vi 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.520
 always find to fight 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.390
 or to all those people who 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.250
 they already use the computer they have 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.020
 learned alone and use it go up 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.840
 internet do e-mails and so on 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.090
 but when it's time to create a folder or 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.120
 to transfer photos from the machine 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.129
 digital or from mobile phone to computer or 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.170
 when it comes to saving a file or 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.560
 changing his name is not able to do so 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.700
 so this course is for them to 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.970
 which I will try to have a language 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.090
 simple and above all of 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.729
 go to order and let everyone pass 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.290
 the main steps of using the 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.840
 computer then a course that is short 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.520
 that goes to the point and therefore that not 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.490
 waste a lot of time but that 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.500
 teach the things we think second 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.799
 me are fundamental 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.970
 in the use of the computer start has 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.409
 registered today so today is 19 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.360
 June 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.399
 so if you see the video today or tomorrow 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.979
 clearly there are no recordings 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.350
 yet keep an eye on ours 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.299
 channel maybe subscribe to our channel 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.370
 because in the coming days I will charge the 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.410
 video of this basic course 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.790
 I want to tell you that we have anyway 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.830
 already of the other videos maybe more 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.770
 advanced where we do an excel course 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.820
 and below now below mine 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.880
 notice will pass a written where it is 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.250
 can find or we also have 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.670
 a course always for beginners 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:25.020
 or we take for granted that you do not 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.660
 know nothing so let's start from scratch in 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.760
 so you can follow step by step 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.400
 the elections reach a good level 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.850
 we hope when a good standard 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.390
 if you have any questions don't 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:43.590

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.200
 questions face tell me I like tell me 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.160
 I don't like asking me for videos on 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.590
 particular topics I can not me 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.180
 writes and I will try in the limit of the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.180
 possible contributions 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.930
