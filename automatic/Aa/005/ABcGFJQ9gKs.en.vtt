that<00:02:11.239> little<00:02:11.600> bumper<00:02:12.049> back<00:02:12.290> down<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.890> bone

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
that little bumper back down to the bone

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.420 
that little bumper back down to the bone
so<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.430> heals<00:02:13.900> that<00:02:14.900> in<00:02:15.260> itself<00:02:15.560> gives<00:02:15.890> you

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
so it heals that in itself gives you

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.819 
so it heals that in itself gives you
back<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.820> circumcircle<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.440> shoulder

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
back the circumcircle of the shoulder

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.069 
back the circumcircle of the shoulder
joint<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.880> gives<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.299> back<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.780> beat<00:02:20.870> ball

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
joint and gives you back and beat ball

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.720 
joint and gives you back and beat ball
and<00:02:21.200> socket<00:02:21.530> mechanism<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.220> stability<00:02:22.400> that

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
and socket mechanism and stability that

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.630 
and socket mechanism and stability that
you<00:02:22.970> need<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.720> maintain<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.739> stable<00:02:25.160> shoulder

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
you need to maintain a stable shoulder

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.120 
you need to maintain a stable shoulder
and<00:02:25.820> get<00:02:25.940> back<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.269> full<00:02:26.390> activities<00:02:27.130> once

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
and get back to full activities once

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.710 
and get back to full activities once
again<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.430> remember<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.090> remind<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.630> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
again I remember I remind you of the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.140 
again I remember I remind you of the
golf<00:02:30.019> tee<00:02:30.290> scenario<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.489> have<00:02:31.579> a<00:02:31.640> golf<00:02:31.850> ball

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
golf tee scenario you have a golf ball

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.990 
golf tee scenario you have a golf ball
and<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.989> golf<00:02:33.200> tee<00:02:33.530> if<00:02:33.890> part<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.489> golf<00:02:34.730> tee

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
and a golf tee if part of that golf tee

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.130 
and a golf tee if part of that golf tee
is<00:02:35.090> missing<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:36.260> golf<00:02:36.500> ball<00:02:36.739> gonna<00:02:36.980> roll<00:02:37.130> off

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
is missing the golf ball gonna roll off

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.840 
is missing the golf ball gonna roll off
okay<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:38.740> in<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> case<00:02:39.250> when<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.640> have<00:02:39.670> a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
okay so in the case when you have a

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.380 
okay so in the case when you have a
patient<00:02:40.240> that<00:02:40.480> has<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.750> bone<00:02:41.430> bony<00:02:42.430> component

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
patient that has a bone bony component

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.809 
patient that has a bone bony component
to<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.630> glenoid<00:02:44.069> depends<00:02:45.069> on<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.340> size<00:02:45.610> of

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
to the glenoid depends on the size of

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.520 
to the glenoid depends on the size of
the<00:02:45.910> bony<00:02:46.150> component<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:46.959> there's<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.200> large

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
the bony component if there's a large

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.190 
the bony component if there's a large
bone<00:02:47.860> fragment<00:02:48.459> here<00:02:48.640> that's<00:02:48.819> off<00:02:49.120> or<00:02:49.750> missing

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
bone fragment here that's off or missing

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.050 
bone fragment here that's off or missing
where<00:02:50.410> this<00:02:50.650> site<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.069> worn<00:02:51.310> down<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:52.000> changes

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
where this site is worn down it changes

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.560 
where this site is worn down it changes
the<00:02:52.569> shape<00:02:52.959> of<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.590> glenoid<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.090> not<00:02:55.270> as

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
the shape of this glenoid so it's not as

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.690 
the shape of this glenoid so it's not as
oval-shaped<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.709> it's<00:02:57.160> what<00:02:57.370> we<00:02:57.520> call

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
oval-shaped and it's what we call

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.760 
oval-shaped and it's what we call
pear-shaped<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:59.230> have<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.440> pear-shaped

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
pear-shaped we have a pear-shaped

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.800 
pear-shaped we have a pear-shaped
glenoid<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.910> hat<00:03:01.209> means<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.570> you're<00:03:01.720> at

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
glenoid that hat means that you're at

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.490 
glenoid that hat means that you're at
high<00:03:02.050> risk<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:02.560> recurrent<00:03:02.920> dislocations<00:03:03.670> and

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
high risk for recurrent dislocations and

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.110 
high risk for recurrent dislocations and
something<00:03:05.500> more<00:03:05.890> invasive<00:03:06.220> needs<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.820> be<00:03:06.940> done

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
something more invasive needs to be done

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.090 
something more invasive needs to be done
and<00:03:07.510> what<00:03:07.780> we<00:03:07.959> usually<00:03:08.380> do<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.860> something

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
and what we usually do is something

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.240 
and what we usually do is something
called<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.670> ladder<00:03:09.940> shape<00:03:10.300> procedure<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.260> that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
called a ladder shape procedure and that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.630 
called a ladder shape procedure and that
is<00:03:12.880> actually<00:03:13.150> where<00:03:14.140> we<00:03:14.410> take<00:03:14.680> this<00:03:15.010> bone<00:03:15.310> here

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
is actually where we take this bone here

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.390 
is actually where we take this bone here
it's<00:03:15.940> called<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.420> coracoid<00:03:17.070> we<00:03:18.070> actually

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
it's called the coracoid we actually

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.130 
it's called the coracoid we actually
make<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.610> small<00:03:19.000> cut<00:03:19.269> at<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.630> base<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.840> this

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
make a small cut at the base of this

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.040 
make a small cut at the base of this
coracoid<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.580> we<00:03:21.700> just<00:03:21.910> slide<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.330> down<00:03:22.510> to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
coracoid and we just slide it down to

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.680 
coracoid and we just slide it down to
wherever<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:23.709> bone<00:03:24.100> defect<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:24.940> this

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
wherever this bone defect is this

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.930 
wherever this bone defect is this
coracoid<00:03:26.350> here<00:03:26.709> is<00:03:26.890> actually<00:03:27.250> fixated<00:03:27.820> with

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
coracoid here is actually fixated with

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.150 
coracoid here is actually fixated with
two<00:03:28.090> screws<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.930> all<00:03:29.350> that<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.680> does<00:03:29.890> is

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
two screws and all that that does is

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.590 
two screws and all that that does is
just<00:03:30.360> increase<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.630> surface<00:03:31.900> area<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.800> that

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
just increase the surface area of that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.590 
just increase the surface area of that
socket<00:03:34.600> of<00:03:34.840> that<00:03:35.260> glenoid<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:36.459> this<00:03:36.970> the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
socket of that glenoid so this the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.390 
socket of that glenoid so this the
shoulder<00:03:38.110> humeral<00:03:38.560> head<00:03:38.680> does<00:03:38.860> not<00:03:39.040> slide<00:03:39.340> off

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
shoulder humeral head does not slide off

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.420 
shoulder humeral head does not slide off
now<00:03:40.300> it<00:03:40.510> has<00:03:40.630> another<00:03:40.930> bumper<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.620> has<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:42.040> go

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
now it has another bumper it has to go

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.240 
now it has another bumper it has to go
across<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:43.090> become<00:03:43.360> unstable<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:45.040> is

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
across to become unstable this is

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.680 
across to become unstable this is
actually<00:03:45.549> a<00:03:45.579> very<00:03:45.790> successful<00:03:46.269> technique

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
actually a very successful technique

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.330 
actually a very successful technique
particularly<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:47.739> patients<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.190> are

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
particularly in patients that are

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.400 
particularly in patients that are
chronic<00:03:48.790> dislocator<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.810> are<00:03:49.930> missing<00:03:50.200> the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
chronic dislocator that are missing the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.259 
chronic dislocator that are missing the
bone<00:03:50.590> at<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.160> front<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:51.850> glenoid

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
bone at the front of that glenoid

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.670 
bone at the front of that glenoid
surface<00:03:52.989> okay<00:03:53.769> now<00:03:54.959> for<00:03:55.959> patients<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.530> have

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
surface okay now for patients that have

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.250 
surface okay now for patients that have
recurrent<00:03:57.489> dislocations<00:03:58.299> that<00:03:58.510> not<00:03:59.140> only

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
recurrent dislocations that not only

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.530 
recurrent dislocations that not only
have<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.860> missing<00:04:00.280> bone<00:04:00.459> in<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.700> front<00:04:00.970> but

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
have that missing bone in the front but

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.030 
have that missing bone in the front but
they<00:04:01.690> also<00:04:01.840> have<00:04:02.079> a<00:04:02.110> big<00:04:02.350> indention<00:04:02.709> in<00:04:02.950> the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
they also have a big indention in the

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.490 
they also have a big indention in the
back<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.549> humeral<00:04:03.910> head<00:04:04.440> there's<00:04:05.440> a

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
back of the humeral head there's a

back of the head we fill in those
indentions<00:04:23.500> sometimes<00:04:23.950> you<00:04:24.070> can<00:04:24.190> do<00:04:24.340> that

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
indentions sometimes you can do that

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.520 
indentions sometimes you can do that
with<00:04:24.729> a<00:04:24.760> bone<00:04:25.000> graft<00:04:25.210> sometimes<00:04:26.200> you<00:04:26.289> can<00:04:26.410> do

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
with a bone graft sometimes you can do

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.830 
with a bone graft sometimes you can do
that<00:04:26.680> with<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.890> metal<00:04:27.310> type<00:04:27.940> of<00:04:28.150> implant<00:04:28.570> such

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
that with a metal type of implant such

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.690 
that with a metal type of implant such
as<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.080> one<00:04:29.260> you're<00:04:29.350> seeing<00:04:29.590> here<00:04:29.950> and<00:04:30.580> all

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
as the one you're seeing here and all

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.040 
as the one you're seeing here and all
that<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:30.940> does<00:04:31.210> is<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.479> gives<00:04:31.600> you<00:04:31.870> back

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
that that does is that gives you back

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.310 
that that does is that gives you back
the<00:04:32.229> contour<00:04:32.860> of<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:33.340> ball<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:34.539> no<00:04:34.840> longer<00:04:35.020> has

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
the contour of the ball so no longer has

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.400 
the contour of the ball so no longer has
a<00:04:35.350> big<00:04:35.620> indention<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:37.060> means<00:04:37.510> that<00:04:37.750> when<00:04:37.900> it

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
a big indention that means that when it

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.650 
a big indention that means that when it
when<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.220> rotate<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.820> shoulder<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.480> no

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
when you rotate the shoulder it no

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.380 
when you rotate the shoulder it no
longer<00:04:40.990> gets<00:04:41.200> caught<00:04:41.500> up<00:04:42.010> on<00:04:42.190> this<00:04:42.460> edge<00:04:42.850> here

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
longer gets caught up on this edge here

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.540 
longer gets caught up on this edge here
if<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.140> still<00:04:44.410> have<00:04:44.650> that<00:04:44.800> indention<00:04:45.340> in<00:04:45.460> the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
if you still have that indention in the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.730 
if you still have that indention in the
humeral<00:04:45.880> head<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.420> can<00:04:46.600> get<00:04:46.690> stuck<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.410> then

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
humeral head it can get stuck and then

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.920 
humeral head it can get stuck and then
you<00:04:47.860> have<00:04:48.040> to<00:04:48.160> pop<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.490> back<00:04:48.520> into<00:04:48.850> place<00:04:49.090> if

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
you have to pop it back into place if

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.510 
you have to pop it back into place if
you<00:04:50.080> don't<00:04:50.200> have<00:04:50.470> that<00:04:50.650> intention<00:04:51.250> it

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
you don't have that intention it

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.340 
you don't have that intention it
smoothly<00:04:52.120> rotates<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:52.960> gives<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.230> all

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
smoothly rotates and gives you all

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.800 
smoothly rotates and gives you all
degrees<00:04:53.680> of<00:04:53.830> freedom<00:04:54.130> in<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.340> shoulder<00:04:54.670> joint

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
degrees of freedom in the shoulder joint

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.860 
degrees of freedom in the shoulder joint
okay<00:04:55.830> so<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:56.980> basically<00:04:57.160> describes<00:04:57.970> the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
okay so that basically describes the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.650 
okay so that basically describes the
glenohumeral<00:04:59.440> joint<00:04:59.980> and<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.910> definition<00:05:01.510> of

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
glenohumeral joint and the definition of

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.210 
glenohumeral joint and the definition of
a<00:05:01.750> shoulder<00:05:02.010> dislocation

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
a shoulder dislocation

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.070 
a shoulder dislocation
