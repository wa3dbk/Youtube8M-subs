pontoons<00:04:06.510> watch<00:04:06.780> out<00:04:07.050> because<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.410> will<00:04:07.590> cut

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
pontoons watch out because you will cut

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.199 
pontoons watch out because you will cut
yourself<00:04:08.930> but<00:04:09.930> just<00:04:10.290> sharp<00:04:11.280> looking<00:04:11.610> lines<00:04:11.880> on

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
yourself but just sharp looking lines on

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.720 
yourself but just sharp looking lines on
this<00:04:12.510> pontoon<00:04:13.080> you'll<00:04:14.010> notice<00:04:14.370> something<00:04:14.550> if

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
this pontoon you'll notice something if

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.120 
this pontoon you'll notice something if
you<00:04:14.790> can<00:04:14.910> see<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.180> on<00:04:15.270> the<00:04:15.360> video<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:15.690> they

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
you can see it on the video but they

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.550 
you can see it on the video but they
they<00:04:17.130> partition<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:18.510> pontoon<00:04:19.080> so<00:04:19.380> that

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
they partition the pontoon so that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.380 
they partition the pontoon so that
there's<00:04:19.770> bulkheads<00:04:20.549> in<00:04:20.760> there<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.150> if<00:04:21.270> you

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
there's bulkheads in there so if you

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.260 
there's bulkheads in there so if you
were<00:04:21.539> to<00:04:21.690> puncture<00:04:22.080> one<00:04:22.289> you<00:04:23.010> would<00:04:23.190> have<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
were to puncture one you would have the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.320 
were to puncture one you would have the
other<00:04:24.510> two<00:04:24.810> sections<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:26.340> get

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
other two sections to get

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.550 
other two sections to get
your<00:04:27.449> home<00:04:27.599> and<00:04:27.870> allow<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.319> get<00:04:28.409> the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
your home and allow you to get the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.520 
your home and allow you to get the

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
repair another thing on this pontoon

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.369 
repair another thing on this pontoon
look<00:04:32.220> at<00:04:32.310> how<00:04:32.400> big<00:04:32.699> that<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:33.629> pontoon<00:04:34.139> is

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
look at how big that the pontoon is
