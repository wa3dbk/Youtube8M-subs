00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hi, it's the fans who come and respond today. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.500
 one more tag this is one more technique 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.849
 overall has nothing to do with level 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.070
 you have to do with the work of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.440
 blogger the work of blogger a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.570
 focus youtuber maybe then that 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.910
 election flame is not about books 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.880
 Which I do not confuse is more like the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.460
 blog reader or case 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.109
 subscribed channels on youtube tv com 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.760
 questions but not exactly with 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.560
 books for anyone that I might as well be 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.900
 a very common land that many fires 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.640
 already answered I will answer also and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.690
 credits will be down here 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.910
 so come on 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.160
 the first question between bush and videos 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.290
 Which do you prefer without a shadow of a doubt? 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.000
 I prefer video people I breathe video 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.559
 on youtube you have not only accurate 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.059
 videos all day to do 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.850
 anything at home and home 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.700
 even needs to hear a video 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.260
 racist even exchange the music for a video 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.610
 I always like a more 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 because of this you need to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.770
 videos all day then I know 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.420
 I prefer a thousand times videos so much that I 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.789
 I kind of changed the job I did 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.890
 Our more blogger I kind of is 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.049
 positive blog does not matter that it does not have 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.000
 more posts to write because I 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.799
 I really like to shoot videos so much 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 I also usually dialogue with the fact that 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.810
 I like much more watch I like 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.790
 much more to record nowadays than I 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.590
 I prefer a thousand times my children. 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.600
 The second question is approximately 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.490
 how many videos do I watch per week 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.700
 I felt this is very very difficult to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.369
 know why today they are enrolled 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.079
 in over 500 channels on youtube then 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.240
 has no idea how many children God 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.000
 This week we think it's going to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.250
 more than 200 a week because I 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.380
 I watch a lot of video on youtube very much 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.110
 a lot of video in the 3 that catches attention 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.790
 to watch the technical video watched 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.450
 video I think the first is who did the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.130
 video by subject and thumbnail 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.659
 these three things make the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.490
 watching the video there are people who know the 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.049
 people no matter the subject can talk 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.880
 of any asshole but I go 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.469
 watch some insults that you 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.119
 anything they do know 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.619
 People know a little teen campaign 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.479
 have to watch what a person is 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.159
 put on youtube fourth question the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.899
 that bothers the most in a blog 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.849
 nowadays I have followed you very few 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.660
 blocks and if we join the blog I 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.660
 I'm very expensive 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:18.060
 litho but it's so is another world 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.770
 It's very difficult to enter the blog to know 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.370
 if the update I still have a 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.650
 feed that was in google reader but not 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.980
 they retired but I accompanied many 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.130
 blogs by feed and that content there then 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.890
 The blog teaches you with a comfortable nothing and 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.510
 started getting updates 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.400
 I'm not frustrated because a 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.160
 certain blog did not post 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.990
 so nowadays nothing bothers me 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.360
 because I do not even care 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.370
 to blog before it bothered the most 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.040
 it was something that in the end I was too 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.200
 Sin as a blogger was to enter the blog 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.660
 does not have any updates but these 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.480
 day is very difficult for me to enter the blog 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.030
 to see if you have an update is already 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.790
 I signed up at the end of the blog received the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.010
 updates so I do not get frustrated anymore 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.240
 known has no great things that I 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.040
 bug in bologna 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.170
 here you also do not have what you do to me 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.840
 watch a good final video your video 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.060
 is tiring if the person makes a note 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.410
 The subject is born should interest more 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.780
 usually the sixth through the end because 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.520
 usually do not watch or of fÃ¡bio 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.350
 all the vices but that really that the 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.390
 farm person I do not know who needs 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.000
 review the vision feature even if I just 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.680
 I need to finally have not do this 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.150
 I really put the video. 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.010
 listening to the person speaks as if he were a 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.450
 podcast with videos you do not need 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.700
 necessarily be seeing that the person 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.700
 are usually living by 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.200
 This I listen to until the end, why not? 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.630
 I'm doing other things at the same time. 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.800
 then failure does not make much difference but 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.050
 when it's something I'm 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.390
 really signed for that time and was 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.550
 something that this year I'm losing 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.260
 Time making no sense to me, you or 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.000
 close, no problem 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.310
 then usually when the subject does not 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.890
 is more interested the person is surrounding 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.180
 very much and I asked this question I prefer 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.520
 short or long videos I prefer 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.350
 long videos so just average not 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.600
 for the great majority preferred medium 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.850
 for drugs that I like a lot and I 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.739
 I prefer it to be as long as possible and 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.980
 short videos bothers me a little 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.770
 because sometimes it looks like it can not. 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.799
 sometimes I like the channel if the person 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.359
 makes a video of 3 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.099
 four minutes bothers me because it was 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.139
 very fast and just waited so long 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:26.319
 by a video of the person who spends a lot 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.539
 fast 3 to 4 going so it's very relative 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:31.629
 but I prefer it as soon as it's about 10 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.610
 minutes Evando know is that I really like 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:35.710
 You can make 20 and 30 minutes and not 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.680
 does not mind sometimes the feijoada 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.629
 dismounted online to gaultier gaucho 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.940
 have more than one hour and watch an hour 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:45.909
 Christmas and listening generally forgiveness 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.190
 not necessarily see more people myself 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:50.289
 I really like long videos so she 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.669
 is the one that says the more videos I 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.340
 You got to see better for me than I do. 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.020
 I can listen all day watching videos. 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.449
 even a question if you have the habit of 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.969
 evaluate the video and comment methodology is 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.039
 sometimes they take too much because it 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.169
 I always comment on it when I 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.340
 really something to add 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.930
 funny that usually the most 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.560
 about the video there are people there on twitter 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.110
 I speak when things do not comment 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.060
 this is very strange but when 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.759
 really has a composition to give me 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.430
 I comment on the video not very rare that 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:24.279
 I'm late, I'm late. 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.840
 and because usually I or conversation option 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:27.819
 of social networks generally do not have 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.529
 nothing to talk to even when I put it 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:32.199
 I liked the video when I really liked 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.870
 video why will you walk on my twitter? 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:38.529
 What I like then plays I already share 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.469
 and never 2 light ours and I gave two slides 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:44.199
 in life was a lot and because it was a video 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.490
 tasteless not really because the dwarf 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.770
 I liked it or I did not like it, it 's simply 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.210
 close the video ready but when I think 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.889
 that were the two videos in life know 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.279
 but it is because it was very bad taste or 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.960
 because it offends someone or something of the kind 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:58.210
 season but I do not like old in haiti 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.550
 it 's not just make me kill me 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.710
 as if I had not been around the 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.729
 eighth question what other social network I 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.310
 use to stay inside the news 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:09.240
 demanding twitter life I use twitter 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.949
 I'll leave it to you as well. 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.080
 all social networks I've tried to pull 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.940
 by the way but I love twitter twitter a 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.620
 best social network life is to see the band 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.069
 question likes to meet bloggers and 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:24.340
 2011 new bloggers love silva love 

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:25.870
 generate new august but will not consume 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.000
 Internet content is just the more 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.560
 new thing to know better 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.020
 so i love 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.150
 new ones we will know new channels because 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.810
 how did you say more videos and 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:40.000
 The process is better than just asking if 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.490
 have a tip to give bloggers in 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.080
 general would be good if it is a 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.780
 blogger specifically let us do 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.570
 videos easy videos because video is life 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.600
 and so it approaches both the people 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:55.510
 You know I love this feature, thank you. 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.450
 youtube for existing thanks for me 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.490
 provide to make videos nowadays 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.889
 so if you block I just write the 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.200
 people pass videos are also very rare 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.820
 but is so close to that of the voter and 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.229
 the person accompanying you 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:13.720
 I think everything is heading for 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:15.760
 audiovisual feature knows all networks 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.260
 are inserting this feature 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:23.080
 then youtube is the future is actually is 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.780
 the president is the future and I think 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.169
 that if there is to arise the 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:31.600
 audiovisual resource then the tenth 

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:33.940
 question to win the game but how not 

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.310
 I know you already answered do not be free 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.310
 the channels that accompany me as they please 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.930
 make this tag on your channel can 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.600
 make or leave creator credits
