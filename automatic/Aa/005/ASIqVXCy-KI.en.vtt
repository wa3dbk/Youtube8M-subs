00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.540
 And super storey floor number 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.540
 That dog cat moth method 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:27.180
 There are many clever today 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:29.730
 It is a hole betting ticket method is high a First of all it is a notice to the place, but I write a serialized article every month 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.940
 The strongest report on our theme 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:39.239

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.510

 I think if you have a a convenience store Come try to pick it up by hand at the specified mountain road 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.190
 Please give me 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:53.350
 Thank you in advance 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.870
 Pabo latte sprint of the one-shot eyes of the heavy prize in that horse racing is opening a box or the like from the recruiting 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.339
 I would like to predict the stakes in the Saturday version 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.360
 Unicorn Stakes to be held in Tokyo is also there together because we will exhibit the Sunday edition of 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.360
 Please enjoy Te 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.530
 Recruitment opens the box etc. Enemy etc. It will be held this year with its opening week This is a yearly sprint 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.970
 It's a stake 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.340
 We would like to expect here 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:26.780
 Yeah well that I do in learning came out relationship between the dates in the car Kedomo Well around is I race the 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.900
 I don't think there is any possibility that it will affect deployment or other matters. 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.270
 It Nde if still not say what made the Well now the stage 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:39.740
 I think the Fu say I want to only exhibit the historical pedigree trend in base 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:43.850
 Well, these two points are something to watch out for in the past race called the Race Print Stakes 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.799
 Well I can do there in two respects, but the wind that has led Well I mean Well almost equal 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.759
 I think it is good to think 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:54.860
 a First of all , a horse whose father is a follow-on to a northern dancer runs well 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.260
 I just didn't say this last year, but I dumped in the so-called Northern Dancer 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.500
 putter 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.730
 Or for example vice regent after if Storm Cat is said to dart part 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.630
 And 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.860
 Well, I guess there are a few places where I can not trust so much 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.360
 I think so 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:15.250
 Well the same is what related to it, but overall I thought Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe duel 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:19.090
 European pedigree You can say that this is also a very important race . 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:23.200
 The Northern Dancers who had a good time dating in the past 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:27.310
 Well did you say dad Wow of movable property dancer system but we can Well just this 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:32.800
 Though it is the number of the year that it comes out the most here 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.319
 There is a horse number that is a betting ticket among them. 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:40.870
 It is quite a point 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:45.790
 Well there was a lister and 50,000 units 1 f 3 in the inside, but I could say that this 11th was direct from birth 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.349
 Because there is a wide release paper with a popular thin film with this, I should remember one thing of this importance 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.180
 So do you think Fu called kana 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:55.340
 If you look at the name that is rising up, for example , have a lineage of 前提 s premise 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.180
 I wonder if the Farufurauda and aah it's system of selling percussion you are 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.829
 Huh 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:05.780
 Well overall little Yappa Well the strong Northern Dancer in Europe of a large process 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:10.470
 I'm also buying up, but I will tell you a little bit after this, but Kim char is a power source in the first place 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:14.250
 There is a high possibility that he was missing most and his mother and father became Tony 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:19.560
 I can say that I had the Arc de Triomphe award eight . 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:23.820
 If you think so, let's say so-called first of all when we think about results of other clohne production pieces 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.050
 Directly below to the fact that the kana is better to consider discounted dart part is a little peek in the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.970
 I think it will be 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:35.080
 Next, it was very easy to understand something like last year in the Arcaneomium prize pedigree holding horse Sukama last year 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.180
 The Garbo I bought was a mother and father caerleon genorous and two of them 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.780
 If you think a low victims Sadler ok 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.980
 In my third Christmas dad's pub, this band is also softly returned 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.500
 I'm waiting for you 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.130
 Well Other b Stars something anymore Well mentioned earlier also 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.320
 It's a commander , but it's a dancing brave if it 's sunny. 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.920
 And Well I think that other such Fu to put out me one of Toka-based compensation of such Kotekote 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.930
 Cartoon 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.060
 I thought because the box like body, which is carried out in the Well by my lawn It is why it can be seen that are well dressed 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.490
 It is this kind of European weight 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:11.420
 Somewhat great boyfriend pretend is also European 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:16.700
 I think from the pedigree tendency that it can be understood that heavy weight is required 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.930
 If you think of more than one point, let's say this year will be around double this year 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.700
 I think 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.980
 Well my father's Northern dancers 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:29.330
 Hirabokku Prince of Stravinsky production pieces 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.990
 Also or was I But Well coming ship are we facing dad Well the other from coming out 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.700
 In 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:39.530
 This time I tried to exclude a bit, and in the sense that it was Taisho Shogun 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.180
 Well masu Toka is the same Bago production piece to last year's Christmas and win the home run or even Arc de 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.969
 Is it not a market 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.499
 Well bent liam mild and relatively european life in mispro 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.429
 Depending on this way of thinking because it is good mortgage is taken up because I think Fu that kana Ali 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:54.809
 I woke up 

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:56.099
 Well Well, if this area is to either choose which from the fact that this year's candidates horse this 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:05:00.779
 Tagano Azagaru is 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:04.960
 Betting basis to think the Fu that wonder if there is a high possibility to do even the most Symbol winding 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:10.910
 Well my father's number says what the writer is, just like last year's Christmas 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:15.020
 The horse that has won the Arc de Triomphe award meets the pedigree of the Arc de Triomphe award holding horse 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:19.760
 Well I think that indeed before may be to it before the car by Nde I was not Well's west 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:23.060
 I think that it was a peculiar kind of so-called mood test If it is possible to alarm, it is first 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:28.040
 It may be a short distance and goodness may come out again 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.900
 As it is Neyappako 9 park of last year , if it is with the city, it is quite prefectural 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:34.610
 It is foolish to want to pay attention most to 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.610
 I 'm thinking it might be 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:47.050
 So China roughness is Pikka_ko would like to take up half of the body 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:50.590
 Yeah Well Well hey I feel that hidden behind because this week Hanshin is not performed even I Stakes 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.880
 I No say go find Well such a place even Mezatoku also good although I 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:57.380
 It is also a pleasure of the summit company 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.160
 A little more I called Ann Forest in the living Well everyone likes steak of Torres of effort 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:04.290
 I want to be careful 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:10.380
 As for Hanshin's Shiba War 2004 House, the Dart pedigree wears well anyway 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:11.580
 Well, especially last week , I could say it in fiber last week , but I'm sorry that I made a lot of Johannesburg production pieces. 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.330
 But 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:18.750
 Well, it's an American Dart pedigree, right? 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:22.289
 Oh, my dad is a bold ruler during this Anwarto Kate 's 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.189
 pt application Well mother Kuril Yappa stone of which was the market trend to that 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.909
 Because it is cast 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:31.390
 But after all the five points of the United States Food pewter in the onslaught After doing pedigree textually 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:36.670
 The Well's easy to open is between such a pedigree features of now of Hanshin 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:40.000
 Nde Well there are another headache horse I much Re Kaneko based on the kind of point that day Mother 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:43.840
 Well I feel like I'm going to pull it out 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.970
 It's easy to forget this if you think it's like a moment like this if you make it a temple together 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.669
 Even if little is doing this per also you include if that kind Well I I last year 3 million to 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:54.639
 I think it's interesting 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:59.199
 Is it me Hamora to start from this week Well Well conversation learning 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:05.979
 Especially on the 8th opening day of Edo , it was the first day of the day, so to see what the basics look like 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:10.639
 I think it will be, but once you remember the example of the work and the Cape, it is most noticeable on the Nakanoshima Line, and it's like Fujiki 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:15.590
 I Oh Well prima facie there was a Kedomo I became profusely cafe because 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:16.159
 Starting from the place to keep the Lou I think that from the form of seeing the Mage transformed Toke Ru wall 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:20.990
 I will 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:24.979
 In Pisces Gold Allure and r Special Week mother with regard Naa to Dadu 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:29.599
 I 've been collaborating, so even if I enter my mother-in- law, I hit it after all 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:30.630
 There's ne Well this is Baa and the ball only to observe the median underground Hatsumi Special Week 

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:34.100
 I marked the area 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:39.140
 I think it's just like it's going to be a way of going to see the state of lightning 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:41.940
 Well I also participate in the horse racing exciting saito I will help you lose weekly at the fair 

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:46.830

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:51.840
 Former major leader devil Sieger's owner of the large demon God Sasaki Lord Hiroshi 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:57.240
 E-mail magazine second goal 22 which interprets the main race with its own viewpoint is the second term 

00:07:51.840 --> 00:08:01.919
 In addition, I also have a public fundraising race this Sunday, which is recommended by my expensive Kazuki, for free. 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:07.490
