00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:10.750
 Today we will talk about the keys of the keys are not 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:14.130
 from locks not from apartment and not water 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.529
 sources about keys as a form 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.550
 hand tools 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.210
 the first group of keys that we 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.990
 consider this group of wrenches 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.360
 they are all represented now before you 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.859
 the most common most ancient species 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:36.220
 wrenches a wrench which is called 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:38.170
 just a wrench it is called 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.980
 correctly called wrench with 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:46.030
 open shed bilateral horn their 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.270
 called because there is no key head 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.239
 under the nut made a horn like this 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.739
 handles so this is technical on 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.790
 technical slang they are also called 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.770
 hopping 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.620
 or usually call them just a key 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.930
 nut then it means exactly 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.659
 such a key 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.289
 their size may be from the most 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.700
 little ones 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:12.010
 here it is the keys to 4 by 5 to 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.250
 it's not the biggest until some big 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:21.610
 like this key 4146 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.240
 according to guest sizes of calls are in 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:30.250
 ranges 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:33.790
 two and a half 3.2 to 75 by 80 but this 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.340
 guests Rowan sizes are usually the most 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.860
 small size start somewhere here 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.740
 So such keys 4 on 5 less already 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.340
 are very rare and unlikely 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.340
 mechanical engineering 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.400
 these keys are made by forging 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.920
 real keys must be 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.909
 forged 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.979
 they are made of alloyed 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.450
 structural chrome-vanadium steel 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:05.259
 40 Haifa for example, well, and usually the keys 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.030
 with a pharynx size over 36 millimeters 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.280
 already made of alloyed 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:14.560
 structural steel 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:16.420
 40x chrome steel as a rule 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.510
 judging from the name they intended 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:26.440
 naturally for the time they are nut for nuts 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:28.440
 and for general the whole group of wrenches 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.450
 designed to work with elements 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.819
 threaded connections are nuts and bolts and 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.739
 screws 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:41.650
 Well, all that all that twists 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:43.360
 unscrewed after wrenches one 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.090
 because of a different one more variety 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.579
 too, wrenches are such 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.019
 keys 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.810
 they are called combined 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.989
 or correctly they are called wrenches 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.980
 keys with open with open and ring 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.989
 business combined that is and wrench 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.660
 wrench and 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.660
 on the other side 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.450
 combo keys tend to do 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.389
 one size that's a key 30 by 30 or 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.840
 key 10 to 10 smaller 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.450
 i.e. open throat size and size 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.950
 flare 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.900
 spanner head is the same then 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.709
 have they meant for one 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.810
 size of guy 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:37.750
 in this case, 30 spanners 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:40.840
 which have annular heads 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.389
 on both sides are called ring 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.310
 Well, ring keys can be 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:50.590
 double-sided like this they can be 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.260
 for example, these are called cranked 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.049
 because the key head is relatively 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.069
 handles are not assisted 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.680
 the grip is done for convenience 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.420
 use for the nut to be 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.450
 easy 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:16.639
 to have a place for a hand here 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:19.950
 articulated keys are straight 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:23.460
 live show now can not show on 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:26.070
 photos, that is, the key heads, we are so 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.430
 if you can see the key heads are in 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.130
 same plane with 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.380
 Stu descent handle is the same well, 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.660
 in some cases it is more convenient 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:45.150
 more convenient they are in some cases 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:47.370
 such back to the wrenches here these 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.440
 the keys that we considered wrenches with 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.000
 open shed one-sidedly there are also 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.060
 and one-sided usually this is the key and 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.979
 I also do not have big sizes 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.979
 I can show this picture 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.320
 looks at not like this 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:08.280
 they usually already exceed 30 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.370
 millimeters for nuts with size 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.020
 hexagon 30 and above 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.060
 they are mainly used for 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.479
 to use already extra 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.750
 lever arm 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:24.150
 namely, this key head 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.919
 more than a grip use 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.039
 some kind of pipe is there any lever 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:31.530
 hard enough on wrenches 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.900
 one-sided here hilt you see 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.970
 then it's just the same key 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.979
 only without the second part 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.930
 this part of the handle can be in jelly 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:45.600
 easy to put a pipe on some kind of lever and 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.729
 use already great effort to 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.310
 unscrewing and tightening the screws 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.280
 as for the ring spanners ring 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.830
 they can also be as bilateral 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.740
 crank or accept and may be 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.800
 one-sided for example like this 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.500
 not exactly the one that is one-way keys 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.750
 it does n't look like this 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.789
 I will tell you what is the difference now 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.830
 These keys are also used in order 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.240
 to see and the grip here is very 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.430
 short precisely to 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.979
 use a lever but usually this 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.930
 pipe or something that you can wear 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:23.190
 on this knob and boost torque 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.490
 this is the key that I am now 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.830
 show this cap key or 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:33.030
 annular cap or ring them 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:36.659
 call it a key shock it is different 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:40.320
 from one-side cap key themes 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:43.169
 what's done at the end of the handle 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.750
 such thickening is specially designed 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:49.700
 in order for them therefore thickenings 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:53.180
 killed that is besides torque 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.560
 you can make an effort to 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.930
 undermine the thread that boiled 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.490
 rusted and so forth that is for that 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.909
 to attach some 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.130
 great moment effort as you can see 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:07.200
 here here are done 12 facets they are all 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.060
 designed for hex even 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.120
 if it's twelve faces just for 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.870
 convenience for ease of handling and for 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.220
 more contact with the nut all this 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.610
 group of keys that we are now 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.490
 considered they can be combined one by one 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.760
 group that is , they all refer to 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.760
 spanner
