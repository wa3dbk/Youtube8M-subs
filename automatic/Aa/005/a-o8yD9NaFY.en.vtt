every<00:01:40.320> two<00:01:40.590> weeks<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:41.220> gonna<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> benefit

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
every two weeks it's gonna be a benefit

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.810 
every two weeks it's gonna be a benefit
why<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.140> benefit<00:01:43.590> well<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.640> organic

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
why is it a benefit well if it's organic

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
why is it a benefit well if it's organic
I'm<00:01:45.360> gonna<00:01:45.479> go<00:01:45.630> over<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> organic<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.439> why

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
I'm gonna go over the organic and why

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.010 
I'm gonna go over the organic and why
that<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.189> special<00:01:47.610> okay<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
that is special okay so one of the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.440 
that is special okay so one of the
biggest<00:01:49.259> concerns<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> Omega<00:01:50.610> threes<00:01:51.030> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
biggest concerns is the Omega threes to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.530 
biggest concerns is the Omega threes to
the<00:01:51.810> mega<00:01:52.049> sixes<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.829> ratio<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:54.119> say<00:01:54.329> you're

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
the mega sixes that ratio so say you're

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.690 
the mega sixes that ratio so say you're
eating<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.899> traditional<00:01:55.470> red<00:01:55.740> meat<00:01:55.979> okay

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
eating a traditional red meat okay

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.319 
eating a traditional red meat okay
the<00:01:57.450> ratio<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.350> omega-6<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.579> two<00:01:59.729> threes<00:02:00.030> could

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
the ratio of omega-6 is two threes could

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.830 
the ratio of omega-6 is two threes could
be<00:02:00.420> anywhere<00:02:00.840> from<00:02:01.200> 25<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.920> one<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.670> mega<00:02:03.299> six<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.210 
two Omega threes so what what does that
mean<00:02:06.689> right<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.170> why<00:02:07.350> should<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.710> care<00:02:07.920> about

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
and so that's kind of my two cents on

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.800 
and so that's kind of my two cents on
red<00:05:45.470> meat<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:46.070> you<00:05:46.310> know<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.669> always<00:05:47.150> always

red meat and you know I always always
always<00:05:48.229> choose<00:05:48.770> or<00:05:48.950> gain

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
always choose or gain
