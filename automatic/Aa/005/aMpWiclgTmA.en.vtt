00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
which was a bit crazy but nevertheless

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.790 
which was a bit crazy but nevertheless
very<00:00:50.760> overwhelming<00:00:51.629> boat<00:00:51.870> there<00:00:52.170> by<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> guys

so that definitely shows me that you
want<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.879> see<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:58.260> actually<00:00:58.410> very<00:00:58.590> glad

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
want to see that I'm actually very glad

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.340 
want to see that I'm actually very glad
about<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.430> because<00:00:59.640> i<00:01:00.120> can't<00:01:00.780> imagine<00:01:00.899> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
about this because i can't imagine that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.270 
about this because i can't imagine that
after<00:01:01.530> some<00:01:01.980> months<00:01:02.539> only<00:01:03.539> trading<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:05.040> could

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
after some months only trading it could

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.870 
after some months only trading it could
get<00:01:05.460> pretty<00:01:05.900> boring<00:01:07.490> overall<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.760> think

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
get pretty boring overall so I think

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.700 
get pretty boring overall so I think
mixing<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.540> up<00:01:09.720> with<00:01:09.960> playing<00:01:10.260> games<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
mixing this up with playing games and

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.590 
mixing this up with playing games and
stuff<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.130> it's<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.090> very<00:01:12.420> good<00:01:12.479> idea

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
stuff like that it's a very good idea

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.070 
stuff like that it's a very good idea
indeed<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:14.990> concerning<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
indeed and now actually concerning the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.020 
indeed and now actually concerning the
first<00:01:16.470> team<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.280> build<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.850> this

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
series um I think I'm going to go with a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.080 
series um I think I'm going to go with a
bonus<00:01:21.540> nigga<00:01:21.780> squad<00:01:22.110> um<00:01:22.380> I'm<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.520> sure<00:01:23.580> yet

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
bonus nigga squad um I'm not sure yet

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.050 
bonus nigga squad um I'm not sure yet
whether<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.780> build<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.619> silver<00:01:26.250> team<00:01:26.460> or<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> gold

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
whether to build a silver team or a gold

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
whether to build a silver team or a gold
team<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.960> don't<00:01:28.170> wanna<00:01:28.380> start<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
team I think I don't wanna start with a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.580 
team I think I don't wanna start with a
bronze<00:01:29.130> team<00:01:29.430> because<00:01:29.759> um<00:01:30.299> getting<00:01:31.259> used<00:01:31.470> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
bronze team because um getting used to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.950 
bronze team because um getting used to
the<00:01:31.710> first<00:01:31.979> touch<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.610> probably<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.810> good

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the first touch is probably not a good

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.130 
the first touch is probably not a good
idea<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.979> bronze<00:01:35.549> team<00:01:35.960> because<00:01:36.960> they

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
idea with a bronze team because they

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.990 
idea with a bronze team because they
have<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.439> very<00:01:37.799> low<00:01:37.950> ball<00:01:38.220> control<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.670> stuff

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
have a very low ball control and stuff

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.870 
have a very low ball control and stuff
like<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.890> by<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.950> way<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.700> on

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
like that by the way as you can see on

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.670 
like that by the way as you can see on
the<00:01:42.000> screen<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.270> very<00:01:42.509> risky<00:01:42.750> by<00:01:43.079> there<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the screen a very risky by there on that

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.670 
the screen a very risky by there on that
move<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.299> he<00:01:45.299> actually<00:01:45.450> wants<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.259> cheapest

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
move on he actually wants the cheapest

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.069 
move on he actually wants the cheapest
by<00:01:46.829> 10k<00:01:47.369> or<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.729> once<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.119> got<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.390> for<00:01:48.570> right

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
by 10k or so once I got in for right

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.440 
by 10k or so once I got in for right
under<00:01:49.409> forty<00:01:49.829> thousand<00:01:50.250> coins<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:51.299> now

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
under forty thousand coins but now

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.780 
under forty thousand coins but now
supplies<00:01:51.869> drop<00:01:52.259> pretty<00:01:52.920> dramatically<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
supplies drop pretty dramatically and

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.789 
supplies drop pretty dramatically and
this<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.780> bummer<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> see<00:01:55.500> that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
this was a bit of a bummer to see that

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950 
this was a bit of a bummer to see that
so<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:56.640> I'll<00:01:57.030> make<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.509> couple<00:01:57.750> of

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
so I think I'll make a couple of

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
so I think I'll make a couple of
thousand<00:01:58.380> points<00:01:58.530> lost<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.219> him<00:01:59.430> but<00:01:59.579> will

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
thousand points lost on him but will

of<00:03:34.319> trades<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.159> do<00:03:35.250> in<00:03:35.699> the<00:03:35.879> back<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.239> primarily

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
of trades I do in the back is primarily

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.869 
of trades I do in the back is primarily
simply<00:03:37.049> because<00:03:37.319> people<00:03:37.829> want<00:03:38.099> to<00:03:38.310> build<00:03:38.579> back

simply because people want to build back

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.930 
simply because people want to build back
as<00:03:39.030> family<00:03:39.449> teams<00:03:39.750> probably<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> most<00:03:40.940> at

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
as family teams probably the most at

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.180 
as family teams probably the most at
this<00:03:42.239> stage<00:03:42.540> got<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.930> smart<00:03:43.290> idea<00:03:43.440> for<00:03:43.829> twenty

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
this stage got a smart idea for twenty

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.189 
this stage got a smart idea for twenty
one<00:03:44.340> thousand<00:03:44.669> client<00:03:45.000> list<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.750> pretty

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
one thousand client list is a pretty

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.189 
one thousand client list is a pretty
nice<00:03:46.530> deal<00:03:46.949> I<00:03:47.159> think<00:03:47.579> at<00:03:47.790> least<00:03:48.049> he<00:03:49.049> hasn't

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
nice deal I think at least he hasn't

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.680 
nice deal I think at least he hasn't
sold<00:03:49.859> yet<00:03:50.040> but<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.489> think<00:03:50.579> he<00:03:50.879> will<00:03:51.209> definitely

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
sold yet but I think he will definitely

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.140
