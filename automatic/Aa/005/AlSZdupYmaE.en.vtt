00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
when I came in and I eat something

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.869 
when I came in and I eat something
cooked<00:02:45.629> that<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.290> know<00:02:46.409> is<00:02:46.590> much<00:02:46.769> denser<00:02:47.099> it's

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
cooked that you know is much denser it's

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.170 
cooked that you know is much denser it's
a<00:02:47.970> much<00:02:48.120> smaller<00:02:48.480> calorie<00:02:49.049> source<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:51.060> know

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
a much smaller calorie source and I know

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.720 
a much smaller calorie source and I know
it's<00:02:51.420> not<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.540> best<00:02:51.810> option<00:02:52.489> that's<00:02:53.489> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it's not the best option that's the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.250 
it's not the best option that's the
struggle<00:02:53.909> that<00:02:54.120> I've<00:02:54.239> been<00:02:54.450> dealing<00:02:54.659> with<00:02:54.870> I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.399 
struggle that I've been dealing with I
do<00:02:55.799> think<00:02:56.609> that<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:57.030> will<00:02:57.209> fix<00:02:57.540> itself<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:58.349> the

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
do think that it will fix itself in the

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.220 
do think that it will fix itself in the
hopefully<00:02:59.310> near<00:02:59.489> future<00:02:59.790> as<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.480> have<00:03:00.720> noticed

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
hopefully near future as I have noticed

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.610 
hopefully near future as I have noticed
very<00:03:01.879> recently<00:03:02.879> than<00:03:03.150> I've<00:03:03.269> been<00:03:03.299> able<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:03.810> get

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
that in the long run it will be worth it

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.140 
that in the long run it will be worth it
that<00:04:36.780> period<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.350> time<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:38.010> I<00:04:38.310> was<00:04:38.700> able<00:04:38.970> to

calories than they actually are because

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.890

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
easier to just get into a pattern of

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.950 
easier to just get into a pattern of
under<00:05:46.860> eating<00:05:47.280> basically<00:05:48.000> because<00:05:48.690> you'll

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
under eating basically because you'll

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.260 
under eating basically because you'll
never<00:05:49.020> force<00:05:49.590> your<00:05:49.800> stomach<00:05:50.160> to<00:05:50.340> expand<00:05:50.940> if

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
never force your stomach to expand if

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.510 
never force your stomach to expand if
you<00:05:51.420> don't<00:05:51.660> realize<00:05:52.200> you're<00:05:52.590> under<00:05:52.890> eating<00:05:53.280> so

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
you don't realize you're under eating so

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.480 
you don't realize you're under eating so
track<00:05:53.850> your<00:05:54.270> calories<00:05:54.480> and<00:05:55.250> force<00:05:56.250> yourself

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
track your calories and force yourself
