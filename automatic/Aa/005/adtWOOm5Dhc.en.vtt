00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
take apart the stopper you do the second

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.029 
take apart the stopper you do the second
thing<00:02:09.660> which<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.960> take<00:02:10.110> apart<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.500> trap<00:02:10.770> and

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
thing which is take apart the trap and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.610 
thing which is take apart the trap and
you<00:02:11.640> still<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.240> slow<00:02:12.750> running<00:02:12.780> drains<00:02:13.110> or

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
you still have a slow running drains or

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
a clogged drain at that point is

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.090 
a clogged drain at that point is
probably<00:02:15.570> something<00:02:16.140> beyond<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.800> point

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
probably something beyond this point

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.160 
probably something beyond this point
maybe<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.000> wall<00:02:18.180> underneath<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.990> home

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
maybe in the wall underneath the home
