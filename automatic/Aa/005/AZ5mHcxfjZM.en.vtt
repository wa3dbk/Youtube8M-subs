 completely new game she i would say 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.059
 has nothing to do with the first 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.269
 rule so if you don't like

 32 another sequel undergone 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.690
 radical changes in truth 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.390
 from the game released in 2006 there is little 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.609
 left portals no more pampering with 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.199
 by gravity too they were part of the scope 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.750
 who had no place in pro barely 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.070

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.659

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.909
 secondary character 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.949
 about barely this hunter story behind 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.680
 heads in a cyberpunk city populated 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.420
 a variety of alien creatures 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.000
 we play as a hitman us mlc 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.670
 more recently he was a simple military army 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.479
 us but his plane was flying 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.580

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.790
 and m brahma 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.640
 then what we play for foot soldiers who 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.800
 flew on his military plane which 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.810
 suddenly the driver or weaving and mind he 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.370
 woke up many, many years later 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.130
 unknown to him to the coin 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.890
 nothing help he understood so far 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.480

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.160
 already temporarily that he is here 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.260

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.900
 that cyberpunk real where he is one of 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.510
 few people in general mostly his 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.610
 inhabit a variety of aliens and he 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.730
 becomes bounty hunter such an item 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.120
 criminals simple guy who 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:02.040
 solve the problem for the money 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.810
 about barely almost role-playing game only without 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.250
 set dialogues with the ability 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.250
 selection and pumping points 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.370
 What if this football game can 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.980
 say no pkp 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.080
 you have no pumping there any 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.720
 complex interactions with the world but with 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.180
 that she is absolutely not alive you can 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.190
 do what you have and always wanted to 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.760
 action games and can always like brand 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.730
 drink and not always possible 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.069
 if you rest confessions and he's something 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.170
 rubbing you and demanding money from you 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.659

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.939
 put a weapon on him kill him 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.680
 the guard then he describes everything to you 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:42.420
 tell one of the options how 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.720
 you can do committed not managed 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.720
 do 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.890
 we freely travel around the city 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.140
 and quite unusual for shooters 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.060
 the way the authors borrowed the system 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.920
 move from recent multiplayer 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.170
 bring shooter that is, the hero can 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.210
 clamber over a wide variety of surfaces 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.750
 you can move around the rooftops and 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.750
 through the streets 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.620
 can you real jump from building to 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.290
 building cling to everyones 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.880
 giving way will help as drake bath artis 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.010
 clutching a ledge pops out 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.020
 shoot it all first-person 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.060
 without moving real very 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.610
 nontrivial on gaurav 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.450
 move as usual in 3d move and 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.930
 could not and this author allowed 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.819
 create a lot of interesting situations 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.319
 important element of gameplay wizar he 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.540
 allows you to look through the walls and 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.920
 pre-calculate your prey all 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.349
 objects and characters around 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.239
 highlighted in different colors on the video 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.830
 vizar bystander you can 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.470
 see who he is and what he has 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.750
 pockets even rob it but as in 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.090
 many open world police games are not 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.400
 napping worth several times getting caught in 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.430
 lenses flying around cameras like you 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:00.560
 start looking for a bank beaten 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.480
 Now a lot of money can help him and he 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.819
 generously reward or can 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.560
 kill the punks kill the dude himself it 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.540
 pick up all that matter there is such a system 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.580
 she allowed to create 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.610
 the author has found a lot of situations 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.739
 mattresses of the mind is an interesting picture when here's 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.840
 how two aliens beat 3 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.150
 milongero I came up took one like 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.280
 human shield shot another went with 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.710
 this living shield to the club where it was located 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.560
 his order was ordered to open in general 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.220
 the fire of the human shield immediately spread 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.229
 noggin 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.060
 This is a very bloody game and the goal is that 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.100
 we had to kill she started 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.220
 lie frost under the right across the city 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.360
 you really need to run after him 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.180
 the real chase around will 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.430
 heaps want a random passer maybe 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.979
 minions of this goal but only to the player 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.050
 decide to bother spending on them 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.560
 time or rush on with you a in 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.410
 head 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.060
 the game is perfectly straight 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.310
 Can I convey the atmosphere of the real ones? 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.860
 just rushing through some kind of chinese 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.560
 the market on the way burbank all 106 on the way 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.110
 rolling three people kill 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.750
 to catch up with your goal and Horde 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.240
 pounding you put here such 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.330
 windows and in general decides that with him 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.060
 do killed pick up everything he has 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.650
 send to customer or interrogate before 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.990
 as you can say in the past 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.000
 some valuable information regarding 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.220
 plot with this if you 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.660
 everything can confuse him to death and then 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.660
 neither money nor information 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:41.659
 than about hardly this is one of the most 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:43.669
 unexpected games on this show and some 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.500
 very much give late 90s 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.930
 early 2000 by us when developers 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.680
 tried with the usual genres to do 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.629
 something new 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.849
 I wonder really what they will do 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:55.400
 still here is the scene that she lets do 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.680
 tiger cup that always wanted yes not 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.810
 listen to recordings i put him in the face and 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.729
 for that there was nothing or some 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.259
 come to the sad scumbag he where 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:05.030
 personal 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.379
 drill the bridge with such a brush back 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.349
 pistol in the face 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.759
 this is really surprising after years 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.270
 stamps like 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:13.270
 fresh 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.190
 Of course, in the end, I can hardly tire 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.260
 monotonous gameplay and tasks but 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.630
 there is one hopeful detail 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.400
 human head completely abandoned 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.740
 any multiplayer to completely 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.330
 concentrate on single player yes 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.160
 and agree nowadays just 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.530
 see a shooter which is different from 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.530
 the rest is not only the plot already joy 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.909
 gender on our epic version 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:03.069
 report from E3, see www site 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:05.789
 game style and in the September issue 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:05.789
