far<00:03:31.210> away<00:03:31.920> we<00:03:32.920> had<00:03:33.070> a<00:03:33.100> good<00:03:34.000> frost<00:03:34.330> last<00:03:34.540> night

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
far away we had a good frost last night

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.690 
far away we had a good frost last night
so<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.470> was<00:03:35.590> able<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.830> freeze<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.130> lot<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.520> blood

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
so it was able to freeze a lot of blood

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.180 
so it was able to freeze a lot of blood
on<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.970> leaves<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:37.480> in<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.470> soybean<00:03:38.860> field

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
on the leaves and in the soybean field

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.980 
on the leaves and in the soybean field
so<00:03:39.550> we've<00:03:39.940> been<00:03:40.000> able<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.240> track<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.510> very

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
so we've been able to track it very

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.740 
so we've been able to track it very
easily<00:03:41.260> up<00:03:42.070> until<00:03:42.460> it<00:03:42.760> got<00:03:42.880> into<00:03:43.150> this<00:03:43.300> thick

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
easily up until it got into this thick

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.590 
easily up until it got into this thick
cover<00:03:44.020> so<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.680> think<00:03:45.460> we're<00:03:45.700> pretty<00:03:45.730> close<00:03:46.090> it's

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
cover so I think we're pretty close it's

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.910 
cover so I think we're pretty close it's
starting<00:03:46.990> to<00:03:47.050> clot<00:03:47.230> up<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.590> we're<00:03:47.680> finding

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
starting to clot up and we're finding

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.560 
starting to clot up and we're finding
about<00:03:48.130> every<00:03:48.340> ten<00:03:48.520> yards<00:03:48.850> finding<00:03:49.180> spots<00:03:49.390> of

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
about every ten yards finding spots of

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.080 
about every ten yards finding spots of
blood<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:49.990> it<00:03:50.020> should<00:03:50.290> be<00:03:50.320> real<00:03:50.650> close<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:51.190> said

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090
