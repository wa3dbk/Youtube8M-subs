00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
part of the reason I wanted to include

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.950 
part of the reason I wanted to include
it<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:49.890> series<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.660> love<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
it in this series and but I just love it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.110 
it in this series and but I just love it
it's<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.370> it's<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:53.489> difficult<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.910> wear

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it's like it's so difficult to wear

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.520 
it's like it's so difficult to wear
green<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> think<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.930> wasn't<00:00:55.230> quite<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
green and I think this wasn't quite a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.900 
green and I think this wasn't quite a
nice<00:00:55.800> one<00:00:56.070> especially<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.610> glittery

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910

top coat I'm pretty sure upon further

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.729 
top coat I'm pretty sure upon further

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
research the barium is called Aztec
green<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.399> from<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> Aztec<00:01:03.059> collection

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
green it was from the Aztec collection

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.420 
green it was from the Aztec collection
but<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.019> also<00:01:04.170> wanted<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> include<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.070> models

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
collection from OPI this is probably as

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.710 
collection from OPI this is probably as
neon<00:03:35.639> as<00:03:35.910> you're<00:03:36.000> going<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.150> get<00:03:36.269> with<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.510> red

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
neon as you're going to get with a red

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.870 
neon as you're going to get with a red
nail<00:03:36.930> polish<00:03:37.109> it's<00:03:37.650> kind<00:03:37.829> of<00:03:38.069> almost<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.669> little

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
nail polish it's kind of almost a little

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.190 
nail polish it's kind of almost a little
bit<00:03:39.000> shares<00:03:39.299> or<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.569> little<00:03:39.750> bit<00:03:39.840> jelly-like

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
bit shares or a little bit jelly-like

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.930 
bit shares or a little bit jelly-like
and<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.950> definitely<00:03:41.099> gives<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.639> kind<00:03:41.819> of

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
and it definitely gives you that kind of

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.789 
and it definitely gives you that kind of
inner<00:03:42.209> glow<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.139> can<00:03:43.319> get<00:03:43.440> from<00:03:43.590> some

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
inner glow that you can get from some

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.680 
inner glow that you can get from some
nail<00:03:43.980> polish<00:03:44.130> colors<00:03:44.579> so<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.730> think<00:03:44.849> it<00:03:45.299> can<00:03:45.660> be

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
nail polish colors so I think it can be

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.870 
nail polish colors so I think it can be
included<00:03:46.139> within<00:03:46.319> neon<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.220> last<00:03:47.459> one<00:03:47.700> I

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
included within neon and the last one I

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.400 
included within neon and the last one I
would<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.090> pretend<00:03:48.389> I'm<00:03:48.630> holding<00:03:48.930> in<00:03:49.019> my<00:03:49.079> hand

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
would you pretend I'm holding in my hand

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.099 
would you pretend I'm holding in my hand
but<00:03:49.650> I'm<00:03:49.769> not<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.910> neon<00:03:51.359> I<00:03:51.810> don't<00:03:51.989> know<00:03:52.049> if

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
but I'm not it is neon I don't know if

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.390 
but I'm not it is neon I don't know if
it's<00:03:52.200> called<00:03:52.319> neon<00:03:52.560> yellow<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:52.980> think<00:03:53.220> school

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
it's called neon yellow I think school

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.370 
it's called neon yellow I think school
neon<00:03:53.579> yellow<00:03:53.730> neon<00:03:54.090> green<00:03:54.329> which<00:03:55.109> is<00:03:55.230> from

neon yellow neon green which is from
barian<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.190> is<00:03:56.310> fantastic<00:03:56.870> I've<00:03:57.870> never

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
barian and it is fantastic I've never

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.500 
barian and it is fantastic I've never
want<00:03:58.349> it<00:03:58.440> over<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.680> white<00:03:58.859> polish<00:03:59.209> as<00:04:00.209> people

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
want it over a white polish as people

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.240 
want it over a white polish as people
say<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.019> gives<00:04:01.380> it<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.560> extra<00:04:01.799> boost

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
say that that gives it that extra boost

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.530 
say that that gives it that extra boost
and<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:02.489> would<00:04:02.609> imagine<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.970> I've<00:04:03.150> same<00:04:03.419> with

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
and I would imagine that I've same with

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.150 
and I would imagine that I've same with
any<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.810> these<00:04:03.930> nail<00:04:04.109> polishes<00:04:04.530> but<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:04.980> don't

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
any of these nail polishes but I don't

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.190 
any of these nail polishes but I don't
like<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.400> idea<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.730> having<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:06.120> get<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.480> white

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
like the idea of having to get a white

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.110 
like the idea of having to get a white
polish<00:04:07.410> an<00:04:07.620> opaque<00:04:07.950> and<00:04:08.220> then<00:04:08.609> having<00:04:08.819> to<00:04:08.940> put

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
polish an opaque and then having to put

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.520 
polish an opaque and then having to put
an<00:04:09.209> extra<00:04:09.359> couple<00:04:09.599> of<00:04:09.690> coats<00:04:09.900> on<00:04:10.079> and<00:04:10.200> then<00:04:10.500> a

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
an extra couple of coats on and then a

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.199 
an extra couple of coats on and then a
topcoat<00:04:10.859> would<00:04:11.099> be<00:04:11.190> so<00:04:11.370> thick<00:04:11.700> on<00:04:11.879> your<00:04:12.030> nails

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
topcoat would be so thick on your nails

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.879 
topcoat would be so thick on your nails
do<00:04:12.389> you<00:04:12.450> not<00:04:12.599> think<00:04:12.629> and<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.620> don't<00:04:13.799> really

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
do you not think and so I don't really

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.310 
do you not think and so I don't really
like<00:04:13.980> doing<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:14.639> but<00:04:14.940> all<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.840> idea<00:04:16.139> of

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
like doing that but all the idea of

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.050 
like doing that but all the idea of
doing<00:04:16.440> that

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
doing that

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.970 
doing that
but<00:04:17.389> this<00:04:17.480> one<00:04:17.660> probably<00:04:17.840> takes<00:04:18.290> four<00:04:18.650> or<00:04:18.799> five

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
but this one probably takes four or five

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.710 
but this one probably takes four or five
coats<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.489> get<00:04:19.609> it<00:04:19.730> really<00:04:20.090> opaque<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.540> really

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
coats to get it really opaque and really

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.360 
coats to get it really opaque and really
bright<00:04:20.930> it's<00:04:21.440> got<00:04:21.590> some<00:04:21.769> kind<00:04:21.889> of<00:04:22.040> almost
