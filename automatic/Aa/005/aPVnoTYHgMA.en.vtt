acoustic<00:02:52.709> pickup<00:02:53.550> but<00:02:54.330> what<00:02:54.510> happens<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:55.050> it

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
acoustic pickup but what happens is it

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.280 
acoustic pickup but what happens is it
acts<00:02:55.800> as<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.100> push<00:02:56.610> selector<00:02:57.360> switch<00:02:57.660> which

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
acts as a push selector switch which

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.350 
acts as a push selector switch which
allows<00:02:58.319> me<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.819> which

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360

it gives me a blue signal which tells me

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.340 
it gives me a blue signal which tells me
I<00:03:16.650> am<00:03:16.830> just<00:03:17.280> now<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.940> passive<00:03:18.870> mode<00:03:18.900> which<00:03:19.230> I'm

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
I am just now in passive mode which I'm

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.140 
I am just now in passive mode which I'm
just<00:03:19.560> using<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.950> pro<00:03:20.190> Bucer<00:03:20.430> pickups<00:03:20.940> and

and my whatever pickup I'm selected on I

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.190 
and my whatever pickup I'm selected on I
can<00:03:37.980> use<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.670> as<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.940> primary<00:03:39.209> electric

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
can use that as the primary electric

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.420 
can use that as the primary electric
volume<00:03:41.160> knob<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:42.959> course<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.010> do<00:03:44.160> all<00:03:44.280> this

volume knob of course to do all this

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.130 
volume knob of course to do all this
you'll<00:03:44.640> need<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.940> proper<00:03:45.270> input<00:03:45.660> jacks<00:03:45.930> and

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
you'll need the proper input jacks and

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.110 
you'll need the proper input jacks and
as<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.380> can<00:03:46.530> see<00:03:46.680> here<00:03:47.040> we<00:03:47.520> have<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.820> input

as you can see here we have the input
jack<00:03:48.150> for<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.630> magnetic<00:03:49.050> if<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.200> just<00:03:49.440> want<00:03:49.650> to

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
jack for the magnetic if I just want to

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.130 
jack for the magnetic if I just want to
use<00:03:50.070> just<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.700> pickups<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.690> acoustic

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
use just the pickups and the acoustic

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.270 
use just the pickups and the acoustic

capabilities through my regular guitar

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.220 
capabilities through my regular guitar
amplifier<00:03:53.850> but<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:54.450> course<00:03:54.660> it's<00:03:54.810> best<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.050> use

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
amplifier but of course it's best to use

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.870 
amplifier but of course it's best to use
an<00:03:55.320> acoustic<00:03:55.709> amplifier<00:03:56.160> which<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:56.670> why<00:03:56.850> I

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
an acoustic amplifier which is why I

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.340 
an acoustic amplifier which is why I
have<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.030> separate<00:03:57.450> Jack<00:03:57.660> going<00:03:57.870> into<00:03:58.200> my

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
have a separate Jack going into my

have a separate Jack going into my
acoustic<00:03:58.650> amplifier<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.580> then<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.180> course

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
acoustic amplifier and then of course

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.060 
acoustic amplifier and then of course
into<00:04:00.600> my<00:04:00.690> guitar<00:04:01.020> amplifier<00:04:01.410> from<00:04:01.620> here

hearing the Epiphone ultra 339 I'll

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.920 
hearing the Epiphone ultra 339 I'll
start<00:04:41.010> with<00:04:41.160> letting<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.060> hear<00:04:42.390> just<00:04:42.780> the

acoustic<00:04:43.470> sound<00:04:43.710> on<00:04:44.010> its<00:04:44.220> own<00:04:44.460> then<00:04:45.210> I'll<00:04:45.360> kick

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
acoustic sound on its own then I'll kick

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.360 
acoustic sound on its own then I'll kick
it<00:04:45.810> into<00:04:45.960> just<00:04:46.350> the<00:04:46.470> passive<00:04:46.950> mode<00:04:47.100> so<00:04:47.250> you'll

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
it into just the passive mode so you'll

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.240
