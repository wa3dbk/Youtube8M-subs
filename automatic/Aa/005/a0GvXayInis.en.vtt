00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.770

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.660
 I come bringing a folder that says 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.720

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.840

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.180
 in which there is still going to be a folder 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.040
 which is called skin for haiti and then he 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.600
 is the one who right now will see that the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.160
 it's really super super curly once 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.440
 that you do it you know if they apply it 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.630

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.220
 is the subject you already know choose those files 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.290

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.360
 resources issues and apply it out 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.060
 Gentlemen copy it and then apply it 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.400
 You know, it's a bit old, but 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.170
 that the truth is supposed by fire not 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.940
 Many people impress you because you do not 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.460
 many people had not seen it and then they 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.510
 beats even though the last one is old 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.220

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.090

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.090
 of customization I hope they come back to 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.460
 come back these volume packs have the 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.930
 same punch that I had before here in the 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.180
 channel to renew them back to 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.069
 receive because the truth 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.290
 when you open the channel of yourself 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.540
 renew in one of your videos 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.780
 can be completely sure of 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.960
 that nothing is junk that nothing is 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.510
 means that nothing is videos without 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.880
 without taking another time all everything 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.720
 all all all all you have is 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.220
 renew the work is quality and therefore 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.900

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.780

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.730

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.220
 detail but with the right evolution 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.570

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.570
