your hand and then it's just a matter of
just<00:01:29.800> ripping<00:01:30.800> it<00:01:30.890> right<00:01:31.369> down<00:01:32.110> just<00:01:33.110> like

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
just ripping it right down just like

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.020 
just ripping it right down just like
that<00:01:33.580> sometimes<00:01:34.580> you'll<00:01:34.790> get<00:01:34.910> a<00:01:34.970> little

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
that sometimes you'll get a little

that sometimes you'll get a little
splinter<00:01:35.540> group<00:01:35.840> going<00:01:36.080> but<00:01:36.920> it's<00:01:37.070> pretty

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
splinter group going but it's pretty

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.230

easy to take off as well and see the
difference<00:01:41.630> between<00:01:42.290> this<00:01:42.680> one<00:01:42.920> this<00:01:43.280> one<00:01:43.570> now

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
difference between this one this one now

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.120 
difference between this one this one now
let's<00:01:44.630> go<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.110> put<00:01:45.229> some<00:01:45.410> seasoning<00:01:45.830> on<00:01:45.950> them
