00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.699
 hi how about guys in this video what 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.890
 you're going to see is how are we going to hit jumps 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.469
 that are going to send us to fly so much 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.300
 we like cars like 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.129
 unexpectedly the least we 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.100
 we were hoping that it would be flying to fly 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.239
 the stratosphere the very simple trick what 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.409
 only thing that you will have to do is come to 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.479
 the location is where I am 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.519
 marking and once you have come here 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.690
 with a friend a friend will have 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.059
 what to put as I am right now 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.379
 placed on the door look and it will get 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.330
 stuck there as if you were 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.009
 hiding from someone until you see that 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.379
 the door is blocked and it is sticking 

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.970
 like skips and then just the 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.369
 friends will have to hit a half jump 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.739
 of the door or stamp against the 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:06.140
 car against the door and once they do 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.479
 that can happen three things or the one 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.310
 know the grandmother or the one who jumps with the 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.409
 car flies you jump with a car instead 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.820
 walking or the one that is placed in the 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.890
 door you can pass several things what 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.030
 you can kill or you can just kill it 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.740
 send to fly as you have seen what 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.930
 it happens that it has flown to the stratosphere 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.570
 it's very very funny is not it useful 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.100
 for nothing but it's a laugh so nothing 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.810
 I invite you to go and take a 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.640
 xavi artist with your friends a 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.640
