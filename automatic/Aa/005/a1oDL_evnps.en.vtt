00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
was in the room and you have video

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.080 
was in the room and you have video
effects<00:03:45.560> this<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.710> like<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:47.220> heat<00:03:47.640> sensitive

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
effects this is like a heat sensitive

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.710 
effects this is like a heat sensitive
thing<00:03:48.950> well<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:49.980> don't<00:03:50.130> think<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.460> now<00:03:50.730> it's

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
thing well I don't think it is now it's

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.010 
thing well I don't think it is now it's
just<00:03:51.960> an<00:03:52.080> effect<00:03:53.000> got<00:03:54.000> matrix<00:03:54.510> numbers<00:03:54.900> on

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
just an effect got matrix numbers on

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.860 
just an effect got matrix numbers on
here<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.440> guess<00:03:55.650> it's<00:03:55.830> just<00:03:55.890> for<00:03:56.220> kids

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870

here I guess it's just for kids
distorting<00:03:57.870> inverted<00:04:02.630> kind<00:04:03.630> of<00:04:03.690> weird<00:04:03.900> yeah

that's about really the gist of it and
I'm<00:04:08.100> really<00:04:08.250> disappointed<00:04:08.460> it<00:04:08.940> doesn't<00:04:09.180> come

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
can just include it on my blog and this

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.880 
can just include it on my blog and this
we<00:04:24.750> put<00:04:24.900> on<00:04:24.990> my<00:04:25.080> blog<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.440> people<00:04:25.740> could

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
we put on my blog and people could

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.520 
we put on my blog and people could
control<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.460> mice<00:04:27.210> around<00:04:27.360> with<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.750> if<00:04:28.050> when<00:04:28.440> I

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
control it mice around with it if when I

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.560 
control it mice around with it if when I
let<00:04:28.740> them<00:04:28.890> but<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.580> guess<00:04:30.060> it's<00:04:30.240> gonna<00:04:30.360> take<00:04:30.540> a

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
let them but I guess it's gonna take a

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.960 
let them but I guess it's gonna take a
bit<00:04:30.720> more<00:04:33.110> well<00:04:34.110> see<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.700> know<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.910> other

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
bit more well see and you know the other

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.340 
bit more well see and you know the other
cool<00:04:36.330> feature<00:04:36.600> about<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:36.900> robot<00:04:37.260> is

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
cool feature about this robot is

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.840 
cool feature about this robot is
obviously<00:04:37.680> it's<00:04:37.980> got<00:04:38.160> an<00:04:38.220> onboard<00:04:38.490> battery

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
obviously it's got an onboard battery

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.210 
obviously it's got an onboard battery
but<00:04:39.060> sure<00:04:39.420> it<00:04:39.720> runs<00:04:39.870> out<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.950> needs<00:04:41.130> to

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
but sure it runs out so it needs to

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.180 
but sure it runs out so it needs to
charge<00:04:41.370> himself<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:43.260> docking<00:04:43.620> Xu<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:44.040> way

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
charge himself the docking Xu is way

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.090 
charge himself the docking Xu is way
over<00:04:44.400> there<00:04:44.610> it's<00:04:45.450> a<00:04:45.510> good<00:04:45.770> meter<00:04:46.770> away<00:04:46.980> from

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
over there it's a good meter away from

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.680 
over there it's a good meter away from
the<00:04:47.280> robot<00:04:47.610> he's<00:04:47.880> I<00:04:47.910> guess<00:04:49.070> now<00:04:50.210> if<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.330> click<00:04:51.390> on

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
the robot he's I guess now if I click on

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.470 
the robot he's I guess now if I click on
here<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:52.230> battery<00:04:52.470> icon<00:04:53.090> you<00:04:54.090> can<00:04:54.180> see<00:04:54.360> it's

so<00:05:49.990> it<00:05:50.050> could<00:05:50.229> plant<00:05:50.469> the<00:05:50.620> steps<00:05:50.860> but<00:05:51.069> it

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
so it could plant the steps but it

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.070 
so it could plant the steps but it
doesn't<00:05:51.550> in<00:05:52.060> fact<00:05:52.270> if<00:05:52.389> you<00:05:52.479> take<00:05:52.629> it<00:05:52.780> anyway<00:05:53.020> in

know I think I can drive around the
house<00:07:01.300> to<00:07:01.539> the<00:07:01.719> kids<00:07:01.930> room<00:07:02.110> whatever<00:07:02.409> I<00:07:02.469> want

house to the kids room whatever I want

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.809 
house to the kids room whatever I want
to<00:07:02.680> do<00:07:02.800> is<00:07:02.979> nice

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:03.819 
to do is nice

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.240 
to do is nice
if<00:07:04.599> the<00:07:04.750> start<00:07:05.020> of<00:07:05.110> things<00:07:05.259> to<00:07:05.469> come<00:07:05.710> but<00:07:06.219> I

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.250 
if the start of things to come but I

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.519 
if the start of things to come but I
certainly<00:07:06.580> think<00:07:06.819> in<00:07:07.029> in<00:07:07.270> version<00:07:07.719> 2.0<00:07:08.319> or

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:08.529 
certainly think in in version 2.0 or

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:10.980 
certainly think in in version 2.0 or
whatever<00:07:08.919> will<00:07:09.129> be<00:07:09.159> next<00:07:09.639> when<00:07:10.240> you<00:07:10.479> know<00:07:10.599> but

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
whatever will be next when you know but

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.540 
whatever will be next when you know but
I<00:07:11.110> guess<00:07:11.139> actually<00:07:11.680> saying<00:07:11.919> that<00:07:12.129> this<00:07:12.400> is

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:12.550 
I guess actually saying that this is

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.040 
I guess actually saying that this is
mikono<00:07:12.909> so<00:07:13.180> maybe<00:07:13.389> they'll<00:07:13.599> just<00:07:13.779> create

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
mikono so maybe they'll just create

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.439 
mikono so maybe they'll just create
add-ons<00:07:14.349> bolt<00:07:14.860> ons<00:07:15.069> you<00:07:15.370> know<00:07:16.000> all<00:07:16.270> these

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:16.449 
add-ons bolt ons you know all these

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:17.969 
add-ons bolt ons you know all these
things<00:07:16.539> come<00:07:16.930> apart<00:07:17.050> you<00:07:17.409> can<00:07:17.560> build<00:07:17.770> three

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:17.979 
things come apart you can build three

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:20.459 
things come apart you can build three
different<00:07:18.339> flavors<00:07:18.580> of<00:07:18.909> this<00:07:19.029> robot<00:07:19.509> so<00:07:20.199> maybe

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:20.469 
different flavors of this robot so maybe

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:22.340 
different flavors of this robot so maybe
they'll<00:07:20.770> just<00:07:20.800> go<00:07:21.130> out<00:07:21.250> with<00:07:21.430> them<00:07:21.729> you

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
they'll just go out with them you

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.260 
they'll just go out with them you
sophisticated<00:07:23.350> on<00:07:24.100> movement<00:07:24.789> things<00:07:25.030> head

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
sophisticated on movement things head

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.430
