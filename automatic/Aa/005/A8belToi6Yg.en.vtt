00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello to those 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:15.619
 With you shock and today I will tell you how 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:18.859
 configure md graphics card for games with 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:23.640
 maximum performance and 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:26.519
 increase fps of similar cases each 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.980
 Crimea asked such questions therefore 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:35.040
 what do we need to start downloading the most 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.090
 new firewood in dmd download mdts list 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.059
 control center 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.980
 I downloaded some beta drivers for 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:46.350
 for every crap enough now 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.660
 what we need we need 2 input this 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.559
 game tab and performance with 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.390
 so 3d application d a r t 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:59.960
 dover thrive is responsible for maximizing 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.609
 the frequency of the processor and memory card 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.670
 dough does not automatically adjust 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.409
 fan speed all similar 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 depending on the frequency you need 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.659
 memory and so here is this mode including 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.680
 so much when activity 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.659
 video card reaches 90 percent and pain 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.820
 so you can tick and not 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.530
 steam can also put a manual 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.159
 fan control and put you 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.869
 one hundred percent but better about it for now 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.810
 will not go into the application settings 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:40.799
 so what we need to do first 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.700
 smoothing parameter all this 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.659
 turned off already detect it improves the quality 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.750
 image standard set 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.570
 standard 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.570
 so now we go bad filtering 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.280
 so not over the path so redefine 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.189
 anisotropic application settings 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.509
 16x filtering 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.229
 filtration quality performance 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.799
 optimization of some formats 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:18.180
 the surface is not worth so turn off sats x 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.760
 set to better 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.430
 look at all sorts of small textures in 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.260
 games the same can be done for and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.500
 nvidia but there somehow it is not very 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.470
 fundamentally exit then into the difference 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.079
 of course i will show the frequency control 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.910
 frames 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.670
 Well, naturally cloth sync pulses 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.810
 turn on and dad did not warm triple 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.660
 buffering 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.390
 it makes no sense to put if you turned off 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.530
 vertical sync and mode 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.379
 tessellation adjusts tessellation level 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.849
 I do not know dust and what it is but 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.130
 the fact is that when you turn 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:00.030
 battlefield 4 i dont work this 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:04.019
 better to leave and that's basically all 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:10.940
 what do you want to customize so dare 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:13.079
 Good for everyone, yes, I'm so goodbye 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.010
 subscribe to the put put likes channel 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.010
 bye Bye 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.200
 I am a stove 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.870
 but 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.230
 auto 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.230
 new
