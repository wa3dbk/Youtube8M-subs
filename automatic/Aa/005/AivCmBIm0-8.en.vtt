some Lego sets

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.940 
some Lego sets
I<00:00:44.489> cut<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.649> only<00:00:46.739> way<00:00:46.920> I

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
I cut them because it's the only way I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.260 
I cut them because it's the only way I
could<00:00:47.100> figure<00:00:47.309> out<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.640> make<00:00:47.879> them<00:00:48.030> small

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
could figure out how to make them small

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.500 
could figure out how to make them small
enough<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:49.610> what<00:00:50.610> you'll<00:00:50.730> have<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> cut

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
enough so what you'll have to do is cut

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.650 
enough so what you'll have to do is cut
them<00:00:51.660> down<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> size<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.770> they<00:00:52.890> fit<00:00:53.129> and

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
them down to size so that they fit and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.490 
them down to size so that they fit and
here's<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> process<00:00:55.160> take<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> 1<00:00:56.430> by<00:00:56.579> 3<00:00:56.610> plate

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
here's the process take a 1 by 3 plate

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.799 
here's the process take a 1 by 3 plate
to<00:00:58.500> these<00:00:58.739> little<00:00:59.100> triangle<00:00:59.670> pieces<00:01:00.629> right

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
other way I put this one on backwards

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.740 
other way I put this one on backwards
just<00:02:26.470> like<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:27.120> there<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.150> go<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.630> now

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750

Peabody<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.440> correct<00:02:29.890> now<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.880> built<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.630> to

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
Peabody is correct now I built this to

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.440 
Peabody is correct now I built this to
try<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.680> imitate<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.520> video<00:02:33.730> game<00:02:33.940> model<00:02:34.360> as

try to imitate the video game model as

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.980 
try to imitate the video game model as
much<00:02:34.630> as<00:02:34.750> possible<00:02:34.960> so<00:02:35.830> her<00:02:36.190> legs<00:02:36.450> are<00:02:37.450> not<00:02:37.630> she

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
much as possible so her legs are not she

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.260 
much as possible so her legs are not she
doesn't<00:02:38.140> she<00:02:38.800> doesn't<00:02:38.830> stay<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.820> use<00:02:40.240> a

doesn't she doesn't stay up so I use a

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.790 
doesn't she doesn't stay up so I use a
little<00:02:40.420> bit<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.660> clay<00:02:40.870> for<00:02:41.200> my<00:02:41.290> animations

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
little bit of clay for my animations

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.980 
little bit of clay for my animations
stick<00:02:42.580> her<00:02:42.670> on<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.850> ground<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.300> she's<00:02:43.720> great

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
stick her on the ground and she's great

on all sides but start with this piece

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.080 
on all sides but start with this piece
up<00:03:04.830> because<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:06.220> don't<00:03:06.459> need<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.760> use<00:03:06.910> that

up because you don't need to use that

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.600 
up because you don't need to use that
part<00:03:07.450> for<00:03:07.600> anything<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.650> we're<00:03:09.250> going<00:03:09.400> to

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
part for anything so we're going to
