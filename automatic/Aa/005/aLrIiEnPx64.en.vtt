a<00:03:10.319> syrax<00:03:10.680> bomber<00:03:15.829> so<00:03:16.829> again<00:03:17.100> just<00:03:17.130> look<00:03:17.489> at<00:03:17.549> the

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
a syrax bomber so again just look at the

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.949 
a syrax bomber so again just look at the
timing<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.389> mean<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.630> can<00:03:18.750> happen

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
timing of this I mean it can happen

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.050 
timing of this I mean it can happen
really<00:03:19.139> really<00:03:19.560> close<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.459> time<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.790> the
