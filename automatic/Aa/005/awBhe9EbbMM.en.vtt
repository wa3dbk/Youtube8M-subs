00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
few times now and it takes five of the

few times now and it takes five of the
legs<00:00:33.660> for<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> sub<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.469> fall<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> ground

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
capturing the point you might want to

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.580 
capturing the point you might want to
bring<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.090> sub<00:00:39.329> down<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.500> will

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
bring the sub down because it will

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.590 
bring the sub down because it will
provide<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> capturing<00:00:41.579> team<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.059> bit<00:00:42.360> more

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
provide the capturing team a bit more

provide the capturing team a bit more
covered<00:00:43.160> before<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.489> sub<00:00:44.700> comes<00:00:44.910> down<00:00:45.120> there

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
covered before the sub comes down there

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.369 
covered before the sub comes down there
isn't<00:00:45.570> much<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> hide<00:00:45.960> behind

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
isn't much to hide behind

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.959 
isn't much to hide behind
but<00:00:46.590> once<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> sub<00:00:47.129> falls<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.670> hide

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
but once the sub falls you can hide

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.340 
but once the sub falls you can hide
behind<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.329> big<00:00:48.480> three<00:00:48.719> pieces<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
behind the big three pieces of the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.970

submarine

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.310 
submarine
it<00:00:50.550> will<00:00:50.700> also<00:00:50.789> crush<00:00:51.180> anyone<00:00:51.600> below<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.110> sub

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it will also crush anyone below the sub

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.900 
it will also crush anyone below the sub
as<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.039> you're<00:00:53.190> running<00:00:53.340> around<00:00:53.550> down

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
as well so if you're running around down

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.369 
as well so if you're running around down
below<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.420> keep<00:00:54.719> an<00:00:54.840> eye<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:54.989> how<00:00:55.320> many

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
below there keep an eye on how many

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.959 
below there keep an eye on how many
stands<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.920> been<00:00:56.039> destroyed<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.789> don't

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
stands have been destroyed so you don't

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:05.140 
stands have been destroyed so you don't
get<00:00:57.059> killed

you<00:01:35.940> might<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.270> thinking<00:01:36.660> while<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:37.020> teams

are going to camp these switches but it
will<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> lot<00:01:39.330> harder<00:01:39.570> than<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.840> think

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
because each gate has a set of two

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.510
