playful interactions for a long time we
were<00:01:17.179> so<00:01:17.389> constrained<00:01:17.749> by<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.020> mouse<00:01:18.229> and

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
were so constrained by a mouse and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.469 
were so constrained by a mouse and
keyboard<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:19.369> know<00:01:19.520> that<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:20.090> was<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.389> way

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
keyboard you know that that was the way

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.879 
keyboard you know that that was the way
we<00:01:20.509> had<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.840> figure<00:01:21.200> out<00:01:21.319> how<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:21.499> make<00:01:21.710> things

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:21.889 
we had to figure out how to make things

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.440 
we had to figure out how to make things
feel<00:01:22.159> expressive<00:01:22.789> through<00:01:22.999> those<00:01:23.119> interfaces

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
feel expressive through those interfaces

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.779 
feel expressive through those interfaces
or<00:01:23.780> even<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:24.170> gamepad<00:01:24.649> I<00:01:24.979> think<00:01:25.429> we're<00:01:25.700> in

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
or even in the gamepad I think we're in

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.010 
or even in the gamepad I think we're in
a<00:01:25.850> really<00:01:25.999> interesting<00:01:26.299> period<00:01:26.630> right<00:01:26.840> now

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
a really interesting period right now

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.069 
a really interesting period right now
especially<00:01:27.409> regards<00:01:28.189> to<00:01:28.340> input<00:01:28.729> these<00:01:29.600> new

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
especially regards to input these new

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.080 
especially regards to input these new
technologies<00:01:30.709> and<00:01:30.920> new<00:01:30.979> ways<00:01:31.069> but<00:01:31.789> have<00:01:31.939> their

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
technologies and new ways but have their

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.919 
technologies and new ways but have their
own<00:01:32.209> limitations<00:01:33.189> but<00:01:34.189> they<00:01:34.369> open<00:01:34.700> up<00:01:34.819> a<00:01:34.999> set

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
own limitations but they open up a set

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.559 
own limitations but they open up a set
of<00:01:36.049> expressive<00:01:36.619> options<00:01:37.039> for<00:01:37.310> how<00:01:37.459> you<00:01:37.569> input

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
of expressive options for how you input

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.270 
of expressive options for how you input
into<00:01:38.929> the<00:01:39.139> game<00:01:39.319> whatever

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
into the game whatever

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.430 
into the game whatever
experience<00:01:40.790> you're<00:01:40.940> talking<00:01:41.299> about<00:01:41.570> that

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
experience you're talking about that

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.990 
experience you're talking about that
just<00:01:42.470> makes<00:01:43.100> things<00:01:43.190> possible<00:01:43.460> that<00:01:43.850> weren't

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
just makes things possible that weren't

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.330 
just makes things possible that weren't
possible<00:01:44.119> before<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:45.020> think<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:45.979> lot<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.159> what

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
possible before I think a lot of what

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.649 
possible before I think a lot of what
any<00:01:46.549> gamers<00:01:46.940> are<00:01:47.090> trying<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.390> do<00:01:47.510> now<00:01:47.630> that

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
any gamers are trying to do now that

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.060 
any gamers are trying to do now that
we're<00:01:47.930> sort<00:01:48.140> of<00:01:48.229> trying<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.470> like<00:01:48.650> reach<00:01:48.860> in

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
we're sort of trying to like reach in

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.330 
we're sort of trying to like reach in
and<00:01:49.190> pull<00:01:49.630> at<00:01:50.630> least<00:01:50.810> temporarily<00:01:50.990> pull<00:01:51.650> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
and pull at least temporarily pull the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.520 
and pull at least temporarily pull the
idea<00:01:52.670> of<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:53.030> game<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.600> video<00:01:53.840> game<00:01:54.020> out<00:01:54.259> of

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
idea of a game and a video game out of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.920 
idea of a game and a video game out of
that<00:01:54.799> mechanism<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.580> being<00:01:55.850> always<00:01:56.540> about<00:01:56.750> big

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
that mechanism of being always about big

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.380 
that mechanism of being always about big
companies<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.860> seeing<00:01:58.580> what<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:58.820> have<00:01:59.060> if

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
companies and and seeing what we have if

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.969 
companies and and seeing what we have if
I<00:01:59.479> have<00:01:59.630> different<00:01:59.869> elbow<00:02:00.259> room<00:02:00.440> now<00:02:00.680> what

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
I have different elbow room now what

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.190 
I have different elbow room now what
does<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.130> feel<00:02:01.369> like<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.729> make<00:02:01.909> something<00:02:02.200> can

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
does it feel like to make something can

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.410 
does it feel like to make something can
I<00:02:03.290> create<00:02:03.680> this<00:02:03.890> mental<00:02:04.280> space<00:02:04.520> where<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:05.149> don't

know what tradition is I don't need to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.070 
know what tradition is I don't need to
know<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.940> way<00:02:08.030> it<00:02:08.119> was<00:02:08.239> supposed<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.690> be<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.020> I

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
know the way it was supposed to be and I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.540 
know the way it was supposed to be and I
try<00:02:09.259> not<00:02:09.319> to<00:02:09.500> follow<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.920> rules<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.459> that's

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
try not to follow the rules and that's

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.759 
try not to follow the rules and that's
sort<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:10.910> what<00:02:11.090> you're<00:02:11.239> seeing<00:02:14.590> we're<00:02:15.590> still

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
in the very early stages of this even

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.440 
in the very early stages of this even
being<00:02:17.750> possible<00:02:18.320> for<00:02:18.500> people<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.769> do<00:02:19.010> so<00:02:19.940> you
