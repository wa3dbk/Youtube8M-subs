00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.820
 so people, the first step is to cut the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.440
 pallet, we are going to measure 1 and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.500
 20 for 60 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.380
 the pallet he has he already has this part 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.020
 vineyard that facilitates cutting does not need 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.720
 I'm measuring very accurately, I'm going 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.470
 to allow this way here and I will tell 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.470
 with the tico-tico saw 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.000
 then here we have the pallet 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.840
 with the right measure let's leave it 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.840
 all i suggest uses alexandre even let 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.189
 in garbage hand 60 wood it 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.189
 take this fault well 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.400
 so the first step is such a bottom 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.740
 which is the preparatory fund for the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.150
 painting, why are we going to do it later? 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.150
 I used to use latex paint 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.910
 Good. So, we've already shaved. 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.420
 that is the basis of culture and will 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.270
 this paint pallet yellow that tinga 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.640
 I the water-based enamel because 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.210
 because it is a very dry ink 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.970
 fast it covers only two of superbem 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.720
 already needed and is much better than the 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.720
 that synthetic enamel 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.320
 and now I'm going to repeat the same process 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.729
 on the second pallet because we're going 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.729
 make a two-bedroom couch 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.770
 now that the structure is ready to 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.500
 people think of upholstery so there are several 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.000
 ideas can be made to make the upholstery gives 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.300
 to put the footon that is 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.340
 wonderful and a better idea is 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.990
 pick up a mattress and coated with fabric 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.290
 to end this sofa 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.420
 Can we have the backrest done? 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.360
 only that the cost will be a bit more 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.900
 high or can we think of 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.900
 cushions 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.670
 I thought a suggestion is to use a 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.310
 side table 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.800
 matching that sofa so what I 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.700
 I did get a pallet of 1 and 20 by 80 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.980
 like the average 60 couch so I pretend the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.400
 right here 60 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.480
 And for the smaller table, of course, so I 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.160
 I left two supports and cut only by 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.830
 party which has a 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.900
 Then I thought a choir is complementary. 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.260
 that this turquoise blue that is 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.140
 using pretty suits everything and I did 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.990
 affirms the same process of painting the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.300
 sofa I painted this pallet so now 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.020
 to finish more lateral line to people 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.760
 will set the fire 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:29.070
 I got silicone caster I 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:34.040
 I think that super luxury is a measure only 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.040
 I had only put him 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.560
 Hmm 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.580
