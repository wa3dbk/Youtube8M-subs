be<00:00:56.030> doing<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.300> review<00:00:56.420> on<00:00:56.600> that<00:00:56.839> later<00:00:57.050> on<00:00:57.230> in

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
be doing a review on that later on in

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.100 
be doing a review on that later on in
the<00:00:57.500> year

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.440 

I<00:01:03.670> think<00:01:04.840> overall<00:01:05.840> it<00:01:05.960> was<00:01:06.260> my<00:01:06.380> Yamaha<00:01:06.710> FJ<00:01:07.450> 1200

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
I think overall it was my Yamaha FJ 1200

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.000 
I think overall it was my Yamaha FJ 1200
I<00:01:09.730> had<00:01:10.730> that<00:01:10.940> in<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.270> early<00:01:11.870> 90s<00:01:12.380> there<00:01:12.860> was<00:01:12.950> a

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
I had that in the early 90s there was a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.860 
I had that in the early 90s there was a
lovely<00:01:13.640> machine<00:01:15.610> great<00:01:16.610> all-rounder<00:01:17.300> I<00:01:17.480> think

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
lovely machine great all-rounder I think

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.840 
lovely machine great all-rounder I think
the<00:01:17.960> second<00:01:18.350> best<00:01:18.560> has<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.130> be<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.430> corona

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
the second best has to be the corona

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.810 
the second best has to be the corona
I've<00:01:20.090> got<00:01:20.300> at<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:20.510> moment<00:01:21.160> but<00:01:22.160> aronia<00:01:22.580> will

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
I've got at the moment but aronia will

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.910 
I've got at the moment but aronia will
be<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.060> first<00:01:23.300> best<00:01:23.600> if<00:01:23.900> it<00:01:24.050> was<00:01:24.170> more<00:01:24.350> usable

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
be the first best if it was more usable

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.130 
be the first best if it was more usable
in<00:01:25.040> slow<00:01:25.490> town<00:01:25.760> traffic<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.900> fuel

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
in slow town traffic and the fuel

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.330 
in slow town traffic and the fuel
injection<00:01:27.470> mapping<00:01:27.860> was<00:01:27.979> just<00:01:28.190> that<00:01:28.310> little

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
injection mapping was just that little

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.560 
injection mapping was just that little
bit<00:01:28.700> better

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.840
