congressional approval for this type of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.929

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
action what's different in this case

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
action what's different in this case
you're<00:01:18.600> right<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> mean<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.200> haven't<00:01:19.380> actually

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you're right I mean we haven't actually

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.999 
you're right I mean we haven't actually
declared<00:01:20.369> war<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> country<00:01:21.330> since<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
declared war as a country since the

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.640 
declared war as a country since the
1940s<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.330> particular<00:01:24.750> case<00:01:25.380> I

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
1940s and so this particular case I

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.710 
1940s and so this particular case I
think<00:01:25.680> speaks<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.610> fact<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
think speaks to the fact that the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
think speaks to the fact that the
president<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.320> well<00:01:28.530> aware<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.189> public
