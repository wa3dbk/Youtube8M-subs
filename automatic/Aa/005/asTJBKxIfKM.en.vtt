days<00:03:16.410> absolutely<00:03:17.160> not<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.490> walk<00:03:17.970> into<00:03:18.150> the

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
days absolutely not you walk into the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.200 
days absolutely not you walk into the
studio<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:19.190> there's<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.400> something<00:03:21.090> about

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
studio and there's just something about

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.110 
studio and there's just something about
the<00:03:21.540> performance<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:23.220> lifts<00:03:24.030> you

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
the performance that just lifts you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.450 
the performance that just lifts you
every<00:03:24.330> time<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:24.990> think<00:03:25.050> if<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.590> stops<00:03:26.280> being

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
every time and I think if it stops being

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.460 
every time and I think if it stops being
like<00:03:26.730> this<00:03:26.910> if<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.570> stop<00:03:27.780> getting<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:28.200> little

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
like this if I stop getting that little

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.870 
like this if I stop getting that little
tingle<00:03:29.040> on<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.190> back<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.430> my<00:03:29.460> neck<00:03:29.640> when<00:03:29.820> I

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
tingle on the back of my neck when I

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.630 
tingle on the back of my neck when I
walk<00:03:30.030> into<00:03:30.210> the<00:03:30.300> studio<00:03:30.540> then<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.520> should<00:03:32.520> go

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
walk into the studio then I should go

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.830 
walk into the studio then I should go
and<00:03:32.670> do<00:03:32.820> something<00:03:32.850> else<00:03:33.270> because<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.630> is

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
and do something else because it is

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.320 
and do something else because it is
supposed<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.710> about<00:03:34.800> excitement<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.970> it's

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
supposed to be about excitement and it's

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.690 
supposed to be about excitement and it's
supposed<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.600> be<00:03:36.720> hopefully<00:03:37.110> about<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:38.310> being

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
supposed to be hopefully about you being

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.660 
supposed to be hopefully about you being
able<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.090> create<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.860> your<00:03:41.160> music<00:03:41.400> and

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
able to create that in your music and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.520 
able to create that in your music and
with<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.970> players<00:03:42.210> and<00:03:42.660> then<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.110> comes

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
with the players and then that comes

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.840 
with the players and then that comes
through<00:03:43.770> I<00:03:43.830> think<00:03:43.860> in<00:03:44.250> your<00:03:44.280> tracks<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.480> using
