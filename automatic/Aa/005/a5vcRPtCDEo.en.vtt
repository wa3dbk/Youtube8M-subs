00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.079
 today the recipe with gratin dauphinois as for the classic black film 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:17.970
 but this one 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.990
 it is for tooth and in addition it is not reached then will push Dauphinois time 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.689
 the ingredients we're going to need, of course, the potatoes the apples 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.099
 with firm flesh that's important for the recipe 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.899
 then we need lep 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.220
 we will need 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.780
 we need liquid cream 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.230
 no thick cream 1 rather the liquid cream 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.370
 grated Gruyère cheese or Emmenthal cheese 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.449
 a hint of nutmeg 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.449
 and of course to season salt pepper 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.410
 we will put metro gratin small capes om om earth 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.710
 or you wish 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.560
 in a gratin dish 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.360
 to share family 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.750
 so first of all that the potatoes are going to cut him off course and on 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.420
 the cliché 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.970
 and to go slice and take him about 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.300
 2 to 3000 meters thick for that with knives 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.810
 pretty good 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.970
 to complete this effort 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.970
 the asm would have used a mandolin it will be much simpler 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.700
 since we will adjust from the beginning the right size 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.700
 and we will have perfect regularity on all potatoes 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.490
 so the skipped potatoes massaged and now 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.050
 we will put the milk 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.759
 a year and a half skim 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.009
 up to about the dead potatoes in 2008 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 slightly above the height of the potatoes 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.430
 so you go this man down we did not wash why because the 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.450
 fed that just the potato powerful vallier the milk he will give 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.830
 of creaminess another powerful so it's important not to wash the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.010
 potatoes before the curlers opengl es 2 cloves of garlic 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.980
 and we're going to take away one because in the other the germ there is still 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.050
 the bitterness 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.680
 from there to say so we dream 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.170
 but German 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.020
 and we will 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.090
 with the flat of the knife we ​​will just lean gold 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.240
 and who was crushing 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.210
 let's get to extract a little bit 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.890
 the juice from there it can be equally bitter in the same way 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.839
 and so here it is crushed we will put it in the cooking 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.439
 with potatoes 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.080
 now here is the first step 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.009
 it's over and we will not go to the thigh 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.719
 then of course you have to arm yourself with a statue 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:26.999
 because 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:31.459
 its tendency to stop approaching easily so always to stir for 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.470
 about ten minutes of cooking 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.599
 it will take by promising potatoes quite frequently 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.849
 they continued to his lovers with him 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.059
 salt 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.969
 two pinches of salt 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.209
 a poor man from the Arab world 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.159
 three four rounds 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.569
 and nutmeg 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.569
 the little report that will allow us 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:59.589
 to remember this - of scad so here's the ten minutes are past the 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.589
 potatoes we will reserve them in a salad bowl 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.109
 and we will continue cooking the milk we are still can now 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.979
 cream 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:12.540
 now we will let reduce this mixture 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.479
 to remember 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.340
 a mixture home you still do not want stirring the best moments 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.110
 for our part 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.359
 attached to the pan 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.119
 during this time we will be able to start 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.009
 to arrange the potatoes 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.419
 in the dish gratin dish for slightly buttered aura before 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.140
 so that the potatoes do not attach me 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.069
 in the case of all 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.029
 a first layer of potatoes will be avoided 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.549
 of master 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.079
 the whole ear manceaux 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.059
 all the same 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:45.619
 we spread the potato on a first layer that we drag fast 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:47.120
 when we know it will be ready 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.849
 think the cream now 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.119
 and sufficiently reduced 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:54.459
 she is in a slayer 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.459
 we will now be able to put on the potato 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:59.289
 barroso 

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:01.209
 copiously this first layer 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.749
 we are now going to master a second 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:06.579
 thickness of potatoes that are spread 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.429
 on the first always paying attention 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:10.519
 not to put 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.519
 the greedy underwater 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.349
 we also learned that this second layer of potatoes 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.219
 with the cream 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:22.319
 and so you go I'm going to do it twice 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.580
 so that these two excessive bush feed the apple well 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.449
 earth of our niche device 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.180
 if we only do it on top the cream to go down to maybe not 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.770
 to feed all the potatoes whose components of times 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:35.650
 we are sure 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.880
 that all to the fin potatoes dances 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.250
 sometimes cream 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.020
 of course 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.969
 last step 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:43.469
 grated cheese 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:45.210
 toulon will dispose 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.279
 on top 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:47.569
 now 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.569
 we have to put in the oven 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.719
 socrates postponed about 15 to 20 minutes 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.919
 180 degrees 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.979
 beautiful colored layer on well caramelized and cheese 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.360
 crisp 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.740
 here are our skates 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.309
 they are ready 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:07.309
 she is 7 hours nice golden color 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.759
 slightly arched 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.020
 and that's not pie 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.470
 it can be enjoyed with roast meats or in a very small meal 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.180
 simple and fast with a salad 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.229
 I wish to badagry times
