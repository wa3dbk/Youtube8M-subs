00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
lettuces I grew them inside in Maggio's

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.909 
lettuces I grew them inside in Maggio's
because<00:00:06.990> I'm<00:00:07.080> just<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.410> cold<00:00:07.680> they<00:00:07.830> usually

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
because I'm just so cold they usually

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.250 
because I'm just so cold they usually
saw<00:00:08.550> them<00:00:08.760> directly<00:00:09.090> outside<00:00:09.240> but<00:00:09.750> like<00:00:10.200> I

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
saw them directly outside but like I

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.360 
saw them directly outside but like I
said<00:00:10.410> with<00:00:10.530> everything<00:00:10.800> else<00:00:10.920> this<00:00:11.040> year<00:00:11.250> it

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
I better get a bit of a head start and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.640 
I better get a bit of a head start and
grow<00:00:16.890> them<00:00:17.070> inside<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.550> some<00:00:17.699> modules<00:00:18.470> I'm<00:00:19.470> not

icebergs first so these are about a foot

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.590

apart like I said I'm only putting six
in<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.020> don't<00:00:52.680> worry<00:00:52.829> about<00:00:52.980> hearing<00:00:53.399> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
in I don't worry about hearing it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.130 
in I don't worry about hearing it
traffic's<00:00:54.000> terrible<00:00:54.090> tonight<00:00:54.719> cuz<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.079> been

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
traffic's terrible tonight cuz it's been

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.630 
traffic's terrible tonight cuz it's been
cold<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.710> Monday<00:00:55.949> night<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:56.370> everyone's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.850 

so<00:01:02.860> I<00:01:02.890> can<00:01:03.130> say<00:01:03.250> I'm<00:01:03.340> only<00:01:03.430> doing<00:01:03.730> 6<00:01:04.770> when<00:01:05.770> I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
so I can say I'm only doing 6 when I

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.190 
so I can say I'm only doing 6 when I
pluck<00:01:06.130> some<00:01:06.340> more<00:01:06.550> in<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.330> walk<00:01:07.479> the<00:01:07.600> saw

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
pluck some more in the walk the saw

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.910 
pluck some more in the walk the saw
so<00:01:08.620> I<00:01:08.650> forget<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.040> obsessional<00:01:09.670> crop<00:01:10.030> I<00:01:13.920> mean

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
so I forget this obsessional crop I mean

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.300 
so I forget this obsessional crop I mean
some<00:01:15.100> people<00:01:15.130> leave<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:16.770> leave<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.890> plants

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
some people leave that leave the plants

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.930 
some people leave that leave the plants
in<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.550> modules<00:01:19.650> longer<00:01:20.650> than<00:01:20.800> I<00:01:20.860> do<00:01:21.040> but<00:01:21.460> as

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
in the modules longer than I do but as

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.359 
in the modules longer than I do but as
far<00:01:22.150> as<00:01:22.240> I'm<00:01:22.390> concerned<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.890> can<00:01:24.040> lift<00:01:24.220> them

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
far as I'm concerned you can lift them

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
far as I'm concerned you can lift them
out<00:01:24.460> like<00:01:24.670> that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.440 

and<00:01:29.190> they've<00:01:29.310> got<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> decent<00:01:29.670> set<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.090> roots<00:01:30.300> I

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
and they've got a decent set of roots I

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.240 
and they've got a decent set of roots I
like<00:01:30.660> that<00:01:30.870> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.110> see<00:01:31.320> they're<00:01:31.620> coming<00:01:32.040> out

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
like that you can see they're coming out

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.220 
like that you can see they're coming out
the<00:01:32.340> bottom<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.090> better<00:01:33.900> off<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
the bottom then the better off in the

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.290 
the bottom then the better off in the
ground<00:01:34.500> real<00:01:34.830> it<00:01:35.010> if<00:01:35.760> you<00:01:35.850> leave<00:01:35.970> them<00:01:36.120> in<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
ground real it if you leave them in the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.780 
ground real it if you leave them in the
Politan<00:01:36.780> layer<00:01:36.990> somewhere<00:01:37.350> warm<00:01:37.670> they've<00:01:38.670> got

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
Politan layer somewhere warm they've got

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.320 
Politan layer somewhere warm they've got
a<00:01:38.820> tendency<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.600> become<00:01:39.960> pop<00:01:40.320> bound<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.330> that

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
a tendency to become pop bound and that

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.270 
a tendency to become pop bound and that
can<00:01:42.510> make<00:01:42.630> an<00:01:42.810> bolt<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.440> to<00:01:43.500> seed<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.860> bit<00:01:44.070> later

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
can make an bolt go to seed a bit later

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.130 
can make an bolt go to seed a bit later
on<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.910> it's<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.240> easy<00:01:45.480> we're<00:01:45.900> just<00:01:46.050> gonna

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
on so it's just easy we're just gonna

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.740 
on so it's just easy we're just gonna
shove<00:01:46.410> them<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:47.240> interview<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.540> holes

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
shove them in interview little holes

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.070 
shove them in interview little holes
that<00:01:48.960> are<00:01:49.140> dipped<00:01:52.340> like<00:01:53.340> so

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.730 

Filomena<00:01:57.040> touch<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.930> I<00:02:01.960> say<00:02:02.530> it's<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.680> first

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
Filomena touch so I say it's the first

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.720 
Filomena touch so I say it's the first
time<00:02:03.100> I've<00:02:03.220> ever<00:02:03.310> done<00:02:03.460> it

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
time I've ever done it

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.600 
time I've ever done it

sixty lettuces to eat in a week and it's

sixty lettuces to eat in a week and it's
a<00:02:43.680> bit<00:02:44.680> pointless<00:02:45.010> really<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:45.670> that's<00:02:45.820> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
a bit pointless really so that's the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.050 
a bit pointless really so that's the
icebergs<00:02:46.360> don't<00:02:47.430> just<00:02:48.430> get<00:02:48.550> on<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.760> do<00:02:48.880> the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
others but basically that's about it

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.340 
others but basically that's about it
just<00:02:51.100> give<00:02:51.370> them<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.490> quick<00:02:51.670> watering<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.350> and

so that safety was a plus one there must
