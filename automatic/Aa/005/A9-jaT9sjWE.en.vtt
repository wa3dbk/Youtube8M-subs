00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.590
 healer and a little bit of art a little bit 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.650

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.560
 a little bit 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.220
 let him suffer a little and 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.090
 after only one end per 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.530
 songs 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.600
 let's do the same 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.459
 Now that he's a little bit in the cry , 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.080
 let's add not all of this but one 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.630
 teaspoon of carlos so that either 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.080
 I know it does not dry out old clothes 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.180
 nothing dries like me 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.049
 and we go to the mess with soup spoon or 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:24.940
 pre in order depending on the three 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.430
 for that step 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.180
 but you can take warm that was in a 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.820
 caldito glass ready

 giving the arreid comma as is in that 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.729
 the cook always has to nibble on 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.729
 Contact 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.789
 of the biggest and biggest this is also 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.550

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.240
 we continue to bingo take old clothes 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.919
 and here we are already throwing the chips 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.439
 that are going to accompany the clothes well to 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.169
 french fries to this as well 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:04.719
 those mothers remembered many times 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.219
 they add tomato that remains of vice 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:08.790
 the tomato looks great on a 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.680
 little bit of your measure because you're there 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.360
 you have left of vision tomato and children 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.970
 they eat a loaf of bread flying 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.350
 opposes but I personally like it 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.150
 more the taste of the meat with the 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.070
 pucherito and not lose the substance of 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.240
 They refilled but if you want a dish something 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.440
 more different tomato and here we are already 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.390
 adding the potatoes that are going to 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.520
 accompany this I think that already what 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.650
 it remains to teach the finished dish ok 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.710
 let's go to the mess let's recommend it what 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.050
 I teach when I'm loading more for 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.610

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.950
 You can only ride like you

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.360
 as 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.669
 and this you can remove the old clothes 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.169
 what mixed and what does I like 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.819
 pose it to me so this can not be done 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.009
 because usually people who mix it 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.779
 everything and then fry it again 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.520
 lucky in but I do not like it and I 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.169
 like to fry the potatoes apart and throw it 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.699
 apart and do not mix melanie itching 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:04.129
 that's why to sharpen knives not 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.599
 they just have to eat and this is the 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.069
 little dish of old clothes after which 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:09.740
 about the meat as you saw and the 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.479
 principle be center that tita 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.910
