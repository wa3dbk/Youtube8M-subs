a reason we invented pasteurization and
the<00:02:22.939> ironic<00:02:23.569> part<00:02:23.599> of<00:02:23.989> all<00:02:24.110> of<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.769> the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
the ironic part of all of this is is the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.059 
the ironic part of all of this is is the
perceived<00:02:25.220> health<00:02:25.459> benefits<00:02:26.030> there's<00:02:26.299> no

reason there's no science to back this

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.190 
reason there's no science to back this
idea<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:29.989> pasteurized<00:02:30.799> milk<00:02:30.950> has<00:02:31.489> anything

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
visit is it's doing something different

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.330 
visit is it's doing something different
to<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:35.989> milk<00:02:36.260> that's<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.769> to<00:02:36.860> harm<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.220> in

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
any way the raw milk isn't any more

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.490 
any way the raw milk isn't any more
nutritious<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.700> seems<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.659> have<00:02:41.810> no<00:02:41.959> benefits

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
nutritious it seems to have no benefits

nutritious it seems to have no benefits
that<00:02:42.769> any<00:02:42.980> real<00:02:43.340> science<00:02:43.730> can<00:02:43.909> detect<00:02:44.269> it's

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
that any real science can detect it's

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.210 
that any real science can detect it's
just<00:02:44.840> hippie<00:02:45.170> science<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.890> must<00:02:46.099> be

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
just hippie science that it must be

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.619 
just hippie science that it must be
better<00:02:46.400> for<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:46.730> because<00:02:46.849> it's<00:02:47.180> less

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
better for you because it's less

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.740 
better for you because it's less
processed<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.379> I<00:02:49.010> just<00:02:49.190> simply<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:50.120> true

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
processed and I just simply is it true

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.460 
processed and I just simply is it true
it<00:02:51.260> carries<00:02:51.709> extra<00:02:52.310> risk<00:02:52.940> with<00:02:53.780> no<00:02:54.049> reward

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
it carries extra risk with no reward

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.110 
it carries extra risk with no reward
whatsoever<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.159> it's<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:55.519> silly<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.090> I

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
whatsoever and it's just silly so I

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.240 
whatsoever and it's just silly so I
think<00:02:56.299> we<00:02:56.540> can<00:02:56.720> safely<00:02:56.959> brand<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.799> whole<00:02:57.950> raw

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
think we can safely brand the whole raw

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.809 
think we can safely brand the whole raw
milk<00:02:58.579> movement<00:02:59.030> as<00:02:59.260> hippie<00:03:00.260> science<00:03:00.819> alright

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
milk movement as hippie science alright
