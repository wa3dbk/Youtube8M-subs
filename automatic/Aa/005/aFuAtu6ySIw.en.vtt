00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.360
 Welcome side to the picture today, let's go. 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.879
 start talking about the excretory system 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.660
 that this very important system for 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.850
 eliminate excreta which are products of 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.179
 cell metabolism that should be 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:26.829
 released from the body of a 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:29.489
 animal and the first cutting edge to be 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:34.060
 The excretory system is the 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:37.629
 plants and the excretory system of these 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:42.039
 animals is composed of ready or 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:45.550
 cold and I'll explain what it is 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:49.269
 Even cold itself is actually a 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.000
 system that runs through the whole 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.840
 the planar body this system of 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.160
 tubes 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:01.120
 branching out and it has a 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:07.390
 communication with the outside through a 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.329
 little that pole is the writer pole too 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:14.500
 called nephritis the pure and that is where 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:17.860
 the discrete ones will be eliminated in the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:22.180
 the innermost end of the proton here 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.090
 and noodle there is a specialized cell 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.450
 this cell a cold cell that 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.200
 varies according to species if it 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.130
 has a flagellum is called solemar 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.950
 oscip 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.899
 in this case as we are talking about 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:44.590
 I'm going to represent a cell 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:48.070
 mud that is found in these animals 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.039
 the flame cell has a set of 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.770
 flagellates and when these flagellates become 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.159
 move creates an aspect that calls 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.329
 like a flame of fire out why 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.299
 this cell is called the mud cell and the 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.509
 these scourges be very 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.260
 important because from this 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:14.069
 beat the liquid that has been absorbed 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.730
 by the writing cells will be 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.790
 led to the writer channel 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.220
 of the proton is phrygian and because of 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.250
 beat these scourge 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.560
 the liquid can be transported here 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:36.090
 to be deleted in nephritis in pure O 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:41.819
 pole and good writer continuing the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.709
 annelids and mollusks already have net 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.410
 neither cold 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.040
 here the organization is a little bit 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.940
 different in annelids such as 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.569
 In this earthworm, the goal is neither Phrygian nor anything 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.010
 more is that a whole tube is novella duet 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.470
 education 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.799
 at one end of the method and 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.390
 there is a structure in the form of 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.329
 funnel and this structure is if nothing and 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.390
 other end there is a pole that is 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:19.140
 called nephritis the pure and the where 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.910
 will be eliminated the discrete ones and with the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.700
 what happens is this process 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.220
 good this is frost tuma that this 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.660
 end of which it is connected 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.900
 directly to elomar we already saw that 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.750
 the annelids are selado madoz animals and 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.380
 in the sealed one there is some liquid 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.099
 discreet pass here the fluid your name 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.329
 and they will be absorbed by the nephrons 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.700
 take these discrete will be then 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:55.620
 conducted by the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:59.010
 until they are eliminated and in addition 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.579
 the grave itself is not cold either 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.430
 also to directly absorb 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.829
 discrete nitrogen compounds that pass here 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.639
 in the bloodstream 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:14.549
 many capillaries pass close to the goal 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:18.049
 neither Phrygian nor the discrete ones that are here 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.090
 in the blood can also be removed and 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.889
 transported directly to this 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.800
 pipe system 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.940
 when these discrete people fall here in the 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.200
 will be eliminated and here 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.780
 personal is a long time 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.990
 remember that the annelids are 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.320
 segmented animals as we have already seen 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.680
 in the last classes and this structure of the 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.910
 metaphor nor phrygian is repeated in each 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.300
 segment 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:52.560
 and to close this class I want to talk about 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:56.930
 the glands vents or glands antenna 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.840
 more that are found in arthropods 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.150
 especially in these crustaceans 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.740
 bands are also considered to be 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.810
 structures writer if the two wendes 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.140
 are located 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.110
 Here at the base of antennas why 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.760
 they are called antenna glands 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:24.210
 more these glands absolve products 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:27.060
 that circulates here on the clean heli 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.290
 if the product is useful for the animal for 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.510
 an important substance that gland 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:37.590
 should listen to that substance that has 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:41.640
 absorbed to the hemolymph and what should 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.660
 be eliminated is accumulated in the 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.000
 glands 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.450
 at a certain moment this gland 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.430
 opens and this product will be excreted 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.530
 for the environment 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.220
 an example here of product that is 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:59.190
 excreted is the good ammonia we 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.830
 here with these three structures the very 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.680
 or Phrygian granddaughter in this video and 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.050
 glands antennas and next class 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.510
 Let's keep talking about other 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.510
 two do not miss until then
