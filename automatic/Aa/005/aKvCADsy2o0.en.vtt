problem<00:04:38.740> with<00:04:38.979> a<00:04:39.010> couple<00:04:39.280> different<00:04:39.820> brush

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060

brands<00:04:40.360> like<00:04:40.630> Dell<00:04:41.200> iam<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.710> love<00:04:41.950> deleon

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
brands like Dell iam and love deleon

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.580 
brands like Dell iam and love deleon
brushes<00:04:42.790> but<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:43.660> tends<00:04:43.960> to<00:04:44.169> pick<00:04:44.320> up<00:04:44.470> a

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
brushes but that it tends to pick up a

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.200 
brushes but that it tends to pick up a
little<00:04:44.800> bit<00:04:44.889> too<00:04:45.040> much<00:04:45.250> of<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.639> finer<00:04:45.880> melt

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
little bit too much of the finer melt

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.230 
little bit too much of the finer melt
things<00:04:46.600> so<00:04:47.229> it<00:04:47.590> picks<00:04:48.280> up<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.550> perfect<00:04:48.820> amount

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
things so it picks up the perfect amount

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.629 
things so it picks up the perfect amount
and<00:04:49.510> applies<00:04:50.020> it<00:04:50.050> very<00:04:50.470> evenly<00:04:51.070> with<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.400> dome

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
and applies it very evenly with the dome

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.120 
and applies it very evenly with the dome
so<00:04:52.240> you're<00:04:52.419> not<00:04:52.690> applying<00:04:53.050> like<00:04:53.470> a<00:04:53.500> whole<00:04:53.860> flat

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
so you're not applying like a whole flat

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.950 
so you're not applying like a whole flat
surface<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.610> one<00:04:54.940> particular<00:04:55.479> spot<00:04:55.750> you're

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
surface to one particular spot you're

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.780 
surface to one particular spot you're
slowly<00:04:56.380> spreading<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.160> around<00:04:57.250> which<00:04:57.639> is

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
slowly spreading it around which is

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.090 
slowly spreading it around which is
absolutely<00:04:58.419> great<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:59.229> this<00:04:59.440> one<00:04:59.620> is<00:04:59.830> great

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100
