different from what creative has been
using<00:00:55.679> on<00:00:56.219> their<00:00:56.760> Zen<00:00:57.359> players<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:58.109> this

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
using on their Zen players like this

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.750 
using on their Zen players like this
envision<00:00:58.710> em<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.420> Zen<00:01:00.420> vision<00:01:00.750> W<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.550> a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
completely different cable and this will

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.030 
completely different cable and this will
eventually<00:01:07.860> support<00:01:08.520> 1080p<00:01:09.200> alt<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.620> all

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
eventually support 1080p alt and all

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.210

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
still very very rugged now the thing I

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.800 
still very very rugged now the thing I
do<00:02:09.979> notice<00:02:10.459> about<00:02:10.819> this<00:02:11.030> screen<00:02:11.390> which<00:02:11.690> I

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
do notice about this screen which I

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.610 
do notice about this screen which I
don't<00:02:11.870> like

and<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.280> hope<00:02:13.550> this<00:02:13.730> changes<00:02:14.000> for<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.540> final

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
and I hope this changes for the final

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.050 
and I hope this changes for the final
consumer<00:02:15.290> edition<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:19.670> know<00:02:19.790> I<00:02:19.819> haven't

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
consumer edition is you know I haven't

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.000 
consumer edition is you know I haven't
figured<00:02:20.390> out<00:02:20.540> if<00:02:20.660> this<00:02:20.810> screen<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.500> glass<00:02:21.799> or

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
figured out if this screen is glass or

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.449 
figured out if this screen is glass or
not<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:23.120> almost<00:02:23.420> feels<00:02:23.690> plastic<00:02:23.989> but<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
not it almost feels plastic but the

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:33.370 
not it almost feels plastic but the
issue<00:02:25.700> here<00:02:26.209> is<00:02:28.150> there<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:30.459> thin<00:02:31.459> film<00:02:32.380> know

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
issue here is there is a thin film know

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.820 
issue here is there is a thin film know
if<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.530> can<00:02:33.680> see<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.040> thin<00:02:34.910> film<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.830> plastic

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
if you can see this thin film of plastic

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.460 
if you can see this thin film of plastic
I<00:02:37.130> guess<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.580> keep<00:02:37.730> scratches<00:02:38.330> away<00:02:38.600> this<00:02:39.260> is

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
I guess to keep scratches away this is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.750 
I guess to keep scratches away this is
the<00:02:39.769> same<00:02:40.069> thing<00:02:40.370> they<00:02:40.549> did<00:02:40.850> with<00:02:41.090> their<00:02:42.340> Zen<00:02:43.340> X

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
the same thing they did with their Zen X

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.750 
the same thing they did with their Zen X
Phi<00:02:44.090> was<00:02:44.870> they<00:02:45.079> they<00:02:45.440> put<00:02:45.829> a<00:02:45.890> plastic<00:02:46.459> screen

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
Phi was they they put a plastic screen

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.759 
Phi was they they put a plastic screen
on<00:02:47.000> it<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.390> then<00:02:47.570> put<00:02:47.900> this<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:49.340> thin<00:02:50.000> film

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
on it and then put this this thin film

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.970 
on it and then put this this thin film
over<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.920> top<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.989> hope<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:54.950> changes

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
over the top of it I hope that changes

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.289 
over the top of it I hope that changes
or<00:02:55.750> they<00:02:56.750> continue<00:02:57.260> with<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.590> any<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.120> is

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
or they continue with that any and it is

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.199 
or they continue with that any and it is
a<00:02:59.329> very<00:03:00.200> price<00:03:00.650> competitive<00:03:00.890> product<00:03:01.820> meaning

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
a very price competitive product meaning

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.830 
a very price competitive product meaning
it<00:03:02.420> is<00:03:02.600> a<00:03:02.630> cheaper<00:03:04.150> alternative<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.180> more<00:03:05.570> the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
it is a cheaper alternative to more the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.020 
it is a cheaper alternative to more the
robust<00:03:06.829> devices<00:03:08.709> now<00:03:09.709> when<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.070> came<00:03:10.549> this

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
robust devices now when this came this

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.620 
robust devices now when this came this
came<00:03:11.299> with<00:03:12.760> plasma<00:03:13.959> OS<00:03:14.959> on<00:03:15.260> it

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
came with plasma OS on it

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.699 
came with plasma OS on it
the<00:03:17.630> typical<00:03:18.079> slide<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.560> lock<00:03:19.600> now<00:03:20.680> again<00:03:21.680> I

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
the typical slide to lock now again I

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.039 
the typical slide to lock now again I
keep<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.430> want<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.819> stress<00:03:23.090> this<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.600> this<00:03:23.750> is

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
keep I want to stress this that this is

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.400 
keep I want to stress this that this is
a<00:03:24.079> developer<00:03:24.769> edition<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:26.299> is<00:03:26.480> still<00:03:27.230> very

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
a developer edition and it is still very

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.819 
a developer edition and it is still very
developer<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.489> speak<00:03:28.810> meaning<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.590> is

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
developer so to speak meaning that it is

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.509 
developer so to speak meaning that it is
just<00:03:31.280> kind<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.209> sketchy<00:03:32.510> slow<00:03:33.069> it's<00:03:34.069> just<00:03:34.220> not

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
just kind of sketchy slow it's just not

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.840 
just kind of sketchy slow it's just not
put<00:03:35.030> together<00:03:35.239> yet<00:03:35.510> so<00:03:36.019> don't<00:03:36.950> don't<00:03:37.370> judge

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
put together yet so don't don't judge

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.680 
put together yet so don't don't judge
the<00:03:38.239> OS<00:03:38.989> quite<00:03:39.319> yet<00:03:39.650> on<00:03:40.459> this<00:03:40.760> because<00:03:41.540> I've

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
the OS quite yet on this because I've

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.369 
the OS quite yet on this because I've
seen<00:03:41.720> how<00:03:42.139> the<00:03:42.560> creative<00:03:42.889> the<00:03:43.639> Z<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
seen how the creative the Z the the

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.039 
seen how the creative the Z the the
processor<00:03:45.920> chip<00:03:46.129> performs<00:03:46.670> at<00:03:47.239> CES<00:03:47.599> and<00:03:47.989> it

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
processor chip performs at CES and it

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.010 
processor chip performs at CES and it
does<00:03:48.200> perform<00:03:48.409> quite<00:03:48.830> nicely

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
does perform quite nicely

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.730 
does perform quite nicely
so<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.440> code<00:03:50.650> just<00:03:50.860> has<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.310> be<00:03:52.500> optimized<00:03:53.500> on

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:53.740 
so the code just has to be optimized on

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.890 
so the code just has to be optimized on
this<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.640> worked<00:03:55.150> on<00:03:55.390> they're<00:03:55.690> really

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
this and and worked on they're really

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.570 
this and and worked on they're really
gonna<00:03:55.990> have<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.200> depend<00:03:56.530> on<00:03:56.740> developers<00:03:57.400> for

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
gonna have to depend on developers for

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
gonna have to depend on developers for
this<00:03:59.220> but<00:04:00.220> just<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.550> jump<00:04:00.760> into<00:04:00.970> some<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.540> these

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
this but just to jump into some of these

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:12.180 
this but just to jump into some of these
pretty<00:04:01.870> quick<00:04:02.170> here<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:08.820> UI<00:04:09.820> is<00:04:11.190> pretty

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
pretty quick here the UI is pretty

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.680 
pretty quick here the UI is pretty
straightforward<00:04:12.520> easy<00:04:13.120> to<00:04:13.360> use<00:04:18.480> about<00:04:19.480> what

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
straightforward easy to use about what

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.780 
straightforward easy to use about what
you<00:04:19.840> would<00:04:19.989> expect<00:04:20.470> this<00:04:21.220> is<00:04:21.430> something

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
you would expect this is something

want to get into the other stuff but I'm

want to get into the other stuff but I'm
just<00:04:47.980> quick<00:04:48.310> I'll<00:04:48.520> show<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.910> web<00:04:49.060> browser

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.360 

now<00:05:08.080> this<00:05:08.260> is<00:05:08.440> opera<00:05:09.010> ten<00:05:09.520> mini<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.180> believe

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
now this is opera ten mini I believe

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.700 
now this is opera ten mini I believe
this<00:05:12.370> opera<00:05:13.000> is<00:05:13.090> going<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.510> be<00:05:13.720> there<00:05:14.410> browser

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
this opera is going to be there browser

this opera is going to be there browser

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.510 
of choice pre-loaded on the plasma OS
does<00:05:20.830> have<00:05:22.710> accelerometer<00:05:23.710> in<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:24.010> switch

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
does have accelerometer in it switch

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:37.800 
does have accelerometer in it switch
will

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.610 

and<00:05:38.810> like<00:05:39.200> for<00:05:39.530> instance<00:05:41.290> is<00:05:43.240> just<00:05:44.240> a<00:05:44.360> keyboard

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
and like for instance is just a keyboard

00:05:44.620 --> 00:06:09.540 
and like for instance is just a keyboard
so<00:05:45.620> you<00:05:46.160> can<00:05:46.310> do

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.640 

it's<00:06:10.550> just<00:06:10.999> a<00:06:11.180> basic<00:06:13.749> again<00:06:14.749> that's<00:06:15.020> just<00:06:15.379> it's

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
it's just a basic again that's just it's

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.619 
it's just a basic again that's just it's
really<00:06:16.009> slow<00:06:16.280> on<00:06:16.310> the<00:06:16.580> accelerometer<00:06:17.389> but<00:06:17.419> I

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:17.629 
really slow on the accelerometer but I

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.649 
really slow on the accelerometer but I
would<00:06:18.050> expect<00:06:18.529> that<00:06:18.620> to<00:06:18.860> improve<00:06:19.479> once<00:06:20.479> they

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:20.659 
would expect that to improve once they

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:25.149 
would expect that to improve once they
