hi it's John Costa Mesa R&amp;D today we
have<00:00:48.980> a<00:00:49.010> cam<00:00:49.550> bridge<00:00:49.820> off<00:00:50.090> of<00:00:50.270> a<00:00:50.390> Porsche<00:00:50.750> 911

on<00:00:52.130> the<00:00:52.160> research<00:00:52.580> side<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.770> we've

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
on the research side and we've

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.790 
on the research side and we've
resurfaces<00:00:55.610> because<00:00:56.170> whoever<00:00:57.170> took<00:00:57.350> this<00:00:57.530> off

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
resurfaces because whoever took this off

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.530 
resurfaces because whoever took this off
took<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.220> scotch-brite<00:00:58.610> pad<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:59.240> it<00:00:59.330> and

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
took a scotch-brite pad to it and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
took a scotch-brite pad to it and
screwed<00:00:59.810> it<00:00:59.930> all<00:01:00.050> up

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
screwed it all up

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.370 
screwed it all up
but<00:01:01.460> we've<00:01:01.640> also<00:01:01.910> taken<00:01:02.420> out<00:01:02.750> these<00:01:03.020> little

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
but we've also taken out these little

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.750 
but we've also taken out these little
balls<00:01:03.650> in<00:01:04.160> here<00:01:06.040> these<00:01:07.040> are<00:01:07.220> going<00:01:07.370> to<00:01:07.460> be<00:01:07.580> the

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
balls in here these are going to be the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.510 
balls in here these are going to be the
next<00:01:08.000> big<00:01:08.240> thing<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:08.600> these<00:01:08.780> motors<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:10.280> have

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
next big thing on these motors to have

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.270 
next big thing on these motors to have
to<00:01:10.760> require<00:01:11.180> some<00:01:11.510> repair<00:01:11.870> because<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:13.010> balls

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
to require some repair because the balls

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.760 
to require some repair because the balls
are<00:01:13.550> just<00:01:13.870> pushed<00:01:14.870> into<00:01:15.110> place<00:01:15.230> and

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
are just pushed into place and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.590 
are just pushed into place and
eventually<00:01:16.220> they're<00:01:16.340> gonna<00:01:16.430> vibrate<00:01:16.850> out<00:01:17.090> and

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
eventually they're gonna vibrate out and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.040 
eventually they're gonna vibrate out and
cause<00:01:18.320> an<00:01:18.560> oily<00:01:19.119> what<00:01:20.119> we've<00:01:20.300> done<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:20.840> take

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
cause an oily what we've done is to take

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.120 
cause an oily what we've done is to take
an<00:01:21.610> EDM<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.790> balls<00:01:23.030> out<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.660> then<00:01:24.650> we<00:01:24.770> take<00:01:24.950> it

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
an EDM the balls out and then we take it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.840 
an EDM the balls out and then we take it
and<00:01:25.280> cut<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.640> thing<00:01:25.820> with<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.030> cap<00:01:26.770> for<00:01:27.770> a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
and cut the thing with a cap for a

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.760 
and cut the thing with a cap for a
standard<00:01:28.850> size<00:01:29.090> set<00:01:29.420> screw<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:30.500> we're<00:01:30.619> gonna

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
standard size set screw and we're gonna

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.010 
standard size set screw and we're gonna
lock<00:01:30.890> tight<00:01:31.190> Pat<00:01:31.400> it<00:01:31.520> into<00:01:31.700> place<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.270> just

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020
