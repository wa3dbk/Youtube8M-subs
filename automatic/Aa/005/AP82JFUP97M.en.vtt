something like that and you're used to a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.050 
something like that and you're used to a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
a medium fire rate auto rifle this is a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.209 
a medium fire rate auto rifle this is a
good<00:01:57.420> choice<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.719> you<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:01.619> one<00:02:01.860> improvement

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
good choice for you the one improvement

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.130 
good choice for you the one improvement
I<00:02:02.520> feel<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.969> has<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:03.750> tagged

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
I feel like it has is that it's tagged

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.429 
I feel like it has is that it's tagged
it<00:02:04.350> seems<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.740> stagger<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.520> mother<00:02:06.439> you're

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
it seems to stagger like a mother you're

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.540 
it seems to stagger like a mother you're
shooting<00:02:07.740> guys<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.099> body<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.429> they're

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
shooting guys in the body and they're

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.100 
shooting guys in the body and they're
dragging<00:02:09.179> their<00:02:09.209> sold<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:09.660> over<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> place

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
dragging their sold all over the place

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.199 
dragging their sold all over the place
it's<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:10.890> satisfying<00:02:11.250> weapon<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
it's just a really satisfying weapon to

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.270 
it's just a really satisfying weapon to
you

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.119 
you
so<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> highly<00:02:14.760> recommend<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.680> as<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.739> good

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
so I highly recommend it as a good

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.009 
so I highly recommend it as a good
replacement<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.730> any<00:02:18.090> exotic<00:02:18.450> auto-rifle

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
something like that shadow price is a

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.270 
something like that shadow price is a
nice<00:02:30.840> replacement<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.650> also<00:02:31.799> argue<00:02:32.099> that

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
nice replacement you can also argue that

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.949 
nice replacement you can also argue that
a<00:02:32.489> Theon's<00:02:32.760> epilogue<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.420> nice<00:02:33.629> replacement

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
a Theon's epilogue is a nice replacement

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.289 
a Theon's epilogue is a nice replacement
but<00:02:34.709> if<00:02:34.860> you're<00:02:35.010> not<00:02:35.129> a<00:02:35.190> fan<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.519> super<00:02:36.090> high
