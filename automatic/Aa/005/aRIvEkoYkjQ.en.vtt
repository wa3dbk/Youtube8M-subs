to<00:02:03.990> get<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.229> certain<00:02:04.469> areas<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.939> is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
to get to certain areas but this is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.670 
to get to certain areas but this is
something<00:02:06.360> we've<00:02:06.509> had<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.810> Halo<00:02:07.049> before<00:02:07.409> so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
something we've had in Halo before so

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.859 
something we've had in Halo before so
it's<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:08.250> particularly<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.479> that

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
it's not particularly all that

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.290 
it's not particularly all that
interesting<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.610> guess<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:11.879> assume<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
interesting I guess we can assume that

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.640 
interesting I guess we can assume that
these<00:02:12.420> moments<00:02:12.690> will<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:12.959> more<00:02:13.230> freak

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
these moments will be more freak

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.839 
these moments will be more freak
than<00:02:13.799> they<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.040> previous<00:02:14.220> Halo<00:02:14.610> games

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
than they have in previous Halo games

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.339 
than they have in previous Halo games
but<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.269> all<00:02:15.450> speculation<00:02:15.689> at<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.200> point

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
but it's all speculation at this point

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.740 
but it's all speculation at this point
until<00:02:16.680> we<00:02:16.799> see<00:02:16.980> something<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.489> the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
until we see something on the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.089 
until we see something on the
multiplayer<00:02:18.750> side<00:02:19.019> not<00:02:19.319> much<00:02:19.530> has<00:02:19.680> really

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
multiplayer side not much has really

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.339 
multiplayer side not much has really
changed<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.640> map<00:02:21.090> Empire<00:02:21.599> from<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.959> beta<00:02:22.140> has

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
changed the map Empire from the beta has

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.929 
changed the map Empire from the beta has
been<00:02:22.500> altered<00:02:22.860> slightly<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.430> some<00:02:23.579> changes

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
been altered slightly and some changes

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.369

during e3 now this is the thing that I'm
actually<00:02:35.579> really<00:02:36.060> excited<00:02:36.239> about<00:02:36.780> we've

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
actually really excited about we've

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.809 
actually really excited about we've
already<00:02:37.560> had<00:02:37.859> hands-on<00:02:38.250> time<00:02:38.519> with<00:02:38.730> the

standard arena modes during the beta
earlier<00:02:40.859> this<00:02:41.010> year<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.700> can't<00:02:41.970> help<00:02:42.150> but

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
earlier this year so I can't help but

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.699 
earlier this year so I can't help but
wonder<00:02:42.359> if<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.720> big<00:02:43.019> new<00:02:43.260> multiplayer

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
wonder if this big new multiplayer

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.319 
wonder if this big new multiplayer
reveal<00:02:43.890> might<00:02:44.489> be<00:02:44.640> related<00:02:44.879> to<00:02:45.030> cut

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
reveal might be related to cut

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.059

past<00:02:47.280> Halo<00:02:47.609> games<00:02:47.819> we<00:02:48.540> know<00:02:48.659> space<00:02:48.900> battles

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
past Halo games we know space battles

past Halo games we know space battles
for<00:02:49.440> instance<00:02:49.739> were<00:02:49.859> cut<00:02:50.040> from<00:02:50.069> reach<00:02:50.430> as<00:02:50.609> well

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
it is so I'm pretty excited about it as

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.390 
it is so I'm pretty excited about it as

far as bad news goes and there really
isn't<00:02:59.579> all<00:02:59.879> that<00:02:59.939> much<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:01.019> found<00:03:01.200> out<00:03:01.379> that

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
isn't all that much we found out that

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.080 
isn't all that much we found out that
split<00:03:01.859> screen<00:03:02.069> co-op<00:03:02.280> will<00:03:02.609> not<00:03:02.819> be<00:03:02.970> included
