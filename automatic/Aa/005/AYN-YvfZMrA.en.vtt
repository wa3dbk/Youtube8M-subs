00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.490
 andrés portillo this great friend 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.060
 motivator talk about something very 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.820
 important 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.360
 André we did not have it exercising 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.980
 you know that the mls in the abdomen but the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.540
 most serene organ most important of the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.090
 body that is the brain that is the one that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:24.029
 allows us to live and coexist cerebral is 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.769
 very important as you said what happens 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.779
 if you stop exercising the body it 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.970
 weakens the muscle and suddenly it 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.980
 atrophy and you do not know how all mengual 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.050
 we will find that we lose our memory or 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 we lose capacities but always the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.879
 brain is generating new 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.590
 new connections possibilities for 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.050
 be restoring its functions 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.570
 then you have to learn to exercise it 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.300
 and mainly to know to help for 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.050
 example to your children how to do it 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.879
 so they can study much easier 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.370
 learn the information that they are 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.039
 receiving and we also believe that we are going 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.360
 losing for example memory and the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.840
 reality is that we can always 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.510
 and today I'm going to put several exercises 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.840
 to start practicing them, act 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.520
 I know that everything is acquired with practice 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.400
 If you can not do it the first time 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.260
 it's okay it's normal it starts to practice 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.570
 the central ones of putting three 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.009
 very simple exercises to start 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.009
 to do this exercise your brain of 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:32.070
 exercise the emotional sensory part 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.100
 creative that is a part of your brain 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.869
 but also the other one that is the rational 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.430
 structured the logic and at the time that 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.820
 you do these exercises what your 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.729
 brain is makes a connection a 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.789
 reconnection and then you're exercising 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.940
 and using the maximum potential of your 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.940
 brain 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.390
 exercises that helps have more 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.930
 memory capacity to think better to be 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.030
 smarter and more memory more 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.540
 creativity more flexibility when 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.290
 you are making decisions 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:09.850
 be much more suddenly considered 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:13.540
 we are scattered how many times are you

 they forget the keys of the car that also 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.960
 even to read there are days when 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.090
 really do not concentrate on reading 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.090
 and you are reading by habit 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.500
 the first with four in one hand in the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.600
