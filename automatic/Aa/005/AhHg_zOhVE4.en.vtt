00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
how to do the four actually three basic

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.360 
how to do the four actually three basic
I'm<00:00:06.089> stitches<00:00:06.870> for<00:00:07.109> sewing<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.529> how<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:07.980> sew

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
I'm stitches for sewing and how to sew

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.910 
I'm stitches for sewing and how to sew
on<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.550> button<00:00:08.990> first<00:00:09.990> we'll<00:00:10.320> start<00:00:10.469> with<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
on a button first we'll start with the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.249 
on a button first we'll start with the
running<00:00:11.130> stitch<00:00:11.630> the<00:00:12.630> running<00:00:12.900> stitch<00:00:13.110> is

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
running stitch the running stitch is

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.000 
running stitch the running stitch is
probably<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.799> simplest<00:00:14.190> stitch<00:00:14.849> there<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:16.010> so

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
probably the simplest stitch there is so

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.220 
probably the simplest stitch there is so
at<00:00:17.250> every<00:00:17.460> string<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.480> want<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.840> tie<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> knot

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
at every string you want to tie a knot

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.130 
at every string you want to tie a knot
at<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.439> end<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.630> when<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.810> thread<00:00:22.109> it

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
at the end and when you thread it

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.590 
at the end and when you thread it
through<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.500> needle<00:00:23.420> automatic<00:00:24.420> needle

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
through the needle automatic needle

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.019 
through the needle automatic needle
threaders<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.619> help<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.880> want

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
threaders really help with that you want

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.890 
threaders really help with that you want
to<00:00:27.090> leave<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> bit<00:00:27.480> at<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.320> end<00:00:29.000> alright<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.480> I'm

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
to leave a bit at the end alright so I'm

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.870 
to leave a bit at the end alright so I'm
going<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.349> start<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> top<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.820> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
going to start on the top just so you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.240 
going to start on the top just so you
guys<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.500> go<00:00:34.590> all<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.219> way

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
guys can see so you go all the way

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.700 
guys can see so you go all the way
through<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.410> until<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:38.160> hits<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.870> knot

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
through with it until it hits the knot

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.410 
through with it until it hits the knot
and<00:00:41.100> then<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.579> flip<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> other<00:00:42.210> side

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
and then you flip it to the other side

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.700 
and then you flip it to the other side
and<00:00:42.840> go<00:00:43.440> through<00:00:44.660> again<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.200> pull<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.410> all<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and go through again and pull it all the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.660 
and go through again and pull it all the
way<00:00:47.149> you<00:00:48.149> want<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.570> tight<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.489> like<00:00:50.489> this

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
way you want to be tight to like this

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.020 
way you want to be tight to like this
and<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.649> go<00:00:52.890> back<00:00:55.250> again<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.910> other

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and then you go back again on the other

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.619 
and then you go back again on the other
side<00:00:58.940> sometimes<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> string<00:01:00.300> will<00:01:00.449> get

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
side sometimes the string will get

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.899 
side sometimes the string will get
tangled<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.689> starts<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.049> look<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.200> that

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
tangled so it starts to look like that

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.890 
tangled so it starts to look like that
and<00:01:08.909> you'll<00:01:09.119> flip<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> other<00:01:09.750> side

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
and you'll flip it to the other side

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.789 
and you'll flip it to the other side
again<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.710> go<00:01:11.280> through<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.500> probably

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
again and go through so this is probably

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.460 
again and go through so this is probably
the<00:01:16.979> easiest<00:01:17.490> stitch<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.840> it's

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the easiest stitch there is and it's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.670 
the easiest stitch there is and it's
also<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> one<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.159> use<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.380> gene

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
also the one we use to do the gene

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.039 
also the one we use to do the gene
purses<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> there's<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:26.570> that's<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> basic

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
purses so there's that that's the basic

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.350 
purses so there's that that's the basic
running<00:01:28.320> stitch<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.579> simple<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
running stitch it's really simple and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.859 
running stitch it's really simple and
really<00:01:31.100> fast<00:01:32.100> today<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.270> will<00:01:33.600> sew<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
really fast today and now we will sew on

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.170 
really fast today and now we will sew on
the<00:01:33.900> button<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.770> we<00:01:34.799> will<00:01:35.009> fold<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.820> hold

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
the button so we will fold for hold

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.120 
the button so we will fold for hold
button<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:38.340> we'll<00:01:38.670> start<00:01:39.180> from<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
button and so we'll start from the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
button and so we'll start from the
bottom<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> we<00:01:44.970> want<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.240> place<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.450> button

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
bottom so we want to place the button

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.170 
bottom so we want to place the button
and<00:01:46.079> hold<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:47.430> go<00:01:47.579> through<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
and hold it on you go through one of the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.870 
and hold it on you go through one of the
holes<00:01:51.829> sometimes<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.040> string<00:01:53.280> will<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.759> get

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
holes sometimes a string will just get

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.950 
holes sometimes a string will just get
tangled<00:01:54.360> everywhere<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.780> then

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
tangled everywhere so like that and then

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.780 
tangled everywhere so like that and then
you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.290> diagonal<00:01:58.860> or<00:01:59.009> right<00:01:59.189> beside<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
you can go diagonal or right beside I

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.520 
you can go diagonal or right beside I
like<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> go<00:02:00.329> diagonal<00:02:03.079> then<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.140> go<00:02:04.259> through

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
like to go diagonal then you go through

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.340 
like to go diagonal then you go through
another<00:02:04.770> hole<00:02:05.570> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:06.689> you'll<00:02:06.930> go<00:02:07.110> up

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
another hole and then you'll go up

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.270 
another hole and then you'll go up
sometimes<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.220> hard<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.399> find<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.789> hole<00:02:10.280> so

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
sometimes it's hard to find the hole so

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.850 
sometimes it's hard to find the hole so
you'll<00:02:11.430> go<00:02:11.580> up<00:02:11.760> into<00:02:12.180> another<00:02:12.510> hole<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.830> you

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
you'll go up into another hole and you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.210 
you'll go up into another hole and you
want<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.190> totally<00:02:17.520> tight<00:02:18.860> then<00:02:19.860> you'll<00:02:20.010> go

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
want to totally tight then you'll go

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.970 
want to totally tight then you'll go
down<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.970> last<00:02:21.120> hole<00:02:24.319> so<00:02:25.319> that's<00:02:25.500> how<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.709> sew

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
down the last hole so that's how you sew

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.390 
down the last hole so that's how you sew
on<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> button<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.819> B<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.300> running<00:02:27.330> stitch<00:02:28.400> so

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
on a button and B the running stitch so

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.050 
on a button and B the running stitch so
we'll<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:29.700> cut<00:02:30.239> this<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.970> usually<00:02:32.970> your

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
we'll just cut this and usually your

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.509 
we'll just cut this and usually your
time<00:02:33.269> not<00:02:33.480> but<00:02:33.870> yeah<00:02:34.230> we'll<00:02:34.830> just<00:02:34.890> cut<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.340> for

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
the thinner thread we're using and you

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.649 
the thinner thread we're using and you
pull<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.739> through<00:02:59.010> until<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.580> knot<00:02:59.730> hits<00:02:59.970> and

pull it through until the knot hits and

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.259 
pull it through until the knot hits and
then<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.379> pull<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:01.860> back<00:03:02.010> over<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.819> go

then you just pull it back over and go

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.130 
then you just pull it back over and go
through<00:03:03.629> again<00:03:04.519> like<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.659> you<00:03:06.930> keep

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
through again like that and you keep

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.940 
through again like that and you keep
doing<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:09.989> it's<00:03:10.170> another<00:03:10.379> really<00:03:10.739> easy

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950

looks like candy cane stripes a little

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:33.160 
looks like candy cane stripes a little
bit<00:03:28.150> now<00:03:29.150> we<00:03:29.209> will<00:03:29.420> do<00:03:29.599> the<00:03:29.629> blanket<00:03:30.080> stitch<00:03:32.170> so

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
again you want to put together with the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.140 
again you want to put together with the
string<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:36.590> link<00:03:36.860> of<00:03:37.010> sun<00:03:37.250> starts<00:03:37.790> out<00:03:37.940> like<00:03:38.120> a

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
string the link of sun starts out like a

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.350 
string the link of sun starts out like a
overt<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.780> stitch<00:03:39.080> go<00:03:39.980> through<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.760> then<00:03:41.060> come

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
back and instead you go through the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:55.479 
back and instead you go through the
string<00:03:47.769> like<00:03:48.769> this<00:03:53.349> you<00:03:54.349> do<00:03:54.530> that<00:03:54.680> again<00:03:55.040> I'll

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
string like this you do that again I'll

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.910 
string like this you do that again I'll
show<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:55.819> can<00:03:56.180> take<00:03:57.049> it<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.380> you<00:03:57.500> go<00:03:57.650> through

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
show you can take it and you go through

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.690 
show you can take it and you go through
the<00:03:58.220> little<00:03:58.519> loop<00:03:58.730> that's<00:03:58.940> there<00:03:59.269> and<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:01.610> has

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
the little loop that's there and it has

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.600 
the little loop that's there and it has
like<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:01.940> line<00:04:02.239> over<00:04:02.420> top<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:03.500> can<00:04:03.650> see<00:04:03.709> it

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.610 

all<00:04:09.880> these<00:04:10.420> stitches<00:04:10.660> are<00:04:10.990> pretty<00:04:11.290> easy<00:04:13.620> so

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
all these stitches are pretty easy so

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.270 
all these stitches are pretty easy so
there<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.040> again<00:04:16.739> so<00:04:17.739> you're<00:04:17.890> going<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.220> go

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
there it is again so you're going to go

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.940 
there it is again so you're going to go
through<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.579> fabric<00:04:19.620> put<00:04:20.620> your<00:04:20.769> needle

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
through the fabric put your needle

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.720 
through the fabric put your needle
through<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.430> loop<00:04:21.609> and<00:04:22.000> pull<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:24.310> those<00:04:24.490> are

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
through the loop and pull so those are

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.790 
through the loop and pull so those are
the<00:04:24.760> three<00:04:24.880> basic<00:04:25.570> stitches<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.290> how<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.560> sew

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
the three basic stitches and how to sew

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.600 
the three basic stitches and how to sew
on<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.310> button<00:04:27.370> see<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.270> next<00:04:28.360> time
