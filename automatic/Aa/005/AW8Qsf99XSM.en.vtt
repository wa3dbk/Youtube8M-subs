00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.340
 in recent years there has been a 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.990
 important expansion in the market of 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.540
 smart phones and it's not easy 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.369
 choose one among so many why I have 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.140
 prepared this video so you can 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.240
 identify which is the best smartphone 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.240
 and the one that best suits your needs 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.060
 sensor 2 was presented during the 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.920
 fairs is las vegas 2015 as the first 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.860
 smartphone in incorporate a ram 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.690
 of 4 gigas to its really has been exceeded 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.460
 himself with this terminal and has 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.530
 managed to produce a device with a 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.590
 premium finish that could be a 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.570
 mix between the htc one tm 8 and the lg 3 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.090
 at the same time it is the first 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.710
 64-bit smartphone with 4 gigs of 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.690
 ram memory in addition to has fixed them 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.070
 to keep the price incredibly 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.030
 low 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.030
 do not 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.219
 I chose reflections is a phone that 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.720
 impressive at first glance it looks very 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.700
 well and I've heard the comments 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.619
 about critical areas such as the 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.140
 size the camera and the quality of the 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.400
 screen and has improved them has also 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.500
 put some efforts into the 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.850
 durability but some may have the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.280
 jee feeling that has not gone 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.720
 far enough after all 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.520
 choose flex 2 have a sheet of 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.740
 specifications very similar to that of 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.050
 first reflex where practically only 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.060
 highlights a new carrier in summary 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.700
 we can say that the flex axis 2 is 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.140
 basically a curved and flexible g3 and for 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.490
 so we have a phone that 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.840
 includes among the best smartphones 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.840
 Android of the moment 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.299
 the minutes of jaume is probably one 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.979
 of the best in the Android market and 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.020
 that the technical specifications that 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.880
 incorporates really are impressive 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.640
 this new pack sets the level 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.500
 competitive of the best devices 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.759
 getting to the level of samsung or app and 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.649
 is that your hardware is from another world 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.440
 we are talking about a processor 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.700
 qualcomm standard 1 810 of 8 cores and 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.580
 64 bits 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.920
 along with a adrenal 430 gpu accompanied 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.569
 with 4 gb of ram memory and its memory 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.569
 internal is 64 gigabytes 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.579
 the mind mx 4 pro is a device already 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.499
 not only pretty on the outside but also 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.209
 inside since we find ourselves with 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.069
 specifications worthy of a 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.109
 high- end device to those that already 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.030
 we are used to this 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.099
 device we find a memory 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.879
 gigabytes ram 3 along with a 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.980
 Exynos 5 processor opts 5,430 of 8 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.049
 cores that give you more performance 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.109
 that remarkable alternates to that of the Chinese brand 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.430
 that has android 4.4 kitkat by 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.739
 another side we find a 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.689
 5.5-inch screen with a 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.900
 resolution somewhat higher than the resolution 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.980
 of osca that looks really good 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.629
 finally in the section on the camera 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.730
 we have the same sensor that carries 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.280
 the sony xperia z 3 that gives you a 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.169
 outstanding result many criticize 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.120
 to michu for their phones similar to 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.620
 the iphone but the truth is that this 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.620
 politics works wonders 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.920
 ah 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.599
 do not 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.520
 this terminal has a design 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.110
 elegant with metal finish and a 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.090
 perfect ratio between size and 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.430
 screen this makes him a smartphone 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.980
 Compact with a 5.2-inch game 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.450
 for that reason and many more things could not 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.290
 missing from our list with best 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.480
 smartphones 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.610
 in addition we also highlight his camera almost 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.170
 to a very good job and your software the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.180
 which offers possibilities of 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.370
 customization as well as several options 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.530
 of control by gestures finally its 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.550
 battery promises to beat the day by doing 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.550
 a moderate use 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.370
 how it has to be the iphone had to 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.049
 hold a position in this ranking this 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.000
 terminal is certainly very solid in all 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.340
 the aspects as it includes a great 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.079
 performance a magnificent camera and a 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.579
 great battery life the 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.230
 quality of the screen is something that 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.569
 note at first sight with some great ones 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.730
 brightness values â€‹â€‹contrast and value and 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.560
 that manages to sell by itself 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.180
 to have it in your hand is very light and 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.409
 which is made of aluminum and the 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.390
 contact draws attention very 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.430
 positively support all 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.140
 consumers what they asked for an iphone 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.420
 with bigger screen and with a 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.650
 very innovative hardware without a doubt both 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.650
 models are magnificent 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.080
 the htc one mv has shown that if a 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.400
 thing is done well so that you change it 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.230
 the Taiwanese firm has retouched 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.210
 slightly your flagship to 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.860
 Maintain quality standards 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.150
 terminal has a screen of 5 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.060
 inches with a qualcomm processor 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.340
 snapdragon 810 8-core with a 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.860
 64-bit architecture and with one 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.960
 clock speed up to 2.1 hertz 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.790
 this is the new and powerful terminal 3 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.290
 gigas of ram memory that has a 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.210
 outer appearance that reminds a lot 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.820
 although with changes to the previous model 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.280
 almost all the rumors were true 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.350
 the Taiwanese presented the n9 in Barcelona 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.820
 and everything indicates that this year we are more 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.700
 before one of the best terminals 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.600
 presented this year 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.600
 or not 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.240
 this time the gis revenue its flagship 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.280
 betting on a screen design 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.320
 slightly curved and a casing 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.940
 leather back although its license 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.690
 form is practically the same as that of 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.240
 previous model 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.430
 lgg 4 integrates the screen with a 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.350
 5.5-inch diagonal and resolution 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.960
 quad hd 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.330
 resulting in a density of 534 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.040
 dots per inch but promises to improve 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.800
 the visual experience with a system 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.990
 how much display the camera is one of the 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.210
 highlights with a very bright lens 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.370
 Luminous and enhanced optical stabilizer 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.550
 autonomy remains a key point 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.710
 together with a snapdragon 808 processor 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.330
 that give good results and that in 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.620
 set makes it one of the best 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.620
 smartphone of the year 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.780
 the galaxy note 4 is the fourth generation 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.220
 of the series of babette with more hits 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.050
 of the moment as well as their 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.460
 predecessors this phone combines 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.949
 state-of-the-art technology with a 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.870
 large and bright screen with the note 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.669
 4 samsung has shown once again that 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.710
 is the undisputed king of the concept for 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.810
 see terms of both quality and 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.340
 functionality may that in the market for 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.050
 smartphones the difference between 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.360
 manufacturers are becoming narrower 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.190
 but one thing is clear in the field of 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.020
 the tablets the South Korean does not have 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.569
 Smart integration competition 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.430
 of the spm is the cherry on the cake and 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.800
 samsung did everything correctly with 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.410
 his new four adding technology 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.690
 of tip hands 2 rafinha and a small 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.950
 concession to criticism by adding framework 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.970
 metal 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.970
 or not 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.160
 The new Samsung Galaxy S 6 is indeed 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.870
 an elegant terminal the terminal logo 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.520
 has a unibody chassis that gives you 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.440
 consistency and the plastic has finally 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.510
 been replaced by much more materials 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.190
 noble and to the liking of the users as 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.110
 the metal unlike the models 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.090
 previous the South Korean firm has 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.860
 decided to set aside qualcomm for 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.890
 assemble a chip manufactured by itself 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.720
 xxi not 7.420 which is an 8-core chip 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.390
 able to reach clock speeds 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.980
 up to 2.1 gigahertz the terminal is 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.060
 have a payment platform of their own 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.890
 samsung pay 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.690
 In addition, the s6 can be loaded 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.820
 wireless just by leaving it in a 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.350
 platform as the executive of 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.150
 samsung is not about an evolution 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.760
 but something totally new and 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.460
 revolutionary along the way the 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.110
 water resistance the microsd slot and 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.020
 the possibility of removing the battery 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.910
 while in the s6 elx innovates with a 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:23.840
 double screen and curve what does 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.840
 really attractive 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.570
 and good band up here the video today 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.280
 do not forget to give the x subscribe to my 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.750
 channel I invite you to follow me in my
