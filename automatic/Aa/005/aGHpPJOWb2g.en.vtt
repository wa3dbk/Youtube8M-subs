00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
this bike because the booming exhaust

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.580 
this bike because the booming exhaust
drowns<00:01:55.369> out<00:01:55.639> all<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.630> cars<00:01:56.840> all<00:01:57.049> around<00:01:57.409> you

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
drowns out all the cars all around you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.899 
drowns out all the cars all around you
so<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:57.740> really<00:01:58.009> need<00:01:58.099> to<00:01:58.159> rely<00:01:58.490> on<00:01:58.520> your<00:01:58.729> eyes

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
so you really need to rely on your eyes

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.239 
so you really need to rely on your eyes
so<00:01:59.329> that's<00:02:00.289> a<00:02:01.630> little<00:02:02.630> safety<00:02:02.899> tip<00:02:03.229> there<00:02:03.439> now

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
so that's a little safety tip there now

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.589 
so that's a little safety tip there now
the<00:02:04.399> second<00:02:04.759> thing<00:02:04.789> I<00:02:04.969> don't<00:02:05.149> really<00:02:05.270> like<00:02:05.479> on

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
the second thing I don't really like on

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.649 
the second thing I don't really like on
this<00:02:05.659> bike<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.919> the<00:02:07.279> handlebars<00:02:07.819> themselves

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659 
this bike is the handlebars themselves

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.830 
this bike is the handlebars themselves
the<00:02:08.869> grips<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.970> know<00:02:11.090> they<00:02:11.239> are<00:02:11.360> hard<00:02:11.629> but

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
the grips you know they are hard but

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.770 
the grips you know they are hard but
that<00:02:11.989> doesn't<00:02:12.230> really<00:02:12.349> bother<00:02:12.530> me<00:02:12.709> oddly<00:02:13.129> and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
that doesn't really bother me oddly and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.240 
that doesn't really bother me oddly and
which<00:02:14.780> I've<00:02:15.110> read<00:02:15.350> quite<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.650> bit<00:02:15.740> about<00:02:16.040> that

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
which I've read quite a bit about that

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.570 
which I've read quite a bit about that
does<00:02:16.760> bother<00:02:16.970> some<00:02:17.330> other<00:02:17.420> writers<00:02:17.900> out<00:02:18.050> there

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
does bother some other writers out there

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.950 
does bother some other writers out there
it's<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.760> diameter<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.480> gets<00:02:20.720> me<00:02:21.340> now<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.960> am

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
it's the diameter that gets me now I am

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.560 
it's the diameter that gets me now I am
a<00:02:23.990> triple<00:02:24.440> XL<00:02:24.830> size<00:02:25.160> glove<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.240> I'm<00:02:26.390> at<00:02:26.510> the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
a triple XL size glove so I'm at the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.650 
a triple XL size glove so I'm at the
upper<00:02:26.810> end<00:02:26.960> of<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.170> spectrum<00:02:27.800> here<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.420> this

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
upper end of the spectrum here so this

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.970 
upper end of the spectrum here so this
isn't<00:02:29.810> going<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.050> be<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.200> problem<00:02:30.440> for<00:02:30.590> everyone

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
isn't going to be a problem for everyone

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.880 
isn't going to be a problem for everyone
in<00:02:31.070> fact<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:31.460> you're<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.640> small<00:02:32.000> glove<00:02:32.330> or<00:02:32.690> a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
in fact if you're a small glove or a

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.920 
in fact if you're a small glove or a
medium<00:02:33.890> even<00:02:34.070> you're<00:02:34.460> probably<00:02:34.810> jumping<00:02:35.810> up

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
medium even you're probably jumping up

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.240 
medium even you're probably jumping up
and<00:02:36.020> down<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.380> cheering<00:02:36.740> right<00:02:36.890> now<00:02:36.920> it's

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
and down and cheering right now it's

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.680 
and down and cheering right now it's
probably<00:02:37.370> suited<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.090> perfectly

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
probably suited to you perfectly

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.490 
probably suited to you perfectly
but<00:02:39.620> for<00:02:39.830> me<00:02:40.180> it's<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.330> really<00:02:41.630> small<00:02:41.900> diameter

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
but for me it's a really small diameter

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.400 
but for me it's a really small diameter
and<00:02:42.620> I'm<00:02:42.740> just<00:02:43.750> holding<00:02:44.750> on<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.110> throttle

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
and I'm just holding on to the throttle

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.310 
and I'm just holding on to the throttle
wrapping<00:02:46.130> my<00:02:46.220> hands<00:02:46.460> around<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:47.060> after<00:02:47.690> around

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
wrapping my hands around it after around

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.560 
wrapping my hands around it after around
half<00:02:48.980> an<00:02:49.160> hour<00:02:49.310> 40<00:02:49.700> minutes<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.030> riding<00:02:50.420> my

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
half an hour 40 minutes of riding my

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.390 
half an hour 40 minutes of riding my
right<00:02:50.840> hand<00:02:51.080> will<00:02:51.230> go<00:02:51.350> completely<00:02:51.740> numb<00:02:52.100> and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
right hand will go completely numb and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.720 
right hand will go completely numb and
I'll<00:02:53.240> have<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.510> stop<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:53.900> stretch<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.350> out<00:02:54.730> so

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
I'll have to stop and stretch it out so

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.250 
I'll have to stop and stretch it out so
I<00:02:55.760> don't<00:02:55.970> have<00:02:56.030> risk<00:02:56.270> problems<00:02:56.660> riding<00:02:57.170> this

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
I don't have risk problems riding this

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.410 
I don't have risk problems riding this
bike<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:57.680> not<00:02:57.710> a<00:02:57.860> wrist<00:02:58.100> issue<00:02:58.310> at<00:02:59.090> all<00:02:59.270> the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
bike it's not a wrist issue at all the

bike it's not a wrist issue at all the
riding<00:02:59.630> position<00:02:59.840> is<00:03:00.170> really<00:03:00.440> really<00:03:01.090> sweet

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
riding position is really really sweet

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.450 
riding position is really really sweet
for<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.390> super<00:03:02.720> sport<00:03:02.990> bike<00:03:03.230> it's<00:03:03.890> mainly<00:03:04.190> the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
for a super sport bike it's mainly the

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.830 
for a super sport bike it's mainly the
diameter<00:03:05.060> of<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.360> handlebars<00:03:05.990> that<00:03:06.430> really

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
diameter of the handlebars that really

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.540 
diameter of the handlebars that really
cripples<00:03:08.840> my<00:03:09.050> hands<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.650> makes<00:03:10.070> them<00:03:10.280> numb

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
cripples my hands and makes them numb

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.280 
cripples my hands and makes them numb
now<00:03:11.390> it's<00:03:11.510> not<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.720> end<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.990> world<00:03:12.140> you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
now it's not the end of the world you

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.410 
now it's not the end of the world you
can<00:03:12.440> get<00:03:12.620> aftermarket<00:03:13.370> grips<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.270> to

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
can get aftermarket grips just to

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.060 
can get aftermarket grips just to
increase<00:03:14.690> that<00:03:14.960> dome<00:03:15.230> or<00:03:15.530> out<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.680> little<00:03:15.890> bit

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
increase that dome or out a little bit

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.190 
increase that dome or out a little bit
more<00:03:16.360> it's<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.420> little<00:03:17.630> bit<00:03:17.750> like<00:03:17.900> when<00:03:18.080> you're

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
more it's a little bit like when you're

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.420 
more it's a little bit like when you're
in<00:03:18.320> school<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.800> you'll<00:03:18.890> swing<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.250> on<00:03:19.310> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
in school and you'll swing it on the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.000 
in school and you'll swing it on the
monkey<00:03:19.700> bars<00:03:19.760> do<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.090> remember<00:03:20.510> if<00:03:20.660> the<00:03:21.010> bars

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
monkey bars do you remember if the bars

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.860 
monkey bars do you remember if the bars
fit<00:03:22.430> your<00:03:22.550> hand<00:03:22.760> perfectly<00:03:23.000> you<00:03:23.600> can<00:03:23.630> like

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
fit your hand perfectly you can like

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
swing from bar to bar all day long if

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.570 
swing from bar to bar all day long if
they're<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.210> bit<00:03:26.480> big<00:03:26.780> or<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.410> bit<00:03:27.620> small<00:03:27.980> it

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
they're a bit big or a bit small it

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.970 
they're a bit big or a bit small it
hurts<00:03:28.850> your<00:03:29.030> hands<00:03:29.270> and<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.690> can<00:03:29.840> only<00:03:29.990> go<00:03:30.200> one

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
hurts your hands and you can only go one

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.860 
hurts your hands and you can only go one
to<00:03:31.160> two<00:03:31.310> bars<00:03:31.580> it's<00:03:31.790> exactly<00:03:32.270> like<00:03:32.360> that<00:03:32.720> it's

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
to two bars it's exactly like that it's

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
to two bars it's exactly like that it's
what<00:03:32.990> it<00:03:33.080> reminded<00:03:33.440> me<00:03:33.620> of<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:34.580> same<00:03:34.820> thing<00:03:35.120> so

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
what it reminded me of the same thing so

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.680 
what it reminded me of the same thing so
yeah<00:03:36.890> that's<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.910> second<00:03:38.300> point

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
yeah that's the second point

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.250 
yeah that's the second point
the<00:03:38.870> third<00:03:39.320> point<00:03:39.740> I'll<00:03:40.130> just<00:03:40.160> get<00:03:40.490> off<00:03:41.260> now

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
the third point I'll just get off now

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.110 
the third point I'll just get off now
this<00:03:42.440> paint<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:43.280> color<00:03:43.580> is<00:03:43.880> absolutely

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
this paint the color is absolutely

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.330 
this paint the color is absolutely
fantastic<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:45.350> just<00:03:45.680> think<00:03:45.860> it's<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.130> best

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
fantastic I just think it's the best

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.170 
fantastic I just think it's the best
shade<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.760> red<00:03:46.970> in<00:03:47.840> the<00:03:48.470> entire<00:03:48.800> world<00:03:49.190> but<00:03:50.060> on

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
shade of red in the entire world but on

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.680 
shade of red in the entire world but on
the<00:03:50.300> $8.99<00:03:50.600> model<00:03:51.670> it<00:03:52.670> came<00:03:53.000> without<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.360> clear

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the $8.99 model it came without a clear

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.150 
the $8.99 model it came without a clear
coat<00:03:53.990> now<00:03:54.800> in<00:03:54.950> 2014<00:03:56.920> selling<00:03:57.920> something

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
coat now in 2014 selling something

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.130 
coat now in 2014 selling something
without<00:03:58.520> a<00:03:58.550> clear<00:03:58.850> coat<00:03:59.060> is<00:03:59.240> just<00:03:59.510> absolutely

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
without a clear coat is just absolutely

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.240 
without a clear coat is just absolutely
bananas<00:04:00.410> as<00:04:01.130> far<00:04:01.370> as<00:04:01.490> I'm<00:04:01.640> concerned

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
bananas as far as I'm concerned

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.370 
bananas as far as I'm concerned
why<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.850> clearcoat<00:04:04.330> does<00:04:04.570> is<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:04.960> obviously

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
why the clearcoat does is it obviously

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.670 
why the clearcoat does is it obviously
protects<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:05.980> paint<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:07.300> without<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.680> you're

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
protects the paint so without a you're

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.760 
protects the paint so without a you're
risking<00:04:09.390> stone<00:04:10.390> chip<00:04:10.720> city<00:04:11.050> and<00:04:13.770> it's

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
risking stone chip city and it's

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.890 
risking stone chip city and it's
obviously<00:04:15.100> a<00:04:15.190> cost-cutting<00:04:15.850> exercise<00:04:16.120> but

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
obviously a cost-cutting exercise but

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.630 
obviously a cost-cutting exercise but
it's<00:04:17.200> just<00:04:17.470> crazy<00:04:18.090> from<00:04:19.090> my<00:04:19.269> point<00:04:20.080> of<00:04:20.140> view<00:04:20.640> so

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
it's just crazy from my point of view so

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.300 
it's just crazy from my point of view so
what<00:04:21.760> I've<00:04:21.850> done<00:04:21.970> here<00:04:22.030> is<00:04:22.480> we<00:04:22.600> looked<00:04:23.110> down

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
what I've done here is we looked down

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.730 
what I've done here is we looked down
got<00:04:24.310> the<00:04:24.400> shifter<00:04:24.790> here<00:04:25.350> now<00:04:26.350> your<00:04:26.500> boot

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
got the shifter here now your boot

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.710 
got the shifter here now your boot
obviously<00:04:27.400> sits<00:04:27.700> around<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.150> area<00:04:28.420> around

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
obviously sits around this area around

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.170 
obviously sits around this area around
the<00:04:28.870> foot<00:04:29.080> peg<00:04:29.290> to<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.860> shifter<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:30.580> I've<00:04:31.030> got

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
the foot peg to the shifter so I've got

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.540 
the foot peg to the shifter so I've got
a<00:04:31.210> layer<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:31.690> clear<00:04:31.960> contacts<00:04:32.680> over<00:04:33.130> this<00:04:33.280> part

really liked on this bike now with any
of<00:05:12.700> these<00:05:12.850> three<00:05:13.120> things<00:05:13.350> change<00:05:15.120> me<00:05:16.120> buying

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
of these three things change me buying

the bike find you them beforehand and

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.900 
the bike find you them beforehand and
the<00:05:18.970> answer<00:05:19.270> to<00:05:19.390> that<00:05:19.510> is<00:05:19.720> no<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:21.100> good<00:05:21.460> points

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
the answer to that is no the good points

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.460 
the answer to that is no the good points
far<00:05:22.240> outweigh<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.980> negative<00:05:23.980> ones<00:05:24.220> I<00:05:25.470> can

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
far outweigh the negative ones I can

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.560 
far outweigh the negative ones I can
only<00:05:26.590> come<00:05:26.830> up<00:05:26.860> with<00:05:27.010> three<00:05:27.370> and<00:05:27.550> that's<00:05:28.360> just

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
only come up with three and that's just

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.330 
only come up with three and that's just
being<00:05:28.780> as<00:05:28.930> honest<00:05:29.200> as<00:05:29.350> possible<00:05:29.410> and<00:05:30.100> again

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
being as honest as possible and again

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.040 
being as honest as possible and again
they're<00:05:30.730> not<00:05:30.850> going<00:05:30.970> to<00:05:31.030> suit<00:05:31.600> everyone

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
they're not going to suit everyone

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.480 
they're not going to suit everyone
because<00:05:32.230> if<00:05:32.350> you<00:05:32.440> were<00:05:32.560> a<00:05:32.590> much<00:05:32.830> smaller<00:05:33.190> rider

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
because if you were a much smaller rider

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.320 
because if you were a much smaller rider
than<00:05:33.790> I<00:05:33.880> am

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
than I am

than I am
yeah<00:05:35.200> they<00:05:35.440> probably<00:05:35.620> wouldn't<00:05:36.070> you<00:05:37.030> probably

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
yeah they probably wouldn't you probably

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.760

wouldn't<00:05:37.720> have<00:05:37.810> those<00:05:37.960> complaints<00:05:38.320> to<00:05:38.530> begin

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
wouldn't have those complaints to begin

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.640 
wouldn't have those complaints to begin
with<00:05:39.060> but<00:05:40.060> yeah<00:05:40.660> I<00:05:40.690> thought<00:05:40.900> it<00:05:41.020> was<00:05:41.110> put<00:05:41.320> where

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
with but yeah I thought it was put where

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.250 
with but yeah I thought it was put where
it's<00:05:41.770> putting<00:05:41.950> it<00:05:42.070> out<00:05:42.220> there
