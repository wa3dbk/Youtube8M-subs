 being here on our list of 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.309
 contacts we just select the 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.239
 contact to which we want to add a 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.219
 Photo 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.839
 let's say let's say we want to add 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:42.280
 a photo to this that says tourist bus 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:45.159
 we do not select the name because it does not 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.129
 we would be doing like the flame but 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.839
 we selected the face to 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.329
 select the face we can see 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.270
 bad we can see more contact information 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.990
 we select the face again 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.550
 being here already in the editing part 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.740
 of the contact we select again the 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.510
 face and here I get the option to take 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.930
 the photo or choose a photo from the gallery 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.610
 let's choose a photo in the gallery 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.150
 let's select any 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.680
 there are not many photos here to choose 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.890
 selected any trim there 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.370
 only once do we select any 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.260
 part of the image that interests us 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.990
 we just read here up save 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.170
 so it's simple we've added a 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.030
 photo contact we can return leave 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.640
 completely and we are going to enter 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.670
 again by phone all 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.950
 contacts let's find the bus 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.050
 tourist I think it is or here you have to 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.760
 appear the image normally if you 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.090
 we add a hand in contact 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:51.300
 It is time that we dedicate quickly the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.780
 user know what was done 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.170
 I bet it was not good to record 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.900
 this new tourist's hands here 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.270
 since I give easily identifiable with 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.119
 a picture we are going to add quickly 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.000
 another photo in this case I will show you 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.000
 because it is useful for example we are going to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.980
 make a call we use this other 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.670
 that I have here to call the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.670
 engine 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.180
 let's call him quickly 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.930
 at this time they do not make a photo 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.930
 contact to the engine 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.360
 As you can see, there is not a photo that we 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.560
 Quickly identify who 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.990
 he calls us but the name and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.990
 then we will quickly assign you to 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.270
 this contact that calls iphone5 s in a 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.900
 picture we go to contacts all 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.180
 contacts 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.970
 let's find the contact here 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.040
 7 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.850
 we select the face as we said 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.920
 again the little face and another of the little face 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.000
 choose photo gallery 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.000
 we select any image 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 let's select 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:23.090
 let's take a picture here 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.610
 let's reflect this we have to keep it 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.050
 since the photo store them we left 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.720
 here again and now we are going to do 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.260
 again the call I'm going to call it 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.260
 again 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.300
 but now the volume 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.060
 or you will see immediately the photo of 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.620
 the person we assign besides the 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.760
 name we can identify it with the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.250
 Photo 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.400
 so that's the advantage of having a photo 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.959
 in a contact assigned the subject by 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.849
