00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
basically are the hardest part because

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.200 
basically are the hardest part because
it<00:00:09.660> sets<00:00:09.960> up<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.200> rest<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.769> solo<00:00:11.219> for

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210

even sixteenth notes so the only note
that's<00:00:43.559> not<00:00:43.770> picked<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.430> little<00:00:44.610> hammer

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
that's not picked is that little hammer

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
solo by the time they switch the cameras

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.760 
solo by the time they switch the cameras
to<00:00:53.399> them<00:00:53.489> he's<00:00:53.670> already<00:00:53.850> other<00:00:55.520> okay<00:00:57.710> try<00:00:58.710> to

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:22.830 

this<00:01:10.909> morning<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.299> was<00:01:11.390> coming<00:01:11.570> across<00:01:11.720> maybe<00:01:12.140> I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.029 

tend<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:23.869> like<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:24.140> one<00:01:24.200> although<00:01:24.530> I<00:01:24.560> just

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
tend to like that one although I just

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.399 
tend to like that one although I just
started<00:01:25.399> tuning<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.729> Vinnie<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:27.140> way<00:01:27.259> I've

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
started tuning it to Vinnie the way I've

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.960 
started tuning it to Vinnie the way I've
done<00:01:27.619> it<00:01:27.679> you<00:01:27.950> don't<00:01:28.100> hear<00:01:28.369> that<00:01:28.549> slide

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
done it you don't hear that slide

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.149 
done it you don't hear that slide
anytime<00:01:29.689> you<00:01:29.780> hear<00:01:29.899> getting<00:01:30.200> played<00:01:33.159> can't

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
anytime you hear getting played can't

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.740 
anytime you hear getting played can't
get<00:01:34.250> rid<00:01:34.399> of<00:01:34.460> that<00:01:34.549> slide<00:01:37.360> so<00:01:38.360> I<00:01:38.390> don't<00:01:38.659> think

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
get rid of that slide so I don't think

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.240 
get rid of that slide so I don't think
he's<00:01:38.899> doing<00:01:39.170> that<00:01:39.229> I<00:01:39.380> think<00:01:39.560> he's<00:01:39.830> either<00:01:39.979> this

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
he's doing that I think he's either this

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:59.169 
he's doing that I think he's either this
way<00:01:56.110> last<00:01:57.110> part<00:01:57.470> it's<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.099> little<00:01:58.250> trick<00:01:58.789> in<00:01:58.939> so

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
way last part it's a little trick in so

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:05.380 
way last part it's a little trick in so
many<00:01:59.299> songs<00:01:59.750> that<00:02:00.020> he<00:02:00.110> does<00:02:00.289> I<00:02:04.119> tend<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.149> start

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
many songs that he does I tend to start

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:19.979 
many songs that he does I tend to start
it<00:02:05.599> with<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.990> index<00:02:08.140> int

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.590

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.230
