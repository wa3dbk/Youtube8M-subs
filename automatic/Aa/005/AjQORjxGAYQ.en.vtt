the first time I came over the bluff at

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.750 
the first time I came over the bluff at
shipsterns<00:01:56.720> feels<00:01:57.410> like<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.710> long<00:01:58.070> time<00:01:58.430> ago

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
shipsterns feels like a long time ago

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.710 
shipsterns feels like a long time ago
now<00:01:59.030> is<00:01:59.180> probably<00:01:59.600> nearly<00:02:00.530> 15<00:02:01.010> years<00:02:01.040> ago<00:02:01.720> and

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
now is probably nearly 15 years ago and

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.080 
now is probably nearly 15 years ago and
back<00:02:03.020> then<00:02:03.260> it<00:02:03.290> was<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.500> myth<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:04.190> didn't<00:02:04.610> believe

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
back then it was a myth I didn't believe

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.320 
back then it was a myth I didn't believe
that<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.450> wave<00:02:05.660> that<00:02:06.050> good<00:02:06.700> could<00:02:07.700> exist<00:02:08.119> you

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
that a wave that good could exist you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.559 
that a wave that good could exist you
know<00:02:08.360> about<00:02:08.750> yeah

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.509 

it's<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.140> pretty<00:02:12.319> special<00:02:12.650> place<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.280> if<00:02:13.430> you

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
it's a pretty special place so if you

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.429 
it's a pretty special place so if you
ever<00:02:13.640> walk<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.209> there<00:02:14.390> it's<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.659> kind<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.019> ice<00:02:15.230> we

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
ever walk in there it's a kind of ice we

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.830 
ever walk in there it's a kind of ice we
look<00:02:15.709> at<00:02:15.829> it<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.329> be<00:02:17.599> you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.750 

I<00:02:35.720> wouldn't<00:02:36.530> really<00:02:36.620> consider<00:02:37.070> myself<00:02:37.160> a<00:02:37.580> big

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760
