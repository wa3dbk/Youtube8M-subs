00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.630
 are 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.900
 the trainers study association the electrotechnical association 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.450
 at are the association of electrical engineering students to the technical 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.790
 university delft 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 and we have the strongest this year 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.730
 girls we had a totally different stand we have one 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.990
 fifteen years ago 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.600
 We have planned time is done according to him was stunt it was before 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.390
 Image expression girls on the easier farther 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.390
 and five years ago it was teenagers 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.770
 where to buy the star of the sea could be played other things 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.090
 there were a little bit to brainstorm ideas 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.619
 and right now someone is saying that they can make do with a huge game controller 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.880
 what once set a world record 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
 so yes that would do 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.430
 Yes 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.670
 the 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.010
 at 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.870
 if you grab television remote control 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.870
 there comes a light pink skin when you press the button that can't see 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.490
 and when you feel the volume knob picks up that lingers 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.090
 if you don't get the impression that that thought in your customers for just two on it 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.810
 change volume but you see here 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.090
 it seems there is now a sensor 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.970
 now they are a piece of metal 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.930
 enno brommet of course 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.880
 he had the ball for 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.220
 sleeve 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.690
 and then it passes on and we can read that 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.690
 and the chip that pass it on to the eu and the knife 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.469
 2 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.029
 feel free to take home 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:29.549
 but not me anyway 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.199
 because that does not fit in the room 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.339
 but we go for a user at introduction weekends for new ones 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.779
 students and the faculty the open days even meaner
