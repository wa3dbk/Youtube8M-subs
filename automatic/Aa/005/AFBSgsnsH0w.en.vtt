00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.509
 and live we have Mr. Javier 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.669
 farje international analyst from 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.760
 london who delves into the 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:12.130
 information that we have just delivered 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.110
 very good Mr. Farc that can be 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.660
 attribute the increasing attacks of 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.520
 Afghan soldiers and police against the 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.500
 NATO troops 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.480
 good afternoon colleagues there are several 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.000
 reasons first deep 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.890
 mistrust at the population level by 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.230
 the role of NATO much of 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.210
 Western correspondents have 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.400
 verified effectively there is a 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.379
 deep distrust on the part of 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.150
 let's say the town has gaining respect 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.879
 to the presence so in second place 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.250
 a leaked document from the Ministry of 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.680
 Afghan interior in March to an agency 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.290
 Western news explained that the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.210
 Recruitment and supervision system 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.430
 of the background of those who 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.770
 present as to do police in the 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.630
 police win in the Afghan forces is 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.700
 extremely deficient accordingly 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.680
 allows the infiltration of people who 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.510
 they are against the presence of 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.880
 foreign troops there is also a 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.680
 cultural problem in pasture areas 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.660
 for example 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.759
 it is considered you see the soldiers 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.649
 Americans as arrogant and not 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.600
 respect local cultural values 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.850
 this is a problem that does not come from 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.430
 now of the British presence in 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.899
 afghanistan at the beginning of the 20th century it 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.149
 saw that the allies steps of the 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.720
 British sometimes killed their own 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:28.490
 British because they considered that 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.950
 strict life of that region were not 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.470
 respected there is also a problem 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.170
 let's say 15 percent of the deaths 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.270
 of NATO soldiers are 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.880
 Americans this year in afghanistan 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.260
 have been the product of death by 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.000
 arcane soldiers so that is a 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.130
 crucial problem that is 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.890
 increasing quite a lot and that has 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.080
 become the main element in 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.910
 the war in afghanistan in 2012 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.030
 these are some reasons why 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.040
 which can be attributed to an increase 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.840
 quite substantial from the death of 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.180
 NATO soldiers by part of 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.700
 soldiers and policemen nearby yes sir 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.350
 farc a nebula has formed for the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.350
 NATO mission in Afghanistan 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.920
 I was in Pakistan in the year 2001 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.720
 when the campaign began in 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.849
 border with afghanistan and the idea 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.340
 It was always very clear to fight the fall 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.799
 but this is no longer the main goal 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.750
 many generals of the NATO general 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.459
 retired or british are saying 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.290
 that the main objective of the 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.870
 presence of coalition troops 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.030
 led by NATO in Afghanistan not 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.340
 it makes sense it has been totally lost 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.530
 objective what is the objective to rebuild 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.329
 the country avoid al Qaeda attacks 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.340
 fight Taliban seems to have no 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.139
 clarity regarding the objectives to 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.599
 that adds to the fact that there is little 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:46.159
 political stability has no control of 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.019
 the political situation and is 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.069
 increasingly dependent on help 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.389
 from the west 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.280
 then there seems to be a lack of 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:54.920
 clear direction we know that having a 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.409
 withdrawal of troops in 2014 but 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.139
 between now and 2014 as there is no 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.609
 clarity about what is expected 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.500
 achieve in afghanistan but it has been lost 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.060
 address a lot of people consider not 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.370
 only here but in countries 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.010
 Western that has been lost let's say 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.810
 the battle to win the favor of the 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.120
 drones and there is no clear objective 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.430
 political or military presence of the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.920
 NATO 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.329
 thank you very much sir farje for the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.329
 time that has given us until then
