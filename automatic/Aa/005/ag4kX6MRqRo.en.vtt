00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.639
 hello guys and girls I'm going to show you today 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.469
 as I have done as manufactured pearls for 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.539
 make bracelets and necklaces but they are good 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.880
 not very round pearls are rather with 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.550
 cylindrical shape and I made them with 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.380
 homemade play dough I will teach you is not 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.089
 so hard good very entertaining but 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.029
 in such good result used 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:29.490
 homemade plasticine straws scissors 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.610
 sticks wooden skewers a piece of 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.140
 black gold plated spray carton 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 pink and yellow 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.870
 first I have taken a piece of cardboard 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.579
 these to hold the pearls and with 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.730
 a wooden skewer of those of the 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.399
 pinchitos long I've made holes 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.620
 and I've put and I've put it like this' bases 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.140
 with a support to put the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.940
 pearls then when I do them if you go to 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.100
 do many then put several skewers 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.370
 and it's me you make few because you put some 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.339
 uncles work then I have picked up the straw 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.290
 beige and I cut it into pieces 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.350
 that you want to see the smallest ones 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.390
 with smaller pieces that you want 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.510
 cylinders a little bigger because the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.610
 short is bigger 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.000
 I then that would explain why the good 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.920
 I made here to make the video 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.780
 I've done it with the straw like that 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.550
 but then I realized that I had 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.659
 it cost more to take it out short and then I 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.670
 made another series 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.670
 and I lost him put good Vaseline 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.939
 I explain you see the catch a piece of 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.670
 homemade plasticine that I'll leave the link 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:45.350
 so that you go to if you do not know how to do it 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.179
 to have the formula the recipe and how 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.799
 You see, I've taken bits, you see 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.090
 taking pieces I'm going to teach 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.730
 several times and take pieces of 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.880
 you have carried off the straw 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.600
 take a piece of plasticine you see 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.170
 like a churro 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.930
 and you go with the index and the thumb of a 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.720
 hand you take the piece of straws and with 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.550
 the index finger and the thumb of the other hand 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.970
 You are rolling around and you are going 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.819
 circling is very important that the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.819
 fingers that hold the straw the piece of 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.800
 straws that I squeezed it jce well so that 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.270
 the dough does not get in it 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.459
 because if not then it stays stuck and not 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.040
 You can remove the page piece but 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.180
 well it 's not serious either but good 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.870
 if you want to take it out so it does not look 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.280
 the best good and good you are doing 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.719
 You are giving it back very important 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.129
 when you put them on the stick that does not 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.829
 they touch each other and do not 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.200
 will be stuck and well you are doing 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.810
 as I say churritos and you go rolling 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.079
 around the little pieces of straw you see 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.670
 and you have little cylinders left 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.170
 I try to do the round ones but not what 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.569
 I got then if we 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.299
 we manage to make them round because it's better 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.189
 if you want round you see later if 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.840
 cut larger pieces, then six 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.510
 larger cylinders a few more pieces 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.430
 great for 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.250
 to then make the bracelets or the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.220
 necklaces then you can also I have 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.349
 left ready and you can do it to 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.010
 you in relief if you want to make 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.390
 pinchitos or pinholes or whatever you want 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.569
 I have done it to the base because 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.200
 I wanted to make my idea was to make bracelets 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.080
 with 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.819
 with thread with black leather and make the 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.890
 silver because I really like that guy 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.870
 of black and silver bracelet then 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.090
 as he began to paint it silver with 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.650
 spray I have not painted them before but 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.810
 You can also paint the plasticine 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.280
 homemade and make it directly colored 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.860
 red yellow green color that 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.900
 you want and so you do not have to paint them 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.200
 then because then paint them with a 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.180
 brush is more more patience than with the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.700
 aerosol 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.950
 good as you see 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.560
 is to take the piece of straw with the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.650
 index and the thumb of a hand and with the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.540
 another you are spinning around me what you 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.910
 he said is that for example then when 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.310
 this one has dried when taking out the piece 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.140
 of straw inside has cost me a 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.580
 little then what I have done is in another 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.790
 series the straw covered with 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.130
 Vaseline and so then it is better 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.079
 you will see later that I teach it and 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.460
 it gets better but you see the more laps 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.070
 You give him more , work it, because 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.960
 cylinder will stay smoother and rather 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.550
 done then when it dries some 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.249
 Sometimes it swells up again 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.840
 cracks other times it stays well 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:36.180
 that already 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.130
 Depends on how your play dough is 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.949
 then I found you are doing 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.810
 cutting a piece for a bracelet is worth 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.260
 do a whole piece for example so 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.270
 a little rounded arched all that 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.850
 caught that piece of the straw 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.240
 which has as spring and done the same 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.430
 have read circling and when I have 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.139
 coated whole because I've folded it a 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.810
 I've been a little bit so I know 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.350
 stay in the way you see good to see what 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.350
 what results 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.230
 and hey, you already click on the piece 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.190
 of 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:15.289
 in a pinchito in a pinchito and already dry 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.539
 once they are dry you see 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.490
 some I tell you some, it depends on 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.620
 if you have left much dry or not 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.949
 if they crack or break 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.040
 little but good are irregular and that 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:30.050
 I like it because they are 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.140
 are handmade things and things to 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.780
 because they are always not perfect in 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.030
 general nobody is perfect and even less 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.010
 the craft things then to me not 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.530
 I care if they have flaws or that 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.050
 they are not or they are not perfect you see 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:47.000
 here I am taking out the pieces of the 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.830
 straw that I did not put on petroleum jelly and 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.850
 has cost a little more and then the 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.950
 others although it may not look like it in the video 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.810
 it is much more easily removed with the base 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.390
 then to the advice that you put 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.420
 Vaseline to the page 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.190
 or oil in the same and you see then it 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.760
 it's much easier, I've taken a 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.160
 cutter you can take a pair of scissors or something 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.900
 something pointy to get the 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.730
 little pieces then there are others like this one 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.120
 example you see with the straw before 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.889
 I dried I made him like redonditos 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.990
 in what he said of doing a little bit in 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.770
 Highlight if you want cartoons I like 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.320
 I wanted something smooth because I have not made a 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.090
 to see to see if the result and 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.979
 well once you have them all to my 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.840
 emptied all the pieces of straw if 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.479
 someone stays inside nothing happens then 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.139
 to remove them as you wish I have tried 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.210
 for example with a silver marker it is 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.610
 much more entertaining clear is and not 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.560
 you can paint them on the inside that I have 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.960
 painted two now after taught 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.949
 I will show the difference between the spray 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.810
 and the marker depends on him as 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:57.360
 you want the silver color 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.160
 here for example you see me to make them 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.950
 with the spray I took a tray a 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.389
 piece of newspaper to be able to change them 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.690
 if you make several colors that's why it's the 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:07.980
 newspaper with beige spray the vais 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.100
 painting to which the advantage is that it 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.940
 they paint inside and out 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.680
 then you take with the skewer again the 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.780
 you put inside and what I have done is 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.880
 to give it that are not smooth smooth 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.320
 then another spray for example it 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.570
 I teach a model I've done 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.190
 it is painted black and then with pink 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.620
 beige squeezes is like this from time to time and 

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.870
 it comes out as a drip and it stays good 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:33.090
 irregular as he says I like the 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.580
 irregular things and here you see the one of the 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:37.590
 left is with the marker and the other 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.530
 with the spray is not the same brightness and 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.690
 Well, here you have it here 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.150
 I say is simple is original good so 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:48.660
 good result so good I hope that 

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:52.050
 you like that you can make many pearls 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:54.540
 and many necklaces and bracelets for this 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:58.520
 summer I say goodbye and I wait for you in my 

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.520
 next video goodbye see you soon
