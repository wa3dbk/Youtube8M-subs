00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.780
 how about everyone have a very good day today 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.760
 how to make a witch of the ore 50 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.980
 then we start let's start with 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.480
 the side of the hat we come from this 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.449
 way working like this 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:27.640
 Now I have some parts like 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:30.700
 as old then our patched 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.500
 we came here 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.500
 we come here 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:44.140
 and then we return here a debit 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.219
 here another has a crime and here 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.780
 we make another one come back here and ready 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.899
 now let's start then with the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.320
 head let's go here here we go 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.250
 to make a part of the eyelashes 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.150
 we have with the nose 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.820
 which is quite expected we came to 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:09.530
 here with the mouth and we come here with 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.680
 our chin come back down we have the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.460
 neck so you're not going to take us 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.990
 a bandage 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.659
 not for a sale here 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.370
 a come that is here 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.980
 for this 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.920
 now let's make the pp lenses the 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.920
 pelito the witch comes this way 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.310
 comes here 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.229
 well that one here and another ready prayer let's go 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.119
 to make the body the body to start 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.530
 from here like a little figure 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.210
 the one of the witch like the back 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.259
 we come here then with the little hand 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.120
 that arrives there up here and here 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:02:00.110
 then he is running 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:03.200
 let's say it the clever stick 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.920
 let's say here like this now what are we going to 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.390
 do we are going to make the stick 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.390
 that appears here 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.230
 and it arrives in the same way here now 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.460
 let's go then to the part of the 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.700
 body that is missing millions here 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:27.620
 we go here and then we return for 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.110
 make the dress that is assembled 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.519
 and the dress is around here a little 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.890
 common as loose 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.090
 here now what will happen we will do 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.569
 so 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.650
 the apothecary 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.280
 and they come here 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.530
 the witch gothic look here 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.210
 over here in the other in the other leg 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.380
 we come like this 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.450
 and we come in this way 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.980
 put now what will happen level 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.610
 so 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.610
 here 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.340
 and here we come like this 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.920
 A) Yes 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.420
 and we arrived here 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.730
 ready now we have the silhouette of the 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.400
 witch what we are going to do is fill 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.400
 then very easy we come here 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.110
 it's work 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.450
 and every one who seeks the love to fill 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.450
 so I'm going to do it like that 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.570
 the most basic and not stuffed 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.520
 common 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.349
 osaka 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.310
 if the easiest we fill in as 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.310
 unicorn in term 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.280
 i 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.459
 remember that you were in the middle 50 in 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.459
 aruba 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.190
 we have here 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.590
 Y 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.690
 We are already finishing and we are going well between 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.940
 the truth that they are more and almost that 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.940
 completely and filled 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.270
 well seen that's all we already have the 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.730
 light determined I hope you liked it 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.300

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.300
