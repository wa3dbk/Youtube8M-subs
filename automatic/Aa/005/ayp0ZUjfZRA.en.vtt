00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
so let's do a little example joy ride up

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.590 
so let's do a little example joy ride up
to<00:01:47.280> Times<00:01:47.550> Square<00:01:47.910> to<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.210> our<00:01:48.330> feet<00:01:48.570> wet

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
to Times Square to get our feet wet
