00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.460
 it was the turn of the column of jorgito 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.650
 pandino are you going to talk about the cars 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.439
 electrical is exactly a fashion that 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.110
 it is here is growing more in the world 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.119
 the first electric car manufactured in 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.849
 series for the massive sale was the nissan 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.070
 leaf and now volwagen is added with the app 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.780
 the app that was screened in Argentina 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.239
 I've been here so many chilitos very 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.590
 nice one of the most beautiful also 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.750
 of volwagen lately good there is a 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.359
 electrical version that for now is in 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.519
 europe but it's interesting to take it as 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.649
 an example of what they are and what they are for 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.300
 thought the selected cars of 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 done if you travel to Mendoza not 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.370
 is for autonomy in the case of and in 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.929
 general 160 kilometers with which is in 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.760
 a city like europe water almost and you 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.190
 you live in pillar and of strange capital of 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.440
 come back to you perfect as is the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.440
 good mechanics in the case of the there is a 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.720
 important battery on the floor an engine 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.250
 electric if you leave with the load will be 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.630
 you have in the indicators in the tank 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.600
 of naphtha you have how much you have left of load 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.159
 electric 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.439
 and the interesting thing about this car is that 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.570
 when you slow down the system makes it 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.820
 recharge electricity is not true 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.640
 you have three driving options in 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.080
 age then you can say limit the 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.940
 power that delivers the engine that the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.530
 maximum are 82 horses also save 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.149
 in the clear if Olympia is the power 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.640
 It will be a little slower and you will go to 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.770
 energy how long it takes to load the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.649
 battery was left in a plug 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.960
 normal of your house about six hours 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.820
 the full charge but in europe and 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.140
 places with loaders forward but not 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.179
 think that if you go to your house inside the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.399
 night but there are fast chargers that 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.590
 you can buy it and it's probably going to 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.009
 be installed the shopping 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.319
 in europe they are already installed in the house 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.690
 on the street that those boots in average 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.280
 hour they charge you 80's battery but 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.960
 good is a magazine and say more 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.310
 sophisticated and obviously the battery 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.789
 is ready for which is the burden is to 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.679
 every time exactly is a good 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.200
 question has eight years of guarantee the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.090
 battery or 160,000 kilometers because here 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.440
 the important thing is the mechanics is quite 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.299
 simpler I tell you that the engines 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.000
 gasoline and gels is much simpler the 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.110
 mechanical the great against for now and for 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.940
 this moment 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.890
 the price are still more expensive than the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.300
 common but eventually self 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.700
 it is surely a technology that is going 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.050
 as always it's going to be cheaper and it's 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.030
 a good solution because also not 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.890
 pollute nothing then it really is 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.930
 one we see it as the gene here how many 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.200
 years we are missing to see more or less what 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.510
 which is fine or well to europe look no 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.490
 I think so many but it has to do with 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.050
 the policies of governments because in 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.510
 Europe and other countries there is exemption 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.200
 tax for ecological cars 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.840
 they bless you come back so that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.250
 at least for this year that they take you 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.750
 a tax 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.750
 it's easier to come back 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.490
 thanks we continue
