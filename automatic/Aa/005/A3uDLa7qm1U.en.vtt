00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.450 

so<00:00:02.520> here's<00:00:03.090> another<00:00:03.360> limit<00:00:03.870> problem<00:00:04.460> again

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
so here's another limit problem again

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.639 
so here's another limit problem again
the<00:00:06.210> first<00:00:06.450> thing<00:00:06.660> I'm<00:00:06.839> going<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.020> try<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.379> do

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
the first thing I'm going to try to do

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.280 
the first thing I'm going to try to do
is<00:00:07.950> plug<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.790> H<00:00:08.970> equals<00:00:09.540> zero<00:00:09.840> into<00:00:10.080> this

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
is plug in H equals zero into this

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.370 
is plug in H equals zero into this
problem<00:00:10.590> if<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.730> plug<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.179> H<00:00:12.420> equals<00:00:12.840> zero

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
problem if I plug in H equals zero

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.070 
problem if I plug in H equals zero
you<00:00:13.530> notice<00:00:13.799> I'll<00:00:13.920> get<00:00:14.130> three<00:00:14.549> plus<00:00:14.730> zero<00:00:15.080> so

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
you notice I'll get three plus zero so

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.740 
you notice I'll get three plus zero so
I'll<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.320> three<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.800> negative<00:00:16.890> first

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
I'll have three to the negative first

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.870 
I'll have three to the negative first
minus<00:00:18.750> three<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.199> negative<00:00:19.619> first<00:00:19.890> over

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
minus three to the negative first over

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
minus three to the negative first over
zero<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.740> again<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.890> turns<00:00:23.250> into<00:00:23.490> zero<00:00:24.269> over

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
zero and again this turns into zero over

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.290 
zero and again this turns into zero over
zero<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:26.250> we're<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.580> be<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> little<00:00:27.119> more

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
zero so we're going to be a little more

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.380 
zero so we're going to be a little more
clever<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.900> how<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.170> do<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:29.060> now<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.090> see

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
clever on how we do this one now I see

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.240 
clever on how we do this one now I see
these<00:00:30.599> negative<00:00:31.050> exponents<00:00:31.740> floating<00:00:32.130> around

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
these negative exponents floating around

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.670 
these negative exponents floating around
and<00:00:32.820> remember<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.809> can<00:00:33.930> make<00:00:34.110> negative

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
and remember you can make negative

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.889 
and remember you can make negative
exponents<00:00:35.250> positive<00:00:35.280> by<00:00:36.059> putting<00:00:36.630> them<00:00:36.750> on

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
exponents positive by putting them on

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.139 
exponents positive by putting them on
the<00:00:37.050> other<00:00:37.140> side<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.680> fraction<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.850> here

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the other side of the fraction but here

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.180 
the other side of the fraction but here
we<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.660> real<00:00:39.899> careful<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:40.800> if

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
we have to be real careful because if

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.310 
we have to be real careful because if
things<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:42.030> separated<00:00:42.600> by<00:00:42.750> pluses<00:00:43.079> or

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
things are separated by pluses or

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.770 
things are separated by pluses or
minuses<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:44.640> can't<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.180> move<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
minuses you can't just move it to the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.389 
minuses you can't just move it to the
bottom<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.379> move<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.860> other<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
bottom and move this other one to the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.840 
bottom and move this other one to the
bottom<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.300> algebraically<00:00:49.140> correct

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
bottom that's not algebraically correct

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.850 
bottom that's not algebraically correct
what<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.480> however<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:54.410> I<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.739> think

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
what I can do however is I can think

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.229 
what I can do however is I can think
about<00:00:56.160> 3<00:00:56.879> plus<00:00:57.149> h<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.309> negative<00:00:59.760> 1<00:00:59.969> as

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
about 3 plus h to the negative 1 as

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
about 3 plus h to the negative 1 as
being<00:01:00.750> over<00:01:01.170> 1<00:01:02.719> 3<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> negative<00:01:03.930> 1<00:01:04.470> over<00:01:04.710> 1

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
being over 1 3 to the negative 1 over 1

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.230 
being over 1 3 to the negative 1 over 1
and<00:01:06.110> that's<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.409> being<00:01:07.650> divided<00:01:08.010> by<00:01:08.250> H<00:01:08.520> so

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and that's all being divided by H so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.210 
and that's all being divided by H so
here's<00:01:09.450> my<00:01:09.570> original<00:01:09.990> H<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.770> hanging<00:01:11.040> out<00:01:11.159> in

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
here's my original H just hanging out in

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.050 
here's my original H just hanging out in
the<00:01:11.340> bottom<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:13.070> now<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.490> move<00:01:14.640> them<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the bottom and now I can move them to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.100 
the bottom and now I can move them to
the<00:01:15.180> bottom<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.810> their<00:01:16.590> respective<00:01:17.490> fractions

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
the bottom of their respective fractions

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.950 
the bottom of their respective fractions
so<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> limit<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.710> H<00:01:19.950> approaches<00:01:20.549> 0<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.180> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
so the limit as H approaches 0 and I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.289 
so the limit as H approaches 0 and I
often<00:01:22.290> seen<00:01:22.500> people<00:01:22.979> leaving<00:01:23.490> off<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.880> limits

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
often seen people leaving off the limits

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.240 
often seen people leaving off the limits
you<00:01:24.509> have<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.439> in<00:01:25.590> there<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.070> it's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
you have to have that in there or it's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.649 
you have to have that in there or it's
no<00:01:26.460> longer<00:01:26.780> equal<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.960> what<00:01:28.350> we're<00:01:28.500> writing<00:01:29.659> so

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
no longer equal to what we're writing so

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.569 
no longer equal to what we're writing so
I'll<00:01:30.810> move<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.710> denominator

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
I'll move this one to the denominator

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.840 
I'll move this one to the denominator
so<00:01:33.420> I'm<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.600> moving<00:01:33.780> him<00:01:34.049> down<00:01:34.290> here<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.729> it

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so I'm just moving him down here so it

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.969 
so I'm just moving him down here so it
will<00:01:35.939> become<00:01:36.030> 3<00:01:36.420> +<00:01:36.630> H<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.079> positive<00:01:37.740> first

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
will become 3 + H to the positive first

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.410 
will become 3 + H to the positive first
so<00:01:38.610> I'm<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.150> rid<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
so I'm just going to get rid of the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.819 
so I'm just going to get rid of the
parentheses<00:01:40.430> minus<00:01:41.430> 1<00:01:41.909> over<00:01:42.090> 3<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.290> again

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
parentheses minus 1 over 3 and again

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.289 
parentheses minus 1 over 3 and again
that's<00:01:44.159> still<00:01:44.399> all<00:01:44.610> being<00:01:45.000> divided<00:01:45.360> by<00:01:45.630> H<00:01:47.299> ok

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that's still all being divided by H ok

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.630 
that's still all being divided by H ok
so<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> couple<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:49.860> fractions<00:01:50.399> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
so here I see a couple of fractions a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.340 
so here I see a couple of fractions a
lot<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.000> times<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> fraction<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.170> good

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
lot of times with a fraction a good

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.460 
lot of times with a fraction a good
trick<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.829> get<00:01:53.100> common<00:01:53.610> denominators<00:01:54.470> so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
trick is to get common denominators so

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.720 
trick is to get common denominators so
if<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.920> get<00:01:55.979> common<00:01:56.579> denominators

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
if I get common denominators

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.969 
if I get common denominators
well<00:01:59.730> there's<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.000> 3<00:02:00.240> +<00:02:00.479> H<00:02:00.690> here<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.620> 3<00:02:01.860> here

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
well there's a 3 + H here and a 3 here

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.940 
well there's a 3 + H here and a 3 here
I'll<00:02:02.520> multiply<00:02:03.330> top<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:03.990> bottom<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.740> one

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
I'll multiply top and bottom of this one

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.660 
I'll multiply top and bottom of this one
by<00:02:05.070> 3<00:02:05.690> so<00:02:06.690> I'll<00:02:06.810> get<00:02:06.960> 3<00:02:07.350> over<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.130> I'm<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.459> even

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
by 3 so I'll get 3 over and I'm not even

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.640 
by 3 so I'll get 3 over and I'm not even
going<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.820> multiply<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.360> out<00:02:11.690> -<00:02:12.690> now<00:02:13.350> there's<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
going to multiply it out - now there's a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.400 
going to multiply it out - now there's a
3<00:02:13.920> +<00:02:14.160> H<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.910> I'll<00:02:15.090> multiply<00:02:15.630> top<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.170> bottom

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
3 + H here I'll multiply top and bottom

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:25.670 
3 + H here I'll multiply top and bottom
by<00:02:16.830> 3<00:02:17.100> +<00:02:18.060> H<00:02:20.300> over<00:02:21.300> 3<00:02:21.330> times<00:02:21.930> 3<00:02:22.740> +<00:02:23.040> H<00:02:24.470> again<00:02:25.470> my

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
by 3 + H over 3 times 3 + H again my

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.810 
by 3 + H over 3 times 3 + H again my
divided<00:02:26.430> by<00:02:26.580> H<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.870> still<00:02:28.200> hanging<00:02:28.530> out<00:02:28.650> there

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
divided by H is still hanging out there

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.300 
divided by H is still hanging out there
nothing's<00:02:29.820> happened<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.240> him<00:02:30.420> yet

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
nothing's happened to him yet

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.250 
nothing's happened to him yet
and<00:02:34.100> now<00:02:35.100> ok<00:02:35.760> we've<00:02:35.970> got<00:02:36.000> common<00:02:36.600> denominators

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
and now ok we've got common denominators

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.290 
and now ok we've got common denominators
in<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.590> numerator<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:41.220> again<00:02:41.430> here's<00:02:41.700> my<00:02:41.850> big

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
in the numerator so again here's my big

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.590 
in the numerator so again here's my big
/<00:02:42.810> H<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.620> bottom<00:02:43.700> I've<00:02:44.700> got<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.120> common

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
/ H on the bottom I've got this common

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.009 
/ H on the bottom I've got this common
dumped<00:02:45.900> denominator<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.980> 3<00:02:47.250> times<00:02:47.580> 3<00:02:48.270> +<00:02:48.510> H<00:02:49.489> and

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
dumped denominator of 3 times 3 + H and

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.050 
dumped denominator of 3 times 3 + H and
I'll<00:02:52.019> just<00:02:52.290> simplify<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.830> numerator<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.670> this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
I'll just simplify the numerator of this

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.890 
I'll just simplify the numerator of this
fraction<00:02:55.070> ok<00:02:56.070> and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.690 

recall<00:02:59.860> that<00:02:59.890> I'm<00:03:00.159> going<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.370> have<00:03:00.549> to

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
recall that I'm going to have to

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.729 
recall that I'm going to have to
distribute<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.330> negative<00:03:01.360> sign<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.349> three

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
distribute the negative sign so three

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.280 
distribute the negative sign so three
minus<00:03:02.920> three<00:03:03.159> will<00:03:03.640> be<00:03:03.760> zero<00:03:04.150> but<00:03:04.989> then<00:03:05.170> I'll

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
minus three will be zero but then I'll

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.470 
minus three will be zero but then I'll
pick<00:03:05.470> up<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.769> negative<00:03:06.340> H<00:03:06.519> term<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:07.299> the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
pick up a negative H term in the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.470 
pick up a negative H term in the
numerator<00:03:08.700> okay<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:09.879> I'm<00:03:10.060> getting<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.360> little

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
numerator okay so I'm getting a little

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.100 
numerator okay so I'm getting a little
closer

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
closer

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.259 
closer
I<00:03:11.260> still<00:03:11.560> can't<00:03:11.769> substitute<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.580> H<00:03:12.849> equals

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
I still can't substitute in H equals

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.850 
I still can't substitute in H equals
zero<00:03:13.569> though<00:03:13.810> because<00:03:14.200> I'm<00:03:14.379> still<00:03:14.650> going<00:03:14.830> to

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
zero though because I'm still going to

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.089 
zero though because I'm still going to
be<00:03:15.010> dividing<00:03:15.519> by<00:03:15.549> zero<00:03:16.319> we<00:03:17.319> can<00:03:17.500> think<00:03:17.620> about<00:03:17.920> H

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
be dividing by zero we can think about H

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.020 
be dividing by zero we can think about H
though<00:03:18.519> as<00:03:18.730> being<00:03:18.970> H<00:03:19.209> over<00:03:19.599> one<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:21.000> now<00:03:22.000> I

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
though as being H over one and now I

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.770 
though as being H over one and now I
have<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.299> fraction<00:03:22.989> divided<00:03:23.860> by<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.159> fraction<00:03:24.780> so

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
have a fraction divided by a fraction so

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.600 
have a fraction divided by a fraction so
to<00:03:25.870> simplify<00:03:26.319> this<00:03:26.530> down<00:03:26.739> I'm<00:03:27.220> just<00:03:27.280> going<00:03:27.549> to

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
to simplify this down I'm just going to

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.289 
to simplify this down I'm just going to
flip<00:03:27.940> my<00:03:28.150> bottom<00:03:28.690> fraction<00:03:28.930> over<00:03:30.180> I'm<00:03:31.180> going

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
flip my bottom fraction over I'm going

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.030 
flip my bottom fraction over I'm going
to<00:03:31.359> flip<00:03:31.629> the<00:03:31.780> bottom<00:03:32.079> fraction<00:03:32.290> over<00:03:32.680> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
to flip the bottom fraction over and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:42.070 
to flip the bottom fraction over and
multiply<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:37.120> let's<00:03:37.329> see<00:03:37.540> here

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.460 

so<00:03:43.080> now<00:03:43.230> we<00:03:43.290> have<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.650> limit<00:03:43.860> as<00:03:44.780> H<00:03:45.780> approaches

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
so now we have the limit as H approaches

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.870 
so now we have the limit as H approaches
zero<00:03:46.860> I've<00:03:47.700> got<00:03:48.270> negative<00:03:48.510> H<00:03:48.930> over<00:03:49.650> 3<00:03:49.680> times<00:03:50.250> 3

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
zero I've got negative H over 3 times 3

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.300 
zero I've got negative H over 3 times 3
plus<00:03:51.150> H<00:03:51.390> in<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.840> numerator<00:03:52.290> I'm<00:03:53.070> going<00:03:53.220> to

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
plus H in the numerator I'm going to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.240 
plus H in the numerator I'm going to
flip<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:53.790> multiply<00:03:53.910> by<00:03:54.480> 1<00:03:54.930> over<00:03:54.960> H<00:03:55.440> again<00:03:55.890> I'm

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
flip and multiply by 1 over H again I'm

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.340 
flip and multiply by 1 over H again I'm
flipping<00:03:56.760> this<00:03:56.880> part<00:03:57.770> the<00:03:58.770> H<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.280> now<00:03:59.490> canceled

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.660 

so<00:04:04.350> I'm<00:04:04.440> going<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.650> simplify<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.190> I've<00:04:05.430> got<00:04:05.640> a

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
so I'm going to simplify it I've got a

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.550 
so I'm going to simplify it I've got a
negative<00:04:06.000> 1<00:04:06.690> on<00:04:06.870> top<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.700> have<00:04:08.700> 3<00:04:09.330> times<00:04:09.360> 3<00:04:10.320> plus

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
negative 1 on top I have 3 times 3 plus

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.020 
negative 1 on top I have 3 times 3 plus
h<00:04:10.800> in<00:04:11.070> the<00:04:11.310> bottom<00:04:12.050> and<00:04:13.050> now<00:04:13.800> again<00:04:14.310> I've<00:04:14.670> done

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
h in the bottom and now again I've done

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.729 
h in the bottom and now again I've done
some<00:04:15.240> algebra<00:04:15.750> I'm<00:04:15.930> going<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.170> go<00:04:16.290> back<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.620> my

some algebra I'm going to go back to my

some algebra I'm going to go back to my
plug<00:04:17.040> and<00:04:17.250> chug<00:04:17.400> method<00:04:17.880> if<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.720> substitute<00:04:19.019> in

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
plug and chug method if I substitute in

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.880 
plug and chug method if I substitute in
H<00:04:19.830> equals<00:04:20.310> zero<00:04:20.660> notice<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.840> this<00:04:21.959> case<00:04:22.019> I'm<00:04:22.530> no

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
H equals zero notice in this case I'm no

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.410 
H equals zero notice in this case I'm no
longer<00:04:23.720> dividing<00:04:24.720> by<00:04:24.870> zero<00:04:25.830> I<00:04:26.130> end<00:04:27.090> up<00:04:27.240> getting

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
longer dividing by zero I end up getting

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.630 
longer dividing by zero I end up getting
negative<00:04:28.260> 1<00:04:28.680> over<00:04:28.950> 9<00:04:29.940> when<00:04:30.390> I<00:04:30.420> simplify<00:04:30.720> and

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
negative 1 over 9 when I simplify and

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.390 
negative 1 over 9 when I simplify and
again<00:04:32.640> that's<00:04:33.060> my<00:04:33.300> solution<00:04:34.100> so<00:04:35.100> a<00:04:35.130> lot<00:04:35.370> of

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
again that's my solution so a lot of

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.010 
again that's my solution so a lot of
