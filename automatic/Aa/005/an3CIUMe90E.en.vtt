ups<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.529> map<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.010> as<00:00:26.910> far<00:00:27.090> as<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.390> know

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
ups on this map and as far as I know

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.410 
ups on this map and as far as I know
this<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.230> works<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.529> all<00:00:28.769> consoles<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:30.330> I

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
this one works on all consoles but I

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.540 
this one works on all consoles but I
believe<00:00:30.720> there<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.080> way<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.160> map<00:00:32.369> on

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
believe there is a way out of the map on

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.310 
believe there is a way out of the map on
shoulder<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.149> next-gen<00:00:33.719> consoles<00:00:34.170> as<00:00:34.290> well

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
shoulder on next-gen consoles as well

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.440 
shoulder on next-gen consoles as well
I'm<00:00:35.040> pretty<00:00:35.430> sure<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.700> can<00:00:35.820> still<00:00:36.030> get<00:00:36.239> into

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
I'm pretty sure you can still get into

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.979 
I'm pretty sure you can still get into
this<00:00:36.719> spot<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.820> get<00:00:39.570> all<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.809> map<00:00:39.960> just

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
this spot so get all the map just

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.200 
this spot so get all the map just
however<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:41.430> doesn't<00:00:41.579> really<00:00:41.790> matter<00:00:42.000> which

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
however it doesn't really matter which

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.959 
however it doesn't really matter which
way<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.160> this<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.489> how<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.760> it

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
way you do it this is just how I do it

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.690 
way you do it this is just how I do it
on<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> old<00:00:45.480> gen<00:00:45.750> consoles<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.559> simply<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.520> do

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
on the old gen consoles I simply just do

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.880 
on the old gen consoles I simply just do
a<00:00:47.730> run<00:00:48.030> jump<00:00:48.360> onto<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.960> sledge<00:00:49.200> match<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
a run jump onto the sledge match the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.479 
a run jump onto the sledge match the
jump<00:00:50.160> button<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.809> I<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.590> basically<00:00:52.770> if<00:00:53.309> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
jump button and I just basically if you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.389 
jump button and I just basically if you
get<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.789> right<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.780> will<00:00:54.989> bounce<00:00:55.800> off<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
get it right you will bounce off of that

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.369 
get it right you will bounce off of that
ledge<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.120> then<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.809> move<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
ledge and then you just have to move to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.349 
ledge and then you just have to move to
the<00:00:58.410> right<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:59.010> land<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.090> ledge<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the right and land on this ledge and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.420 
the right and land on this ledge and
then<00:01:00.690> jump<00:01:00.960> back<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> left<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> land<00:01:02.250> on

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
then jump back to the left and land on

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.329 
then jump back to the left and land on
this<00:01:02.579> high<00:01:02.730> barrier<00:01:03.680> so<00:01:04.680> anyways<00:01:04.920> once<00:01:05.220> you're

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
this high barrier so anyways once you're

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.130 
this high barrier so anyways once you're
up<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.970> jump<00:01:06.299> over<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.900> water

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
up here just jump over to this water

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.149 
up here just jump over to this water
tower<00:01:07.500> type<00:01:07.920> thing<00:01:08.250> over<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:10.159> there's

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
tower type thing over here and there's

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.289 
tower type thing over here and there's
one<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.430> spot<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.210> just

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
one little spot right here you can just

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
one little spot right here you can just
drop<00:01:12.479> straight<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> map<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.939> just

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
drop straight out of the map and just

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.120 
drop straight out of the map and just
follow<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> path<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.780> take<00:01:16.020> right<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
follow the path I take right here you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
follow the path I take right here you
can't<00:01:17.430> actually<00:01:17.670> go<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> sand<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.570> make

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
can't actually go on the sand so make

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
can't actually go on the sand so make
sure<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.290> jump<00:01:19.650> over<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.790> land

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
sure you do jump over it and just land

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.749 
sure you do jump over it and just land
right<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.780> simply<00:01:22.470> go<00:01:22.650> prone<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.280> crawl

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
right here and simply go prone and crawl

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.210 
right here and simply go prone and crawl
straight<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.810> I'll<00:01:25.470> speed<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.100> video

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
straight in here I'll speed up the video

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.270 
straight in here I'll speed up the video
a<00:01:26.400> bit<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> you'll<00:01:28.560> see<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.860> second<00:01:29.159> all

if they shoot you or they see you at all
I'm<00:01:41.520> pretty<00:01:42.329> sure<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> explosive<00:01:43.350> tracking

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
I'm pretty sure the explosive tracking

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.490 
I'm pretty sure the explosive tracking
drone<00:01:44.159> guys<00:01:44.399> will<00:01:44.880> explode<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.720> hurt<00:01:46.350> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
drone guys will explode and hurt you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.740 
drone guys will explode and hurt you
though<00:01:46.710> but<00:01:47.460> it's<00:01:47.640> not<00:01:47.850> really<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> big<00:01:48.509> deal

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
though but it's not really a big deal

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.929 
though but it's not really a big deal
you<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.290> back<00:01:49.439> up<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.950> go<00:01:50.549> somewhere

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
you can just back up and go somewhere

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.840 
you can just back up and go somewhere
else<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> hide<00:01:51.540> away<00:01:51.720> from<00:01:52.079> them<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.729> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
else and hide away from them so it's a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.209
