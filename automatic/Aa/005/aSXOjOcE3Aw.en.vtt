that game we won 12 games we're doing
something<00:01:31.840> right<00:01:31.990> around<00:01:32.109> here<00:01:32.319> so<00:01:32.499> we'll

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
something right around here so we'll

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.989 
something right around here so we'll
continue<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:33.069> play<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.579> way<00:01:33.670> in<00:01:33.789> which<00:01:33.880> we

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
continue to play the way in which we

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:35.699 
continue to play the way in which we
know<00:01:34.090> how<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.450> it<00:01:34.659> seems<00:01:34.899> to<00:01:34.990> be<00:01:35.109> a<00:01:35.139> recipe<00:01:35.590> for

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
know how and it seems to be a recipe for

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:36.089 
know how and it seems to be a recipe for
success

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
success

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:37.529 
success
well<00:01:36.399> I<00:01:36.429> just<00:01:36.670> think<00:01:36.880> we<00:01:36.999> need<00:01:37.119> to<00:01:37.209> be<00:01:37.299> playing

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
well I just think we need to be playing

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.569 
well I just think we need to be playing
a<00:01:37.630> certain<00:01:37.899> way<00:01:38.049> down<00:01:39.039> the<00:01:39.159> stretch<00:01:39.369> if<00:01:39.490> we

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
a certain way down the stretch if we

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:40.949 
a certain way down the stretch if we
look<00:01:39.729> at<00:01:39.849> last<00:01:39.969> season<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.479> way<00:01:40.599> we<00:01:40.719> kind<00:01:40.899> of

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
look at last season the way we kind of

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.379 
look at last season the way we kind of

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
yards per carry so that's not surprising

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.350 
yards per carry so that's not surprising
what<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.890> surprising<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.700> Sunday<00:02:40.239> we

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
what is surprising is that Sunday we
