00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
your hands just because it's a little

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.640 
your hands just because it's a little
easier<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.880> spread<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:27.350> just<00:01:28.350> make<00:01:28.470> sure

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
easier to spread this out just make sure

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.100 
easier to spread this out just make sure
every<00:01:29.220> piece<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.790> tortilla<00:01:30.150> has<00:01:30.659> some<00:01:30.930> beans

and<00:01:36.770> if<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:37.250> have<00:01:37.430> the<00:01:37.610> chance<00:01:37.850> it's<00:01:38.090> always<00:01:38.330> a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
and if you have the chance it's always a

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.090 
and if you have the chance it's always a
good<00:01:38.570> idea<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:39.020> make<00:01:39.200> your<00:01:39.350> beans<00:01:39.560> yourself

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
when it's ok to use a canned product try

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.130 
when it's ok to use a canned product try
to<00:01:43.520> keep<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.850> sodium<00:01:44.180> level<00:01:44.479> down<00:01:44.630> on<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:44.960> fat

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
to keep the sodium level down on the fat

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.300 
to keep the sodium level down on the fat
level<00:01:45.470> down<00:01:47.410> now<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:48.620> I've<00:01:48.710> added<00:01:48.830> my<00:01:49.100> beans

level down now that I've added my beans
I'm<00:01:49.610> gonna<00:01:49.850> go<00:01:50.030> ahead<00:01:50.120> and<00:01:50.270> add<00:01:50.570> some<00:01:50.710> already
