you can see as soon as you put it the 2

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.390 
you can see as soon as you put it the 2
flashes<00:01:35.189> connect<00:01:35.759> together<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.040> turn

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
flashes connect together so if we turn

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
flashes connect together so if we turn
the<00:01:41.759> camera<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:44.340> take<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> picture<00:01:45.180> with

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the camera on and we take a picture with

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.359 
the camera on and we take a picture with
it<00:01:45.689> then<00:01:46.229> you're<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> see<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.100> both

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
it then you're going to see that both

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
it then you're going to see that both
flashes<00:01:48.030> should<00:01:48.990> be<00:01:49.140> firing<00:01:49.470> off<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:51.259> that's

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
flashes should be firing off and that's

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.149 
flashes should be firing off and that's
going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.590> be<00:01:52.710> basically<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.860> ETTL<00:01:55.860> modes

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
going to be basically in the ETTL modes

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.649 
going to be basically in the ETTL modes
so<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.060> true<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.450> lens

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
so it's going to be true the lens

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.200 
so it's going to be true the lens
metering<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:59.159> flash<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.670> going<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> try<00:02:00.149> to

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
metering and a flash is going to try to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.190 
metering and a flash is going to try to
flash<00:02:00.960> everything<00:02:01.320> correctly<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.810> another

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
flash everything correctly so another

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.240 
flash everything correctly so another
thing<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:05.040> afterwards<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:07.250> you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
thing you can do afterwards is if you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
put the master one-eighth of the power

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.250 
put the master one-eighth of the power
of<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.850> slave<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.540> that's<00:02:38.750> how<00:02:38.900> you're<00:02:39.110> going

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
of the slave so that's how you're going

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.430 
of the slave so that's how you're going
to<00:02:39.320> adjust<00:02:39.770> your<00:02:40.760> ratios<00:02:41.300> from<00:02:41.570> one<00:02:41.870> flash<00:02:42.200> to

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
to adjust your ratios from one flash to

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.460 
to adjust your ratios from one flash to
the<00:02:42.470> other<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:44.300> have<00:02:44.480> different<00:02:44.989> modes<00:02:45.230> that

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
the other you have different modes that

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.390 
the other you have different modes that
you<00:02:45.620> can<00:02:45.950> put<00:02:46.310> it<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.080> have<00:02:48.170> et<00:02:48.650> al<00:02:49.190> you

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
you can put it in so you have et al you

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.500 
you can put it in so you have et al you
can<00:02:49.610> put<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:49.940> on<00:02:50.060> manual<00:02:50.739> in<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:52.850> case<00:02:53.120> if<00:02:53.360> you

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
can put it on manual in that case if you

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.740 
can put it on manual in that case if you
go<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.750> group<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.950> go<00:02:55.160> here<00:02:55.700> then<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.570> can

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
go to group you go here then you can

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.390 
go to group you go here then you can
adjust<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:57.380> can<00:02:57.560> put<00:02:57.800> this<00:02:58.070> flash<00:02:58.489> on<00:03:00.400> 1/32

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
adjust you can put this flash on 1/32

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.160 
adjust you can put this flash on 1/32
power<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.150> then<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:03.140> last<00:03:03.500> year<00:03:03.920> on<00:03:05.170> 116

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
power and then this last year on 116

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.479 
power and then this last year on 116
power<00:03:06.410> let's<00:03:06.800> say<00:03:07.010> and<00:03:08.950> that's<00:03:09.950> how<00:03:10.190> that's

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
power let's say and that's how that's

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.840 
power let's say and that's how that's
going<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.760> work<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:12.400> then<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.610> way<00:03:13.820> that

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
going to work and then the way that

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.880 
going to work and then the way that
you're<00:03:14.300> going<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.630> change<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.260> group<00:03:15.560> is

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
you're going to change the group is

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.680 
you're going to change the group is
you're<00:03:16.250> going<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.489> go<00:03:16.610> on<00:03:16.640> this<00:03:17.090> slash<00:03:17.420> and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
you're going to go on this slash and

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.350 
you're going to go on this slash and
you're<00:03:17.810> going<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.080> press<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.320> menu<00:03:18.769> until

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
you're going to press that menu until

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.360 
you're going to press that menu until
you<00:03:20.360> get<00:03:20.540> there<00:03:20.810> group<00:03:21.140> setting<00:03:21.739> on<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.100> slave

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
you get there group setting on the slave

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.180 
you get there group setting on the slave
flash<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.200> then<00:03:24.200> when<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.500> press<00:03:24.650> group<00:03:24.980> you

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
flash and then when you press group you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.530 
flash and then when you press group you
can<00:03:25.370> set<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:25.790> up<00:03:25.910> as<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.540> b<00:03:26.930> c<00:03:27.260> d<00:03:27.290> or<00:03:27.920> e<00:03:28.459> so<00:03:28.670> if<00:03:29.420> you

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
can set it up as a b c d or e so if you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.610 
can set it up as a b c d or e so if you
put<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:29.989> in<00:03:30.260> mode<00:03:31.130> b<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.810> we<00:03:32.810> put<00:03:33.049> this<00:03:33.200> one<00:03:33.260> in

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
put it in mode b and we put this one in

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.590 
put it in mode b and we put this one in
mode<00:03:33.830> eight<00:03:34.130> then<00:03:34.549> you<00:03:34.970> can<00:03:35.150> adjust<00:03:35.480> the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
mode eight then you can adjust the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.400 
mode eight then you can adjust the
ratios<00:03:35.989> from<00:03:36.260> Group<00:03:36.620> A<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:36.860> Group<00:03:37.130> B<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:39.140> if<00:03:39.260> I

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
ratios from Group A and Group B so if I

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.470 
ratios from Group A and Group B so if I
see<00:03:39.650> some<00:03:39.860> interest<00:03:40.310> in<00:03:40.489> these<00:03:40.760> videos<00:03:41.150> I'll
