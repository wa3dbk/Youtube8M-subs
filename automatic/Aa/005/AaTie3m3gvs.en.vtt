00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.420
 The counter is hot. 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.170
 logic the subject the story of the little 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:18.449
 June 30 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:20.850
 palms for at least I have to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.550
 back to you today's story that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.930
 the story of a boy who lived in 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.410
 planet 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.980
 Yes, the boy who lived at the time 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.300
 very very very far away was very 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.579
 small is such a small planet 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.739
 he could see the sunset how many times 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:55.739
 You want to get a little bit of side 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:58.590
 new and so watched the color of the sun more 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.910
 40 times between the boy who is 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.469
 known as small I thought that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.920
 nobody knows how right ex 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.320
 guerrilla actually has a drawing 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.650
 so weird and I think he 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.320
 it was more or less like the planet that 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.390
 little Prince William who is very 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.580
 very small as I already told you 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.900
 he had daily tasks for example 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.369
 every day 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.340
 he had to solve his 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.170
 competitors 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.590
 had to remove the weeds and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.810
 He had to be careful too carefully. 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:38.780
 to see if any had not been born 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.780
 bomb without knowing that I'm going there 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.509
 I loved very much a very vague ray. 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.439
 little and small planet as a planet 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:53.670
 little prince a dollar had a 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:56.549
 tragedy, because there was a great 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.090
 began to remove the waters of the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.030
 line knows he realized he realized 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.579
 a bud of a tapir that he does not 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:13.620
 I knew it 's not the line anymore. 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:19.489
 nor the good thing was that cogita I do not know 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:23.610
 It took many days to blossom was 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:26.519
 Beautiful, she was so beautiful. 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:32.040
 I want more beautiful than he had ever seen 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:34.680
 in all he cared for her every day 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.060
 very well but she had to be beautiful 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.400
 she had to fucking want one for 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.269
 within the day because seeing more and more 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.010
 do it 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.680
 she also wanted a glass vial 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.670
 during the night because some animal 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.350
 Wild could attack a small 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.220
 prince who care as much that way to 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:59.180
 old woman had one day he got tired 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:04.890
 tired and decided to take a long trip 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.620
 took the trails of the néné and was 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.450
 way no one knows how well 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.739
 taking a ride as well as a group of 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.250
 wild birds 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:18.600
 he traveled planet to planet of 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.450
 constellation of lyra and the best of everything 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:27.389
 was important on the planet he cited 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:30.150
 if you know the land was where the 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:34.049
 land our planet and here on earth 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.829

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.370
 their 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:44.390
 fox taught the most important lesson 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:47.930
 of your own you do not know 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:56.900

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:58.880
