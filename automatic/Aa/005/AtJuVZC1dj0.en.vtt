00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
bed that furnace / out up up up and you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.380 
bed that furnace / out up up up and you
know<00:02:25.610> I<00:02:26.320> suppose<00:02:27.320> your<00:02:27.470> deal<00:02:27.650> like<00:02:27.830> that<00:02:28.390> you

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
know I suppose your deal like that you

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.370 
know I suppose your deal like that you
could<00:02:29.540> do<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:31.630> I'm<00:02:32.630> puffing<00:02:32.810> like<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.440> like

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
could do this I'm puffing like that like

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.470 
could do this I'm puffing like that like
you<00:02:36.380> probably<00:02:36.530> do<00:02:36.740> like<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.070> either<00:02:37.480> that

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
you probably do like that either that

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.150 
you probably do like that either that
too<00:02:38.750> they'll<00:02:39.080> probably<00:02:39.320> make<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.740> little<00:02:40.040> more

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
too they'll probably make a little more

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.150 
too they'll probably make a little more
sense<00:02:40.430> because<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:42.260> kind<00:02:42.860> of<00:02:42.950> just<00:02:43.130> like

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
sense because that kind of just like

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.180 
sense because that kind of just like
float<00:02:43.490> in<00:02:43.640> there<00:02:43.760> but<00:02:44.680> actually<00:02:45.680> no<00:02:45.830> you<00:02:45.890> can't

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
float in there but actually no you can't

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.630 
float in there but actually no you can't
do<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.490> that<00:02:46.640> because<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.630> wouldn't<00:02:47.959> work

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
do like that because it wouldn't work

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.860 
do like that because it wouldn't work
well<00:02:49.640> I'm<00:02:49.850> an<00:02:50.030> idiot<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.450> don't<00:02:50.630> know<00:02:50.720> why

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870
