it's just an eggshell so I'm just going
to<00:00:34.670> show<00:00:34.910> now<00:00:35.750> how<00:00:35.900> you<00:00:35.960> can<00:00:36.200> extract<00:00:36.500> this<00:00:36.710> egg

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
to show now how you can extract this egg

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.600 
to show now how you can extract this egg
out<00:00:37.180> without<00:00:38.180> breaking<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:38.660> action<00:00:38.960> okay<00:00:39.800> so

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
out without breaking the action okay so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.990 
out without breaking the action okay so
this<00:00:40.760> is<00:00:40.970> our<00:00:41.260> actual<00:00:42.260> egg<00:00:42.530> which<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:43.250> which<00:00:43.970> is

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
this is our actual egg which is which is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.230 
this is our actual egg which is which is
villian<00:00:44.420> again<00:00:44.660> I<00:00:44.870> break<00:00:45.290> it<00:00:45.380> if<00:00:45.500> crack<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.240> all

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
villian again I break it if crack so all

00:00:47.240 --> 00:01:19.370 
villian again I break it if crack so all
we<00:00:47.600> need<00:00:47.810> is<00:00:47.990> a<00:01:09.610> little<00:01:10.610> bigger

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.320 

yeah<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:21.189> this<00:01:21.490> size<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:23.380> should<00:01:23.560> do<00:01:24.030> okay

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
yeah of this size this should do okay

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.609 
yeah of this size this should do okay
and<00:01:25.900> now<00:01:26.799> exactly<00:01:27.580> on<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.940> opposite<00:01:28.330> side<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
and now exactly on the opposite side the

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.530 
and now exactly on the opposite side the
decide<00:01:30.250> which<00:01:30.490> is<00:01:30.610> like<00:01:30.729> you<00:01:30.909> know<00:01:31.030> much<00:01:31.330> more

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
decide which is like you know much more

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.890 
decide which is like you know much more
smaller<00:01:31.840> here<00:01:32.770> we<00:01:32.920> just<00:01:33.190> poke<00:01:33.399> one

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.830 

and<00:01:38.320> now<00:01:38.620> comes<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:39.940> part<00:01:40.180> which<00:01:40.420> people

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
and now comes to the part which people

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.330 
and now comes to the part which people
might<00:01:41.020> find<00:01:41.230> it<00:01:41.410> disgusting<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:42.100> need<00:01:42.250> to

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
might find it disgusting you need to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.940 
might find it disgusting you need to
blow<00:01:42.550> from<00:01:42.730> this<00:01:42.970> small<00:01:43.060> hole<00:01:43.450> so<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:44.560> you

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
blow from this small hole so that you

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.320 
blow from this small hole so that you
know<00:01:45.070> you<00:01:45.280> would<00:01:45.400> extract<00:01:45.820> all<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.060> egg

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
know you would extract all the egg

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.740 
know you would extract all the egg
through<00:01:46.900> this<00:01:47.050> bigger<00:01:47.650> one<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.360> size

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
through this bigger one I think the size

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.930 
through this bigger one I think the size
of<00:01:49.960> this<00:01:50.080> should<00:01:50.350> be<00:01:50.530> enough<00:01:50.770> just<00:01:51.340> making

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
of this should be enough just making

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.800 
of this should be enough just making
sure

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:03.260 

so<00:01:55.810> we<00:01:55.930> go<00:01:56.170> from<00:01:56.350> here<00:02:00.600> keep<00:02:01.600> blowing<00:02:01.900> a<00:02:02.290> little

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
so we go from here keep blowing a little

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.820 
so we go from here keep blowing a little
don't<00:02:04.270> blow<00:02:04.420> it<00:02:04.480> like<00:02:04.660> too<00:02:04.960> hard<00:02:05.230> initially<00:02:05.680> so

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
don't blow it like too hard initially so

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.080 
don't blow it like too hard initially so
that<00:02:05.980> you<00:02:06.160> know<00:02:06.250> you<00:02:06.310> would<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.670> might<00:02:06.820> end<00:02:07.030> up

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
that you know you would you might end up

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.150 
that you know you would you might end up
cracking<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.540> egg<00:02:07.750> so<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.500> need<00:02:08.680> to<00:02:08.800> just<00:02:09.010> be

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
cracking the egg so you need to just be

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:24.660 
cracking the egg so you need to just be
a<00:02:09.190> little<00:02:09.460> careful<00:02:09.580> in<00:02:09.760> that<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:24.550> it's

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:24.980 

you<00:04:10.920> could<00:04:11.070> easily<00:04:11.250> cover<00:04:11.640> it

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:36.550 

there<00:04:25.350> looks<00:04:25.560> disgusting

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:46.219 

you<00:04:37.560> know<00:04:37.969> it<00:04:43.639> does<00:04:44.639> take<00:04:44.849> some<00:04:44.879> time<00:04:45.120> till<00:04:46.080> the

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
you know it does take some time till the
