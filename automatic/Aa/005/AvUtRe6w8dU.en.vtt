every<00:01:49.979> time<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.250> fall<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.540> still<00:01:51.780> get

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
every time you fall so you can still get

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.210 
every time you fall so you can still get
three<00:01:52.049> stars<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.530> fall<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.040> would

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
three stars if you fall but this would

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.940 
three stars if you fall but this would
make<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> lot<00:01:53.610> harder<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:55.020> next<00:01:55.049> penalty<00:01:55.710> is

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
make a lot harder the next penalty is

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.389 
make a lot harder the next penalty is
the<00:01:56.280> mobile<00:01:56.939> hazard<00:01:57.590> penalty<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:59.189> when

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the mobile hazard penalty that's when

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
the mobile hazard penalty that's when
you<00:01:59.490> hit<00:01:59.670> a<00:02:00.030> whole<00:02:00.360> course<00:02:00.659> hazard<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.469> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
you hit a whole course hazard you get a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.100 
you hit a whole course hazard you get a
four<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.860> half<00:02:01.890> second<00:02:02.340> penalty

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
four and a half second penalty

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.460 
four and a half second penalty
at<00:02:03.380> a<00:02:03.680> 50cc<00:02:04.220> level<00:02:04.730> and<00:02:05.510> so<00:02:06.050> you're<00:02:06.230> better<00:02:06.380> off

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
at a 50cc level and so you're better off

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.889 
at a 50cc level and so you're better off
slowing<00:02:07.040> down<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:07.430> try<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.640> them<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.630> next

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
slowing down to try to them the next

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.050 
slowing down to try to them the next
penalty<00:02:09.290> is<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.710> fixed<00:02:10.250> hazard<00:02:10.580> collision

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
penalty is the fixed hazard collision

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.810 
penalty is the fixed hazard collision
and<00:02:11.810> just<00:02:12.050> like<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.860> mobile<00:02:13.070> hazard<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.760> you

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
and just like the mobile hazard a you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.610 
and just like the mobile hazard a you
have<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.390> actually<00:02:14.690> get<00:02:14.870> some<00:02:15.440> type<00:02:15.590> of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
have to actually get some type of

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.010 
have to actually get some type of
reaction<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:16.790> have<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.060> get<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.240> sound<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.930> a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
reaction you have to get a sound and a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.960 
reaction you have to get a sound and a
light<00:02:18.620> flash<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.160> get<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.400> penalty<00:02:19.670> there

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
light flash to get the penalty there

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.460 
light flash to get the penalty there
just<00:02:20.150> not<00:02:20.300> jump<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.570> you<00:02:21.050> won't<00:02:21.230> get<00:02:21.380> the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
just not jump to you won't get the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.890 
just not jump to you won't get the
penalty<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.000> next<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.480> off-road

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
penalty and the next is the off-road

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.440 
penalty and the next is the off-road
penalty<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.620> at<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.490> honorific<00:02:25.820> decedent

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
penalty that at the honorific decedent

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.850 
penalty that at the honorific decedent
sea<00:02:26.600> level<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.200> about<00:02:27.440> two<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:27.710> a<00:02:27.830> half

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
sea level is about two and a half

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.940 
sea level is about two and a half
seconds<00:02:28.340> for<00:02:28.490> every<00:02:28.700> second<00:02:29.030> you're<00:02:29.150> offroad

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
seconds for every second you're offroad

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.320 
seconds for every second you're offroad
so<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.070> main<00:02:31.250> thing<00:02:31.430> about<00:02:31.460> this<00:02:31.790> one<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.120> just

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
so the main thing about this one is just

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.380 
so the main thing about this one is just
try<00:02:32.630> not<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.870> drive<00:02:33.680> off-road<00:02:34.070> too<00:02:34.400> often<00:02:34.850> if

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
try not to drive off-road too often if

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.480 
try not to drive off-road too often if
you<00:02:35.630> go<00:02:35.870> off<00:02:36.020> just<00:02:36.050> for<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.500> little<00:02:37.010> bit<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
you go off just for a little bit the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.890 
you go off just for a little bit the
coming<00:02:37.730> quarters<00:02:38.030> that's<00:02:38.210> okay<00:02:38.510> but<00:02:38.720> they

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
coming quarters that's okay but they

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.740 
coming quarters that's okay but they
send<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.260> driving<00:02:39.710> will<00:02:40.280> cause<00:02:40.490> you<00:02:40.670> lose<00:02:41.510> your

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
send it driving will cause you lose your

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.080 
send it driving will cause you lose your
three<00:02:41.930> start<00:02:42.170> raking<00:02:42.320> but<00:02:43.250> if<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.670> are<00:02:43.850> using

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
three start raking but if you are using

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.800 
three start raking but if you are using
a<00:02:44.570> boost<00:02:45.580> off-road<00:02:49.060> don't<00:02:50.060> get<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.420> penalty

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
a boost off-road don't get the penalty

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.870 
a boost off-road don't get the penalty
so<00:02:51.170> go<00:02:51.350> ahead<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.590> take<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.040> shortcuts<00:02:52.459> if

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
so go ahead and take the shortcuts if

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.020 
so go ahead and take the shortcuts if
you<00:02:53.060> are<00:02:53.150> getting<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.540> first<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.700> last

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
you are getting the first and the last

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.120 
you are getting the first and the last
penalty<00:02:56.360> is<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.720> position<00:02:57.170> penalty<00:02:57.590> I'll

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
penalty is the position penalty I'll

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.949 
penalty is the position penalty I'll
explain<00:02:58.459> this<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.700> little<00:02:58.760> bit<00:02:59.000> more<00:02:59.240> towards

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
explain this a little bit more towards

for a few final thoughts about how to
get<00:04:29.970> 3<00:04:30.180> stars<00:04:30.480> on<00:04:30.690> Mario<00:04:30.930> Kart<00:04:31.170> Wii<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:32.370> thing

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
get 3 stars on Mario Kart Wii the thing

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.520 
get 3 stars on Mario Kart Wii the thing
to<00:04:32.760> know<00:04:33.090> is<00:04:33.300> all<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.690> modes<00:04:33.870> work<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.290> same

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
to know is all the modes work the same

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.680 
to know is all the modes work the same
way<00:04:34.560> they<00:04:35.220> all<00:04:35.340> have<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.610> same<00:04:35.760> penalties<00:04:36.330> and

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
way they all have the same penalties and

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.990 
way they all have the same penalties and
they<00:04:36.870> all<00:04:36.990> have<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.260> same<00:04:37.290> bonuses<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:38.580> times

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
they all have the same bonuses the times

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.300 
they all have the same bonuses the times
might<00:04:39.240> change<00:04:39.480> slightly<00:04:39.660> but<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.950> works<00:04:41.190> the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
might change slightly but it works the

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.160 
might change slightly but it works the
same<00:04:41.490> way<00:04:41.670> so<00:04:42.150> main<00:04:42.360> thing<00:04:42.540> to<00:04:42.630> remember<00:04:42.660> is

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
same way so main thing to remember is

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.950 
same way so main thing to remember is
try<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.500> avoid<00:04:44.490> Falls<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.210> collisions<00:04:45.630> slow

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
try to avoid Falls and collisions slow

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.660 
try to avoid Falls and collisions slow
down<00:04:46.140> if<00:04:46.290> you<00:04:46.380> need<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:46.800> is<00:04:46.920> more<00:04:47.250> important

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
down if you need to it is more important

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.340 
down if you need to it is more important
to<00:04:47.760> avoid<00:04:48.390> the<00:04:48.510> collision<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:49.020> slow<00:04:49.170> down<00:04:49.290> a

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
to avoid the collision and slow down a

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.110 
to avoid the collision and slow down a
little<00:04:49.530> than<00:04:49.830> it<00:04:49.950> is<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.310> try<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:50.670> keep<00:04:50.850> full

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120

throttle and run into the mix and the
other<00:04:53.850> thing<00:04:54.000> is<00:04:54.090> if<00:04:54.210> you're<00:04:54.330> going<00:04:54.360> offroad

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
other thing is if you're going offroad

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.750 
other thing is if you're going offroad
just<00:04:55.710> make<00:04:55.950> sure<00:04:56.070> you're<00:04:56.190> going<00:04:56.400> off<00:04:56.490> you<00:04:56.520> know

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
just make sure you're going off you know

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.280 
just make sure you're going off you know
just<00:04:56.790> cutting<00:04:57.180> corners<00:04:57.420> that's<00:04:57.780> okay<00:04:58.050> but<00:04:58.230> if

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
just cutting corners that's okay but if

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.210 
just cutting corners that's okay but if
you're<00:04:58.350> going<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.560> drive<00:04:58.680> off-road<00:04:58.980> for

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
you're going to drive off-road for

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.650 
you're going to drive off-road for
extended<00:04:59.580> period<00:04:59.790> time<00:04:59.820> make<00:05:00.330> sure<00:05:00.360> you<00:05:00.510> got<00:05:00.600> a

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
extended period time make sure you got a

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.840 
extended period time make sure you got a
boost<00:05:00.900> to<00:05:01.170> do<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:02.250> then<00:05:02.340> finally<00:05:02.670> have<00:05:02.820> a

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
boost to do it and then finally have a

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.220 
boost to do it and then finally have a
strategy<00:05:03.360> when<00:05:03.540> you're<00:05:03.630> using<00:05:03.780> your<00:05:03.900> items

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
strategy when you're using your items

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:05.750 
strategy when you're using your items
you<00:05:04.410> know<00:05:04.470> don't<00:05:04.680> just<00:05:04.830> hit<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.130> mushroom<00:05:05.670> and

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
you know don't just hit the mushroom and

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.700 
you know don't just hit the mushroom and
bang<00:05:05.970> into<00:05:06.210> walls<00:05:06.420> and<00:05:06.750> wait<00:05:07.080> for<00:05:07.380> an<00:05:07.440> open

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
bang into walls and wait for an open

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.560 
bang into walls and wait for an open
stretch<00:05:07.950> and<00:05:08.580> be<00:05:08.760> careful<00:05:09.090> about<00:05:09.270> placing

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
stretch and be careful about placing

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.630 
stretch and be careful about placing
your<00:05:09.690> items<00:05:09.990> make<00:05:10.710> sure<00:05:10.860> you<00:05:10.980> cover<00:05:11.160> your<00:05:11.400> rear

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
your items make sure you cover your rear

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.260 
your items make sure you cover your rear
end<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.750> you<00:05:12.840> don't<00:05:12.870> get<00:05:13.110> hit<00:05:13.260> yourself<00:05:14.270> and

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
end so you don't get hit yourself and
