you will see that on screen that is a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.240 
you will see that on screen that is a
personal<00:00:45.600> drop<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.829> drops<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.160> I've

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
personal drop all of the drops that I've

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.770

which<00:00:48.930> I'm<00:00:49.050> quite<00:00:49.200> surprised<00:00:49.559> about

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
which I'm quite surprised about

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.590 
which I'm quite surprised about
considering<00:00:50.129> I've<00:00:50.399> been<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> our<00:00:51.149> middle<00:00:51.420> with

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
considering I've been to our middle with

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.520 
considering I've been to our middle with
thickness<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.760> Spenny<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.000> all<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> drop

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
thickness and Spenny and all of the drop

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.950 
thickness and Spenny and all of the drop
so<00:00:55.680> far<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:55.980> been<00:00:56.010> mine<00:00:56.399> which<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.329> don't

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
so far have been mine which I I don't

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.740 
so far have been mine which I I don't
even<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.260> how<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.120> guess

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
even know how that's you know I guess

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.959 
even know how that's you know I guess
the<00:01:01.140> odds<00:01:01.260> are<00:01:01.500> possible<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.250> don't<00:01:02.879> know

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the odds are possible and I don't know

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.880 
the odds are possible and I don't know
but<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.570> strange<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.180> mean<00:01:06.600> yeah<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.619> has

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
but it's strange so I mean yeah it has

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.080 
but it's strange so I mean yeah it has
been<00:01:07.920> good<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:09.979> from<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.310> chest<00:01:11.700> plate<00:01:11.939> we

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
been good and from the chest plate we

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.899 
been good and from the chest plate we
got<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.600> think<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.049> saw<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> Fate<00:01:13.590> Mel<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:14.520> four

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
got I think we saw the Fate Mel got four

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.749 
got I think we saw the Fate Mel got four
mil<00:01:15.240> 4.3<00:01:16.200> millage<00:01:16.500> smelling<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.549> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.429 
mil 4.3 millage smelling like that and
then<00:01:18.689> we<00:01:19.259> got<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.590> bigger<00:01:19.890> drop<00:01:20.070> later<00:01:20.880> on

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.569 
equivalent to a you note by 250 ml on RS
3<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.810> that's<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.350> know<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> huge<00:02:01.979> drop<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
3 so that's you know it's a huge drop it

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.330 
3 so that's you know it's a huge drop it
really<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:04.619> split<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.130> well

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
really is and and that's split as well

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.280 
really is and and that's split as well
it's<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.880> 500<00:02:06.509> mil<00:02:06.659> tall<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.110> hill

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
so on are three in split winners like

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.160
