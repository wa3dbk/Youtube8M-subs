system without removing the air box
you're<00:00:12.030> gonna<00:00:12.090> mark<00:00:12.750> out<00:00:13.019> your<00:00:13.639> cut<00:00:14.639> line<00:00:16.250> just

going to be you know somewhere halfway
between<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.970> screws<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:23.750> then<00:00:26.960> we'll<00:00:27.960> follow

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
between the screws and then we'll follow

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.580 
between the screws and then we'll follow
along<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.330> cut<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> down<00:00:30.990> arrow

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
along this here and I cut the down arrow

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.799 
along this here and I cut the down arrow
here<00:00:34.700> which<00:00:35.700> will<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:36.000> us<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.329> everything<00:00:36.750> is

is<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.729> EZ<00:01:41.909> cut<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.810> air<00:01:45.990> intake<00:01:46.470> sensor<00:01:47.159> is

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
is the EZ cut the air intake sensor is

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.969 
is the EZ cut the air intake sensor is
gonna<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.610> somewhere<00:01:48.060> right<00:01:48.119> about<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.800 

so<00:01:52.979> we're<00:01:53.280> not<00:01:53.399> gonna<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.880> interfering<00:01:54.659> with

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
so we're not gonna be interfering with

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
so we're not gonna be interfering with
it<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> cut<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.590> here

regular saw-blade no big handle a little

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.580 
regular saw-blade no big handle a little
bit<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.950> duct<00:02:08.250> tape<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:08.970> away<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.110> go

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
bit of duct tape on it and away we go

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.530 
bit of duct tape on it and away we go
this<00:02:11.370> marks<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.970> handy-dandy<00:02:12.390> little<00:02:12.750> tool

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
this marks the handy-dandy little tool

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.590 
this marks the handy-dandy little tool
on<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:15.660> part<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.260> thing

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
on this part of the thing

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.210 
on this part of the thing
there's<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.780> overlapping<00:02:19.380> scene<00:02:19.920> if<00:02:20.160> you

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
there's the overlapping scene if you

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.490 
there's the overlapping scene if you
don't<00:02:20.610> want<00:02:20.910> to<00:02:21.030> cut<00:02:21.240> into<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.600> bottom<00:02:22.230> half

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
don't want to cut into your bottom half

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.610 
don't want to cut into your bottom half
you<00:02:22.920> would<00:02:23.310> probably<00:02:23.700> stop<00:02:23.970> right<00:02:24.330> about<00:02:24.780> here

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
you would probably stop right about here

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.390 
you would probably stop right about here
and<00:02:26.060> then<00:02:27.320> you'll<00:02:28.320> crack<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.100> we're<00:02:29.310> gonna

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
and then you'll crack it and we're gonna

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.010 
and then you'll crack it and we're gonna
see<00:02:29.640> how<00:02:29.670> easy<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:30.150> cracks<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.660> little<00:02:30.690> bit

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
see how easy it cracks a little bit

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.380 
see how easy it cracks a little bit
later<00:02:31.250> but<00:02:32.250> on<00:02:32.400> on<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.880> one<00:02:33.060> we're<00:02:33.209> gonna<00:02:33.270> go

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
later but on on this one we're gonna go

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.710 
later but on on this one we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.840> cut<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.440> half<00:02:34.650> all<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.070> way<00:02:35.190> down

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.810 

and<00:02:39.720> that's<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.860> don't<00:02:41.010> cut<00:02:41.310> into<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.670> bottom

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
and that's it don't cut into the bottom

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.610 
and that's it don't cut into the bottom
half<00:02:42.030> too<00:02:42.390> deep<00:02:42.600> now<00:02:42.750> what<00:02:42.930> all<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.320> did<00:02:43.470> was

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
half too deep now what all we did was

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.210 
half too deep now what all we did was
cut<00:02:43.830> into<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.340> little<00:02:45.530> where<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> seal<00:02:46.920> goes

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
cut into the little where the seal goes

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.620 
cut into the little where the seal goes
so<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:47.760> not<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.900> air<00:02:52.110> box<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:54.360> we'll<00:02:54.480> come

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
so it's not the air box and we'll come

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.210 
so it's not the air box and we'll come
back<00:02:54.840> over<00:02:55.020> here<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.590> side<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.100> of

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
back over here to this side and of

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.840 
back over here to this side and of
course<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.610> remove<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.150> screws<00:02:57.420> already<00:02:58.850> you

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
course we remove the screws already you

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.780 
course we remove the screws already you
want<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.120> stay<00:03:00.300> on<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.600> top<00:03:00.900> half<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.560> this

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
want to stay on the top half of this

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.850 
want to stay on the top half of this
takes<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.910> little<00:03:03.209> bit<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.480> finagling<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:04.290> make

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
takes a little bit of finagling to make

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.410 
takes a little bit of finagling to make
the<00:03:05.040> corner<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.850> do<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.239> can<00:03:06.390> use

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
the corner but you can do it you can use

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.600 
the corner but you can do it you can use
a<00:03:06.570> smaller<00:03:06.930> jig<00:03:07.290> soft<00:03:07.560> you<00:03:07.709> want<00:03:07.920> or<00:03:08.280> even<00:03:08.520> the

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
a smaller jig soft you want or even the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.300 
a smaller jig soft you want or even the
power<00:03:09.570> dremel<00:03:10.290> but<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.470> don't<00:03:10.769> like<00:03:10.950> using<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
power dremel but I don't like using the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.890 
power dremel but I don't like using the
power<00:03:11.610> tools<00:03:12.030> because<00:03:12.239> they<00:03:12.330> can<00:03:12.480> get<00:03:12.630> away

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
power tools because they can get away

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.710 
power tools because they can get away
from<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.590> this<00:03:14.549> is<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> gas<00:03:15.000> tank<00:03:15.030> here

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
from you and this is the gas tank here

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.509 
from you and this is the gas tank here
so<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.049> don't<00:03:16.350> want<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.590> cut<00:03:16.769> into<00:03:16.920> that<00:03:22.519> now

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
so you don't want to cut into that now

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:32.320 
so you don't want to cut into that now
we're<00:03:23.700> cutting<00:03:24.000> down<00:03:29.120> here's<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.330> fun<00:03:30.570> part

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
we're cutting down here's the fun part

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.320 
we're cutting down here's the fun part
might<00:03:33.330> take<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.600> couple<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.049> different<00:03:35.330> tries

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
might take a couple of different tries

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.180 
might take a couple of different tries
to<00:03:36.750> get<00:03:36.959> it<00:03:37.080> all<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.350> way<00:03:37.470> as<00:03:37.620> deep<00:03:37.980> as<00:03:38.160> you

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
to get it all the way as deep as you

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.170 
to get it all the way as deep as you
want<00:03:38.310> we<00:03:38.910> can't<00:03:39.180> get<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:39.570> at<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.670> same<00:03:41.670> angle

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
want we can't get in at the same angle

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.390 
want we can't get in at the same angle
as<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.299> other<00:03:42.540> side<00:03:45.739> you<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:46.799> see<00:03:46.890> we<00:03:47.160> can<00:03:47.310> get

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
as the other side you can see we can get

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:58.300 
as the other side you can see we can get
in<00:03:47.549> there<00:03:47.700> pretty<00:03:47.910> deep

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.740 

see<00:03:59.310> don't<00:03:59.520> the<00:03:59.580> blade<00:03:59.850> is<00:04:00.060> bottoming<00:04:00.540> out<00:04:00.690> in

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
see don't the blade is bottoming out in

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.960 
see don't the blade is bottoming out in
the<00:04:00.930> airbox<00:04:01.380> bottom<00:04:01.980> right<00:04:02.220> here<00:04:02.400> that's

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
the airbox bottom right here that's

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.610 
the airbox bottom right here that's
following<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.930> don't<00:04:04.050> want<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.350> force

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
following it so you don't want to force

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.100

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
- might be a good idea yeah I nicked it

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.940 
- might be a good idea yeah I nicked it
a<00:04:21.390> little<00:04:21.570> bit<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.780> didn't<00:04:22.080> go<00:04:22.230> in<00:04:22.440> too<00:04:22.620> deep<00:04:22.800> but

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
a little bit I didn't go in too deep but

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.350 
a little bit I didn't go in too deep but
you<00:04:23.010> could<00:04:23.220> put<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.460> piece<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.730> tape<00:04:24.120> or

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360

you could put a piece of tape or
something<00:04:24.750> on<00:04:24.870> that<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:26.370> protect<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:32.660> don't

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
something on that to protect it I don't

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.070 
something on that to protect it I don't
know<00:04:33.780> how<00:04:33.960> far<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:36.000> plastic<00:04:36.570> is<00:04:36.690> kind<00:04:36.960> of

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
know how far the plastic is kind of

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.280 
know how far the plastic is kind of
brittle<00:04:37.530> see<00:04:37.890> here<00:04:38.160> it's<00:04:38.520> moving<00:04:38.760> already<00:04:39.300> now

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
brittle see here it's moving already now

brittle see here it's moving already now
what<00:04:40.440> we<00:04:40.560> need<00:04:40.680> is<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.860> wood<00:04:41.100> chisel
