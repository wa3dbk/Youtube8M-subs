00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.350
 hello guys and girls the glitter zone 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.779
 they look great but how do we do 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.900
 remove them in this video I'll show you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.650
 a super easy way to do so let's 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.770
 need cotton 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.430
 nail polish remover 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.350
 and aluminum foil the first thing we're going to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.480
 to do is take a little piece of cotton 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.460
 it can be whatever it is like I am 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.420
 using discs I'm going to start 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.210
 half 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:48.079
 and we are going to put a lot of nail polish 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.300
 to cotton and we're going to stick it a little bit 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.510
 to our nail as you see we will return 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.430
 a little bit and on top we are going to put paper 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.770
 aluminum 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.770
 so that the cotton stays there 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.239
 and we are going to do that also with all 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.239
 the other nails 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.820
 this can also work for you 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.970
 remove the nails that are of rhinestones or 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.460
 basically any varnish 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.660
 or nail polish that is something 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.660
 complicated to remove 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.640
 and we are going to leave them this way 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.640
 around about 5 minutes 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.640
 dv 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.050
 after they spent this time what 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.240
 let's do is remove the rubbing a 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.370
 little cotton to our nail for 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.400
 that is finished removing the last thing that we 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.140
 could have been left of the varnish 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.990
 or glitter 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.020
 and as you will see, he practically took off 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.860
 all last let's take another 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.690
 cotton also with nail polish remover and 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.850
 same way we will go through 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.480
 our nails to remove the little bit that 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.480
 we have been 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.670
 and with that, our 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:35.099
 nails I hope you liked both 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.099
