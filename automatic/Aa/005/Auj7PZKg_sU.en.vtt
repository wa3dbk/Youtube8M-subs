00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.430
 very good everyone I'm air today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.260
 we come with a tutorial on how to put the 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.480
 cream to improve the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.119
 connection with other players in 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.599
 any the online game of both the 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:20.939
 xbox as of pei 3 and especially the 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:23.509
 connection and where it affects the most is my to almost 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.070
 all of us is not in the call of duty 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:29.949
 that allows us to join groups 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.079
 or not so much the parts of the xbox as 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.440
 The groups of Carlos beauty the room 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.379
 previous or the multiplayer group 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.059
 well this gets in the way but 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:45.420
 before explaining those ways we're going to 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:48.170
 go little by little this for windows to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:55.130
 what is being for great I know 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.130
 we come here we put you to execute 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:04.050
 here we are we put 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.760
 cmd point excel 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.760
 and here we put ip 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.020
 with fifa no 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.600
 trust and press whole will open us 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.600
 this 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.860
 but it's very simple once we need 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.470
 this to see here gateway 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.130
 default will usually be something 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.130
 similar to this one 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.940
 will be this on almost two computers a lot 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.180
 and well let's go to the browser 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:44.439
 this is to enter the router is worth 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:47.829
 192 points 168 await as we are 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.929
 will open a little eyelash like this if it is 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.929
 have 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.509
 password and username if not 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.950
 is protected can enter and only 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.350
 It usually comes under the router if 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.140
 you changed it for a sticker or 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.319
 in the value instructions they already put the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.319
 mine 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.850
 and we enter the router this is mine 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.870
 well there are many many types of router 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.870
 there are many some routers will have a 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.310
 a possibility to do it one way u 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 but I 'm going to show you the most 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.030
 easy 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.460
 we'll see 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.700
 let's use 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.530
 where was plateau teams here 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.050
 I had another router and the other router did not 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.250
 I was like this so much in advanced but 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.290
 the best you have to look at 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.200
 configurations then advanced the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.440
 plateau or plateau teams host something 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.270
 that has of plateau to look for all the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.640
 configurations because it is impossible 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.380
 do it every router 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.300
 but good to look for the configuration 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.710
 of plateau plateau host 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.870
 click here 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.550
 and well here we would address 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.930
 plateau that would set us a predetermined 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:11.920
 0 here we can put any up 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.650
 255 I recommend an installed anything 130 and 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.010
 peak but better than 20 for 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.640
 up to avoid problems with others 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.000
 equipment 42 is the one that I have the one that I 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.140
 I like to put here and we click 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.030
 Apply 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.030
 and then I'm going to apply that 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.650
 would ensure the changes and this for what 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.900
 It serves as it serves to S &amp; P we are 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.150
 giving that 6p permission to open 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.500
 the ports that she wants that she needs 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.980
 the xbox or the play to connect to 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.129
 Internet 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.959
 and so have the cream open this is the 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.040
 easiest way the other way is 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.700
 opening the doors that now I will say 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.189
 but I say now we will go to the xbox 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.200
 because to record full but see is that 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:08.970
 exactly the same as almost the same 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.430
 and we'll see how we put the configuration 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.000
 and we already have are exempt and we put the 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.889
 our that we want then we are going to 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.169
 forward 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.169
 no lie door activation 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.340
 active active and ports by activating 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.710
 or what you need in English and here 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.570
 you will see here I have several things these are 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.390
 all you have to open I have one 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.980
 from the other the xbox others mixed other 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.700
 things there 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.650
 this would be some now then already 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.630
 I will teach what you have to open them 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.180
 I will leave the description but I say this 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.060
 something secondary if you can do it like that 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.540
 better not to do it of the two 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.640
 ways or one or this one is much more 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.950
 easy and give many problems of 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.440
 if they do it like that I recommend it 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.040
 one hundred percent then another thing that 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.040
 we have to know 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.210
 the basic configuration for example 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.820
 that we need to know the primary and 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:17.289
 the secondary this so that it will serve us 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:20.289
 so to put it in the console 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.259
 and this is what we need in 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.830
 principle pointing everything and good clear 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:28.180
 lie I forget one thing here 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.360
 we need this more than the subnet that 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.710
 usually it will always be 255 155 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.710
 255 points 0 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.480
 this is what we have the 90 and play 9% 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.420
 from all of us 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.660
 and good and my dog barking but this is 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.760
 everything and now new for the good xbox 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.250
 we are already here in the xbox after 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.720
 see everything on a piece of paper written all 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:57.600
 the ip addresses all we have 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.060
 said then we are going in this case in the xbox 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.050
 He said it's the same in the pei three are what 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.100
 which puts advanced settings at times 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.140
 easy 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.760
 the option is what I leave you here 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.440
 I have in this case the network connection 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.620
 type with cable then we go here and 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.410
 set up let's go here you have to be in 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:21.220
 manual or automatic how are we going to 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.560
 manual and we put the ip address that 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.750
 We put in pot host our 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.660
 Subnet mask and our door 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.210
 link that is the router we go to the 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.310
 dns servers and we put exactly what 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.990
 that we protons leaving the primary and 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.820
 the secondary 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.220
 this has no more sciences that easy 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.730
 we already have our super cream the mega 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.590
 open and this is without opening the ports 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:49.240
 I do not need to repeat it and well I'm going to 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.680
 try the connection so you can see that 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.830
 I have open wool 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.690
 and well you have connected the network 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.380
 this is always disconnected to do the 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.380
 connection test 

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:11.870
 connected to the internet 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.699
 and connecting to xbox live to see that no 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.460
 we see no exclamation mark in 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:18.500
 the perfect beige medium nothing open if 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.449
 they used exclamations that have moderate 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.310
 strict that you have already done something wrong or 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:23.810
 any configuration of the router or the 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.690
 that is wrong 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:30.680
 and well this has been all I hope that you 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:33.860
 like the video you have served dale 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:36.139
 to like favorites and all that subscribe 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.870
 if you are not subscribed and good to say that 

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:41.389
 is where this is for the xbox and for 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.880
 the play 3 is the same is to pass a format 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:46.450
 to another it is coming to be the same and good 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.450
 until another
