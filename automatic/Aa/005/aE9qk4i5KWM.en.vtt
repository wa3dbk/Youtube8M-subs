when<00:03:30.849> you<00:03:30.999> fight<00:03:31.299> this<00:03:31.689> fish<00:03:32.260> when<00:03:32.950> you<00:03:33.069> get

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:33.249 
when you fight this fish when you get

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:35.759 
when you fight this fish when you get
close<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.670> boat<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:35.140> want<00:03:35.379> to<00:03:35.499> keep<00:03:35.709> the

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
close to the boat you want to keep the

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.830 
close to the boat you want to keep the
rod<00:03:36.219> tip<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:36.700> suppose<00:03:37.030> from<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.420> water<00:03:37.629> as

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
rod tip I suppose from the water as

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.910 
rod tip I suppose from the water as
possible<00:03:38.049> because<00:03:38.920> they<00:03:39.280> have<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.430> very<00:03:39.819> very

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
possible because they have a very very

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.849 
possible because they have a very very
delicate<00:03:41.920> mouth<00:03:42.189> and<00:03:43.019> it<00:03:44.019> does<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:44.530> does

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
delicate mouth and it does it does

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.030 
delicate mouth and it does it does
clears<00:03:45.519> up<00:03:45.760> very<00:03:46.269> easily<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.709> last<00:03:47.889> thing

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
clears up very easily so the last thing

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.459 
clears up very easily so the last thing
you<00:03:48.249> want<00:03:48.489> is<00:03:48.549> for<00:03:48.609> that<00:03:48.939> fish<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.959> shake<00:03:50.260> his

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:50.469 
you want is for that fish to shake his

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:52.410 
you want is for that fish to shake his
head<00:03:50.620> out<00:03:50.799> of<00:03:50.859> the<00:03:51.010> water<00:03:51.189> too<00:03:51.760> often<00:03:52.180> I

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
head out of the water too often I

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.330
