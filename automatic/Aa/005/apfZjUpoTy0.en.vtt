00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
or a board called the wave they're both

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.010 
or a board called the wave they're both
called<00:00:16.410> cast<00:00:16.770> cast<00:00:17.550> rewards<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.150> they're

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020

called cast cast rewards and they're
different<00:00:19.230> than<00:00:19.470> skateboards<00:00:20.070> cuz<00:00:20.610> they<00:00:20.730> only

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
different than skateboards cuz they only

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.050 
different than skateboards cuz they only
have<00:00:20.970> two<00:00:21.360> lives<00:00:22.340> their<00:00:23.340> prices<00:00:23.730> are<00:00:23.850> about

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
have two lives their prices are about

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.560 
have two lives their prices are about
the<00:00:24.240> same<00:00:24.450> so

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.170 

this<00:00:30.080> is<00:00:30.230> how<00:00:30.380> you<00:00:30.440> read<00:00:30.740> it

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.720 

so<00:00:33.810> basically<00:00:34.680> why<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.130> write<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:37.730> you

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
so basically why you write it this you

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.930 
so basically why you write it this you
put<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:40.220> non-dominant<00:00:41.220> foot<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> front

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
put your non-dominant foot in the front

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.600 
put your non-dominant foot in the front
and<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:46.070> dominant<00:00:47.070> foot<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and so have your dominant foot in the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.160 
and so have your dominant foot in the
back<00:00:47.790> and<00:00:48.350> be<00:00:49.350> ready<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.060> push<00:00:51.060> off

first you take your dominant foot and
put<00:02:25.239> it<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.450> little<00:02:25.480> bit<00:02:25.870> back<00:02:26.080> when<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.349> wrote

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
put it a little bit back when you wrote

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.200 
put it a little bit back when you wrote
stick<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.099> then<00:02:27.730> shift<00:02:28.569> your<00:02:28.659> way

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.540 

it's<00:02:32.210> pretty<00:02:32.570> easy<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.040> have<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.400> have

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
it's pretty easy you just have to have

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:50.220 
it's pretty easy you just have to have
good<00:02:34.760> bounce

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.840 

okay<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.770> next<00:02:51.920> thing<00:02:52.220> I'm<00:02:52.310> going<00:02:52.520> to<00:02:52.640> teach

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
okay the next thing I'm going to teach

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.810 
okay the next thing I'm going to teach
you<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:54.260> nose<00:02:55.040> manual<00:02:55.550> which<00:02:55.700> is

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
you is the nose manual which is

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.970 
you is the nose manual which is
basically<00:02:56.210> a<00:02:56.360> manual<00:02:56.870> but<00:02:57.410> you're<00:02:57.620> manually

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
basically a manual but you're manually

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.650 
basically a manual but you're manually
the<00:02:58.280> other<00:02:58.490> way<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.910> back<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.150> going<00:03:02.510> to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the other way so the back is going to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.120 
the other way so the back is going to
come

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.670 

just<00:03:06.580> like<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:08.820> it's<00:03:09.820> that<00:03:10.000> simple<00:03:10.240> it's<00:03:10.720> the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
just like this it's that simple it's the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:28.039 
just like this it's that simple it's the
same<00:03:11.890> as<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.100> manual<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.520> backwards

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.690 

what<00:03:29.049> a<00:03:29.260> Hangtown<00:03:29.709> is<00:03:29.890> basically<00:03:30.459> you<00:03:30.640> just

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
what a Hangtown is basically you just

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.830 
what a Hangtown is basically you just

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
riding it you put both feet on this end

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:48.150 
riding it you put both feet on this end
of<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.049> board

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.690 

Sony's<00:03:49.160> in<00:03:49.660> for<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.690> hang<00:03:50.960> 20<00:03:51.230> we<00:03:52.010> do<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.340> exact

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
Sony's in for a hang 20 we do the exact

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.990 
Sony's in for a hang 20 we do the exact
same<00:03:52.730> thing<00:03:53.240> just<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.660> do<00:03:53.840> it<00:03:53.960> on<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.260> back<00:03:54.470> end

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
same thing just to do it on the back end

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:08.510 
same thing just to do it on the back end
do<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.120> like<00:03:56.240> this

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.270
