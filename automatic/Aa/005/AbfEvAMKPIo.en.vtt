hi<00:00:11.670> my<00:00:12.059> name<00:00:12.210> is<00:00:12.269> Chris<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.200> petal

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
hi my name is Chris and this is petal

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.160 
hi my name is Chris and this is petal
nonsense<00:00:14.000> final<00:00:15.000> stand<00:00:15.269> has<00:00:15.450> left<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.839> CTE

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
nonsense final stand has left the CTE

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.019 
nonsense final stand has left the CTE
again<00:00:16.590> but<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.039> shouldn't<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.580> too<00:00:17.789> long<00:00:17.820> until

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
again but it shouldn't be too long until

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.120 
again but it shouldn't be too long until
we<00:00:18.420> get<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> final<00:00:18.840> version<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.100> means

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
we get the final version what it means

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.490 
we get the final version what it means
is<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.820> CTE<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.420> now<00:00:21.570> back<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.080> normal

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
is that the CTE is now back to normal

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.910 
is that the CTE is now back to normal
and<00:00:22.619> normal<00:00:23.160> means<00:00:23.789> prototype<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:25.230> before<00:00:25.830> we

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
and normal means prototype but before we

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.349 
and normal means prototype but before we
look<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> new<00:00:26.460> changes<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.970> want<00:00:27.180> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
look at the new changes I want to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.060 
look at the new changes I want to
mention<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.080> playstation<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.859> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
mention that the playstation and the

mention that the playstation and the
xbox<00:00:29.460> players<00:00:29.699> are<00:00:29.970> now<00:00:30.330> also<00:00:30.630> able<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.320> sign

helicopter physics in the CTE but they

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.640 
helicopter physics in the CTE but they
appear<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.360> close<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.259> numbers

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
appear to be very close to the numbers

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.469 
appear to be very close to the numbers
which<00:01:25.830> are<00:01:26.040> used<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.549> my<00:01:26.729> video<00:01:27.090> where<00:01:27.450> i

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
which are used in my video where i

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.880 
which are used in my video where i
showed<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.810> what<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.619> by<00:01:28.829> just

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
showed you what you can do by just

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.910 
showed you what you can do by just
changing<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.820> few<00:01:29.970> numbers<00:01:30.390> around<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.350> during

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
changing a few numbers around so during

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.679 
changing a few numbers around so during
the<00:01:32.009> next<00:01:32.159> few<00:01:32.400> days<00:01:32.579> i<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:33.000> more<00:01:33.180> testing

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the next few days i will do more testing

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.690 
the next few days i will do more testing
and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> separate<00:01:34.950> video<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.520> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and then have a separate video for you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.090 
and then have a separate video for you
about<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.090> helicopter<00:01:36.750> physics<00:01:37.110> but<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.920> this

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
about the helicopter physics but in this

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.710 
about the helicopter physics but in this
video<00:01:38.310> i<00:01:38.490> want<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> focus<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> head

your<00:01:47.280> gun<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.210> should<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> look<00:01:48.810> at

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
your gun then you should have a look at

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.560 
your gun then you should have a look at
my<00:01:49.140> visual<00:01:49.649> recoil<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.180> head

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
my visual recoil it's all in your head

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.980 
my visual recoil it's all in your head
video<00:01:52.140> where<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.740> explained<00:01:53.430> all<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.119> you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
video where I explained all of that you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.450 
video where I explained all of that you
should<00:01:55.140> really<00:01:55.470> watch<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.799> first<00:01:56.040> before

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
should really watch this first before

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.219 
should really watch this first before
you<00:01:56.579> continue<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:59.509> alright<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.780> what<00:02:01.079> we've

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you continue here alright so what we've

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.530 
you continue here alright so what we've
got<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.680> CTE<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.430> first<00:02:02.670> prototype<00:02:03.030> of

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
got in the CTE is the first prototype of

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.090 
got in the CTE is the first prototype of
the<00:02:03.659> head<00:02:03.780> coaching<00:02:04.170> fix<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.890> must

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the head coaching fix you must

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.160 
the head coaching fix you must
understand<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.420> final<00:02:06.869> it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
understand that this is not final it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.440 
understand that this is not final it
might<00:02:07.560> get<00:02:07.829> changed<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.340> lot<00:02:08.520> actually<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
might get changed a lot actually I

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.559 
might get changed a lot actually I
expect<00:02:09.959> quite<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.349> few<00:02:10.649> changes<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.910> currently

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
expect quite a few changes so currently

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.820 
expect quite a few changes so currently
the<00:02:12.750> change<00:02:12.989> only<00:02:13.349> works<00:02:13.530> with

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the change only works with

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.280 
the change only works with
a few<00:02:14.130> selected<00:02:14.640> weapons<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.960> means<00:02:16.200> that

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
a few selected weapons this means that

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.450 
a few selected weapons this means that
if<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.530> are<00:02:16.620> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.950> test<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.310> out

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
if you are going to test this out

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.670 
if you are going to test this out
yourself<00:02:17.940> then<00:02:18.240> make<00:02:18.690> sure<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.230> use<00:02:19.260> one

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
yourself then make sure that you use one

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.860 
yourself then make sure that you use one
of<00:02:19.710> these<00:02:20.040> otherwise<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.060> will<00:02:21.150> notice<00:02:21.450> no

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
of these otherwise you will notice no

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.960 
of these otherwise you will notice no
difference<00:02:22.380> because<00:02:23.010> only<00:02:23.280> these<00:02:23.550> weapons

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
difference because only these weapons

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.720 
difference because only these weapons
have<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.390> changes<00:02:24.810> ok<00:02:25.710> so<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.070> returned<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
have the changes ok so I returned to the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.460 
have the changes ok so I returned to the
place<00:02:26.850> where<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.210> recorded<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.110> different

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
place where I recorded the different

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.370 
place where I recorded the different
impacts<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.370> visual<00:02:29.670> recoil<00:02:30.150> video<00:02:30.570> which

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
impacts in the visual recoil video which

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.800 
impacts in the visual recoil video which
you<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.650> watched<00:02:31.860> by<00:02:32.070> now<00:02:32.250> right<00:02:32.460> so<00:02:33.390> let's

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
you have watched by now right so let's

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.570 
you have watched by now right so let's
have<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.020> look<00:02:34.080> what<00:02:34.350> happens<00:02:34.680> now<00:02:34.890> after<00:02:35.460> this

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
have a look what happens now after this

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:47.030 
have a look what happens now after this
change<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.240> CTE<00:02:45.350> we<00:02:46.350> can<00:02:46.530> clearly<00:02:46.770> see

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
change in the CTE we can clearly see

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.890 
change in the CTE we can clearly see
that<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.220> projectile<00:02:47.940> impact<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.720> same

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that the projectile impact in the same

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.830 
that the projectile impact in the same
spot<00:02:49.080> in<00:02:49.230> all<00:02:49.650> views<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.280> all<00:02:50.460> players<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.360> that

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
spot in all views of all players so that

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.990 
spot in all views of all players so that
is<00:02:51.959> something<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.440> got<00:02:52.770> fixed<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.880> is

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
is something that got fixed but that is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.120 
is something that got fixed but that is
not<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.300> head<00:02:54.570> glitching<00:02:54.810> issue<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.709> let's

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
not the head glitching issue so let's

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.920 
not the head glitching issue so let's
test<00:02:56.340> now<00:02:56.580> if<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.060> still<00:02:57.300> hit<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.480> player

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
test now if I can still hit that player

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.630 
test now if I can still hit that player
when<00:02:58.230> only<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.620> part<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.040> my<00:02:59.220> head<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.520> you

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
when only a part of my head is you

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.820 
when only a part of my head is you
revealed<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.209> my<00:03:00.690> weapon<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.170> clearly<00:03:01.560> behind

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
revealed and my weapon is clearly behind

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.620 
revealed and my weapon is clearly behind
cover<00:03:06.860> no<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.070> can't<00:03:08.580> hit<00:03:08.700> him<00:03:08.760> anymore<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
cover no I can't hit him anymore the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.110 
cover no I can't hit him anymore the
shots<00:03:09.870> are<00:03:10.020> fire<00:03:10.320> impact<00:03:11.010> in<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.400> object<00:03:14.120> now

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
shots are fire impact in the object now

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.400 
shots are fire impact in the object now
let's<00:03:15.300> have<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.450> look<00:03:15.510> what<00:03:15.810> happens<00:03:16.110> when<00:03:16.200> i'm

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
let's have a look what happens when i'm

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.840 
let's have a look what happens when i'm
using<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:16.830> pistol<00:03:17.040> which<00:03:17.400> has<00:03:17.580> not<00:03:17.790> been

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
using a pistol which has not been

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:28.580 
using a pistol which has not been
changed<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:26.090> as<00:03:27.090> expected<00:03:27.239> i<00:03:27.720> can<00:03:27.959> easily<00:03:28.440> hit

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
changed and as expected i can easily hit

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.830 
changed and as expected i can easily hit
the<00:03:28.800> player<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.640> if<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.120> change<00:03:30.360> back<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.600> the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
the player and if you change back to the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.250 
the player and if you change back to the
primary<00:03:31.080> which<00:03:31.500> has<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.980> fix<00:03:33.110> then<00:03:34.110> the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
primary which has to fix then the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.040 
primary which has to fix then the
projectiles<00:03:34.830> impact<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.820> object<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.750> it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
projectiles impact in the object so it

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.240 
projectiles impact in the object so it
seems<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.560> head<00:03:37.680> pitching<00:03:38.070> has<00:03:38.220> been

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
seems that the head pitching has been

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.420 
seems that the head pitching has been
fixed<00:03:38.730> but<00:03:39.630> let's<00:03:40.290> do<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> bit<00:03:40.769> more<00:03:40.800> testing

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
fixed but let's do a bit more testing

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.060 
fixed but let's do a bit more testing
chest<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.940> be<00:03:42.060> sure<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:43.290> there's<00:03:43.470> still<00:03:43.590> only<00:03:43.890> a

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
chest to be sure so there's still only a

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.680 
chest to be sure so there's still only a
very<00:03:44.310> small<00:03:44.459> part<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:45.030> my<00:03:45.180> head<00:03:45.330> exposed

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
very small part of my head exposed

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.870 
very small part of my head exposed
behind<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.440> object<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.519> very<00:03:47.790> easy

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
behind that object and it is very easy

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.040 
behind that object and it is very easy
for<00:03:48.180> me<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.450> aim<00:03:48.780> at<00:03:49.019> that<00:03:49.200> player<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.900> what<00:03:52.019> I

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
for me to aim at that player so what I

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.900 
for me to aim at that player so what I
expected<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.650> happen<00:03:52.769> is<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.310> my<00:03:53.459> shot<00:03:53.730> would

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
expected to happen is that my shot would

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.840 
expected to happen is that my shot would
impact<00:03:54.390> in<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.750> object<00:03:55.140> i'm<00:03:55.320> hiding<00:03:55.739> behind

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
impact in the object i'm hiding behind

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.370 
impact in the object i'm hiding behind
but<00:03:56.850> as<00:03:56.970> we<00:03:57.090> have<00:03:57.120> seen<00:03:57.209> i<00:03:57.570> only<00:03:58.050> need<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.350> look

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
but as we have seen i only need to look

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.320 
but as we have seen i only need to look
up<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.890> little<00:03:58.920> bit<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.459> then<00:03:59.519> i<00:03:59.790> can<00:04:00.060> shoot

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
up a little bit and then i can shoot

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.810 
up a little bit and then i can shoot
over<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.720> object<00:04:00.870> again<00:04:01.440> or<00:04:02.040> through<00:04:02.640> the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
over the object again or through the

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.150 
over the object again or through the
object<00:04:03.269> from<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.720> other<00:04:03.870> players<00:04:04.230> view<00:04:04.500> now

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
object from the other players view now

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.860 
object from the other players view now
let<00:04:05.310> me<00:04:05.340> show<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.640> one<00:04:05.910> more<00:04:05.940> example<00:04:06.120> how

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
let me show you one more example how

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.080 
let me show you one more example how
small<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.320> few<00:04:07.800> changes<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> be<00:04:08.700> able<00:04:08.820> to

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
small that few changes to be able to

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.250 
small that few changes to be able to
shoot<00:04:09.330> over<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.810> object

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.509 

so<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.380> first<00:04:17.560> prototype<00:04:17.859> of<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.400> head

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
so the first prototype of the head

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.729 
so the first prototype of the head
glitching<00:04:18.760> fix<00:04:19.120> does<00:04:19.359> work<00:04:19.690> hi<00:04:20.139> wait<00:04:20.380> only

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
glitching fix does work hi wait only

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.590 
glitching fix does work hi wait only
works<00:04:20.919> for<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.190> most<00:04:21.370> extreme<00:04:21.760> cases<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.419> head

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
works for the most extreme cases of head

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.330 
works for the most extreme cases of head
glitching<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.200> now<00:04:23.830> let's<00:04:24.040> have<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.190> look<00:04:24.250> what

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
glitching and now let's have a look what

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.010 
glitching and now let's have a look what
kind<00:04:24.669> of<00:04:24.850> change<00:04:25.150> has<00:04:25.389> been<00:04:25.570> done<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.750> the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
kind of change has been done to the

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.500 
kind of change has been done to the
weapons<00:04:26.410> for<00:04:26.710> this<00:04:26.860> fix<00:04:27.160> as<00:04:27.940> I've<00:04:28.180> showed<00:04:28.360> the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
weapons for this fix as I've showed the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.690 
weapons for this fix as I've showed the
individual<00:04:28.960> recoil<00:04:29.410> video<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:30.100> projectors

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
individual recoil video the projectors

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.060 
individual recoil video the projectors
come<00:04:31.030> from<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.389> center<00:04:31.750> of<00:04:31.780> your<00:04:31.960> screen

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
come from the center of your screen

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.830 
come from the center of your screen
however<00:04:33.070> this<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.639> what<00:04:33.850> has<00:04:34.000> been<00:04:34.210> changed<00:04:34.630> in

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
however this is what has been changed in

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.320 
however this is what has been changed in
this<00:04:34.960> CTE<00:04:35.380> patch<00:04:35.740> they<00:04:36.610> spawn<00:04:36.850> about<00:04:37.090> six

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
this CTE patch they spawn about six

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.090 
this CTE patch they spawn about six
centimeters<00:04:37.930> lower<00:04:38.139> now<00:04:38.410> which<00:04:38.740> means<00:04:39.010> that

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
centimeters lower now which means that

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.920 
centimeters lower now which means that
they<00:04:39.340> are<00:04:39.370> about<00:04:39.790> on<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.090> same<00:04:40.300> level<00:04:40.330> as<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
they are about on the same level as the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.290 
they are about on the same level as the
sides<00:04:41.200> on<00:04:41.440> your<00:04:41.590> gun<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:42.070> can<00:04:42.910> show<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:43.120> that

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
sides on your gun I can show you that

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.360 
sides on your gun I can show you that
very<00:04:43.540> easily<00:04:43.750> by<00:04:44.169> simply<00:04:44.200> shooting<00:04:45.040> at<00:04:45.190> that

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
very easily by simply shooting at that

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.900 
very easily by simply shooting at that
object<00:04:46.590> so<00:04:47.590> that<00:04:47.620> impact<00:04:48.100> is<00:04:48.250> clearly<00:04:48.520> below

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
object so that impact is clearly below

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.670 
object so that impact is clearly below
the<00:04:49.060> red<00:04:49.240> dot<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.720> if<00:04:49.990> we<00:04:50.080> compare<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.590> the

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
the red dot and if we compare to the

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.590 
the red dot and if we compare to the
impact<00:04:51.040> of<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.400> pistol<00:04:51.820> then<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.120> becomes<00:04:52.479> a

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
impact of the pistol then it becomes a

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.060 
impact of the pistol then it becomes a
little<00:04:52.750> bit<00:04:52.960> more<00:04:53.169> obvious<00:04:55.710> so<00:04:56.710> by<00:04:56.830> spawning

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
little bit more obvious so by spawning

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.980 
little bit more obvious so by spawning
the<00:04:57.280> projectile<00:04:57.850> a<00:04:57.880> little<00:04:58.180> bit<00:04:58.300> lower<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.810> is

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
the projectile a little bit lower it is

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.840 
the projectile a little bit lower it is
more<00:04:59.229> likely<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.650> impact<00:05:00.070> in<00:05:00.280> an<00:05:00.370> object<00:05:00.760> that

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
more likely to impact in an object that

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.820 
more likely to impact in an object that
I<00:05:01.030> am<00:05:01.150> hiding<00:05:01.389> behind<00:05:01.660> which<00:05:02.350> should<00:05:02.620> help

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
I am hiding behind which should help

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.010 
I am hiding behind which should help
with<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.190> head<00:05:03.490> glitching<00:05:03.910> but<00:05:04.479> by<00:05:04.600> looking<00:05:04.780> a

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
with the head glitching but by looking a

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.870 
with the head glitching but by looking a
little<00:05:05.169> bit<00:05:05.410> up<00:05:05.620> I<00:05:05.800> can<00:05:06.100> still<00:05:06.370> shoot<00:05:06.639> over

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
little bit up I can still shoot over

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.909 
little bit up I can still shoot over
that<00:05:07.240> object<00:05:07.690> because<00:05:08.290> it<00:05:08.410> has<00:05:08.530> only<00:05:08.740> been

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
that object because it has only been

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.730 
that object because it has only been
lowered<00:05:09.370> by<00:05:09.520> six<00:05:09.880> centimeters<00:05:10.660> but<00:05:11.620> this

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
lowered by six centimeters but this

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.409 
lowered by six centimeters but this
change<00:05:12.070> sounds<00:05:12.460> like<00:05:12.610> all<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.940> crosshairs

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
change sounds like all the crosshairs

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.450 
change sounds like all the crosshairs
are<00:05:13.600> now<00:05:13.750> wrong<00:05:14.050> since<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.680> projectile<00:05:15.280> does

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
are now wrong since the projectile does

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.700 
are now wrong since the projectile does
not<00:05:15.610> spawn<00:05:15.850> at<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.090> center<00:05:16.540> of<00:05:16.570> it<00:05:16.810> this<00:05:17.530> would

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
not spawn at the center of it this would

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.230 
not spawn at the center of it this would
be<00:05:17.740> ready<00:05:18.040> to<00:05:18.250> projectile<00:05:18.760> would<00:05:18.940> spawn

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
be ready to projectile would spawn

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.140 
be ready to projectile would spawn
normally<00:05:19.810> but<00:05:20.440> it<00:05:20.560> isn't<00:05:20.919> this<00:05:21.850> is<00:05:22.030> the

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
normally but it isn't this is the

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.420 
normally but it isn't this is the
trajectory<00:05:22.780> of<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:23.020> projectile<00:05:23.289> before<00:05:24.250> the

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
trajectory of the projectile before the

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.700 
trajectory of the projectile before the
change<00:05:24.669> it<00:05:25.150> starts<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:25.840> then<00:05:26.050> it<00:05:26.200> begins<00:05:26.440> to

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
change it starts and then it begins to

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.860 
change it starts and then it begins to
fall<00:05:26.950> with<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.370> distance<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:28.000> this<00:05:28.570> is<00:05:28.720> what

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
fall with the distance and this is what

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.600 
fall with the distance and this is what
it<00:05:28.960> looks<00:05:29.169> like<00:05:29.380> with<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.890> change<00:05:30.220> the

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
it looks like with the change the

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.670 
it looks like with the change the
projection<00:05:31.150> spawns<00:05:31.479> six<00:05:31.780> centimeter<00:05:32.350> lower

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
projection spawns six centimeter lower

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.700 
projection spawns six centimeter lower
and<00:05:33.010> first<00:05:33.580> flies<00:05:33.940> upwards<00:05:34.510> it<00:05:34.900> then<00:05:35.320> series

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
and first flies upwards it then series

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.830 
and first flies upwards it then series
in<00:05:35.919> that<00:05:36.100> about<00:05:36.280> 20<00:05:36.729> meters<00:05:37.000> and<00:05:37.210> then<00:05:37.450> begins

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
in that about 20 meters and then begins

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.930 
in that about 20 meters and then begins
to<00:05:37.930> fall<00:05:38.320> with<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.620> distance<00:05:39.190> so<00:05:39.760> you<00:05:39.910> are

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
to fall with the distance so you are

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.300 
to fall with the distance so you are
still<00:05:40.240> able<00:05:40.510> to<00:05:40.660> place<00:05:40.990> that<00:05:41.229> headshot<00:05:41.500> this

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
still able to place that headshot this

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.190 
still able to place that headshot this
approach<00:05:42.640> is<00:05:42.669> definitely<00:05:43.330> a<00:05:43.360> good<00:05:43.630> idea<00:05:43.960> and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
approach is definitely a good idea and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.810 
approach is definitely a good idea and
it<00:05:44.350> is<00:05:44.440> also<00:05:44.650> working<00:05:44.950> very<00:05:45.160> well<00:05:45.400> in<00:05:45.669> some

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
it is also working very well in some

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.909 
it is also working very well in some
cases<00:05:46.120> as<00:05:46.450> I've<00:05:46.630> showed<00:05:46.900> you<00:05:46.930> but<00:05:47.740> this

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
cases as I've showed you but this

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:49.890 
cases as I've showed you but this
prototype<00:05:48.340> is<00:05:48.669> still<00:05:48.880> far<00:05:49.210> away<00:05:49.389> from<00:05:49.570> a

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
prototype is still far away from a

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.450 
prototype is still far away from a
satisfying<00:05:50.440> solution<00:05:50.710> for<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.310> head

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
satisfying solution for the head

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.520 
satisfying solution for the head
glitching<00:05:51.850> issue<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.750> question<00:05:53.200> is<00:05:53.320> what<00:05:53.470> I

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
glitching issue the question is what I

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.070 
glitching issue the question is what I
silly<00:05:53.979> can<00:05:54.250> do<00:05:54.520> about<00:05:54.700> it<00:05:54.880> as<00:05:55.300> the<00:05:55.510> options<00:05:55.930> are

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
silly can do about it as the options are

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.020 
silly can do about it as the options are
limited<00:05:56.470> if<00:05:56.979> the<00:05:57.190> game<00:05:57.340> would<00:05:57.490> have<00:05:57.669> proper

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
limited if the game would have proper

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.150 
limited if the game would have proper
aiming<00:05:58.330> down<00:05:58.450> sights<00:05:58.510> animations<00:05:59.440> so<00:06:00.010> that

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
aiming down sights animations so that

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.620 
aiming down sights animations so that
you<00:06:00.280> see<00:06:00.550> the<00:06:00.700> other<00:06:00.820> player<00:06:01.060> actually

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
you see the other player actually

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.360 
you see the other player actually
raising<00:06:02.050> their<00:06:02.200> weapon<00:06:02.560> up<00:06:02.740> to<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:03.010> eye<00:06:03.039> level

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
raising their weapon up to the eye level

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.150 
raising their weapon up to the eye level
and<00:06:03.639> if<00:06:04.330> there<00:06:04.600> would<00:06:04.720> not<00:06:04.930> be<00:06:04.990> objects<00:06:05.800> on<00:06:06.010> the

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
and if there would not be objects on the

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.529 
and if there would not be objects on the
maps<00:06:06.340> that<00:06:06.520> allow<00:06:06.760> head<00:06:06.970> catching<00:06:07.360> in<00:06:07.479> the

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
maps that allow head catching in the

maps that allow head catching in the
first<00:06:07.750> place<00:06:07.990> then<00:06:08.620> this<00:06:08.889> would<00:06:09.070> be<00:06:09.250> a<00:06:09.280> much

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
first place then this would be a much

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.210 
first place then this would be a much
easier<00:06:09.580> fix<00:06:10.360> so<00:06:11.169> I'm<00:06:11.320> curious<00:06:11.560> to<00:06:11.889> see<00:06:12.039> what<00:06:12.190> I

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
easier fix so I'm curious to see what I

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.370 
easier fix so I'm curious to see what I
silly<00:06:12.610> will<00:06:12.760> do<00:06:12.970> with<00:06:13.210> this<00:06:13.419> prototype<00:06:13.900> over

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
silly will do with this prototype over

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.260 
silly will do with this prototype over
time<00:06:14.650> and<00:06:14.860> I<00:06:15.310> will<00:06:15.460> keep<00:06:15.580> you<00:06:15.700> updated<00:06:16.090> about
