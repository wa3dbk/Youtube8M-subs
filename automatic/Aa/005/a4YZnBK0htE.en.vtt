this is probably my number two team it
is<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.380> configurators<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.519> as<00:00:15.059> you<00:00:15.630> may<00:00:15.809> have

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170

because I have the flu still so we are
using<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.059> conflagration<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:34.230> all<00:00:34.350> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
using the conflagration for all the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
using the conflagration for all the
attacks<00:00:35.130> now<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> like<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> think

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
attacks now this is what I like to think

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.680 
attacks now this is what I like to think
of<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.770> high-risk<00:00:38.160> high-reward<00:00:38.690> because

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
of as high-risk high-reward because

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.799 
of as high-risk high-reward because
you're<00:00:40.230> putting<00:00:40.379> all<00:00:40.770> your<00:00:41.250> hope<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.660> day

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you're putting all your hope on the day

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.479 
you're putting all your hope on the day
don't<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> team<00:00:43.500> stack<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.070> critters

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
don't have a team stack of critters

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.940 
don't have a team stack of critters
which<00:00:44.820> most<00:00:45.780> people<00:00:45.960> don't<00:00:46.289> use<00:00:46.469> credit<00:00:46.710> so

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
which most people don't use credit so

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.100 
which most people don't use credit so
you<00:00:47.219> should<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.460> ground<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.270> if

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you should be ground with that and if

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.619 
you should be ground with that and if
they<00:00:49.260> use<00:00:49.410> mechanical<00:00:50.010> types<00:00:50.390> they're<00:00:51.390> pretty

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
they use mechanical types they're pretty

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.439 
they use mechanical types they're pretty
much<00:00:51.780> screwed<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.980> conflagration<00:00:53.449> it

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
much screwed with the conflagration it

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.040 
much screwed with the conflagration it
is<00:00:54.710> elemental<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.149> elemental<00:00:57.149> types<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
is elemental and elemental types have a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.529 
is elemental and elemental types have a
very<00:00:58.289> good<00:00:58.469> strength<00:00:58.800> against<00:00:59.579> mechanical

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
very good strength against mechanical

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.689 
very good strength against mechanical
types<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> witness<00:01:02.219> against

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
types but they have a witness against

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.830 
types but they have a witness against
water<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.390> kind<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:03.960> sucky<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.909> that's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
water which is kind of sucky so that's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.800 
water which is kind of sucky so that's
why<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.530> decided<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.640> use<00:01:08.670> every<00:01:09.630> single

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
why I decided not to use every single

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.039 
why I decided not to use every single
other<00:01:10.140> elemental<00:01:11.010> type<00:01:11.250> because<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
other elemental type because the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.130 
other elemental type because the
conflagration<00:01:13.350> II<00:01:13.770> usually<00:01:14.460> comes<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.180> people

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
conflagration II usually comes on people

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
conflagration II usually comes on people
that<00:01:16.170> are<00:01:16.500> mechanical<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.729> not<00:01:18.000> mechanical

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that are mechanical are not mechanical

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.280 
that are mechanical are not mechanical
they<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.320> elemental<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.670> i<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.600> define<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
they are elemental so i can define to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.460 
they are elemental so i can define to
that<00:01:22.590> weren't<00:01:22.890> mechanical<00:01:23.549> l<00:01:23.939> most<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:25.110> all

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that weren't mechanical l most are all

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.800 
that weren't mechanical l most are all
dragon<00:01:25.860> Hawks<00:01:26.070> will<00:01:26.490> come<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.390> they

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
dragon Hawks will come of this and they

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.390 
dragon Hawks will come of this and they
are<00:01:28.049> dragon<00:01:28.500> types<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.890> pretty<00:01:29.159> nice

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
are dragon types which is pretty nice

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.359 
are dragon types which is pretty nice
and<00:01:29.810> they<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> same<00:01:31.380> breath<00:01:31.680> which<00:01:32.070> will

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and they have the same breath which will

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.789 
and they have the same breath which will
give<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> added<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.810> burning<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
give the added of burning which is

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.370 
give the added of burning which is
fantastic<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.820> Confederate<00:01:36.570> because

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
fantastic for Confederate because

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.310 
fantastic for Confederate because
configure<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.130> does<00:01:38.549> an<00:01:38.939> extra<00:01:39.390> about<00:01:39.689> 200

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
configure it does an extra about 200

configure it does an extra about 200
damage<00:01:40.640> when<00:01:41.640> your<00:01:42.210> opponent<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.720> burnin

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200

and i'm just showing you pets that i
could<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.180> used<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.930> fel<00:01:55.110> flame<00:01:55.290> here

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
could have used like the fel flame here

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.499 
could have used like the fel flame here
that<00:01:55.890> has<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.549> score<00:01:56.790> sheriff<00:01:57.000> ability<00:01:57.329> which

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that has the score sheriff ability which

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.709 
that has the score sheriff ability which
is<00:01:57.719> really<00:01:58.170> really<00:01:58.469> good<00:01:59.270> especially<00:02:00.270> if<00:02:00.479> you

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
is really really good especially if you

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.179 
is really really good especially if you
load<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:00.930> teammate<00:02:01.350> with<00:02:01.469> elemental<00:02:01.979> types

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
