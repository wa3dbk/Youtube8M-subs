00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.750
 Hello, my name is Ali Kolomeets 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.040
 I want to share with you the experience of repair 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.230
 samovar if you fold the problem then 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.039
 joints between the body of the samovar 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.609
 and firebox to properly fix such 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.920
 samovar 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.840
 it must be completely dismantled 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.460
 trick to reassemble 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.550
 it's expensive it's long and it's more comfortable there 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.620
 repaired his very much easier and 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.070
 maybe someone will find my experience 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 useful the most important task which 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:51.079
 you have to decide how to clean it up 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.079
 scum and dirt from oxides the place died 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.390
 to get to the very bottom of the samovar and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.629
 I did not have to clean up the soldering point 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.700
 make a simple fixture 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.090
 kinda steel brush this brush i 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.210
 made of steel cable scraps 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:12.660
 who his soft wire there 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.229
 wooden handle using steel 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.830
 brush 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.729
 clean the seam between the body and 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.210
 in the firebox 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.610
 that's about the number on dirt quiche while 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.380
 try not to damage the weather on 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.440
 the body of joy itself with a soft brush 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.750
 apply a thick layer of flux in place 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.039
 solder up try to use fuse 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.039
 lead free 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.520
 for soldering it is necessary to use clean 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.940
 100% zinc free 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.940
 and lead 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 hack the necessary amount and you 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.270
 and fire preservative bam and the amount 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:04.890
 tin depends on the size of myself 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:06.689
 used instagram ordinary gas 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.009
 a ring is quite enough for that 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.009
 to melt hollow 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.209
 good head melting 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.370
 warm up and coffee 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.640
 this samovar have a soldering iron 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.909
 heat up until plus begins 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.909
 like 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.519
 finally melted naked one 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.500
 samovar try to tin 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.840
 matched directly to the very bottom 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.060
 which has been heated and processed 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.000
 flux did not touch the cold walls 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.970
 as you can see 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.810
 the seam looks pretty decent of course not 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.260
 five plus 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.150
 but the main leak is fixed don't forget 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.190
 how to wash the samovar before 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.530
 using thank you very much for
