00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.230
 all right 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.090
 Yes Yes 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.310
 but how about youtube friends talk to you 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.920
 bridges and good this tutorial I bring you 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.879
 a video of how to block a program 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.100
 with windows protection firewall 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.220
 to keep out connections over 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.770
 internet and to connect with programs 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.650
 that for example we have cracked 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.820
 programs that if we create ourselves and then 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:54.700
 we connect them to the internet will connect and 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.390
 it will detect that it is pirated and 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.370
 block here for example 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.309
 this time I'm going to block the 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.220
 adobe after effects cs4 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.480
 start 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.910
 the control panel that we are loaded 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.990
 where it says windows firewall and 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.990
 Advanced configuration 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.720
 we give him 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.700
 and now we're going to go to the tab 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.609
 entry rules 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.620
 our great several example here I 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.820
 I have blocked on my list 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.960
 we are going to 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.299
 action 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.299
 new rule action 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.530
 what kind of rule are we going to create 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.870
 create a program 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:57.430
 this is to block connections this 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.780
 is not abused and personalized either 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.780
 but we are going to use program in this 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.080
 occasion plus the next we are going to 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:10.240
 select the art executable from 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.020
 our program at home I have it 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:18.850
 Team Displace HD Program Adobe 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:22.480
 after effects cs4 support files 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.970
 after effects let's open let's go to the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.120
 next and we're going to click on this 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.230
 little eyelash let's put the one that says 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.600
 block the connection we go to the next 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.180
 let's leave the marked all go 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.450
 to the next one and we put a name for it 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.370
 example I'm going to put 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.370
 lock after 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.299
 cs4 that we are going to click on finish and 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.989
 we will have a rule that blocks that 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:59.030
 our after effects cs4 connects to 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.250
 internet so that it detects what is 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.859
 pirated or something like that here 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.420
 and good friends until this arrives 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:11.840
 tutorial I do not know I'm very sad too 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.750
 because I have a notification to him 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:18.270
 extra and let's say in my account 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.880

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.310

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.590
 programs I deleted the mesh all all 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.990

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.819
 delete all the program or all the 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.180
