00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.109
 hello and welcome her husband 80 they left this techno video 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.919
 on board the renovation 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.020
 of the turbo of your page 18 80 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.349
 using a kit 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.479
 gold we will dismount here 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:17.919
 unisys and crous we start well mounted 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.419
 in order to remove 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.569
 this part 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.569
 if some of these years the two parts of the turbo 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.859
 I 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.260
 allen a little coat early childhood 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.479
 in order to get ready 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:42.990
 here 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.170
 we increase 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.630
 how much can not all alone 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.190
 three against one 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.580
 apparently it will be necessary to separate these two parties upk concourent 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.720
 so 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.880
 avoid doing this with a screwdriver so here 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.700
 on the pieces 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.000
 membership fee 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.050
 and each side 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.979
 not without lifting by m 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.340
 once we can 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.540
 new recession raging 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.400
 You can pass 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.290
 tomorrow saturday 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.430
 the block 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.740
 but now 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.760
 fumes 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.760
 we will move to the next hallway 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.080
 right here 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 the circuit that we are going so 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 independence the prime minister 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.940
 the circuit 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.870
 it's here 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.320
 now we will be able to remove 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.690
 this part for a lot 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.140
 it also provides 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.500
 it's a vote 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.870
 a piece 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.969
 ap for patrick achi 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.849
 but 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.849
 now we will proceed to the most delicate phase 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.569
 be careful to be careful to follow the steps 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.550
 before unscrewing 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.520
 groups of the cold turbine 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.890
 you have to mark between lax 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.989
 and the turbie 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.790
 this will allow to look 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.159
 in the first round the customers since 2003 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.039
 I play 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.399
 equip yourself with a tool 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:38.699
 marking 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.229
 earlier 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.229
 take the time to do it gently 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.019
 it would be good for me 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.469
 we will therefore go to unscrewing for this chili nestled in the heart 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.710
 you see that it is 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.639
 this price 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.289
 France 3% 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:21.479
 no matter the brand 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.479
 Warning 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.969
 the meaning you like humor 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:28.979
 record 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.229
 ppr difficulty if you have trouble 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:33.999
 behind 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.249
 you advocate 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.089
 an ap trend why 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.289
 very small price 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.479
 but especially the web TV 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.719
 you put it behind at the level of taxes 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.349
 afp photo 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.859
 for these facts 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.859
 she's having major difficulties 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.599
 this 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.849
 after we started a meter the elements 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.199
 everything starts when you want 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.199
 the turbine 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.519
 flat circuit 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.619
 we will have to do it 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.619
 we take 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.099
 concepts 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.860
 watch out m 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.879
 he leaves the 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.689
 without forcing 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.809
 with a screwdriver 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.809
 why it's in the wall 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.270
 this part 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.199
 bursting 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.199
 come to toulouse nantes i want more 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.090
 this piece 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.020
 hence this piece 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.199
 it starts again 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.909
 it smells like powder 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.090
 coulommiers 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.419
 this part 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:02.969
 inside 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.930
 a small room 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.639
 that you saw 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.580
 in addition here 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.580
 or with a pattern 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.120
 destatis on this piece 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.379
 there is 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:17.550
 a segment 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.430
 honestly 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.680
 it will replace 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.680
 of the refilling phase 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.979
 authorities 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.909
 he will be replaced 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.490
 using a screwdriver or a little bit 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.089
 twisted 

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.089
 the atmosphere taken care 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:46.550
 we are sharp angles we need 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.559
 the small room 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:50.949
 trouble-free source of housing 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.110
 in the top 10 seems to me 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.120
 There you go 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.059
 it's great 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.330
 the same day in a single turn this part that actually 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.340
 divided 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.139
 in two parts that 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.749
 we can see here 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:05.740
 our axis 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.180
 with companies 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.240
 we tap 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.240
 I am 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:19.059
 there it is 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:20.650
 the encounter 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.059
 beaudoin I like what I do 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.949
 There you go 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.089
 we gently tap 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.119
 so we can say 

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:32.119
 for me 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:36.300
 there are still some 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.330
 here 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.569
 who will come out here 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.569
 There you go 

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:50.589
 the protection clause 

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:52.529
 in this part 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:55.039
 at the break 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:58.389
 here and again 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.610
 so we have our own world 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.089
 our action 

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:06.759
 here at this level 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.759
 We have 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.369
 it will also be necessary to replace 

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:15.319
 earrings 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:16.800
 is out 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.800
 of relief 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.939
 in the break had previously 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:26.649
 p the rest of the turbine 

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.649
 we also had this question 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.740
 for the body of the turbo while we could see that the pool 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:37.449
 he also enjoined 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:40.129
 all risks we understand 

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:42.379
 with the screwdriver 

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.099
 so we understand why we change 

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:48.240
 here 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.270
 opening up
