00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:24.529
 hello second lesson in the whole mass d 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.390
 in which I will tell you how to impose 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.050
 texture and modify the object and using 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.599
 here these modes here today talk about 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.160
 polygons mode point and overlay mode 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:41.269
 texture but let's start creating textures 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.730
 regular club now we have a cube and 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:49.190
 make it editable click here 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:52.010
 here so now click create 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.390
 texture panel menu create new 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.260
 stuff I click on it twice and 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:08.060
 only adjust the chat you need 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:11.509
 well i will make it red there again 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.200
 create proper stuff and have another 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.200
 colors to do 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.340
 and once again create the same different color 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.080
 By the way, there is an additional 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.270
 color settings there diffusion itself 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.190
 lighting battle transparency is glittering 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.910
 all that you ca n't even you 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:40.590
 enjoy now go in 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.460
 polygon editing here this 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.470
 here is a cube to multiply and as if we are now 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.729
 we can select one of the parties and our 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.560
 cube we allocate 1 sides and on it 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.259
 apply textures for this you need to hold 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.619
 drag the button on the desired texture to 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.930
 polygon then we paint so one 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.570
 side but if we aren't highlighted and color 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:09.239
 and don't single out one polygon and granddaughter will 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:12.470
 dye yes we will paint the weight of this 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.470
 paint different here 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.549
 so but something we have like this 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.239
 it turned out I will not paint that side 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.549
 with a new business 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.819
 but for told now I will explain how 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.739
 add exactly the textures are ready for 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.319
 this judicial material 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.329
 we go into it and here it is 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.269
 tab texture click on the arrow 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.829
 and upload image 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:47.060
 Well, choose the image you want 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:50.329
 but I donâ€™t know we can do that here 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.760
 still such interpolation not to grow 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.790
 how she seemed not to 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.620
 blurred click it and click without 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:05.659
 ever be felt well and choose 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:10.060
 your polygon and paint it like you 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:14.359
 see now around this sword 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:17.569
 black outlines to avoid them on 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.579
 the texture should be shorter 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.470
 make it transparent to some 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.859
 places and that it was transparent 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:31.819
 go alpha put a tick and load 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:34.609
 it's the same texture and as you can see 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:39.250
 there is no such black stuff even 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.250
 shining on the other side of the cube 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.590
 yes I just figured it out well 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.390
 Now we are going to edit the object 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.340
 remind once again if you do not 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.020
 Objects are edited, that is , the mode and 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.500
 simply will not work and so did 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.230
 what happened to yours? 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.440
 change add for this we go team 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.920
 but the team frame is subdivided and here 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.989
 here click on choose as you need 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:20.519
 subdivide i will take three so here we are 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.519
 there appeared additional polygons 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.460
 so what did they do know let's transform it 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:35.189
 let me think what you can club 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.189
 transform 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.600
 but for now let's make a pyramid so go in 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.370
 polygons select the upper part 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.370
 polygons itself top 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.550
 and go into less reduction mode and 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.350
 reduce as you see there is something that 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.740
 more polygon pyramid is not very 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:11.470
 it turns out, but if we remove all these 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:19.750
 polygons you survived only upwards must 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:25.680
 get here's our pyramid so well 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:32.220
 what do we do it back let's polygons 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:39.370
 no so here so polygon we added 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:43.410
 now choose from it something but i 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.410
 squeeze such a thing 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.879
 for this we want cortes it to 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.250
 squeeze out just if we are without this 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:55.879
 Functions that I want to show 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.860
 then it will be here and so leave it 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:01.699
 in some cases, not very 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:05.180
 go to create a frame and squeeze here 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.620
 here is where the offset is writing that number 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.569
 which you want to extrude if you 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.300
 you want to imitate it yourself 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.810
 should be minus but if we meet 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.990
 out 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:20.270
 then you do not need a minus but I will squeeze out 20 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.840
 she left wait wait a little too 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:28.479
 communicate squeeze this juice 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.479
 here's how you see some part squeezed out 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.500
 to squeeze out 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:44.210
 put a minus inside the transition 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:46.969
 then squeezed inside now show 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:50.150
 you point click here this here 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:53.210
 editing by points we have 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.949
 there are such black points here are those 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.770
 points that you can change them not 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:59.719
 position to make 2 points too 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.979
 decode well, that is, we go skeleton 

00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:07.779
 teams and subdivide so well expand 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:07.779
 I do not know is about to drop here 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:27.520
 Well, something like this does not turn out 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:30.270
 I know what it is but I'll show you purely 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:38.889
 examples so you can see how you can 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:42.280
 edited using these modes well 

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:45.150
 like everyone subscribe like 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.150
 until
