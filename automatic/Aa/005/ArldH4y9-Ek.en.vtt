00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
stop at the hub on xen you probably the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.619 
stop at the hub on xen you probably the
main<00:00:40.050> reason<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.739> actually<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> time<00:00:42.149> because<00:00:42.510> i

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
main reason is actually a time because i

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.549 
main reason is actually a time because i
know<00:00:42.899> i<00:00:43.440> know<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.190> i<00:00:44.219> would<00:00:44.370> love<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.640> again

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and it would probably take up so much

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.700 
and it would probably take up so much
time<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.420> yeah<00:00:48.570> i<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:49.079> really<00:00:49.200> addicting
