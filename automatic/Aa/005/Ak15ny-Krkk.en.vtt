player<00:00:14.820> which<00:00:15.330> I've<00:00:15.480> already<00:00:15.660> gutted

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
player which I've already gutted

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.429 
player which I've already gutted
now<00:00:17.130> first<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.760> cut<00:00:18.060> out<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.359> front<00:00:18.600> area<00:00:18.930> where

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
now first I cut out the front area where

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.650 
now first I cut out the front area where
there<00:00:19.590> used<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> DVD<00:00:20.520> slot<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.390> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
there used to be the DVD slot and I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.439 
there used to be the DVD slot and I
installed<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.260> USB<00:00:22.859> splitter<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.119> now<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.269> have

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
installed a USB splitter so now you have

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.900 
installed a USB splitter so now you have
three<00:00:24.630> USB<00:00:24.960> ports<00:00:25.109> on<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> front<00:00:25.849> on<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
three USB ports on the front on the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.810 
three USB ports on the front on the
inside<00:00:28.070> here's<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> back<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.609> USB

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
inside here's the back of the USB

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.459 
inside here's the back of the USB
splitter<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.599> put<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> cheap<00:00:32.300> computer<00:00:33.300> fan<00:00:33.630> with

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
splitter I put a cheap computer fan with

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.100 
splitter I put a cheap computer fan with
blue<00:00:34.649> LEDs<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:35.370> light<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:35.760> at<00:00:35.880> night<00:00:36.020> and<00:00:37.020> I

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
blue LEDs so light up at night and I

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.080 
blue LEDs so light up at night and I
stuck<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.559> hard<00:00:37.770> drive<00:00:38.040> now<00:00:38.610> we're<00:00:38.760> gonna<00:00:38.879> put

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
stuck the hard drive now we're gonna put

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.479 
stuck the hard drive now we're gonna put
in<00:00:39.180> here<00:00:39.290> now<00:00:40.290> first<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.800> made<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> electrical

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
in here now first I made the electrical

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.790 
in here now first I made the electrical
connections<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> hard<00:00:42.420> drive

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
connections to the hard drive

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.010 
connections to the hard drive
from<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> fan<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:45.300> we'll<00:00:45.570> plug<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.320> USB

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
from the fan and we'll plug in the USB

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.950 
from the fan and we'll plug in the USB
splitter<00:00:50.030> next<00:00:51.030> we're<00:00:51.270> gonna<00:00:51.329> probably<00:00:51.600> want

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
splitter next we're gonna probably want

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.319 
splitter next we're gonna probably want
to<00:00:52.020> put<00:00:52.230> maybe<00:00:52.469> some<00:00:52.559> eight<00:00:52.860> gig<00:00:53.129> USB<00:00:54.059> flash

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
to put maybe some eight gig USB flash

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.420 
to put maybe some eight gig USB flash
drives<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.840> here<00:00:55.020> later<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.800> additional

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
drives in here later on for additional

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.250 
drives in here later on for additional
storage<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:57.449> anything<00:00:57.629> else<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.050> might

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
storage or anything else you can might

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.330 
storage or anything else you can might
want<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.219> let's<00:00:59.430> plug<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.120> second<00:01:01.340> USB

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
want so let's plug in a second USB

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.490 
want so let's plug in a second USB
splitter<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> now<00:01:06.600> we<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.200> hook<00:01:07.290> this

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
splitter and so now we have to hook this

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710 
splitter and so now we have to hook this
hard<00:01:07.680> drive<00:01:07.799> off<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.510> traditional<00:01:09.510> hard

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
plug it into our USB splitter that way

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.700 
plug it into our USB splitter that way
we<00:01:47.820> only<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.240> run<00:01:48.390> one<00:01:48.720> USB<00:01:49.020> cable<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.500> the

we only have to run one USB cable to the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.300 
we only have to run one USB cable to the
actual<00:01:50.040> computer<00:01:52.580> now<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.920> might<00:01:56.070> want<00:01:56.250> to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
actual computer now you might want to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.980 
actual computer now you might want to
run<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.490> power<00:01:56.730> second<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.420> want<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> run<00:01:57.780> the

run a power second I want to run the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.880 
run a power second I want to run the
power<00:01:58.170> supply<00:01:58.620> to<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:59.930> but<00:02:00.930> first<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.680> here's

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
power supply to it but first so here's

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.970 
power supply to it but first so here's
your<00:02:05.010> power<00:02:05.250> supply<00:02:06.230> you<00:02:07.230> want<00:02:07.410> to<00:02:07.500> cut<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
your power supply you want to cut a

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.040 
your power supply you want to cut a
channel<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.850> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.180> DVD<00:02:09.810> player

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
channel in the back of the DVD player

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.110 
channel in the back of the DVD player
where<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.740> are<00:02:11.010> gonna<00:02:11.220> put<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.910> power

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
where you are gonna put in the power

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.780 
where you are gonna put in the power
this<00:02:12.450> was<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.780> old<00:02:12.900> power<00:02:13.140> cord<00:02:13.500> spot<00:02:13.980> but<00:02:14.760> I

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
this was the old power cord spot but I

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.670 
this was the old power cord spot but I
put<00:02:15.480> some<00:02:15.510> electrical<00:02:16.020> tape<00:02:16.050> on<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> make

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
put some electrical tape on it to make

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.280 
put some electrical tape on it to make
it<00:02:16.830> softer<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:17.550> doesn't<00:02:17.790> cut<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.060> wire<00:02:18.290> run

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
it softer so it doesn't cut the wire run

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.750 
it softer so it doesn't cut the wire run
