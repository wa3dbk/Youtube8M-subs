teach your kids to win fiscally you know

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.170 
teach your kids to win fiscally you know
with<00:01:26.290> money<00:01:26.590> but<00:01:27.460> there's<00:01:27.640> so<00:01:27.820> many<00:01:27.939> key

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
with money but there's so many key

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.789 
with money but there's so many key
qualities<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.780> they<00:01:28.899> need<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.110> have<00:01:29.409> just<00:01:29.619> to

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
qualities that they need to have just to

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.320 
qualities that they need to have just to
win<00:01:29.950> in<00:01:30.100> life<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.580> general<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:31.180> I<00:01:31.299> think

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
win in life in general and I think

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.060 
win in life in general and I think
respect<00:01:31.960> is<00:01:32.140> one<00:01:32.290> of<00:01:32.409> those<00:01:32.500> things
