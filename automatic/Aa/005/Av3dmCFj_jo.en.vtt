00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.849
 what do you think of that 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.849
 and it's not good that you win it gives you three points 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.669
 sitting in the preparation 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.150
 to be able to state that it is good against this team 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.170
 Winning to close because they have the competition in two weeks 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.189
 in four weeks 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.189
 if I had anyway and that is what the physical are 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.180
 I think it's not really a defensive aspect 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.569
 how many chances to give away to suspend 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.969
 After all, it is not very easy to borrow 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.969
 that's wrong during the elections 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.559
 nigel glad that we won this competition 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:58.979
 it is good for the moral of the team and very well it is also true that we have one 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.400
 game sent in for the spaces 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.999
 it is not too much to attach value to the result 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.039
 I have this party 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:12.599
 investments in ajax i think you know after all that's why there is in this case 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.169
 not its value 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.919
 exhibition week increased he shouldn't be for us 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.919
 heerenveen is not childish 10 this is my debut 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.199
 but I do know that we are here to log where this type of silent that I have 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.229
 deeply moving 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.229
 yes what is now close again at that time 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.879
 kraft has made it strange to me 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:36.849
 he thought 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:38.259
 he a conditioner 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.050
 9 or thanks in short 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.930
 season a target group of the channel nv quotes an analyst 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.009
 this year 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.380
 they have to calculate 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.479
 residents were sent home 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.659
 the remainder of the competition 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:56.360
 become a sir yourself 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.749
 in a few too many bad passes, just a few good attacks 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.710
 three of the base and waal at that time the field was large and 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:07.650
 we had to go all the way back 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.259
 after our own half because shoes and last name could come out easily 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.770
 divide two halves better I think 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.280
 and played better and 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.600
 it scored Monday
