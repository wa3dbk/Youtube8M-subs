00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.070
 cutting area by the way also 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.710

 to electronic arts sims 3 documents 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.610
 dawn landes and we paste the file 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.619
 ok now we open the launcher download 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.050
 you have to download and you have to 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.180
 appear the logo and we select the 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.880
 motto we will not make you install if you give 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.070
 double click of will happen to install 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.950
 automatically then these are the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.409
 install and move on to this then then 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.700
 nothing guys I'm going to stop here in that 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.340
 moment and I go crazy 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.240
 ok but before going back here it will be clear 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:36.850
 One little thing what happens is that 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.020
 the pix the fix according to the sims weaves in the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.270
 first page where one of your 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.140
 they download they do not tell me exactly 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.180
 where to place it and on the same page if 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.490
 you g which is where they placed the picks 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.039
 for apart for the boats says that the 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.689
 placed in the folder I'm librario 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.860
 to place the folder a lot but if 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.799
 someone comes to them to present some 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.350

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.350

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.509
 rid of and then it is to clarify that yes 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.479
 if someone gets to run errors of the 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.000
 insssep and whatnot to do that 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.019
 before in case and well it was for 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.790
 clarify them and now yes we go back ok no 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.950
 efe returned once it has been 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.489
 installed the set will have them appear 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.069
 this the name of the success set ready and you 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.930
 we'll give ok we wait until it 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.510
 close him 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.489
 content installer and here the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.799
 content of an installed content we 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.469
 will have to appear this little symbol of 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.969
 admiration and here we will have to 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.890
 appear content 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.230
 sometimes it disappears immediately and 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.600
 all the content that is and others that do not 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.210
 it is 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.910
 this encounter exists 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.740
 if he 's here we should see that he already 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.590
 installed the content that we can close 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.910
 out minimize well 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.270
 we go again to the folder 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.100
 and then run the file 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.720
 greenhouse glass and the file is 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.090
 mariette we will copy or cut 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.410
 but I will listen to it we take the document 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.600
 be electronic the sims 3 mods 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.600
 packaging and paste the files 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.480
 action 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.170
 and ready we would have the picks in case 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.000
 perhaps already remember that if they reach 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.470
 have problems try to change the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.880
 Glass greenhouse to the folder 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.130
 free and make them our folder is 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.200
 then since we have the tics and now 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.600
 we copy we have to select the 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.910
 semergen file we will create to copy 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.080
 little bit of nela to copy do not forget to 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.080
 cut copy and we go to the 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:57.350
 electronic documents the sims 3 and in 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.380
 the physical club folder and here we will stick 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.210
 the file here I do not know if here here they 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.710
 they have to appear copy and replace 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.150
 unless you have deleted the file 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.480
 then you should give them to copy the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.879
 start it is important to have this file 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.390
 just in case the flour cell folder that 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.019
 he is here he has his files 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.039
 and so that 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.040
 then up to here it would be many thanks

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.100
 if you do not have the mod folder, you create it and 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.330
 if they do not have the layer 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:36.540
 and if we did not have it, it was possible to file 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.060
 which is in the link in the file 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.370
