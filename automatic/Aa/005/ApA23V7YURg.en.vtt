00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
think the last one I did was back in

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.670 
think the last one I did was back in
March<00:00:06.210> I've<00:00:06.480> just<00:00:06.660> been<00:00:06.779> trying<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.259> spend

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
March I've just been trying to spend

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.470 
March I've just been trying to spend
less<00:00:07.830> money<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.160> books<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.760> actually<00:00:09.269> read

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
less money on books and actually read

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.820 
less money on books and actually read
the<00:00:09.660> books<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.019> own<00:00:10.230> because<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.650> have<00:00:10.800> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
the books that I own because I have a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.919 
the books that I own because I have a
time<00:00:11.070> that<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.429> just<00:00:11.700> haven't<00:00:11.969> read<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.840> think

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
time that I just haven't read so I think

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.870 
time that I just haven't read so I think
it<00:00:13.230> makes<00:00:13.349> more<00:00:13.559> sense<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:14.009> read<00:00:14.160> those<00:00:14.400> before

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
it makes more sense to read those before

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.730 
it makes more sense to read those before
I<00:00:14.910> go<00:00:15.240> out<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.509> get<00:00:15.570> new<00:00:15.750> books<00:00:15.929> even<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.710> I

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
I go out and get new books even so I

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.170 
I go out and get new books even so I
couldn't<00:00:17.039> stop<00:00:17.220> myself<00:00:17.279> completely<00:00:17.880> from

economy<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.110> have<00:01:25.530> no<00:01:25.650> idea<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.100> picked<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.490> up

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
economy I have no idea I picked this up

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
economy I have no idea I picked this up
number<00:01:26.939> one<00:01:27.090> because<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.450> was<00:01:27.570> very<00:01:27.810> cheap<00:01:28.080> i

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
number one because it was very cheap i

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.630 
number one because it was very cheap i
think<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.619> 50<00:01:28.770> cents<00:01:29.159> at<00:01:29.280> goodwill

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
think it was like 50 cents at goodwill

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.609 
think it was like 50 cents at goodwill
and<00:01:29.850> number<00:01:30.270> two<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> do<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.079> reading<00:01:31.320> stories

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and number two I do like reading stories

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.980 
and number two I do like reading stories
about<00:01:31.860> food<00:01:32.100> especially<00:01:32.369> stories<00:01:33.119> about<00:01:33.450> how

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
about food especially stories about how

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.469 
about food especially stories about how
food<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.009> food<00:01:35.369> ingredients<00:01:35.939> shape<00:01:36.299> our

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
food and food ingredients shape our

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.090 
food and food ingredients shape our
world<00:01:36.600> cultures<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.530> think<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.070> just

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
world cultures I think that is just

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100 
world cultures I think that is just
really<00:01:38.430> cool<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.850> hopefully<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.900> it

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
really cool so hopefully I like this it

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.749 
really cool so hopefully I like this it
might<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.470> little<00:01:40.590> dry<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.610> about

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
might be a little dry because it's about

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.429 
might be a little dry because it's about
salt<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.329> next<00:01:42.509> book<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.750> picked<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.079> a

with not being as awesome as you want to
be<00:04:33.050> but<00:04:33.230> also<00:04:33.410> it's<00:04:34.070> about<00:04:34.310> keeping<00:04:34.460> hope<00:04:34.790> even

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
be but also it's about keeping hope even

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.940 
be but also it's about keeping hope even
when<00:04:35.210> you<00:04:35.360> realize<00:04:35.660> that<00:04:35.690> you<00:04:36.440> probably

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
when you realize that you probably

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.409 
when you realize that you probably
aren't<00:04:37.280> going<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.669> be<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:37.910> person<00:04:38.120> that<00:04:38.270> you

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
aren't going to be the person that you

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:39.850 
aren't going to be the person that you
dreamt<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.780> would<00:04:38.900> be<00:04:39.050> when<00:04:39.380> you<00:04:39.530> were<00:04:39.650> a

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
dreamt you would be when you were a

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.170 
dreamt you would be when you were a
young<00:04:40.100> person<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.790> probably<00:04:41.030> sounds

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
young person that probably sounds

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.640 
young person that probably sounds
depressing<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.930> yeah<00:04:42.080> it's<00:04:42.290> a<00:04:42.350> little<00:04:42.560> bit

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
depressing and yeah it's a little bit

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.500 
depressing and yeah it's a little bit
depressing<00:04:42.919> but<00:04:43.220> I<00:04:43.430> just<00:04:43.850> loved<00:04:44.210> this<00:04:44.330> book

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
depressing but I just loved this book

depressing but I just loved this book
and<00:04:44.690> I<00:04:44.780> thought<00:04:44.930> the<00:04:45.050> characters<00:04:45.470> were<00:04:45.500> so

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
and I thought the characters were so

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.710 
and I thought the characters were so
great<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.550> writing<00:04:46.910> is<00:04:46.970> fantastic<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.660> was

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
great the writing is fantastic it was

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.180

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
I've ever read but it inspired me to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.840 
I've ever read but it inspired me to
pick<00:04:51.169> up<00:04:51.290> a<00:04:51.380> different<00:04:51.710> book<00:04:51.800> by<00:04:51.950> her<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.370> also

pick up a different book by her and also

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.330 
pick up a different book by her and also
it<00:04:53.150> inspired<00:04:53.479> me<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.660> pick<00:04:54.440> up<00:04:54.680> this<00:04:55.160> book

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
it inspired me to pick up this book

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.820 
it inspired me to pick up this book
which<00:04:55.550> is<00:04:55.729> her<00:04:55.940> retelling<00:04:56.780> of<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.320> bell<00:04:57.590> jar

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
which is her retelling of the bell jar

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.409 
which is her retelling of the bell jar
essentially<00:04:58.610> which<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:58.970> haven't<00:04:59.270> read<00:04:59.389> it

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
essentially which I haven't read it

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.480 
essentially which I haven't read it
sadly<00:04:59.930> so<00:05:00.200> I<00:05:00.229> can't<00:05:00.530> tell<00:05:00.710> you<00:05:00.800> how<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.310> two

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
sadly so I can't tell you how the two

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.219 
sadly so I can't tell you how the two
are<00:05:01.520> connected<00:05:01.850> but<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:02.600> know<00:05:02.660> this<00:05:02.840> is<00:05:02.990> about<00:05:03.169> a

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
are connected but I know this is about a

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.860 
are connected but I know this is about a
young<00:05:03.560> girl<00:05:03.620> who<00:05:04.220> is<00:05:04.520> I<00:05:05.150> think<00:05:05.360> she<00:05:05.720> is<00:05:05.750> a

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
young girl who is I think she is a

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.740 
young girl who is I think she is a
literary<00:05:06.169> student<00:05:06.680> living<00:05:07.370> in<00:05:07.520> or<00:05:08.120> near<00:05:08.450> New

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
literary student living in or near New

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.870 
literary student living in or near New
York<00:05:08.900> City<00:05:09.139> so<00:05:09.500> I<00:05:09.740> hope<00:05:10.010> it<00:05:10.190> has<00:05:10.310> kind<00:05:10.700> of<00:05:10.790> the

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
York City so I hope it has kind of the

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.580 
York City so I hope it has kind of the
same<00:05:11.030> vibe<00:05:11.240> as<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.660> interestings<00:05:12.139> because

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
same vibe as the interestings because

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.469 
same vibe as the interestings because
that<00:05:12.889> was<00:05:13.100> just<00:05:13.340> such<00:05:13.729> a<00:05:13.760> good<00:05:13.970> book<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.300> I'm

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.540 
that was just such a good book and I'm
expecting<00:05:14.900> this<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.169> be<00:05:15.200> similar<00:05:15.770> if<00:05:16.040> I<00:05:16.340> like

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
expecting this to be similar if I like
