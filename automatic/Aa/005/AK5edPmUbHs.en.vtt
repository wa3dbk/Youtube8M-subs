00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
i have the you can see the shade layer

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.859 
i have the you can see the shade layer
here<00:01:49.409> let<00:01:50.100> me<00:01:50.159> show<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.369> december<00:01:50.880> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
here let me show you december so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.469 
here let me show you december so
december<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.649> eaves<00:01:52.829> are<00:01:53.369> designed<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.090> allow

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
december the eaves are designed to allow

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.980 
december the eaves are designed to allow
the<00:01:54.509> sunlight<00:01:55.049> fully<00:01:55.350> inside<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.810> as<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the sunlight fully inside and as the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.219 
the sunlight fully inside and as the
summer<00:01:58.259> bakes<00:01:59.100> down<00:01:59.689> the<00:02:00.689> windows<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
summer bakes down the windows and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.060 
summer bakes down the windows and
trumbull<00:02:01.890> all<00:02:01.950> are<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:02.460> covered<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.570> shade

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
trumbull all are all covered with shade

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.069 
trumbull all are all covered with shade
from<00:02:05.070> these<00:02:05.280> long<00:02:05.579> eaves<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.750> idea<00:02:06.869> is

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
from these long eaves so the idea is

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.979 
from these long eaves so the idea is
that<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> summer<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.489> thing<00:02:08.989> this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
that in the summer this thing this

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.960 
that in the summer this thing this
arrangement<00:02:10.500> would<00:02:10.950> heat<00:02:11.250> these

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
arrangement would heat these

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.660 
arrangement would heat these
these<00:02:12.970> four<00:02:13.270> living<00:02:13.600> spaces<00:02:13.990> nicely<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.550> each

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
these four living spaces nicely so each

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.190 
these four living spaces nicely so each
one<00:02:15.880> of<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.030> houses<00:02:16.210> is<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.570> passive<00:02:17.050> solar

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
one of the houses is a passive solar

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.860 
one of the houses is a passive solar
house<00:02:17.440> all<00:02:17.650> by<00:02:17.680> itself<00:02:18.210> and<00:02:19.210> then<00:02:19.660> in<00:02:19.780> the

winter<00:02:20.020> I'm<00:02:20.560> sorry<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.040> summer<00:02:21.420> when

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
winter I'm sorry in the summer when

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.120

things are baking down this big
courtyard<00:02:24.580> provides<00:02:25.180> lots<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.840> lots<00:02:26.020> of<00:02:26.820> cool

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
courtyard provides lots and lots of cool

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.340 
courtyard provides lots and lots of cool
local<00:02:28.150> air<00:02:28.480> much<00:02:29.050> like<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> dogtrot<00:02:29.860> house

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
local air much like a dogtrot house

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.320 
local air much like a dogtrot house
would<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.640> then<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.300> course

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
would and and then of course

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.600 
would and and then of course
theoretically<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.710> whole<00:02:38.920> area<00:02:39.340> down

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
theoretically this this whole area down

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.220 
theoretically this this whole area down
here<00:02:39.940> could<00:02:40.330> be<00:02:40.420> very<00:02:40.630> nice<00:02:40.810> living<00:02:41.140> space

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
here could be very nice living space

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
here could be very nice living space
outdoor<00:02:41.950> living<00:02:42.070> space<00:02:42.690> during<00:02:43.690> good<00:02:43.930> weather

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
outdoor living space during good weather

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.770 
outdoor living space during good weather
so<00:02:45.250> now<00:02:45.340> let<00:02:45.460> me<00:02:45.520> show<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.760> how<00:02:46.150> each<00:02:46.480> one<00:02:46.510> of

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
so now let me show you how each one of

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.960 
so now let me show you how each one of
these<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.950> let<00:02:48.490> me<00:02:48.580> explain<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.420> reason<00:02:49.900> I

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
these and let me explain the reason I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.480 
these and let me explain the reason I
designed<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.180> as<00:02:52.420> four<00:02:52.720> separate<00:02:53.230> houses

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
designed this as four separate houses

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.740 
designed this as four separate houses
first<00:02:54.490> of<00:02:54.640> all<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.760> couldn't<00:02:55.300> I<00:02:55.510> couldn't

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
first of all I couldn't I couldn't

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.930 
first of all I couldn't I couldn't
possibly<00:02:56.200> as<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.710> tiny<00:02:57.010> house<00:02:57.160> blogger<00:02:57.580> and

possibly as a tiny house blogger and
simple<00:02:58.750> living<00:02:58.900> advocate<00:02:59.410> couldn't<00:02:59.800> possibly

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
simple living advocate couldn't possibly

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.390 
simple living advocate couldn't possibly
design<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:00.970> big<00:03:01.680> 1,400<00:03:02.680> square<00:03:02.770> foot<00:03:03.070> house<00:03:03.220> I

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
design a big 1,400 square foot house I

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.320 
design a big 1,400 square foot house I
just<00:03:03.580> wouldn't<00:03:03.790> feel<00:03:03.880> right<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:05.410> instead<00:03:05.530> I

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
just wouldn't feel right so instead I

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.480 
just wouldn't feel right so instead I
designed<00:03:07.330> these<00:03:07.630> four<00:03:07.930> houses<00:03:08.140> if<00:03:08.980> my<00:03:09.280> plan

designed these four houses if my plan

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.020 
designed these four houses if my plan
wins<00:03:10.650> my<00:03:11.650> hope<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.040> free<00:03:12.340> green<00:03:12.580> we<00:03:12.850> then

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
wins my hope is that free green we then

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.130 
wins my hope is that free green we then
develop<00:03:13.750> this<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:15.430> concept<00:03:16.390> farther<00:03:16.780> and

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
develop this this concept farther and

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.530 
develop this this concept farther and

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
produce a set of plans that would

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.840 
produce a set of plans that would
essentially<00:03:20.050> include<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:21.010> designs<00:03:21.340> for<00:03:21.489> four

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
essentially include the designs for four

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.240 
essentially include the designs for four
or<00:03:21.880> tiny<00:03:22.209> houses<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:23.530> people<00:03:23.830> could<00:03:23.950> arrange

or tiny houses that people could arrange

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.460 
or tiny houses that people could arrange
in<00:03:24.489> whatever<00:03:24.670> configuration<00:03:25.360> they<00:03:25.989> like<00:03:26.200> this

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
in whatever configuration they like this

configuration other configurations they

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.710 
configuration other configurations they
could<00:03:29.920> build<00:03:30.130> one<00:03:30.340> big<00:03:30.550> house<00:03:31.000> when<00:03:31.420> they<00:03:31.570> have

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
could build one big house when they have

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.949 
could build one big house when they have
money<00:03:31.989> and<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.530> add<00:03:33.370> on<00:03:33.550> as<00:03:33.880> they<00:03:34.120> as<00:03:34.390> the

funds became available or they could

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.660 
funds became available or they could
build<00:03:37.780> multiple<00:03:38.770> versions<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.550> know

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
build multiple versions you know

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.630 
build multiple versions you know
variations<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.660> these<00:03:40.930> different<00:03:41.170> units<00:03:41.650> and

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
variations of these different units and

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.490 
variations of these different units and
whatever<00:03:43.000> configuration<00:03:43.209> work<00:03:43.989> best<00:03:44.290> for

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
whatever configuration work best for

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.100 
whatever configuration work best for
them<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.270> other<00:03:46.330> words<00:03:46.540> i'm<00:03:46.750> really<00:03:46.989> going

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
them so in other words i'm really going

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.190 
them so in other words i'm really going
after<00:03:47.290> flexibility<00:03:48.600> but<00:03:49.600> i'm<00:03:49.750> also<00:03:49.900> going

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
after flexibility but i'm also going

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.930 
after flexibility but i'm also going
after<00:03:51.120> advocating<00:03:52.120> for<00:03:52.330> less<00:03:53.170> is<00:03:53.350> more<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.850> let

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
after advocating for less is more so let

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.630 
after advocating for less is more so let
me<00:03:55.000> take<00:03:55.209> off<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.600> roof<00:03:55.830> of<00:03:56.830> these<00:03:57.070> things<00:03:57.280> and

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640

give<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.150> closer<00:03:58.480> look<00:03:58.840> at<00:03:59.910> at<00:04:00.910> the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
give you a closer look at at the

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.699 
give you a closer look at at the
interiors

it yourselves as you see I've got all
the<00:04:19.959> different<00:04:20.949> components<00:04:21.489> and<00:04:21.639> layers

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
the different components and layers

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.360 
the different components and layers
which<00:04:22.270> just<00:04:22.570> makes<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:23.020> little<00:04:23.110> bit<00:04:23.320> easier

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.980 

so<00:04:27.370> let's<00:04:27.490> start<00:04:27.699> over<00:04:27.789> here<00:04:28.060> with<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.240> 16<00:04:28.810> by
