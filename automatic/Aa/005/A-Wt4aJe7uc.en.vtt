going to talk about another green food
how<00:00:08.550> hollow<00:00:08.880> it's<00:00:09.630> fitting<00:00:10.019> then<00:00:10.170> we're<00:00:10.320> going

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
how hollow it's fitting then we're going

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.049 
how hollow it's fitting then we're going
to<00:00:10.530> be<00:00:10.620> doing<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.010> comparison<00:00:11.610> here<00:00:11.820> because

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
known as the father of wheat grass but

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.380 
known as the father of wheat grass but
he<00:00:15.960> also<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:17.100> very<00:00:17.369> deeply<00:00:17.580> involved<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.240> this

study of alfalfa and he felt that both

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.939 
study of alfalfa and he felt that both
foods<00:00:21.750> were<00:00:21.869> important<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.859> other

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
foods were important and the other

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.790 
foods were important and the other
scientists<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.580> work<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:23.910> dr.<00:00:24.210> Schnabel

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
scientists that work with dr. Schnabel

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.290 
scientists that work with dr. Schnabel
do<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:26.039> as<00:00:26.130> much<00:00:26.220> work<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.670> mouth<00:00:26.820> alpha<00:00:27.240> as

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
do just as much work on mouth alpha as

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.990 
do just as much work on mouth alpha as
we<00:00:27.420> dress<00:00:27.660> we're<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.680> compare<00:00:29.070> here<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
we dress we're going to compare here to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.759 
we dress we're going to compare here to
alfalfa<00:00:30.720> products<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> first<00:00:31.439> thing<00:00:31.650> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
alfalfa products the first thing you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.889 
alfalfa products the first thing you
notice<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.610> two<00:00:32.660> products<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
notice is that the two products have a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
notice is that the two products have a
different<00:00:34.500> packaging<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.370> glass

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
different packaging this is a glass

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.610 
different packaging this is a glass
that's<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> plastic<00:00:36.390> bottle<00:00:36.780> petrochemical

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that's the plastic bottle petrochemical

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.889 
that's the plastic bottle petrochemical
plastic<00:00:38.040> bottle<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.120> glass<00:00:39.360> bottle

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
plastic bottle this is a glass bottle

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.020 
plastic bottle this is a glass bottle
now<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.950> thing<00:00:41.160> about<00:00:41.190> all<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.760> Heinz

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
now the thing about all of Heinz

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.660 
now the thing about all of Heinz
products<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.200> they<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.520> special

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
products is that they have this special

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.420 
products is that they have this special
seal<00:00:45.300> inside<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> metal<00:00:46.260> cap<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:47.100> glass

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
seal inside of a metal cap with glass

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.119 
seal inside of a metal cap with glass
and<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.390> allows<00:00:48.780> Pines<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.829> able<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and that allows Pines to be able to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.340 
and that allows Pines to be able to
remove<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> oxygen<00:00:51.030> from<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> bottle<00:00:51.809> so

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
remove the oxygen from the bottle so

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.979 
remove the oxygen from the bottle so
that<00:00:52.469> you've<00:00:52.620> got<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.370> model<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.239> has<00:00:54.780> no

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
that you've got a a model this has no

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.830 
that you've got a a model this has no
oxygen<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> tablets<00:00:56.840> never

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
oxygen in it so if the tablets never

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.369 
oxygen in it so if the tablets never
really<00:00:58.199> touch<00:00:59.480> oxygen<00:01:00.480> or<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.840> no<00:01:01.020> reason<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
really touch oxygen or have no reason to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.290 
really touch oxygen or have no reason to
get<00:01:01.469> oxidized<00:01:01.949> let's<00:01:02.579> look<00:01:02.760> at<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> color<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
get oxidized let's look at the color of

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
get oxidized let's look at the color of
the<00:01:03.449> clients<00:01:03.870> tablets<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:04.559> they're<00:01:05.159> almost

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the clients tablets here they're almost

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.550 
the clients tablets here they're almost
as<00:01:05.760> green<00:01:06.060> as<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> Pines<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.049> drop<00:01:07.290> packets

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
as green as the Pines we drop packets

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.149 
as green as the Pines we drop packets
but<00:01:07.979> they're<00:01:08.520> 98%<00:01:09.299> pure<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.810> alfalfa<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.770> very

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
but they're 98% pure with alfalfa a very

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.980 
but they're 98% pure with alfalfa a very
little<00:01:11.490> added<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.390> enough<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.900> it

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
little added to it just enough to get it

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.960 
little added to it just enough to get it
through<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.200> tablet<00:01:13.619> machine<00:01:13.950> again<00:01:14.790> it's

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
through the tablet machine again it's

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.179 
through the tablet machine again it's
just<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.659> fresh<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> day<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.560> produced

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
just as fresh as the day was produced

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:17.990 
just as fresh as the day was produced
because<00:01:17.460> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
because it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.719 
because it
it<00:01:18.180> sits<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.080> oxygen-free<00:01:19.920> environment

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
it sits in this oxygen-free environment

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.440 
it sits in this oxygen-free environment
now<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.659> alfalfa<00:01:22.320> let's<00:01:23.220> look<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
now this alfalfa let's look at it it's a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.380 
now this alfalfa let's look at it it's a
bigger<00:01:24.630> tablet<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> costs<00:01:26.909> more<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:29.299> 50<00:01:30.299> in

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
bigger tablet and it costs more to 50 in

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.910 
bigger tablet and it costs more to 50 in
both<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.780> them<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.320> place<00:01:31.740> there's

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
both of them and this is a place there's

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
both of them and this is a place there's
a<00:01:31.950> bigger<00:01:32.130> tablet<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.630> 4<00:01:33.960> times

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
a bigger tablet but this one is 4 times

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.890

on<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> market<00:01:57.240> again<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.500> probably<00:01:59.039> a<00:01:59.070> good

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
on the market again it's probably a good

on the market again it's probably a good
source<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> fiber<00:02:00.020> but<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.259> getting

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
source of fiber but you're not getting

tablets<00:02:40.769> then<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.459> tablets<00:02:41.880> are<00:02:41.970> put<00:02:42.150> into<00:02:42.420> an

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
tablets then the tablets are put into an

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.569 
tablets then the tablets are put into an
oxygen-free<00:02:43.079> environment<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.310> mean

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
oxygen-free environment so I mean

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.039 
oxygen-free environment so I mean
there's<00:02:44.730> no<00:02:44.819> so<00:02:44.970> much<00:02:45.150> care<00:02:45.450> it's<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:45.840> much

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
there's no so much care it's so much

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.809 
there's no so much care it's so much
concerned<00:02:46.950> with<00:02:47.190> giving<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.640> highest

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
concerned with giving you the highest

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.360 
concerned with giving you the highest
nutritional<00:02:48.390> value<00:02:48.750> with<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.250> than<00:02:50.250> there

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
nutritional value with this than there

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.559 
nutritional value with this than there
is<00:02:50.430> with<00:02:50.549> this<00:02:50.940> but<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.690> price<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.170> actually

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
is with this but the price is actually

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.750 
is with this but the price is actually
less<00:02:54.569> for<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.200> you're<00:02:55.890> getting<00:02:56.069> some<00:02:56.459> fiber

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
less for this you're getting some fiber

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.849 
less for this you're getting some fiber
and<00:02:57.269> fiber<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.690> good<00:02:57.840> don't<00:02:58.620> get<00:02:58.739> me<00:02:58.799> wrong

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
and fiber is good don't get me wrong

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.190 
and fiber is good don't get me wrong
you're<00:02:59.579> getting<00:02:59.790> fiber<00:02:59.940> spines<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.600> but

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
you're getting fiber spines to but

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.590 
you're getting fiber spines to but
you're<00:03:01.380> getting<00:03:01.620> less<00:03:02.370> fiber<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.090> more

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
you're getting less fiber and more

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.670 
you're getting less fiber and more
nutrition<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.440> that's<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.310> difference
