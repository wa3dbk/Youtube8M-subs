eyes in his head while the fool walks in
the<00:05:07.690> darkness<00:05:08.280> but<00:05:09.280> I<00:05:09.310> came<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.790> realize<00:05:10.240> that

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
the darkness but I came to realize that

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.159 
the darkness but I came to realize that
the<00:05:10.660> same<00:05:10.930> fate<00:05:10.990> overtakes<00:05:11.919> them<00:05:12.669> both<00:05:13.050> then<00:05:14.050> I

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
the same fate overtakes them both then I

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.010 
the same fate overtakes them both then I
thought<00:05:14.380> in<00:05:14.560> my<00:05:14.680> heart<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:16.330> fate<00:05:16.570> of<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.810> fool

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
thought in my heart the fate of the fool

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.610 
thought in my heart the fate of the fool
will<00:05:17.890> overtake<00:05:18.280> me<00:05:18.460> also<00:05:19.110> what<00:05:20.110> then<00:05:20.350> do<00:05:20.560> I

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
will overtake me also what then do I

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.670 
will overtake me also what then do I
gain<00:05:20.770> by<00:05:21.430> being<00:05:21.640> wise<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.510> said<00:05:23.169> to<00:05:23.290> my<00:05:23.410> heart

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
gain by being wise I said to my heart

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.210 
gain by being wise I said to my heart
this<00:05:24.520> too<00:05:24.820> is<00:05:25.000> meaningless<00:05:25.530> but<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.650> wise<00:05:26.830> man

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
this too is meaningless but the wise man
