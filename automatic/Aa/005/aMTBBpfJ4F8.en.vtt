00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
- I can see you plan! You would like to prove I’m a mad!

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.500
- There’s no need to do so.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
- You think I'm a madman?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.500
- You think I cannot assert my own rights just because I have drunk a little bit of vodka?

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.000
Polish roads

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Tomasz Grygiel and Sebastian Waśko, the City of Warsaw Traffic Department

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.000
Two officers are called out to a rather unusual incident.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.000
There is a drunk driver heading along Obrońców Grodna and Lazurowa streets.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.500
I knocked on the car window but he briefly glanced at me, mumbled “f*ck” and dozed off again.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.500
110-8-34. I’m on the spot.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.000
Another police unit is already on the spot. Officers are trying to persuade the drunk driver to leave the car.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Open the door! Hey!

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.000
The officers have been trying to appeal to the driver’s common sense for some time now - all in vain.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But the task of opening the door proves to be too challenging for him.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
After struggling with the door for some time the man staggers outside.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.500
He maintains to have woken up in the car but cannot recall how he had got inside the vehicle.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.500
He swears he has not been driving the vehicle.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.500
- I haven’t been driving the car…

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
- We have a witness who has been following you and has seen you drive.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.500
- I don't know.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.500
- We have a witness.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.500
Some witnesses have also seen the man hit several traffic barriers, damaging the car.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.500
These repairs could be costly and the driver would not be able to claim insurance.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.000
The insurance company does not reimburse damages incurred as a result of drunk driving.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.600
- He has hit some really large traffic barriers.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
- Yeah, he must have hit some tall structures or must have driven the car on two wheels for a time.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.000
When the driver is submitted to a breathalyser test, his blood alcohol level amounts to almost .2

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
which means he is almost fully incapacitated.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.500
- Are you taking me into policy custody?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.000
- Did you give us any option?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
- What? What do you think you’re doing?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
- I can see you plan! You would like to prove I’m a mad!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.200
- There’s no need to do so.
- You think I'm a madman?

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.800
- You think I cannot assert my own rights just because I have drunk a little bit of vodka?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
- Do you have any brains at all?
- We do...

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.000
- Look... Someone has just texted me.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The driver does not seem to realise how serious the situation is.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.500
The ambulance team do not have good news for him either.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
- He has no injuries...

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.000
...but he might – however – need to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.000
But if he has been tested positive for blood alcohol, no psychiatrist would see him.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
- His blood alcohol level is nearly .2.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
- So I'd suggest a drunk tank and then psychiatric evaluation.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But first of all, the driver needs to be taken to the police station.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.000
However, he does not seem to be ready to go.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Wait, don’t… Wait, why have you locked the doors?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.500
After a while, the driver’s wife arrives to take the car home.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
- Will you release him in the morning?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.500
- He will be released when he sobers up.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.000
- What about the driving licence?

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500
- You will only start the procedure and… ?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
- Right, it will be up to the court to decide what to do.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.500
The man runs quite a big chance to have his driving licence suspended.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.500
The minimum penalty for drunk driving is licence suspension for 1 year, the maximum penalty is 10 years.
