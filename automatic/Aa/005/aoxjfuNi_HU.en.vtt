00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.370
 friends of youtube this is a video with 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.920
 which I personally consider to be 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.410
 the best ps2 games 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.240
 It should be remembered that obviously I have not 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.250
 played all so who thinks 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.230
 different leave a comment a 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.240
 constructive comment please or 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.039
 I will consider you a sad son of 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.020
 the big whore who has nothing more than 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.039
 make you believe yourself macho through the 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.220
 good enough network of vulgarities 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.860
 let's start at number 69 forgiveness 10 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.530
 we have the shadow of the colossus is 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.840
 a game of action and strategy to me 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.630
 like it a lot and if it's in number 10 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.360
 it is merely for its poor history 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.570
 main character is called wanda and not 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.550
 it's not a woman you are in a part 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.629
 of the world totally isolated from the rest 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.379
 This is an island so to speak one 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.760
 island on earth go what stupid in 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.680
 finish 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.839
 wanda makes a treaty with a kind of 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.060
 God with whom he is on arrival 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.160
 to the temple of the forbidden lands and the 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.330
 treaty is that if wanda achieves 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.070
 beat 10 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.190
 great colossi of those lands 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.440
 sleep this kind of god will return you 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.080
 life to the girl these sixteen 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.410
 Giants are of all kinds there are giants 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.750
 terrestrial as air and sea clear 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.530
 it's not just reaching and hitting like 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.590
 deranged you must also think 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.900
 let's go to number nine burnout 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.700
 whatever this game is not a 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.680
 racing simulator like big tourism 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.800
 not a clandestine racing game 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.200
 how need for speed is more like a game 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.560
 of violent violent violent 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.750
 races if very violent careers that 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.670
 they occur in different places both in 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.790
 cities like in places a little more 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.229
 rustic as I think I have made it clear what 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.210
 what sets this game apart 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.220
 motorsport of others is their 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.050
 violence to be able to dump your 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.850
 opponents or crash cars 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.000
 individuals who walk the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.940
 city at number 8 we find the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.220
 very famous 'guitar hero' this game without 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.860
 too much content consists of touching 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.200
 songs with control of the ps2 or 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.319
 for the most fanatical and affluent with 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.849
 the guitar for ps2 does not have a plot 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.440
 of greater magnitudes 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.379
 you only need to press the keys 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.750
 correct at the right time there are 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.819
 many versions of this game from the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.940
 normal up to a few more 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.880
 centered like guitar hero aerosmith or 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.010
 guitar hero metallica in the post 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.190
 number 7 a game that probably 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.700
 many want me to put more metal down 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.489
 gear solid 3 snake eater this game as 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.230
 Many will know it's action and espionage 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.750
 You must infiltrate places of 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.120
 very stealthy way through the game 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.160
 You are getting different types of camouflage 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.160
 both for the land and for 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.349
 herbs the water or drink as extra data 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.720

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.790
 game there are porn magazines that are 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.000
 supposed to be to distract the guards 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.970

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.500
 will be distracted will you be as number 6 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.810

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.000

 I had never played such an action game 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:12.189
 as it is completely recommended 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:14.860
 especially for children under 6 and for 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:17.830

 merely sex girls everywhere and 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:25.870
 Bizarre mentality is not true in 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.500
 actually the game that I decided to put as 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:33.520
 number one is final fantasy 10 for me 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.590
 the best rpg game for playstation 2 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.349
 it's been a pretty acclaimed game and 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.599
 multi- award recipient with one 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:43.240
 Enough wrapping and 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:45.940
 movie graphics you will take control 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.280

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.360
 leader and take your adventure to the 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:58.330
 Last consequences with very 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.460
 versatile and entertaining if you play 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.849
 it is more than likely that it will consume many 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.580
 hours of your life as it was in my case 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:09.280
 good friends that was my list with the 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:12.400
 which I repeat personally considered the 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.409
 best ps2 games I hope they are 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.930
 as much as possible with me and 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:20.759
 well I have nothing left to say 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.759
 Until the next motherfuckers
