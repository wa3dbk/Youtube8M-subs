 go guys today video to speak a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.049
 a little brush 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.040
 I asked for 64 kryolan brushes they are 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.799
 one day and face and 13 eyes and I am 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.020
 enchanted with them and I'll show you a 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.320
 good for you, I'll start with the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.650
 eyes I got cradles packaging like this 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.619
 has a kryolan symbol he's from that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.279
 size it is great as my agent O 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.340
 and starting from the packaging looks like a 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.489
 Does that tube know of an experiment? 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.500
 clinic well resistant and then you pull 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.790
 I also had kryolan spirit and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.170
 numbering 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.370
 this one is 9 363 and it's a brush 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.870
 to fade away or pass illuminator 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.930
 up here 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.320
 same as the people who like to spend 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:02.730
 is the contagious corrective of that brush are 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.430
 very soft is a crazy thing is 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.460
 like this 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.260
 inexplicable I loved and if he wins he is 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.850
 Fantastic 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.549
 this is a shadow is the 9 7 12 and he is 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.970
 to apply the shadow and he is chatinho 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.150
 he is firm, it's very firm even for you 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.920
 pass the shadow by tapping it already 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.009
 it's the 9 8 14 it's beveled just me 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 I find it hard to do 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.060
 then it will be to blur outlined 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.110
 It will be to shade the line of 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:48.840
 smoking lashes or even for you to mark the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.090
 Concave here, give it a go. 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.549
 only if you want a thick outline 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.719
 even in one I think it does not roll over to 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.579
 blur was outlined and eyelash line 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:03.180
 Perfect, I quite liked the goal he asked for. 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.939
 Fine too, next time to 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.220
 to be able to pass eyeliner that I can 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.739
 pass eyeliner gel with it I 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.140
 I am delighted with the fiber looks the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.290
 his size 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.600
 He's a great crowd and he comes too. 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.390
 in this tube here and his number is 9 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.370
 742 I'll talk a little bit about this 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.940
 line prize to do what I saw 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.000
 I researched the site is this premium line 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.790
 seems to be the one with the best quality and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.330
 finish and not just that others are 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.880
 bad did not even go through my 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.520
 head because he created the eca created wool 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.730
 people is already a line totally 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.100
 professional 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.690
 Everything you buy from kryolan I have 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.800
 sure that the person will like it and 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.470
 does not have this 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.550
 but the finish caught my attention the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.540
 increase of the premium that this cable of him 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.750
 it's metal 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.440
 if you fall into any link of the make -up remover or 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.989
 other liquid it will not drop ink 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.850
 because it has no metal it will not 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.100
 Damage then this will last 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.840
 very dim light of the premium line are of 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.480
 excellent quality 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.070
 they were recognized as europa sei 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.230
 what does it mean 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.620
 the best among the natural hairs of the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.920
 fiber it has two fibers that the 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.560
 are synthetic bristles and the 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.410
 are certain natural brush 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.370
 indicated for you to work with a 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.519
 liquid base or even HD bases because 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.060
 it will give you a light cover and you 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.549
 can slowly build up the color to come 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.880
 to a heavier coverage that will get you 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.590
 give a perfect finish and beyond 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.329
 use for base you can also use for 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.280
 blush it works great 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.640
 especially those blushes more 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.100
 pigmented why he gets to 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.700
 few take a little product and 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.980
 builds then this principle is 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.769
 perfect sure will be a brush 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.190
 so for life I think if you 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:19.370
 take care of it all right there goes straight 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.270
 He's for life, I've ordered too. 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.169
 this brush kit is ok 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:30.840
 what they are synthetic sages 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:34.060
 It's for you to work the liquid base. 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.909
 corrective sent everything a lot 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.669
 on all the brushes you 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:43.419
 need it here is that cat language right? 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.940
 famous he is big, you see mega 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.970
 soft and he has a firmness here to 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.889
 You of course pass the legal base too. 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.319
 to pass corrective when people 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.470
 want to cover a larger area and big one 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:59.319
 It is quite real that to pass base it goes 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.449
 give you a bigger coverage is that already 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.940
 will give you a light cover and you will 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.099
 having to build several times has to 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.099
 to be patient is the smallest it is for 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:11.139
 corrective but also gives up to base 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:15.969
 If you like the third one already 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:18.280
 it is smaller also seeing that it rolls up 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.039
 Shadow shadow on cream I really like 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.009
 applying a cream with the brush and 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:30.610
 Come on, the one I think I'll give it to you. 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:32.699
 outline outline of the 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:37.120
 eyelashes 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:39.610
 here comes this one to do the outline and 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.340
 If it's already here, it's a little piece of cake. 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.099
 make out why he's thin and 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.289
 It gives for use on the lips and also this 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.699
 from here to make a sketch also more 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:54.610
 thin 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:56.529
 here we give the two to use there 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.529
 goes from the taste of each one to use 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:02.409
 as outlined in this kit 27 brushes 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:06.099
 Synthetic bristles even to work 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:08.169
 with liquid products actually 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:12.159
 so when you have a brush of 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:14.259
 Natural bristles are me you will save 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.779

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:23.469
