 from whom you clan the first team that 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.330
 we have the first crack and the 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.430
 quarry that is sing clan farts and os 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.009
 I bring an attack of good with fact of 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.290
 the war but in a special attack of 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.390
 an attack with specialized troops 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.280
 it is not troops to which they have been elected 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.220
 for the attack that is called the attack 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.930
 While it is worth an attack, how cool is it? 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.790
 attack with the troops that we are seeing 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.890
 here actively with the two handles 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.480
 freckles and the golems then well go 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.129
 you are seeing, he has enough 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.010
 army in the apart of these things 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.469
 It has broken walls to separate make a 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.199
 little to open the gaps to enter more 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.300
 easily a few boxes the barbarian king 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.070
 and also the clan castle and how not 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.839
 one of rabies a few rages are 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.059
 three and then let's do the first 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.039
 I want to make the kid happen what 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.170
 said in this game is first of 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.280
 everything to put a suicide archer is worth what 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.540
 that is called an archer commit suicide 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.520
 simply to take out the castle from 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.010
 clan after clan castle and is 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.080
 outside as you are seeing 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.550
 here we have here that if archers 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.800
 that if we have magicians that reach us 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.090
 Well, once you are out, it will be much 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.520
 much easier since it speaks what 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.140
 we have to do is put a goal in the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.230
 suicidal golem that is also called that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.610
 I have something the suicidal golem that what 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.560
 makes a good start to put the archers 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.020
 one that will all wizards out there 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.880
 What we are going to do now is put a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.530
 bow to see if it dances a little bit worth 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.390
 there we have the archers that what they are going 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.800
 to do is to finish killing what is the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.390
 clan castle and the people or for 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.670
 outside because this one if we have it very much 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.860
 for inside it is possible that the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.870
 trainer of magicians and archers because what 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.400
 Petter once we are here then start 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.020
 the load I have a bad leg to a 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.180
 explosion but nothing then what happens 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.400
 what's wrong we break walls noia for 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.960
 moment we have gotten it breaks walls for 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.240
 open the gap in what is the wall and 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.010
 enter already what is the following 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 wall directly now to go 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.750
 directly is directly is to the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.340
 center 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.220
 you have to go fast enough that if not 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.360
 it gives us time then we have used some 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.979
 break walls as you are seeing the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.350
 we have here very nice we have used 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.450
 one of magicians to do extrusion 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.860
 total or mainly the issue of 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.490
 golem is to receive the damage for him 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.160
 but also for 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.050
 and destroy as well as the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.850
 breakers to open gaps and 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.620
 magicians already to tighten everything just like the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.360
 pk we're going to throw it in zero as 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.070
 things seeing then that it has happened now 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.560
 we had the the one about this 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.230
 they break second wall magicians are 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.310
 tightening what are the exact ones of 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.470
 lesson they throw teak they also throw the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.870
 rage success as you are seeing this 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.000
 makes them go much much more so 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.490
 which is the center and you are already seeing that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.380
 the goals are reaching the three 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.390
 tight goals already what is 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.660
 practically the whole center 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.370
 the magicians are quite touched for the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.800
 moment as you see how is the attack 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.400
 right now we have an archer here and 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.750
 if I'm not wrong we have this that is 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.820
 very light green that we have a magician 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.440
 we have here the golem and freckles that 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.820
 it's true that you hurt us, we have the magician 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.550
 that is attacking already what is the 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.740
 town hall and we have a barbarian king 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.720
 level 3 and a pec here is attacking by 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.760
 the elixir rations area we are going to 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.640
 see how the attack is triggered you are 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.260
 watching this 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:28.290
 the main thing is having 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.230
 tranquilita we have 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.549
 a bum who, by the way, is going to die 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.739
 0.96 this area has already been enough 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.510
 empty since we do not have troops and that we 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.069
 we have left is a rare spell that 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.290
 we cast a spell of rage here we have 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.690
 the golem we have 2 texas 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.830
 here we have 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.390
 and well, let's see how it works 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.500
 triggers the debate because 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.100
 we know more 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.480
 more anger and decoration we do not have 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.460
 we are operating with what we have 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.620
 containing between the radiant rival almost 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.600
 without destroying all the gold mines 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.580
 if he is still studying everything and 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.200
 pretty much eliminate that the problem has 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.600
 endured quite the attacks I do not know by 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.000
 what is this at the price of going for this 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.490
 zone honestly I would have been out there 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.590
 to veto that damage but good the 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.300
 time the troops 100% are not made 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.280
 this is clear we can have done 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.040
 quite destruction with a very attack 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.470
 cool the truth is that now it is now 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.750
 now times it's still working 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.060
 this type of attack so that the one in eibar 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.070
 or are his last are his last 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.500
 compose because he is attacking the 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.900
 tower d is we have the mortar and a 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.520
 canyon is pretty hurt but hey 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.290
 we have made about three stars there 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.570
 two stars how important it is to try 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.310
 reach 50% and destroy the town hall 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.140
 That's what we expect, what are the two 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.600
 stars and one guys this has been 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.320
 thanks to curro again to lend in 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.580
 the attack 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.320
 Well, what did I do to them? 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.030
 I have no proof of his life attacks and 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.470
 pretty funny that votes 6 the i do not 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.150
 like in favorites and also if you want 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.800

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.900
 video on youtube as farme ar 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.940
 with climbing glasses anything puts me 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.840
 your comments I will try to resolve in the 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.479
 next video 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.479
