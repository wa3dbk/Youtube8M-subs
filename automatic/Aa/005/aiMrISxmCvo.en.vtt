00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.790 

so<00:00:06.130> here<00:00:06.640> it<00:00:06.760> is<00:00:06.940> the<00:00:07.180> new<00:00:07.390> mine<00:00:07.660> lab<00:00:07.960> se<00:00:08.440> quelle

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.800 
so here it is the new mine lab se quelle

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.430 
so here it is the new mine lab se quelle
now<00:00:09.190> it's<00:00:09.430> taken<00:00:09.850> my<00:00:10.030> lab<00:00:10.299> two<00:00:10.630> years<00:00:11.080> of

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
now it's taken my lab two years of

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.930 
now it's taken my lab two years of
research<00:00:11.889> and<00:00:12.040> development<00:00:12.100> to<00:00:12.670> actually

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
research and development to actually

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.420 
research and development to actually
release<00:00:13.240> this<00:00:13.510> coil<00:00:13.869> to<00:00:14.020> market<00:00:14.440> and<00:00:14.650> as<00:00:15.280> you

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
release this coil to market and as you

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.770 
release this coil to market and as you
can<00:00:15.549> see<00:00:15.639> that's<00:00:16.000> two<00:00:16.209> years<00:00:16.420> well<00:00:16.750> spent

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
can see that's two years well spent

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.010 
can see that's two years well spent
because<00:00:17.410> this<00:00:18.070> is<00:00:18.280> a<00:00:18.310> lightweight<00:00:18.699> coil<00:00:19.360> now

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
because this is a lightweight coil now

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.410 
because this is a lightweight coil now
the<00:00:20.080> previous<00:00:20.830> my<00:00:21.039> previous<00:00:21.580> slimline<00:00:22.060> coil

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
the previous my previous slimline coil

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.320 
the previous my previous slimline coil
actually<00:00:22.690> weighed<00:00:23.170> 600<00:00:23.860> grams<00:00:24.130> whereas<00:00:24.730> this

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
actually weighed 600 grams whereas this

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.010 
actually weighed 600 grams whereas this
coil<00:00:25.660> I've<00:00:25.900> weighed<00:00:26.410> it<00:00:26.590> is<00:00:26.880> 528<00:00:27.880> grams<00:00:28.300> so<00:00:28.870> in

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
coil I've weighed it is 528 grams so in

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.560 
coil I've weighed it is 528 grams so in
real<00:00:29.290> terms<00:00:29.620> what<00:00:30.040> that<00:00:30.070> means<00:00:30.490> is<00:00:30.700> that's<00:00:30.880> 72

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
real terms what that means is that's 72

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.479 
real terms what that means is that's 72
grams<00:00:32.200> that<00:00:32.439> I<00:00:32.559> don't<00:00:32.770> have<00:00:32.950> to<00:00:33.070> swing<00:00:33.340> around

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
grams that I don't have to swing around

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.420 
grams that I don't have to swing around
all<00:00:33.820> day<00:00:34.059> while<00:00:34.600> detecting<00:00:35.260> now<00:00:35.890> as<00:00:36.100> you<00:00:36.309> can

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
all day while detecting now as you can

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.119 
all day while detecting now as you can
see<00:00:36.489> it<00:00:37.270> is<00:00:37.480> radically<00:00:37.929> different<00:00:37.989> okay<00:00:38.739> they

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
see it is radically different okay they

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.910 
see it is radically different okay they
have<00:00:39.370> now<00:00:39.579> mounted<00:00:40.239> for<00:00:40.780> extra<00:00:41.199> balance<00:00:41.559> the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
have now mounted for extra balance the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.790 
have now mounted for extra balance the
coil<00:00:42.280> is<00:00:42.550> mounted<00:00:43.390> to<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.600> stem<00:00:43.989> centrally

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
coil is mounted to the stem centrally

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.610 
coil is mounted to the stem centrally
okay<00:00:45.609> now<00:00:46.149> this<00:00:46.420> also<00:00:46.659> happens<00:00:47.109> to<00:00:47.230> be<00:00:47.350> the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
okay now this also happens to be the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.579 
okay now this also happens to be the
pinpoint<00:00:48.219> zone<00:00:48.460> of<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.999> coil<00:00:49.269> and<00:00:49.589> the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
pinpoint zone of the coil and the

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.139 
pinpoint zone of the coil and the
stiffeners<00:00:51.100> also<00:00:51.550> run<00:00:51.729> through<00:00:51.999> that

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
stiffeners also run through that

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.599 
stiffeners also run through that
pinpoint<00:00:52.690> coil<00:00:53.019> so<00:00:53.469> as<00:00:53.890> you're<00:00:54.129> swinging<00:00:54.339> it

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
pinpoint coil so as you're swinging it

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.340 
pinpoint coil so as you're swinging it
and<00:00:54.789> trying<00:00:54.969> to<00:00:55.059> pinpoint<00:00:55.269> things<00:00:55.719> there's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
and trying to pinpoint things there's

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.590 
and trying to pinpoint things there's
there's<00:00:56.769> lots<00:00:57.129> more<00:00:57.309> visual<00:00:58.089> aids<00:00:58.329> to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
there's lots more visual aids to

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.779 
there's lots more visual aids to
actually<00:00:59.079> work<00:00:59.710> out<00:00:59.889> where<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.190> pinpoint

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
actually work out where the pinpoint

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.939 
actually work out where the pinpoint
position<00:01:01.239> is<00:01:01.420> now<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.530> other<00:01:02.679> thing<00:01:02.920> that

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
position is now the other thing that

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.149 
position is now the other thing that
you'll<00:01:03.190> notice<00:01:03.519> is<00:01:03.940> that<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:05.110> coil<00:01:05.470> cover<00:01:05.770> is

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
you'll notice is that the coil cover is

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.180 
you'll notice is that the coil cover is
very<00:01:06.970> minimalistic<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.990> covers<00:01:08.500> just<00:01:08.979> the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
very minimalistic it covers just the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.880 
very minimalistic it covers just the
areas<00:01:09.820> where<00:01:10.210> is<00:01:10.480> likely<00:01:10.900> to<00:01:11.200> be<00:01:11.320> wear<00:01:11.590> on<00:01:11.740> the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
areas where is likely to be wear on the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.520 
areas where is likely to be wear on the
coil<00:01:12.190> so<00:01:12.760> there<00:01:12.910> are<00:01:13.030> areas<00:01:13.330> that<00:01:13.570> that<00:01:14.290> seem

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
coil so there are areas that that seem

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.290 
coil so there are areas that that seem
unprotected<00:01:15.220> but<00:01:15.520> if<00:01:15.730> you<00:01:15.850> think<00:01:16.000> about<00:01:16.090> it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
unprotected but if you think about it

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.720 
unprotected but if you think about it
logically<00:01:16.630> these<00:01:17.470> are<00:01:17.650> unlikely<00:01:18.190> to<00:01:18.370> ever

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
logically these are unlikely to ever

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.330 
logically these are unlikely to ever
receive<00:01:19.180> anywhere<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:20.830> other<00:01:20.980> thing<00:01:21.190> you'll

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
receive anywhere the other thing you'll

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.400 
receive anywhere the other thing you'll
notice<00:01:21.400> is<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.360> there<00:01:22.540> are<00:01:22.690> there<00:01:23.380> are

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
notice is that there are there are

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.670 
notice is that there are there are
cutout<00:01:23.980> areas<00:01:24.610> where<00:01:25.300> which<00:01:25.720> on<00:01:25.990> previous

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
cutout areas where which on previous

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.220 
cutout areas where which on previous
coils<00:01:27.100> would<00:01:27.340> have<00:01:27.520> rezoned<00:01:28.090> actually<00:01:28.840> in<00:01:28.990> so

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
coils would have rezoned actually in so

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.680 
coils would have rezoned actually in so
they've<00:01:29.380> they've<00:01:30.040> really<00:01:30.550> have<00:01:30.760> gone<00:01:31.300> to<00:01:31.450> town

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
they've they've really have gone to town

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.990 
they've they've really have gone to town
on<00:01:31.720> this<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.230> remove<00:01:32.560> every<00:01:33.100> last<00:01:33.310> gram<00:01:33.790> of

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
on this to remove every last gram of

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.810 
on this to remove every last gram of
excess<00:01:34.840> weight<00:01:35.220> giving<00:01:36.220> you<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.340> very

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
excess weight giving you a very

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.480 
excess weight giving you a very
lightweight<00:01:37.180> coil<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.560> what's<00:01:38.980> it<00:01:39.130> like<00:01:39.280> in

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
lightweight coil so what's it like in

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.640 
lightweight coil so what's it like in
the<00:01:39.580> field<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:39.970> hear<00:01:40.150> you<00:01:40.270> ask<00:01:40.450> well<00:01:41.230> I've<00:01:41.470> only

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
the field I hear you ask well I've only

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.900 
the field I hear you ask well I've only
had<00:01:41.860> it<00:01:41.920> for<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.130> couple<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:42.400> days<00:01:42.550> and<00:01:42.850> I

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
had it for a couple of days and I

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.970 
had it for a couple of days and I
haven't<00:01:43.270> taken<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.840> out<00:01:43.960> onto<00:01:44.320> any<00:01:44.470> really

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
haven't taken it out onto any really

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.160 
haven't taken it out onto any really
good<00:01:45.160> Roman<00:01:45.430> sites<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:46.330> to<00:01:46.630> really<00:01:46.810> give<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.110> a

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
good Roman sites to to really give it a

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.050 
good Roman sites to to really give it a
test<00:01:47.410> but<00:01:48.040> I<00:01:48.070> have<00:01:48.340> taken<00:01:48.700> in<00:01:48.790> my<00:01:48.880> back<00:01:49.030> garden

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
test but I have taken in my back garden

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.710 
test but I have taken in my back garden
and<00:01:49.600> I've<00:01:49.960> got<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.140> test<00:01:50.500> bed<00:01:50.710> out<00:01:50.890> there<00:01:51.160> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and I've got a test bed out there and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.540 
and I've got a test bed out there and
first<00:01:52.720> impressions<00:01:53.230> very<00:01:53.500> very<00:01:53.710> good<00:01:53.980> it's

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
first impressions very very good it's

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.320 
first impressions very very good it's
very<00:01:54.760> very<00:01:55.360> sensitive<00:01:55.990> on<00:01:56.170> small<00:01:56.680> items<00:01:57.330> it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
very very sensitive on small items it

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.140 
very very sensitive on small items it
gets<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.780> deep<00:01:58.960> items<00:01:59.410> really<00:01:59.890> well<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.280> I

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
gets the deep items really well and I

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.620 
gets the deep items really well and I
thought<00:02:01.690> I<00:02:02.230> found<00:02:02.830> it<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.070> lot<00:02:03.400> lot<00:02:03.700> quieter<00:02:04.150> to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
thought I found it a lot lot quieter to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.690 
thought I found it a lot lot quieter to
you<00:02:04.840> so<00:02:05.230> I<00:02:05.440> could<00:02:05.500> tweak<00:02:05.950> up<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.310> sensitivity

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
you so I could tweak up the sensitivity

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.300 
you so I could tweak up the sensitivity
a<00:02:07.090> bit<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.659> let's<00:02:08.050> face<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.259> that's<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.039> sign

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
a bit and let's face it that's the sign

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.479 
a bit and let's face it that's the sign
of<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.729> really<00:02:10.030> good<00:02:10.390> coil<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.929> just<00:02:11.890> how<00:02:12.040> stable

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
of a really good coil is just how stable

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.260 
of a really good coil is just how stable
it<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.120> when<00:02:13.690> you're<00:02:13.810> using<00:02:14.020> it
