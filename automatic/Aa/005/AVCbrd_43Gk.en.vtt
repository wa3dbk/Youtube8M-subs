that you can use in your own scenes as

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.460 
that you can use in your own scenes as
well<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> materials<00:01:19.670> backdrops<00:01:20.670> and

geometry is set to display his box you

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.980 
geometry is set to display his box you
can<00:01:32.250> see<00:01:32.280> these<00:01:32.490> boxes<00:01:32.970> out<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> it's

sort of a simple shape so I'll select

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.700 
sort of a simple shape so I'll select
all<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.850> control<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:40.530> we'll<00:01:40.680> just

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
all with control a and then we'll just

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.340 
all with control a and then we'll just
go<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> display<00:01:41.430> tab<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.060> check<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.079> and

go to the display tab and check that and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
go to the display tab and check that and
sure<00:01:43.500> enough<00:01:43.530> displays<00:01:44.100> box<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.360> we'll

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
sure enough displays box so we'll

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.910 
sure enough displays box so we'll
uncheck<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.079> everything<00:01:46.500> becomes

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
uncheck that and everything becomes

alright<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.009> bringing<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.759> view<00:01:56.969> down<00:01:57.180> here

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
alright so bringing that view down here

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.789 
alright so bringing that view down here
we<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.750> see<00:01:58.020> what<00:01:58.140> our<00:01:58.170> scene<00:01:58.409> looks<00:01:58.590> like

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
we can see what our scene looks like

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.139 
we can see what our scene looks like
let's<00:01:59.490> go<00:02:00.119> ahead<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.509> ship<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> top<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
let's go ahead and ship this to top and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.960 
let's go ahead and ship this to top and
wire<00:02:03.149> frame

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.030 

I'll<00:02:08.970> be<00:02:09.479> select<00:02:09.869> all<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.229> then<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.770> view

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
I'll be select all and then this view

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.430 
I'll be select all and then this view
will<00:02:11.160> become<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.700> perspective<00:02:12.480> view<00:02:12.540> we'll

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
will become a perspective view we'll

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.020 
will become a perspective view we'll
start<00:02:13.680> off<00:02:13.800> by<00:02:14.040> looking<00:02:14.070> through<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.820> same

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
start off by looking through the same

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.090 
start off by looking through the same
camera<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.600> here<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.140> then<00:02:16.740> we'll<00:02:16.860> switch

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
camera is here and then we'll switch

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.340 
camera is here and then we'll switch
this<00:02:17.370> view<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> perspective<00:02:18.510> view<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:19.320> that

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
this view to a perspective view so that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.500 
this view to a perspective view so that
it's<00:02:19.620> ready<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:20.070> go<00:02:20.400> into<00:02:20.670> active<00:02:21.090> shade<00:02:21.270> mode

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
it's ready to go into active shade mode

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.200 
it's ready to go into active shade mode
and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.620> here<00:02:23.190> will<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.490> switch<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
and then here will you switch this to a

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.260 
and then here will you switch this to a
front<00:02:24.480> view<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.980> now<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.610> view<00:02:26.850> goes<00:02:27.060> to

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
front view so now this view goes to

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
front view so now this view goes to
active<00:02:27.600> shade<00:02:27.810> mode<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:29.540> still<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.720> all<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:30.990> my

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
active shade mode I still have all of my

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.190 
active shade mode I still have all of my
assisting<00:02:31.830> machines<00:02:32.160> working<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:34.080> is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
assisting machines working so this is

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:43.010 
assisting machines working so this is
going<00:02:34.610> pretty<00:02:35.610> fast<00:02:41.750> if<00:02:42.750> you're<00:02:42.900> ever

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
going pretty fast if you're ever

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.420 
going pretty fast if you're ever
wondering<00:02:43.230> why<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.770> taken<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.070> little<00:02:44.130> bit<00:02:44.340> of

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
wondering why it's taken a little bit of

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.850 
wondering why it's taken a little bit of
time<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.820> can<00:02:44.940> go<00:02:45.150> bring<00:02:45.630> up<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.930> v-ray<00:02:46.500> RT

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
time you can go bring up the v-ray RT

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.740 
time you can go bring up the v-ray RT
dialogue<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.790> can<00:02:47.940> see<00:02:48.120> what's<00:02:48.420> taking

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
dialogue and you can see what's taking

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.960 
dialogue and you can see what's taking
time<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.920> texture<00:02:50.250> maps<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.790> load

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
time so the texture maps have to load

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.550 
time so the texture maps have to load
and<00:02:51.240> it's<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.870> little<00:02:52.050> bit<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.230> work<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.380> be<00:02:52.500> done

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
and it's a little bit of work to be done

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.920 
and it's a little bit of work to be done
before<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.100> ready<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.400> go<00:02:53.600> once<00:02:54.600> you're<00:02:54.780> in

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
before it's ready to go once you're in

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.250 
before it's ready to go once you're in
you're<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.320> though<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.420> here's<00:02:57.420> my<00:02:57.510> view<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.170> I

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
you're in though so here's my view and I

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.100 
you're in though so here's my view and I
can<00:02:59.130> interact<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:00.240> this<00:03:01.610> pretty<00:03:02.610> rapidly

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.360 

again<00:03:07.110> I'm<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.350> sort<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.590> flying<00:03:07.800> my<00:03:07.980> camera

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
again I'm just sort of flying my camera

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.290 
again I'm just sort of flying my camera
in<00:03:09.830> hitting<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.070> right<00:03:11.580> bracket<00:03:11.850> key<00:03:12.030> to

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
in hitting the right bracket key to

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300 
in hitting the right bracket key to
speed<00:03:12.540> up<00:03:12.690> my<00:03:12.870> step<00:03:13.410> size<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.070> move<00:03:14.220> a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
speed up my step size so that I move a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.390 
speed up my step size so that I move a
little<00:03:14.459> faster<00:03:16.370> five<00:03:17.370> six<00:03:17.580> seven<00:03:19.280> that's<00:03:20.280> a

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
little faster five six seven that's a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.260 
little faster five six seven that's a
little<00:03:20.580> more<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:20.940> it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.020 

and<00:03:26.680> that's<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.800> interactivity<00:03:30.700> well<00:03:31.700> vray

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
and that's the interactivity well vray

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.280 
and that's the interactivity well vray
has<00:03:32.180> some<00:03:32.330> new<00:03:32.420> features<00:03:32.570> since<00:03:33.020> this<00:03:33.140> has

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
has some new features since this has

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.960 
has some new features since this has
come<00:03:33.440> out<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.800> we're<00:03:34.190> going<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.460> explore<00:03:34.760> them

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
come out and we're going to explore them

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.420 
come out and we're going to explore them
now<00:03:35.120> at<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.420> scene<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:36.350> in<00:03:36.650> my<00:03:36.770> top<00:03:36.980> view<00:03:37.220> here

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
now at the scene so in my top view here

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.950 
now at the scene so in my top view here
I'm<00:03:37.520> going<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.700> go<00:03:37.790> in<00:03:38.000> and<00:03:38.360> delete<00:03:38.570> these

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
I'm going to go in and delete these

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.720 
I'm going to go in and delete these
extra<00:03:39.650> planes<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.010> are<00:03:40.130> being<00:03:40.310> used<00:03:40.490> to

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
extra planes that are being used to

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.200 
extra planes that are being used to
create<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.060> backdrop<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.920> see<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:43.910> learn<00:03:44.060> the

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
create the backdrop so see you learn the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.140 
create the backdrop so see you learn the
top<00:03:44.420> view<00:03:44.690> we'll<00:03:44.870> just<00:03:45.020> go<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.410> back<00:03:46.150> view

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
top view we'll just go to the back view

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.060 
top view we'll just go to the back view
maybe<00:03:47.390> real<00:03:47.690> quickly<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.470> select<00:03:48.800> these<00:03:48.890> other

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
maybe real quickly to select these other

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.410 
maybe real quickly to select these other
pieces<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.880> we'll<00:03:53.030> switch<00:03:53.210> this<00:03:53.360> to

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
pieces and we'll switch this to

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.850 
pieces and we'll switch this to
wireframe<00:03:53.690> also<00:03:56.050> and<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:59.810> is<00:03:59.990> the<00:04:00.200> existing

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
wireframe also and this is the existing

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.400 
wireframe also and this is the existing
sunlight<00:04:01.490> and<00:04:02.210> this<00:04:02.390> is<00:04:02.540> just<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.900> standard

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
sunlight and this is just a standard

max it's got a tan color it's got a
multiplier<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.810> 1.1<00:04:09.410> we're<00:04:09.860> going<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.040> go

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
multiplier of 1.1 we're going to go

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.620 
multiplier of 1.1 we're going to go
ahead<00:04:10.160> and<00:04:10.250> delete<00:04:10.490> that<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.060> we're<00:04:11.480> going<00:04:11.600> to

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
ahead and delete that and we're going to

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.210 
ahead and delete that and we're going to
switch<00:04:11.840> over<00:04:11.960> to<00:04:12.110> the<00:04:12.320> v-ray<00:04:12.620> Sun<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.040> sky

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
switch over to the v-ray Sun and sky

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.900 
switch over to the v-ray Sun and sky
system<00:04:13.670> I<00:04:15.280> can<00:04:17.440> create<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.770> Sun<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.130> sky<00:04:19.459> system

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
system I can create a Sun and sky system

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.710 
system I can create a Sun and sky system
by<00:04:20.030> going<00:04:20.239> to<00:04:20.330> create<00:04:20.630> lights<00:04:21.470> beer<00:04:22.400> a<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:23.420> B

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
by going to create lights beer a and B

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.870 
by going to create lights beer a and B
race<00:04:23.930> on<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:24.470> we'll<00:04:25.190> just<00:04:25.370> start<00:04:25.520> out<00:04:25.640> by<00:04:25.850> just

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
race on and we'll just start out by just

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.880 
race on and we'll just start out by just
shining<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:26.990> generally<00:04:27.410> on<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.620> front<00:04:27.830> of

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
shining this generally on the front of

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.640 
shining this generally on the front of
the<00:04:27.950> building<00:04:31.420> and<00:04:32.420> we<00:04:32.780> get<00:04:32.900> asked<00:04:33.290> do<00:04:33.350> we<00:04:33.380> want

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
the building and we get asked do we want

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.050 
the building and we get asked do we want
to<00:04:33.740> automatically<00:04:34.190> add<00:04:34.280> a<00:04:34.400> beer<00:04:34.640> a<00:04:34.760> sky

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
to automatically add a beer a sky

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.180 
to automatically add a beer a sky
environment<00:04:35.540> map<00:04:35.690> yes<00:04:36.110> we<00:04:36.260> do<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:36.920> we<00:04:37.070> have

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
environment map yes we do so we have

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.890 
environment map yes we do so we have
both<00:04:37.370> an<00:04:37.490> environment<00:04:37.970> map<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.390> a<00:04:38.480> sunlight

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
both an environment map and a sunlight

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.090 
both an environment map and a sunlight
and<00:04:39.110> both<00:04:39.650> of<00:04:39.680> those<00:04:39.920> are<00:04:40.310> active<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:42.680> we<00:04:42.950> need

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
and both of those are active so we need

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.800 
and both of those are active so we need
to<00:04:43.250> bring<00:04:43.760> our<00:04:43.930> sunlight<00:04:44.930> target<00:04:45.290> down

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.960 

so<00:04:51.380> it's<00:04:51.500> pointing<00:04:51.800> at<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:51.919> building<00:04:52.220> and

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
so it's pointing at the building and

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.060 
so it's pointing at the building and
you'll<00:04:53.750> notice<00:04:53.990> that<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.290> scene<00:04:54.530> is<00:04:54.560> really

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
you'll notice that the scene is really

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.670 
you'll notice that the scene is really
blown<00:04:55.310> out<00:04:55.550> that's<00:04:56.270> because<00:04:56.600> sons<00:04:56.900> are<00:04:57.230> very

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
blown out that's because sons are very

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.890 
blown out that's because sons are very
bright<00:04:57.889> things<00:04:58.220> a<00:04:58.550> lot<00:04:58.940> of<00:04:59.030> people<00:04:59.150> go<00:04:59.330> in<00:04:59.510> and

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
bright things a lot of people go in and

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.300 
bright things a lot of people go in and
take<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.169> intensity<00:05:00.620> down<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:01.040> one

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
take the intensity down to one

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.100 
take the intensity down to one
one-hundredth<00:05:01.850> or<00:05:01.970> something<00:05:02.240> like<00:05:02.330> that<00:05:02.389> but

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
one-hundredth or something like that but

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.390 
one-hundredth or something like that but
what<00:05:03.320> I<00:05:03.350> like<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.620> show<00:05:03.770> you<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:04.070> that<00:05:04.100> we<00:05:04.280> can

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
what I like to show you is that we can

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.480 
what I like to show you is that we can
use<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.610> vir<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:05.090> camera<00:05:05.540> and<00:05:05.900> it<00:05:06.230> has<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.470> built-in

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.350 

physical<00:05:10.490> effect<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:12.880> handle<00:05:13.880> this<00:05:14.030> very

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
physical effect to handle this very

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.650 
physical effect to handle this very
intensely<00:05:14.930> bright<00:05:15.110> scene<00:05:16.030> so<00:05:17.030> if<00:05:17.270> we<00:05:17.300> switch

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
intensely bright scene so if we switch

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.780 
intensely bright scene so if we switch
this<00:05:17.840> view<00:05:18.050> now<00:05:18.260> to<00:05:18.680> the<00:05:18.919> new<00:05:19.100> physical<00:05:19.550> camera

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
this view now to the new physical camera

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.960 
this view now to the new physical camera
just<00:05:20.090> created<00:05:20.680> will<00:05:21.680> see<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:21.980> sky<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.550> it'll

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
just created will see the sky and it'll

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.270 
just created will see the sky and it'll
also<00:05:23.090> adjust<00:05:23.600> for<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.900> brightness<00:05:24.380> so<00:05:25.100> in

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
also adjust for the brightness so in

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.590 
also adjust for the brightness so in
this<00:05:25.370> view<00:05:25.550> here<00:05:25.850> I<00:05:25.880> need<00:05:26.090> to<00:05:26.180> select<00:05:26.270> my

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
this view here I need to select my

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.879 
this view here I need to select my
camera<00:05:27.350> target<00:05:27.710> and<00:05:29.320> then<00:05:30.320> we'll<00:05:30.470> just<00:05:30.620> point

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
camera target and then we'll just point

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.550 
camera target and then we'll just point
that<00:05:30.950> down<00:05:31.220> at<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.430> building<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:35.260> now<00:05:36.260> as<00:05:36.440> i

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
that down at the building and now as i

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.020 
that down at the building and now as i
move<00:05:36.710> my<00:05:36.770> son<00:05:37.310> around<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:40.070> can<00:05:40.190> see<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.580> sky

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
move my son around you can see the sky

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.420 
move my son around you can see the sky
change<00:05:43.930> when<00:05:44.930> the<00:05:45.080> sun<00:05:45.470> is<00:05:45.500> low<00:05:45.620> in<00:05:45.919> the<00:05:45.950> sky<00:05:46.250> of

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
change when the sun is low in the sky of

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.129 
change when the sun is low in the sky of
course<00:05:46.639> you<00:05:46.760> get<00:05:46.880> a<00:05:46.910> very<00:05:47.060> orange<00:05:47.479> effect<00:05:47.810> and

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
course you get a very orange effect and

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.800 
course you get a very orange effect and
when<00:05:48.650> it's<00:05:48.770> high<00:05:48.919> overhead<00:05:49.190> we<00:05:49.700> get<00:05:49.850> a<00:05:49.880> bright

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
when it's high overhead we get a bright

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.140 
when it's high overhead we get a bright
sunny<00:05:51.050> day<00:05:51.400> we'll<00:05:52.400> continue<00:05:52.580> this<00:05:52.940> in<00:05:53.120> the

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
sunny day we'll continue this in the

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.730 
sunny day we'll continue this in the
next<00:05:53.240> movie<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:53.900> we'll<00:05:54.110> show<00:05:54.290> a<00:05:54.320> daylight

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
next movie and we'll show a daylight

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.280 
next movie and we'll show a daylight
analysis
