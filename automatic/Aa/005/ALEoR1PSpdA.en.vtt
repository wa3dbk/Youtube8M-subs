is to think about a product with an

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.170 
is to think about a product with an
enzyme<00:03:36.810> action<00:03:37.290> it's<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.340> bit<00:03:38.550> like<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:38.790> sort

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
enzyme action it's a bit like that sort

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.270 
enzyme action it's a bit like that sort
of<00:03:39.270> biological<00:03:39.480> liquid<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.320> powder<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:41.100> you

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
of biological liquid and powder that you

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.060 
of biological liquid and powder that you

special ones are made for pets because

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.760 
special ones are made for pets because
the<00:03:45.300> chemicals<00:03:45.750> are<00:03:45.870> safe<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.290> they've<00:03:46.560> been

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
the chemicals are safe and they've been

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.940 
the chemicals are safe and they've been
tested<00:03:47.360> now<00:03:48.360> we<00:03:48.420> all<00:03:48.660> know<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:49.170> we<00:03:49.440> fought<00:03:49.709> cats

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
tested now we all know if we fought cats

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.730 
tested now we all know if we fought cats
what<00:03:50.550> cats<00:03:50.850> burrow<00:03:51.060> urine<00:03:51.450> smells<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:52.020> and

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
what cats burrow urine smells like and

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.130 
what cats burrow urine smells like and
in<00:03:52.890> an<00:03:53.010> unneutered<00:03:53.520> tom<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.690> probably<00:03:55.020> the

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
in an unneutered tom it is probably the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.740 
in an unneutered tom it is probably the
most<00:03:55.260> pungent<00:03:55.800> smell<00:03:56.040> at<00:03:56.130> all<00:03:56.450> so<00:03:57.450> when<00:03:57.600> you're

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
most pungent smell at all so when you're

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.480 
most pungent smell at all so when you're
cleaning<00:03:58.050> up<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.620> have<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.890> use<00:03:59.220> something

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
cleaning up you have to use something

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.550 
cleaning up you have to use something
that<00:03:59.910> effectively<00:04:00.540> cleans<00:04:00.930> up<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.170> last<00:04:01.410> of

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
that effectively cleans up the last of

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.170 
that effectively cleans up the last of
that<00:04:01.680> residue<00:04:02.190> if<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:02.730> don't<00:04:02.910> clean<00:04:03.150> it

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
that residue if you don't clean it

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.880 
that residue if you don't clean it
effectively<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:04.260> will<00:04:04.290> have<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.650> problem

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
effectively you will have a problem

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.680 
effectively you will have a problem
because<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.700> cat<00:04:05.880> will<00:04:06.030> keep<00:04:06.180> being<00:04:06.420> drawn

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
because the cat will keep being drawn

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.900 
because the cat will keep being drawn
back<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.200> smell<00:04:07.500> now<00:04:08.070> this<00:04:08.250> could<00:04:08.490> be<00:04:08.550> tiny

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
back to the smell now this could be tiny

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.850 
back to the smell now this could be tiny
microscopic<00:04:09.360> particles<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.380> if<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.590> don't

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
microscopic particles so if you don't

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.740 
microscopic particles so if you don't
