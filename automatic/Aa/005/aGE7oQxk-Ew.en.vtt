00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.350
 the decision to transfer these land 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.480
 plots principle regulations 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.080
 Moscow Region Government 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.180
 which is written 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.270
 translate these land plots under 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.090
 low-rise housing 1 here 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.790
 see it was drilling 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.520
 under the houses it means 15 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:40.580
 house numbers are good 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.040
 easy accommodation getting closer and jumped off 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.800
 there of course there you are then i still have 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.980
 the question arises people come on right 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.430
 then it should have the scheme to 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:59.530
 they did this from the court yard 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.530
 here the storm is wrong I think so about 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.679
 subway train 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:16.910
 how does it mean to determine where 1 is 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:19.010
 now the next question 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.920
 according to the draft agreed 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.410
 control architecture cow oil 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.320
 from why dash idea should be 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.450
 written from what year for what number 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.250
 why is architecture reconciliation money 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.170
 don't give no register on 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.709
 Only the countryâ€™s signature does not allow 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.290
 agree you agreed above that 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.140
 the order must match fill 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.480
 and here if there are all these things then they 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.390
 must be suitably filled in as 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.150
 it is not always written here so this is you 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.580
 know but because because this is ours 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.010
 in law we can if they will 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.350
 numbers stand you think that he does not 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.350
 go further it is not yet to the end 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.140
 still the next stage 1 here too after 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.600
 completion of works submit to perform 4 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:11.000
 until what year here away from why 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.570
 go ahead them your signature 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.240
 responsible for the work and 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:21.950
 surnames number of power of attorney from any 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.720
 there is no number why all these documents have 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.170
 we are already under the thorns 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.570
 our grandfather under this port r11 order is not you 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.900
 ask him caught we must 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.650
 On to the reservoir, all right imagine 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.489
 submit not submitted before 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.280
 Well, bad as even if presented should 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:46.739
 be so to speak a comparative analysis 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.480
 worth it here yes she is absolutely everything 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.739
 the guy here is still building no 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.900
 no leads and let tune no 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.269
 stood out honestly can say no 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.579
 issued because it was not yet 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.290
 appeal even from the developer seems to be 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.930
 issuing permission to eschew and course 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.420
 but on the gold we were told that already 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.359
 warrant there is a warrant for earthworks 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.290
 this is 1 or just a scarf I will interrogate rfid 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:15.450
 earth say no how many let's say 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:20.100
 let's hear our comrades 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.959
 56 is not important to us and you want that 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.210
 here are these wells 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.410
 no no archaeological research 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:31.729
 also so that they do not break the layer which 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.729
 no summer yet 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.770
 and why the lips street enter this zone here 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.420
 it is because we are bordered about you that 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.060
 we ignore us altogether 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.690
 and residents are not perceived this village 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:06:18.650
 will know perfectly well why burkova is not 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:06:18.650
 borders speak in my heart . 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:35.000
 I'll explain again 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.380
 because there are rules on which everything is built 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:44.170
 do it and ecology norms 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.400
 administration officials say 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.790
 representative removed 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.700
 guys carry over the holidays yes people 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:54.700
 calm down and comrade woes go nafig 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:07:04.480
 by and large hands I have everything and how 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:08.430
 would say well here's my can't order 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:28.440
 I will ask without a dozen people this work 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:34.530
 asked to transfer these works to the holiday 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:34.530
