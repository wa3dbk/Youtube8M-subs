00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.880
 I have my notebook here, I do not 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.770
 I change my desktop in goiânia yet 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.170
 I could not find a way to bring it here. 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.570
 we have a lamp too we have here 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.950
 a monitor that was what brought you from 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.869
 last trip I made to goiânia 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.720
 brought in this box is not his box 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.640
 but club but what happens is a monitor 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 television that I brought to power 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.140
 connect my ps3 that is connected here 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.860
 and I turned it on so I could do the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.920
 My plate test wants to see me sent from 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.900
 live live game has formed a better lake 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.060
 well this is the name of the board exactly 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.619
 which is an interesting plaque she can 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.590
 record with the without the use of the computer 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.240
 after recording to memory card I had 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.759
 some good experiences with them 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.409
 It's so far but not so good because she 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.090
 to write to memory cards to 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.250
 not need the computer on the side to 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.469
 able to record it needs to develop 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.700
 to light here she needs the card 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.310
 sdhc class 10 memory 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.079
 If you do not have one of those, it's no good. 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.789
 I have cards that are better than this. 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.360
 have the most modern cards that 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.480
 usb x section faster and fit more 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.890
 thing in it are six I have and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.569
 It does not work now, I'll have to run. 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.760
 behind the older card more 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.170
 has been exceeded to operate a 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.489
 new capture but this has a lot of 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.170
 good thing, she'll eventually go 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.599
 make a video talking as soon as you can 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.540
 test everything coming here 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.120
 we have there the box of my microwave is the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.159
 next these micro 19 some to you 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.510
 one day god who bought her left for 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.010
 buy when she saw that I was 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.769
 sick I turned to him and said so 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.959
 saw a microwave purchase in which it fit 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.379
 the dishes I bought from a set 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.239
 of cups of crap to have there 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.359
 large she bought larger microwaves than 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.450
 It was very big that I have a 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:57.180
 in the kitchen and tomatoes for 34 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.650
 But here it is in Monark's suitcase that the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.060
 I brought it from his house. I got it heavy. 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.419
 to do my things I brought that 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.099
 backpack is also what is with the 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.150
 super nintendo tapes and cars there 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.919
 inside too 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.769
 here you see that everything is messy 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:12.120
 neither expensive 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.069
 only today that more things came 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.540
 The monarch's house was there also, I 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.349
 I have my basket in 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.849
 supermarket 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.879
 this here is very good and has a supermarket 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.199
 here I'll take the basket and take the 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.780
 supermarket and I do not need to take 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.729
 Plastic sachets pick up nothing and I 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.250
 I bring things home dragging 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:32.159
 good inside the consistent basket fair 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.000
 and inside it has more game than I used 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.669
 around 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.489
 yesterday games I used to go to the house of 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:40.290
 unborn child and get things 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.359
 I got to see I do not know I did not see it on the display 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.440
 brave who gets a lot of everything 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.479
 very far 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.430
 that's her problem we have heater and 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.979
 I also became ill understand 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.500
 heater I wanted to buy another oil 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.810
 either only has oil in it so 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.090
 I just did not have it any more when I went to buy 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.949
 what to buy on the coldest day of 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.449
 year and everyone had already bought a 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.569
 arrested that at least one that moves this 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:06.389
 genius has no risk of dying asphyxiated 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.489
 I do not know if anything will be contaminated by 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.220
 our economy said 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.919
 but for now it's like this from here 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.919
 room that as incredible as it may seem I am 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:19.139
 the room more furniture in the house because 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.470

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.750
 low income who do not buy 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.610
 chair still there I'm using it 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.020
 understood she is foldable 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.820

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.140

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.630
 people I wanted to show you are a 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.460
