00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.820
 the week anticipates is special 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.950
 because without bribes with a meat 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.840
 of a lifetime neighborhood is something 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.719
 special people stop you and tell you that 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.640
 are matches that you have to win and the 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.099
 true that one to one comes to him 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.150
 but good also the people expected it 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:26.220
 because it had not been played for a long time 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.250
 because of the theme that this key was and not 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.449
 there was that possibility so nothing 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.870
 waiting for that match with many 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.220
 desire are classics and one those matches 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.250
 he always wants to play he always wants 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.530
 be obviously if the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.559
 you will train differently 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.040
 enjoy the day to day of training 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.050
 Y 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.380
 and you're happy more than anything because 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.360
 you know what you earn today and if you go 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.120
 walking and I have to do some fan 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.610
 de san lorenzo lets you know what 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.900
 obviously it's going to be enough 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.940
 happy so we know if it happens 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.740
 that happens that but then it also happens 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.450
 the opposite of that if not things do not 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.500
 They go well also sound like one week 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.540
 not a good and a little annoying but 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.670
 well we will try as always to give what 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.340
 better and make a game obviously 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.009
 win that the most important thing are classics 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.820
 and juana death and and of the dice that we have 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.650
 won 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.750
 we have the seasoning that we play 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.840
 local with our people that there is no 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.540
 there are people visitor and will stay a 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.190
 court full of fans san lorenzo and 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.650
 that always obviously plays he played 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.390
 favor 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.810
 then in a match can happen 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.570
 anything but the idea is to go to 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.620
 look for that protagonist of the party and 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.240
 Obviously to win hopefully it can not be 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.310
 matter of 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.009
 of how rival comes from how it leads a 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.210
 experience oxide are not classics 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.740
 they play when another way so from 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.200
 side part 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.760
 we're going to want to win and we're going to try to 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.830
 Give the best 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.350
 does not have to change much and what 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.600
 is doing 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.900
 the last three matches although the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.400
 last was only the one we won but 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.010
 we improve a lot in football 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.530
 we have another game level another 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.760
 game volume the team looks looks 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.890
 best 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.500
 we lack a bit of luck in the subject 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.620
 definition or improve the theme of the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.260
 definition but I think that level games 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.890
 they are still improving in the last matches 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.170
 I have if I have several 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.770
 luckily I have more more in favor than in 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.450
 against but good I'll take the 4 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.380
 do what we win in hurricane court 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.690
 I think it's obvious and I remember made 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.900
 like two patrician auto goals that 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.130
 directed and up and good is the one that 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.130
 always remember
