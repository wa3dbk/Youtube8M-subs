00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.440
 good welcome really new 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.269
 let's do a technique that I learned 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:18.650
 also on youtube 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.349
 it serves to know what power we have 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.039
 to use in the flashes when not 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.369
 we have a photo we had a photometer 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.369
 we ask here 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.250
 you have to put them 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.360
 then what you are going to have to 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.930
 do is the first one you have in the 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.040
 camera 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.140
 obviously I organize 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.860
 for essential the diaphragm with which 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.570
 Esteban 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.790
 to seed the shutter speed 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.650
 It has been achieved shutter if you 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.630
 they want it to affect the environments 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.030
 they have to put a lower speed 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.150
 of the nation there they just want that 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.660
 make your products subject or whatever 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:09.280
 I just said the speed of the deadline 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.390
 draw with the speed of 5 500 hundred 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.520
 of followers 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.470
 then when I'm working 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:21.729
 only with this flash in the flash that 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.729
 I have on the camera with flash 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.040
 remember this technique what is going to 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.490
 show is 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.080
 as it is correctly exposed this in 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.840
 this case this pack of cigarettes 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.750
 putting the light at that distance in that 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.380
 angle will not create say that light is 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.910
 correct for this product many times 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.740
 you may have to change the 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.509
 angle of light 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.890
 because you also change it to see 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.180
 what generates 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.680
 it's completely different 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:59.420
 so what does this consist 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:01.640
 I have also the focus of manuel is said 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.740
 the focus with the autofocus and then what 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.319
 I put manual thing she did not change the focus 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.170
 of my product 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.439
 then what I do is a great love 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.439
 in front of 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.770
 the product that I'm going to photograph with 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.250
 is the light of people who are 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.690
 striking a white sheet and I make a 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.040
 first picture I'm working here 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:31.730
 as I said in a 200 the second and 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.930
 determine good to did 200 and a f 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.860
 and the power this term is a means 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.860
 I'm going to take a picture 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.439
 and you put the function where they 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:47.810
 it flashes I do not know if there is the camera the shot 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.280
 good the white sheet and it is not 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.319
 blinking that means I 'm 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.749
 losing record 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.900
 in my photo it means that the 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:59.409
 intensity of this from this flash towards 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.590
 this white sheet is very strong then 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:06.579
 I'm going to lower it by half, we're going to go 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.579
 quarter 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:15.400
 to the other shot and I see also in the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.190
 function keeps flashing my white sheet 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.740
 it means that I 'm overexposed 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.740
 let's go down one more step 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.450
 an eighth 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.190
 good and see, I already needed to take 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.190
 let's get closer here 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.650
 well the white sheet has a blink 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.160
 very small and then I am 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.160
 saying there 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.890
 the intensity the power 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.350
 strong in that position seemed correct 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.000
 and there 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.840
 they take soy 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.840
 the squad 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.910
 and they make their picture and there the product in 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.910
 theory 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.879
 they are left with an exhibition 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.810
 notice that I practically lose a 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.900
 little bit of registration because it has the 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.780
 cellophane paper this is the ones 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.330
 cellophane paper grills and if you guys 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.960
 you see the histogram I have a program 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.700
 quite correct I do not know for these pictures 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.760
 I'm with a black background obviously 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.960
 I have all black background if 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.930
 I'm here but then I have it 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.730
 distributed with all all the highs and 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.120
 halftones I hope to use he has 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.730
 served this huge tutorial more than to 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.110
 one of the questions that made me one of 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.170
 the subscribers 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:08.900
 but that it serves you and is also dedicated 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.790
 to all the sitting shirts what 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.479
 that sell to Argentina the 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:17.960
 photometers at exorbitant prices 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.669
 I mean hopefully the people who serve this 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.340
 you have to buy fewer photometers at all 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.199
 these chantas that they embrace in bringing 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.970
 from outside to the value weights and color of 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.970
 local 4000 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:39.029
 so I wish everyone left and 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.029
 all of you subscribers give a 40
