still like leave the green some little

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.380 
still like leave the green some little
bit<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.410> help<00:00:58.850> but<00:00:59.850> that's<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> only<00:01:00.269> place

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
bit of help but that's the only place

bit of help but that's the only place
now<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:00.870> are<00:01:00.989> some<00:01:01.140> specific<00:01:01.769> leaves<00:01:02.070> that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
now there are some specific leaves that

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.799 
now there are some specific leaves that
we<00:01:02.730> might<00:01:02.879> want<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> look<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.239> mean<00:01:03.359> lots<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
we might want to look I mean lots of

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.560 
we might want to look I mean lots of
leafy<00:01:04.019> greens<00:01:04.350> don't<00:01:04.559> fit<00:01:04.860> right<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.880> some<00:01:06.480> of

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
leafy greens don't fit right so some of

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.850 
leafy greens don't fit right so some of
you<00:01:06.660> heard<00:01:06.780> me<00:01:06.900> say<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.080> before<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.470> again

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
you heard me say this before but again

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.290 
you heard me say this before but again
if<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.520> could<00:01:08.670> make<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> pair<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> shoes

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
if you could make a pair of shoes

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.660 
if you could make a pair of shoes
that'll<00:01:09.570> beliefe<00:01:09.870> Green<00:01:10.050> donated<00:01:10.580> all<00:01:11.580> right

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
that'll beliefe Green donated all right

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.010 
that'll beliefe Green donated all right
so<00:01:11.759> these<00:01:11.880> dense<00:01:12.180> leathery<00:01:12.540> things<00:01:12.840> that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
so these dense leathery things that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.330 
so these dense leathery things that
everyone<00:01:13.200> thinks<00:01:13.470> are<00:01:13.710> great<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:14.100> they

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
everyone thinks are great because they

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.380 
everyone thinks are great because they
have<00:01:14.400> more<00:01:14.580> nutrition<00:01:15.290> don't<00:01:16.290> eat<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
have more nutrition don't eat it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.910 
have more nutrition don't eat it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.109 
kale collard greens cabbage chard the
these<00:01:23.280> things<00:01:23.610> are<00:01:28.520> there's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> combination

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
these things are there's a combination

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.090 
these things are there's a combination
of<00:01:30.180> factors<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.720> mean<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.049> they<00:01:31.619> tend<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> have

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
of factors I mean a they tend to have

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.940 
of factors I mean a they tend to have
about<00:01:32.340> three<00:01:32.700> times<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.329> much<00:01:33.950> cellulose

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
about three times as much cellulose

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
about three times as much cellulose
which<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.549> indigestible<00:01:36.119> fiber<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> three

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
which is indigestible fiber so the three

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.469 
which is indigestible fiber so the three
times<00:01:37.829> harder<00:01:38.100> for<00:01:38.310> your<00:01:38.430> body<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.729> digest<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
times harder for your body to digest and

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.080 
times harder for your body to digest and
lettuce<00:01:39.979> too<00:01:40.979> they<00:01:41.250> tend<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> contain<00:01:41.850> things

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
lettuce too they tend to contain things

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.679 
lettuce too they tend to contain things
like<00:01:42.240> mustard<00:01:43.100> okay<00:01:44.100> which<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.880> poison

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
like mustard okay which is poison

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.899 
like mustard okay which is poison
ever<00:01:46.259> heard<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> mustard<00:01:46.770> gas<00:01:46.979> it's<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
ever heard of mustard gas it's the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.160 
ever heard of mustard gas it's the
saying<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.420> where<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.689> comes<00:01:48.869> from

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
saying this is where it comes from

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.459 
saying this is where it comes from
this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.680> poisonous<00:01:50.189> stuff<00:01:50.540> for<00:01:51.540> most<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.439> us

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
this is poisonous stuff for most of us

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.380 
this is poisonous stuff for most of us
have<00:01:52.710> trouble<00:01:53.130> because<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.180> density

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
have trouble because of the the density

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.370 
have trouble because of the the density
of<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.020> starch<00:01:55.820> even<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.030> not<00:01:57.210> Salus<00:01:57.840> we

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
of the starch even if it's not Salus we

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.959 
of the starch even if it's not Salus we
have<00:01:58.500> trouble<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.250> most<00:01:59.610> human

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
have trouble with it so most human

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.450 
have trouble with it so most human
beings<00:02:00.000> have<00:02:00.810> trouble<00:02:01.259> digesting<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.219> stuff

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
beings have trouble digesting this stuff

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.300 
beings have trouble digesting this stuff
what<00:02:02.759> does<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.880> mean<00:02:03.920> well<00:02:04.920> if<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.070> can't

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
what does that mean well if we can't

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.580 
what does that mean well if we can't
digest<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.149> can't<00:02:06.479> absorb<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.140> nutrients

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
digest it we can't absorb the nutrients

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.699 
digest it we can't absorb the nutrients
they<00:02:07.740> don't<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:07.979> can't<00:02:08.190> assume

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
they don't we can't assume

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.490 
they don't we can't assume
we<00:02:08.950> don't<00:02:09.129> absorb<00:02:09.429> we're<00:02:10.030> not<00:02:10.149> getting<00:02:10.539> nearly

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
we don't absorb we're not getting nearly

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.110 
we don't absorb we're not getting nearly
so<00:02:11.709> much<00:02:11.769> benefit<00:02:12.280> from<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.609> no<00:02:12.760> matter<00:02:12.909> how

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
so much benefit from it no matter how

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.849 
so much benefit from it no matter how
many<00:02:13.239> nutrients<00:02:13.719> are<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:14.709> about

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
many nutrients are in it it's about

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.740 
many nutrients are in it it's about
what's<00:02:15.069> getting<00:02:15.219> into<00:02:15.459> ourselves<00:02:16.000> if<00:02:16.599> we're

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
what's getting into ourselves if we're

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.839 
what's getting into ourselves if we're
not<00:02:16.870> digesting<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.620> very<00:02:17.799> well<00:02:18.010> you're<00:02:18.730> not

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
hoping for is to be able to reproduce

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.309 
hoping for is to be able to reproduce
that's<00:03:48.819> the<00:03:49.060> point<00:03:49.239> is<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.900> make<00:03:50.019> as<00:03:50.199> many

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
that's the point is to make as many

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.899 
that's the point is to make as many
copies<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.859> themselves<00:03:51.280> as<00:03:51.430> possible<00:03:51.849> they

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
copies of themselves as possible they

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.689 
copies of themselves as possible they
can<00:03:51.970> only<00:03:52.180> do<00:03:52.389> that<00:03:52.540> if<00:03:52.659> they<00:03:52.750> survive<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:54.370> they

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
can only do that if they survive so they

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.699 
can only do that if they survive so they
don't<00:03:55.000> want<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.239> be<00:03:55.329> and<00:03:55.750> what<00:03:56.259> they're<00:03:56.439> doing

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
don't want to be and what they're doing

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:57.839 
don't want to be and what they're doing
is<00:03:56.829> they're<00:03:56.949> putting<00:03:57.310> some<00:03:57.459> of<00:03:57.519> their<00:03:57.699> energy

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
is they're putting some of their energy

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.539 
is they're putting some of their energy
into<00:03:58.479> manufacturing<00:03:58.870> these<00:03:59.530> chemicals<00:04:00.099> that

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
into manufacturing these chemicals that

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.520 
into manufacturing these chemicals that
make<00:04:00.909> them<00:04:01.180> toxic<00:04:01.629> that<00:04:01.810> make<00:04:01.930> them<00:04:02.109> taste<00:04:02.349> bad

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
make them toxic that make them taste bad

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.229 
make them toxic that make them taste bad

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
because maybe we have a taste bud for

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:21.569 
because maybe we have a taste bud for
bitter<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:21.130> we

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
bitter so we

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.820 
bitter so we
but<00:04:21.669> not<00:04:21.879> to<00:04:22.060> eat<00:04:22.379> because<00:04:23.379> things<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.740> are

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
but not to eat because things that are

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.710 
but not to eat because things that are
poisonous<00:04:24.009> to<00:04:24.310> us<00:04:24.550> tend<00:04:24.849> to<00:04:24.879> taste<00:04:25.650> bitter

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
poisonous to us tend to taste bitter

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.499 
poisonous to us tend to taste bitter
most<00:04:28.720> poisons<00:04:29.199> taste<00:04:29.439> bitter<00:04:29.710> to<00:04:30.099> us<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.550> think

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
most poisons taste bitter to us I think

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:39.480 
most poisons taste bitter to us I think
it's<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.960> tell<00:04:32.110> us<00:04:32.199> what<00:04:32.379> not<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.740> eat<00:04:38.490> only

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
it's to tell us what not to eat only

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.330 
it's to tell us what not to eat only
young<00:04:40.030> ones<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:41.800> other<00:04:41.889> ones<00:04:41.979> will<00:04:42.159> taste

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
young ones the other ones will taste

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.429 
young ones the other ones will taste
much<00:04:42.520> better<00:04:42.819> and<00:04:43.659> if<00:04:43.780> they<00:04:43.870> spill<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.259> better

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:44.439 
much better and if they spill to better

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:47.189 
much better and if they spill to better
don't<00:04:45.129> eat<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:45.629> okay<00:04:46.629> you<00:04:46.689> don't<00:04:46.840> have<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.080> eat

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199

any of these things I'll eat the ones

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.899 
any of these things I'll eat the ones
that<00:04:49.300> taste<00:04:49.539> good<00:04:49.750> to<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:53.520> parents<00:04:54.520> no

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:06.969 
parents yeah rich vegetables in general

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:08.850 
parents yeah rich vegetables in general
are<00:05:07.479> pretty<00:05:07.539> difficult<00:05:08.050> for<00:05:08.469> our<00:05:08.560> bodies<00:05:08.830> to

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
are pretty difficult for our bodies to

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:16.709 
are pretty difficult for our bodies to
break<00:05:09.460> down<00:05:11.639> carrots<00:05:12.639> are<00:05:15.060> well<00:05:16.060> carrots<00:05:16.539> are

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
break down carrots are well carrots are

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.570 
break down carrots are well carrots are
maybe<00:05:17.379> easier<00:05:17.800> than<00:05:17.979> some<00:05:18.159> of<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.310> other<00:05:18.430> ones

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
maybe easier than some of the other ones

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.769 
maybe easier than some of the other ones
like<00:05:18.669> beets<00:05:18.940> for<00:05:19.180> instance<00:05:19.539> they're<00:05:19.689> almost

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:19.779 
like beets for instance they're almost

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:23.070 
like beets for instance they're almost
impossible<00:05:20.500> for<00:05:20.529> the<00:05:20.710> body<00:05:20.919> to<00:05:21.069> digest<00:05:22.080> you

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
impossible for the body to digest you

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.809 
impossible for the body to digest you
know<00:05:23.169> people<00:05:23.439> think<00:05:23.620> they're<00:05:23.830> so<00:05:24.370> good<00:05:24.580> for<00:05:24.789> us

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
know people think they're so good for us

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.879 
know people think they're so good for us
but<00:05:25.090> you<00:05:25.419> can't<00:05:26.080> really<00:05:26.199> get<00:05:26.349> much<00:05:26.529> from<00:05:26.740> them

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
but you can't really get much from them

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.050 
but you can't really get much from them
because<00:05:26.979> you're<00:05:27.219> not<00:05:27.340> going<00:05:27.460> to<00:05:27.520> digest<00:05:27.699> them

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
because you're not going to digest them

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.480 
because you're not going to digest them
very<00:05:28.270> well<00:05:28.949> carrots<00:05:29.949> are<00:05:30.039> probably<00:05:30.279> a<00:05:30.340> little

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
very well carrots are probably a little

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.040 
very well carrots are probably a little
bit<00:05:30.580> easier<00:05:30.849> than<00:05:30.969> beets<00:05:31.210> not<00:05:31.479> quite<00:05:31.690> as<00:05:31.840> dense

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
bit easier than beets not quite as dense

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.100 
bit easier than beets not quite as dense
or<00:05:32.319> hard<00:05:32.560> but<00:05:33.159> most<00:05:33.430> most<00:05:34.210> root<00:05:34.509> vegetables<00:05:34.990> in

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.659

general<00:05:35.560> are<00:05:35.650> pretty<00:05:35.860> difficult<00:05:36.069> for<00:05:36.340> us<00:05:36.550> no

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
general are pretty difficult for us no

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.459 
general are pretty difficult for us no
why<00:05:37.060> would<00:05:37.300> we<00:05:37.389> eat<00:05:37.509> carrots<00:05:37.839> anyway<00:05:38.139> what's

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
why would we eat carrots anyway what's

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.269 
why would we eat carrots anyway what's
the<00:05:38.589> benefit<00:05:38.830> of<00:05:38.919> carrots<00:05:40.770> for<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.830> carotenes

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 
the benefit of carrots for the carotenes

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.490 
the benefit of carrots for the carotenes
right<00:05:42.849> most<00:05:43.150> people<00:05:43.419> think<00:05:43.629> beta-carotene<00:05:44.110> is

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500

in<00:05:45.009> fact<00:05:45.400> there's<00:05:45.580> a<00:05:45.639> whole<00:05:45.729> family<00:05:46.180> of

carotenes what's that doing not only to
