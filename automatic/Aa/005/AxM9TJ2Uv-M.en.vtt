you<00:00:28.680> look<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:29.010> your<00:00:29.189> chain<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:30.300> can<00:00:30.449> tell<00:00:30.660> that

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
you look at your chain you can tell that

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.200 
you look at your chain you can tell that
each<00:00:30.990> stitch<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.769> composed<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.880> three

each stitch is composed of three

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.530 
each stitch is composed of three
different<00:00:33.390> sections<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.170> yarn<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:36.120> top<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
different sections of yarn on the top of

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.470 
different sections of yarn on the top of
the<00:00:36.690> chain<00:00:36.989> there<00:00:37.950> are<00:00:38.100> two<00:00:38.399> pieces<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.180> yarn

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the chain there are two pieces of yarn

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.000 
the chain there are two pieces of yarn
that<00:00:39.690> come<00:00:39.870> together<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> bottom<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that come together at the bottom and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.869 
that come together at the bottom and
sort<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.940> v-shape<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.309> if<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.460> flip<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
sort of a v-shape and if you flip the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.389 
sort of a v-shape and if you flip the
chain<00:00:45.120> over<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.800> there's<00:00:47.190> one

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
chain over you can see that there's one

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.270 
chain over you can see that there's one
piece<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.700> yarn<00:00:48.059> underneath<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:49.039> so<00:00:50.039> there's

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
piece of yarn underneath that so there's

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.330 
piece of yarn underneath that so there's
two<00:00:50.760> pieces<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> top<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.110> chain<00:00:52.379> one

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
two pieces on the top of the chain one

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.400 
two pieces on the top of the chain one
underneath<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.379> a

you<00:01:14.689> wrap<00:01:14.929> a<00:01:14.960> piece<00:01:15.259> of<00:01:15.320> yarn<00:01:15.710> from<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.100> back

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
you wrap a piece of yarn from the back

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.260 
you wrap a piece of yarn from the back
to<00:01:17.299> the<00:01:17.329> front<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:18.079> the<00:01:18.560> hook<00:01:19.509> pull<00:01:20.509> it<00:01:20.539> through

the front and pull it through both loops
on<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.590> hook<00:02:05.560> so<00:02:06.560> if<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.039> continue<00:02:07.549> doing

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
on the hook so if you continue doing

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.500 
on the hook so if you continue doing
that<00:02:08.530> along<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.739> entire<00:02:10.069> chain<00:02:12.190> eventually

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
that along the entire chain eventually

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.150 
that along the entire chain eventually
you'll<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> row<00:02:15.019> of<00:02:15.260> single<00:02:15.560> crochet

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
you'll have a row of single crochet

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.640 
you'll have a row of single crochet
stitches
