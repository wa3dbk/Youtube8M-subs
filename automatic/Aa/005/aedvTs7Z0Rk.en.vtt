00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
slightly larger hands today the idea is

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.430 
slightly larger hands today the idea is
that<00:00:27.490> we've<00:00:27.910> made<00:00:28.120> a<00:00:28.150> sensation<00:00:29.080> with

that we've made a sensation with

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.010 
that we've made a sensation with
upgraded<00:00:30.160> processor<00:00:30.190> but<00:00:31.030> 1.5<00:00:31.720> gigs

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
upgraded processor but 1.5 gigs

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.900 
upgraded processor but 1.5 gigs
dual-core<00:00:32.650> processor<00:00:33.490> and<00:00:34.300> with<00:00:34.570> extra<00:00:35.910> extra

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
dual-core processor and with extra extra

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.819 
dual-core processor and with extra extra
hardware<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:37.570> software<00:00:37.840> around<00:00:38.739> the

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
hardware and software around the

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.340 
hardware and software around the
beachhead<00:00:39.280> six<00:00:39.579> so<00:00:40.239> we<00:00:40.420> changed<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.200> design

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
beachhead six so we changed the design

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.770 
beachhead six so we changed the design
ever<00:00:41.980> so<00:00:42.190> slightly<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.900> to<00:00:43.900> match<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.320> beats

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
ever so slightly to to match the beats

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.459 
ever so slightly to to match the beats
and<00:00:46.320> we've<00:00:46.559> changed<00:00:48.079> some<00:00:49.079> parts<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and we've changed some parts of the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.990 
and we've changed some parts of the
motherboard<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.219> we've<00:00:50.460> changed<00:00:50.699> some<00:00:50.969> of

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
motherboard and we've changed some of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.299 
motherboard and we've changed some of
the<00:00:51.149> software<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.289> when<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.649> claim<00:00:53.100> use

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the software so that when you claim use

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.100 
the software so that when you claim use
it<00:00:53.489> when<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.910> put<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> sort<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.660> beats

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
it when you put a sort of beats

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.680 
it when you put a sort of beats
headphones<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:56.790> automatically<00:00:57.480> pick

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
headphones in it will automatically pick

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.900 
headphones in it will automatically pick
that<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.670> beats<00:01:00.059> audio<00:01:00.360> mode

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
that up and you get a beats audio mode

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.550 
that up and you get a beats audio mode
so<00:01:02.180> that<00:01:02.300> will<00:01:02.480> only<00:01:02.600> work<00:01:02.840> with<00:01:03.020> be<00:01:03.170> to<00:01:03.380> work

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
so that will only work with be to work

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.900 
so that will only work with be to work
with<00:01:03.710> any<00:01:03.829> of<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:03.980> older<00:01:04.250> beat<00:01:04.400> but<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.760> only

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
with any of the older beat but it only

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.600 
with any of the older beat but it only
work<00:01:05.180> with<00:01:05.330> Beats<00:01:05.540> headphones<00:01:06.460> you<00:01:07.460> can

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
work with Beats headphones you can

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.070 
work with Beats headphones you can
disable<00:01:07.910> it<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.240> it<00:01:08.420> will<00:01:08.510> disable<00:01:08.810> the

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
disable it and it will disable the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.380 
disable it and it will disable the
software<00:01:09.500> elements<00:01:09.950> but<00:01:10.700> it's<00:01:10.850> made<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.090> work

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
software elements but it's made to work

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.969 
software elements but it's made to work
the<00:01:11.810> beats<00:01:12.080> are<00:01:12.350> obviously<00:01:12.770> made<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:14.000> work<00:01:14.979> in

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
the beats are obviously made to work in

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.980 
the beats are obviously made to work in
a<00:01:16.190> non-flat<00:01:16.850> sound<00:01:17.450> way<00:01:17.630> they're<00:01:17.840> made<00:01:17.960> to

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
a non-flat sound way they're made to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.810 
a non-flat sound way they're made to
enhance<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.619> sound<00:01:18.800> so<00:01:19.400> we<00:01:19.520> can<00:01:19.670> just

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
enhance the sound so we can just

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.100 
enhance the sound so we can just
increase<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.390> enhancement<00:01:21.200> on<00:01:21.290> this<00:01:21.500> house

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.860 

and<00:01:26.110> that's<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:27.060> HTC<00:01:28.060> Sensation<00:01:28.930> xing<00:01:30.870> and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
and that's the HTC Sensation xing and

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.320 
and that's the HTC Sensation xing and
this<00:01:32.020> is<00:01:32.170> due<00:01:32.350> out<00:01:32.410> when<00:01:32.760> this<00:01:33.760> is<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.060> first

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
this is due out when this is the first

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.060 
this is due out when this is the first
time<00:01:34.570> in<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.840> world<00:01:35.080> we're<00:01:35.350> talking<00:01:35.680> about<00:01:35.800> it

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
time in the world we're talking about it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
to go with that process we've got a much

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.820 
to go with that process we've got a much
larger<00:01:54.730> battery<00:01:55.060> some<00:01:55.480> go<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.660> 17<00:01:56.140> 15<00:01:56.560> million

larger battery some go to 17 15 million

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.760 
larger battery some go to 17 15 million
family<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.540> larger<00:01:59.110> battery<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.530> go<00:01:59.650> with

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
family so a larger battery to go with

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.090 
family so a larger battery to go with
the<00:01:59.830> market

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
the market

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.859
