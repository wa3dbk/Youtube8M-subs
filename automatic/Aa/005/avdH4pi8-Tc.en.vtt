00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.260
 let's prepare a floury cake for 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.740
 we need it 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:23.039
 no grams of sugar 2 eggs 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:26.640
 strength flour 50 grams of milk 75 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:31.970
 grams of olive oil 15 grams of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.970
 fresh yeast and a little bit of anise 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.770
 later to make a filling that 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.320
 take this cake we will need 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.079
 the little bit of anise a little more flour 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.019
 to sugar 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.409
 and with that there was oil and with that we will do 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.539
 a filling but later I'll tell you what 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:56.350
 first we put the 100 grams of sugar 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:59.590
 and the two eggs in a bowl and the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.310
 let's beat well until foam 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.950
 You can see how it has already been sparkling 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.560
 almost doubled the volume this is 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.100
 whiten eggs with sugar now 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.260
 let's add the 75 grams of oil 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.830
 olive and we will continue beating a 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.350
 little in the little glass where we had the 50 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.680
 grams of milk we have added the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.400
 fresh yeast 15 grams we undo it 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.950
 well and this content we pour it where 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.560
 we have the previous mix we will continue 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.630
 doing to mix well and finally 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.420
 let's go adding the little flour to 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.000
 little in this case already mixing with the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.130
 kneading rods could also be 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.530
 dial by hand but good taking advantage 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.899
 that I have the kneader is because the go 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.240
 to use then let's go throwing 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.310
 flour but it should not be thick 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.490
 mass because if not then it hardens 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.369
 much the cake then in the end I'll tell you 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.210
 the exact amount that I have already cast 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.000
 we have the mass here 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.799
 I have put 250 grams of flour 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.929
 force sticks a lot but is that if you 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.220
 we threw a lot of flour the cake that was 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.470
 It is very hard then, although you see that 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.569
 it is hosted by the hands 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.060
 Well a little patience 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.480
 unta is a dish with a little bit of 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.160
 oil you put it and now covered with 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.360
 We will let the film rest 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:34.510
 until double volume to accelerate the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:37.390
 process I usually put the 40 Â° only 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.880
 I put the dough and with that temperature 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.180
 ferment before then now let's 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.250
 wait for this to double the volume to 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.340
 make the filling of the cake 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.100
 we have put in this container 6 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.440
 tablespoons of sugar 6 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.550
 soup spoons 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.280
 the olive tea a spoonful of anise and 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.220
 two tablespoons of flour we have 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.160
 mixed well and now we reserve it for 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.470
 use it later 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.100
 You see how he has achieved progress 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.380
 now we are going to split it in half 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.080
 let's make two parts one for the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.260
 base and another for the top 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.590
 as the dough is so soft what 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.720
 we had to do is join with 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.420
 oil the roller so it does not stick 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.350
 when stretching it then we have here 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.380
 stretched the bottom part and now we're going 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.270
 to do the same with the other half but 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.610
 I say do not despair even if you see 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.290
 that is very soft 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.740
 or you join hands with a 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.230
 little oil and stretch them 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.290
 pressing until I get that chasm 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.990
 a sheet or with the roller a 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.780
 little bit smeared in oil now let's 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.209
 stretch the other part 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.860
 then we have put the filling 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.260
 in the part that is going to be 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.850
 the bottom of the cake and we have 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.850
 spread with a spoon 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.480
 the filling as it is thick there is no 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.010
 problem now the part that is going to be the 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.920
 cake top 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.090
 is helping us with the same role 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.760
 we are going to dump on the other part 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.070
 we have prepared the cake with 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.800
 careful we have put the top 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.500
 It is preferable to have a smear with a 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.990
 little oil for baking paper 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.210
 that the mass is released better but 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.030
 well there is no problem of all 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.040
 ways now once we've put 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.479
 the top part we have put together a 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:51.860
 little the edges so that it stays 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:55.710
 lies simply by pressing and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.750
 putting them together in any way and by 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.500
 over we have sprinkled abundantly 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.250
 sugar let's leave again a little while 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:08.340
 that I can meditate again and 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.639
 last we will have to bake the 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.470
 here we have this freshly floury cake 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.340
 taken out of the oven 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.430
 we've had it 20 minutes at 180 to 190 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.820
 degrees and this is the look so 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.880
 phenomenal that takes out now we will leave it 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:30.169
 cool on a rack and once cold 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.169
 to eat
