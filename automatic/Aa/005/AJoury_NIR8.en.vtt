00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.259
 good afternoon my name is egor one and i 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.400
 just now set on your happiness 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.990
 warfare os android 4 0 and also look for 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.580
 Sans 40 is originally on this phone 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:26.189
 installed android 23 jun bird and look for 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.439
 cs2 and 1 unfortunately chassis company not 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.890
 gave an update to this phone so 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.630
 android 4 0 maybe this is due to 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.750
 marketing ploy as it came out 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.989
 new model htc desire c principle nothing 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.059
 no different from this phone by 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.309
 characteristics except operating 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.440
 system that is there agreed 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.860
 operating system android 4 0 here 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.840
 android 2 3 here but since we were not given 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.589
 of this update I decided it myself 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:06.000
 do well 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.240
 phone performance increased 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.110
 twice it proves the results 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.990
 testing in the benchmark program and 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:23.189
 the whole end result was two times higher 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:31.549
 times on android 4 0 here let's 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:39.409
 let's see here we 'll see the principle 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:39.409
 standard look for sense 4 0 here 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.220
 Carlson 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:00.050
 let's go to the menu, let's see the menu 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:06.360
 here a little different than that 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:09.420
 htc sense 40 present because it 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.730
 connected to this one here touch panel 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.230
 see here four buttons that is here 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.660
 see the principle one difference here 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.840
 but here's a button added to the screen 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.150
 expectations this is due to this one 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.420
 touch pad because here are four 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.070
 touch keys 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:41.000
 Ice contract look for 40 now doing 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:44.250
 three keys here is such an interface 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.209
 here daddies can now be created here 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:54.269
 cool here still want to say something 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:58.650
 here is much more convenient keyboard 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:00.560
 than she was two and three very nice 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.570
 response 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.200
 that is, it is a pleasure to print 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.700
 still the main feature of this keyboard 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:16.340
 the fact that there is one language change 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:19.980
 move your finger over the space like this 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.220
 if on 2 and 3 there it was necessary to climb in 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.650
 almost all settings change there 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.250
 what on to change language it went away 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.350
 I don't know, maybe half a minute somewhere 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:38.250
 here with one hand movement then change 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:42.630
 keyboard layout like this 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.720
 that they rather say what else in android 4 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.980
 0 power consumption optimized 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.239
 I do not know yet I can not say anything 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.600
 since i only installed it on 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:59.720
 They say that the battery holds longer than 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:05.360
 2 and 3 here also eats less RAM 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.360
 operatives are 70 megabytes less 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:16.299
 so here android 4 0 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:20.030
 here ah yes I forgot to say that 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.550
 Initially here the processor frequency is on 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.210
 600 megahertz 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:29.480
 but on this operating system 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:35.200
 CPU clock speed up to 832 my 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:39.950
 readers of that is to become more powerful 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:42.160
 pretty much the model itself 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.160
 kera is not bad 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.160
 here
