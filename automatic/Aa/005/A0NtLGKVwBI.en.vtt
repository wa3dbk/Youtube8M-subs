that the hourglass is sitting on is one

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210 
that the hourglass is sitting on is one
of<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.360> only<00:01:42.479> areas<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.020> isn't<00:01:43.259> lava<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
of the only areas that isn't lava if you

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.889 
of the only areas that isn't lava if you
wait<00:01:44.399> long<00:01:44.430> enough<00:01:44.670> no<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> wouldn't

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
wait long enough no so I wouldn't

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.420 
wait long enough no so I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.409> sitting<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.100> spot

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
