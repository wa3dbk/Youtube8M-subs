00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.910
 the security cameras of a building 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.259
 de santiago demonstrated how to act 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.000
 delinquents at the time of stealing a 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.680
 vehicle in this case we're going to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 perform because they have several errors in 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.709
 principle appears in the images leave 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.290
 traces and traces of blood that 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:20.290
 will allow to know their identities 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.290
 Y 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:29.430
 to take a couple of seconds to open the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.960
 hood or unplug the alarm and try to 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.300
 start the vehicle these two subjects 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.309
 they took advantage of the darkness of the night in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.250
 the biblical club sector to try 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.280
 take this 4x4 vehicle were delayed 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.860
 little more than two minutes time during 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.050
 which the first young man arrives and breaks the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.739
 rear side glass then they are directed 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.839
 to the hood to disconnect the alarm all 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.589
 was frustrated when the vehicle was blocked 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.180
 and must retire with empty hands 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.220
 Of course, they never knew what cameras 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.860
 security registered all their 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.180
 movements that also committed 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.979
 another mistake they left a samples of 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.479
 blood when breaking the glass 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.860
 they must have been cut and they left 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.950
 all the vehicle inside with 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.900
 blood some blood stains on 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.920
 particular that have been found to be 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.920
 they have done some surveys 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.890
 together with other physical evidence 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.970
 and that's probably going to add to 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.870
 all the records that are collected 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.300
 of this expression 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.670
 was surprising in the sector in that sector or 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.610
 in another sector of the commune let's say 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.980
 proceed to a little more surveillance 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.050
 exhaustive with them the neighbors say 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.240
 who are not surprised that they occur 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.250
 these situations 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.560
 jessica lives in the same sector the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.780
 work was once frustrated the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.150
 theft of your vehicle but it was not the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.200
 first time and thanks to that he was saved with 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.600
 they actually broke all the veneers 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.400
 they dismantled it well here is the second 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.440
 the second time they see or try to steal 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.800
 is that the former was stolen was the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.800
 they took 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:12.510
 never but all the radio in the case of 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.150
 Daniel is convinced that the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.790
 delinquents had him guarded I think 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.470
 that you have to see me have made a guy 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.790
 of previous tracking because it turns out 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.410
 that this type of vehicle where is 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.810
 large and have high power occupy it 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.220
 to make landings in their 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.930
 effects also to be able to stretch the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.030
 ATMs according to figures 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.530
 officers in the commune of santiago el 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.910
 vehicle theft 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.459
 an increase in the first two 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.200
 quarters of the year and it is in this same 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.540
 commune where it is recorded in the largest 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.420
 car theft at country level will 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.920
 still in high bridge and providence 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.260
 daniel says he has learned the lesson 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.870
 he will stop parking his car on the street 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.140
 and lease to a parking lot in your 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.140
 building
