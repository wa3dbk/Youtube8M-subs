00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.360
 Hello guys 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.019
 and in the room 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.919
 let's learn to look 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.919
 and set up 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.910
 the virtual machine 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.989
 noble people 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.460
 so after you download it to the site 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.230
 everything is right there 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.230
 her aunt 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.230
 I veto the box 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.159
 To create a crisis, the process is very simple. 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.470
 we stay here on the new button 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.090
 daughter of an assistant 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.540
 in virtual machine creation 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.760
 we'll stay close on this screen here 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.760
 then we have children on behalf of the virtual machine nation 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.950
 and also the type of the political operating system was listening 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.950
 what powers like france no limits 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.950
 there appears to want to see são paulo version 7 is there 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.170
 florence 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.280
 in this case 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.390
 bogota 1 27 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.850
 so you add here 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.150
 indifferent 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.430
 local tinoco 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.770
 the name of a suspect 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.450
 - the process 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.810
 on this screen 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690
 we can get the memory 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.690
 memory point that it uses the virtual machine 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.760
 by default 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.400
 the biturbo love he plays 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.450
 indicate an amount of ram memory 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.450
 192 support 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.690
 leave it over 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.690
 just such an example but in a 2d way the wheel well said 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.280
 - the next 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.810
 in this part here 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.670
 of deceased 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.210
 How are we setting up? 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.210
 a machine from scratch so we'll have a new one says 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.580
 we were 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.790
 Is it u there? 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.580
 bk hacken this time 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.210
 We mark pressure here. 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.050
 and there is one from each party 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.990
 spread it out here 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.190
 Venice, but if we're going to do it further 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.679
 leaves the game with the nautical the first option ends up creating a disc 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.559
 and let's move forward 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:14.639
 the next 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.219
 in new versions of 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.049
 very few 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.749
 it appears these files here 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.070
 talking beside pole 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.979
 the inequality I want but having the 7 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.429
 port but he says yes 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.060
 Let's leave the power. 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.619
 or course to 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:36.189
 the toughbook those who have a home the extent of the chicken only disputed is 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.759
 little since then 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:40.759
 here we leave it completed in a month 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.849
 in this part kingson as follows 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.099
 and feels as such and the fixed 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.659
 Photo of you going with us. 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.659
 paraded in the morning 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.459
 only that the next côté only with the card is the fixed one 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.569
 if put as I stand here and set for example 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.209
 22 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.529
 stayed on July 25 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:12.159
 on the other side 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.159
 of the same committed here 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.739
 if I put here 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.089
 the option 

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:21.290
 this dynamic something heavy mind 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.929
 This is not a mistake 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:25.779
 the death to the driver's pocket 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:27.789
 since then an unknown 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:29.609
 and if the first option 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.609
 it creates a disk 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.849
 on this route 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.029
 these ten days as configured 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.039
 marina started 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:42.760
 one day when I do not sign two gigas that wins 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.769
 liked the decision 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.319
 so I know it's the squatter 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.940
 I know this first option here 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.940
 decrease in local trade 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.399
 This part is what we get from Haiti. 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:56.409
 the name 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.189
 on our side according to the next disc 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.189
 and we have is save 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.329
 I'm going to create a 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.329
 a patient the injured agent 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.819
 on the spot the Iraqi bloc 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.819
 in the document itself 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:16.590
 they are here 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.590
 in this part 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.270
 an xp and the obvious extent 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.469
 the tradition 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.469
 very close 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.490
 the reason a form that is habitual 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:45.620
 we should do now 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.610
 we select the fall or give a show click 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.999
 team settings 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.479
 the lieutenant bags use athlete despite sonia audi 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.590
 we face in audio 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.150
 we disabled duhalde 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.800
 using sdr criciúma is not a skin disease 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.059
 should prevent 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:08.169
 here in this case 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.409
 this question of ours here dwells our worst disbeliever 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.370
 and here many people have doubts 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.960
 in this next part I am as follows 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.540
 we have to go or add a file and I think it has been stung by 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.469
 robust or if you're already 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.129
 the suspect's secret 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:28.469
 on here 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.120
 to the crime scene 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.400
 you can 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.839
 the direct free zone 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:36.460
 I won there in the bay here. 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.479
 How do I decide? 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.020
 they set up an audio option here 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.689
 interim presidency 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.689
 Let's start our machine. 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.509
 he is already a suspect of first situation 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.129
 some opposition 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.129
 here that works as follows as previously spoken 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.520
 if not present until the severino xp 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.300
 already the outside world 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.300
 then we leave the city of thorn 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.199
 now we have an image 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.999
 such a better world 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.999
 the midfield 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:20.979
 stay here, my shoe 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.460
 in the shirt 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.460
 our image 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.589
 the guest list 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:46.309
 the malta that is the same 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.599
 in recent years 

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.599
 very close to the goal is cold 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:02.710
 I started as if it were within his reach. 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.710
 with the suspect inside him 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.830
 the Palestinian dispute in the game there last year 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:14.839
 after the announcement 

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:24.610
 audousset 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.610
 there's no way 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.770
 It will start with the process 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.270
 he was already dead 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.270
 so who has a facility 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.020
 with the departure of Gaddafi 

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.139
 did not want to do that 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:51.149
 then in that single month 

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:53.259
 but it's very simple but it's sure to fall
