00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
that I think's just downloadable content

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.690 
that I think's just downloadable content
for<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> pc<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:38.190> i'm<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.309> going<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.489> go<00:00:38.610> into

intuitive how they do it and one choice
can<00:01:12.600> literally<00:01:13.049> change<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.470> entire<00:01:13.890> game

there's<00:01:14.549> multiple<00:01:15.479> different<00:01:15.630> endings<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
there's multiple different endings and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.950 
there's multiple different endings and
three<00:01:16.530> different<00:01:16.799> plot<00:01:16.950> lines<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.460> said

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
three different plot lines like I said

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.210 
three different plot lines like I said
but<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.290> way<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.560> they<00:01:19.680> do<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> choices

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
but the way that they do the choices

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.830 
but the way that they do the choices
some<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> choices<00:01:20.939> are<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.450> good<00:01:21.659> so

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
some of the choices are really good so

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.230 
some of the choices are really good so
some<00:01:22.080> choices<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.710> timed<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.850> if<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.060> don't

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
some choices are timed so if you don't

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600 
some choices are timed so if you don't
pick<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> choice<00:01:24.810> within<00:01:25.290> five<00:01:25.619> seconds<00:01:26.100> it

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
pick a choice within five seconds it

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.910 
pick a choice within five seconds it
defaults<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:28.110> what<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.290> means<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.860> have

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
defaults so what that means is you have

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.140 
defaults so what that means is you have
to<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.159> with<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.400> gut<00:01:29.430> instinct<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.000> don't

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
to go with your gut instinct you don't

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.569 
to go with your gut instinct you don't
get<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> sit<00:01:30.420> there<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.689> go<00:01:30.750> okay<00:01:31.340> so<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.549> go

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
get to sit there and go okay so if I go

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
get to sit there and go okay so if I go
this<00:01:33.000> way<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> happen<00:01:34.110> or

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
this way this is going to happen or

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.990 
this way this is going to happen or
maybe<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.159> go<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.400> way<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.640> I'll<00:01:35.850> get

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
maybe I can go this way and I'll get

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.340 
maybe I can go this way and I'll get
better<00:01:36.150> something<00:01:36.479> no<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.840> haven't<00:01:37.200> got<00:01:37.320> that

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
better something no you haven't got that

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
better something no you haven't got that
option<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.920> quickly<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.670> pick<00:01:38.939> safe<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
option you quickly have to pick safe to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.789 
option you quickly have to pick safe to
go<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> got<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.740> I

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
go if you got it's really good and I

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.899 
go if you got it's really good and I
don't<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.009> I've<00:01:41.130> ever<00:01:41.189> seen<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.640> video

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
don't think I've ever seen that a video

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.200 
don't think I've ever seen that a video
games<00:01:42.150> before<00:01:42.329> um<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> that's<00:01:44.640> probably<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
games before um so that's probably the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
games before um so that's probably the
strongest<00:01:45.450> point<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> story<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.619> really

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
strongest point is the story is really

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.920 
strongest point is the story is really
dark<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.460> real<00:01:47.640> mature<00:01:47.939> through<00:01:48.270> sexual<00:01:48.689> as

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
dark it's real mature through sexual as

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.800 
dark it's real mature through sexual as
well<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.880> voice<00:01:51.030> acting<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.479> great<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
well and the voice acting is great the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.130 
well and the voice acting is great the
sounds<00:01:52.140> great<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> gameplay<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.509> when

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
sounds great but the gameplay so when

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.800 
sounds great but the gameplay so when
you<00:01:55.259> first<00:01:55.470> start<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.770> game<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.189> hard<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.810> ran

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
bombs and at the start of the game

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.800 
bombs and at the start of the game
you're<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.610> need

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
you're going to need

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.229 
you're going to need
all<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.319> it's<00:02:12.620> hard<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:14.150> I

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
all of that is it's hard and then I

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.610 
all of that is it's hard and then I
don't<00:02:14.390> know<00:02:14.450> if<00:02:14.569> its<00:02:14.660> pacing<00:02:15.110> issues<00:02:15.200> or

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
don't know if its pacing issues or

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.199 
don't know if its pacing issues or
difficulty<00:02:16.190> issues<00:02:16.459> but<00:02:16.670> when<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.880> get<00:02:17.000> past

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
difficulty issues but when you get past

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.920 
difficulty issues but when you get past
the<00:02:17.540> first<00:02:17.720> chapter<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:19.160> are<00:02:19.250> invincible<00:02:19.930> so

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
the first chapter you are invincible so

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.510 
the first chapter you are invincible so
if<00:02:21.200> you're<00:02:21.410> good<00:02:21.590> at<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.830> games<00:02:22.069> i'd

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
if you're good at the games i'd

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.520 
if you're good at the games i'd
recommend<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.180> normal<00:02:23.599> or<00:02:23.750> even<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.050> hard<00:02:24.260> play

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
recommend the normal or even a hard play

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.770 
recommend the normal or even a hard play
through<00:02:24.860> but<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.489> takes<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:26.000> while<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.480> get<00:02:26.569> used

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
through but it takes a while to get used

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.780 
through but it takes a while to get used
to<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.989> controls<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.430> seems<00:02:28.610> like

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
to the controls and it just seems like

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.229 
to the controls and it just seems like
everything<00:02:29.410> has<00:02:30.410> been<00:02:30.530> ported<00:02:30.980> well<00:02:31.250> for<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
everything has been ported well for the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.330 
everything has been ported well for the
xbox<00:02:32.599> controller<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.650> interface<00:02:34.069> but

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
xbox controller and the interface but

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.130 
xbox controller and the interface but
some<00:02:34.550> things<00:02:34.790> happen<00:02:35.150> so<00:02:35.330> like<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.630> map<00:02:35.870> is

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
some things happen so like the map is

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.750 
some things happen so like the map is
terrible<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.680> can<00:02:36.950> tell<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.340> map<00:02:37.550> is

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
terrible you can tell that the map is

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.309 
terrible you can tell that the map is
designed<00:02:38.540> for<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.780> mouse<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.200> keyboard

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
designed for a mouse and keyboard

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.500 
designed for a mouse and keyboard
especially<00:02:40.069> a<00:02:40.099> mouse<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.090> map<00:02:41.300> isn't

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
especially a mouse so the map isn't

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.600 
especially a mouse so the map isn't
really<00:02:41.900> good<00:02:42.110> some<00:02:42.800> of<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.950> controls<00:02:43.370> are<00:02:43.550> a

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
really good some of the controls are a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.979 
really good some of the controls are a
bit<00:02:43.730> iffy<00:02:44.030> but<00:02:44.150> other<00:02:44.330> than<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.810> game

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
bit iffy but other than that the game

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.530 
bit iffy but other than that the game
plays<00:02:45.260> fine<00:02:45.590> um<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.940> only<00:02:46.970> other<00:02:47.450> thing

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
plays fine um the only other thing

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.360 
plays fine um the only other thing
that's<00:02:48.049> really<00:02:48.140> negative<00:02:48.680> about<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.130> just

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
that's really negative about it is just

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.120 
that's really negative about it is just
a<00:02:49.459> lack<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.700> contact<00:02:50.150> of<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:51.410> company<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.069> the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
a lack of contact of a company of the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.940 
a lack of contact of a company of the
word<00:02:52.280> lack<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.209> substance<00:02:53.540> like<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.440> stories

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
word lack of substance like the stories

word lack of substance like the stories
there<00:02:55.250> but<00:02:56.120> throughout<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.750> game<00:02:56.870> you<00:02:57.019> got<00:02:57.140> to

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
there but throughout the game you got to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.309 
there but throughout the game you got to
be<00:02:57.290> fighting<00:02:57.620> like<00:02:57.650> 3<00:02:57.769> different<00:02:58.430> enemies<00:02:59.319> the
