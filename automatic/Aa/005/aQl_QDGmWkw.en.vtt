so<00:00:00.840> with<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.140> kyocera<00:00:01.709> echo<00:00:02.179> what<00:00:03.179> we've<00:00:03.330> got

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
so with the kyocera echo what we've got

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.379 
so with the kyocera echo what we've got
is<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:05.180> four<00:00:06.180> modes<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.839> operation<00:00:07.080> and

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
is a four modes of operation and

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.970 
is a four modes of operation and
basically<00:00:09.389> they're<00:00:09.630> called<00:00:09.900> single<00:00:10.679> screen

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
basically they're called single screen

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.539 
basically they're called single screen
mode<00:00:11.219> which<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:12.679> basically<00:00:13.679> any<00:00:14.099> normal

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
mode which is this basically any normal

down here and what we can do is jump

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.980 
down here and what we can do is jump
into<00:01:08.990> simulcast<00:01:09.990> mode<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.040> see<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.310> pushed

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
into simulcast mode so you see I pushed

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.780 
into simulcast mode so you see I pushed
pushed<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.200> both<00:01:13.470> screens<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.310> there<00:01:14.729> are

pushed on both screens and there are
these<00:01:14.909> seven<00:01:15.390> applications<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.470> access

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
these seven applications that can access

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.820 
these seven applications that can access
and<00:01:17.250> work<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.990> simulcast<00:01:18.990> mode<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.770> they

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
and work in the simulcast mode and they

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.249 
and work in the simulcast mode and they
are<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> browser<00:01:20.310> context<00:01:21.060> e-mail<00:01:21.540> gallery

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
screen message composition on that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.390 
screen message composition on that
screen<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.970> of<00:01:38.970> course<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:41.220> can

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400

we've got the phone up here and the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
we've got the phone up here and the
messaging<00:01:45.270> screen<00:01:45.509> down<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.979> we

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
messaging screen down here and if we

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.910 
messaging screen down here and if we
also<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.240> jump<00:01:49.049> into<00:01:49.229> something

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
also want we can jump into something

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.460 
also want we can jump into something
else<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.460> my<00:01:51.090> contact<00:01:51.780> database<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.380> have

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
else like my contact database we have

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.420 
else like my contact database we have
contacts<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.869> messaging<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.200> that's<00:01:55.890> sort<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
contacts and messaging so that's sort of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.870 
contacts and messaging so that's sort of
how<00:02:00.170> simultaneous<00:02:01.170> between<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.340> set<00:02:02.700> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
how simultaneous between this set of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.510 
how simultaneous between this set of
seven<00:02:03.329> applications<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:05.070> allows<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
seven applications and it allows you to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.280 
seven applications and it allows you to
do<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:06.030> application<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.810> screen<00:02:06.990> and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
do one application on this screen and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.910 
do one application on this screen and
another<00:02:07.530> application<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.489> screen<00:02:08.879> so

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
another application on that screen so

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.780 
another application on that screen so
for<00:02:10.920> example<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.400> have<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> browser

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
for example you can have the browser

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.070 
for example you can have the browser
window<00:02:12.239> open<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.569> one

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
window open on one

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.770 
window open on one
composing<00:02:13.710> an<00:02:13.920> email<00:02:14.130> on<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> other<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.210> use

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
composing an email on the other and use

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.500 
composing an email on the other and use
the<00:02:15.990> email<00:02:16.170> or<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.190> browser<00:02:17.520> application<00:02:17.790> you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
the email or the browser application you

the email or the browser application you
know<00:02:18.600> as<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.780> reference<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.830> know<00:02:19.950> perhaps<00:02:20.220> if

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
know as a reference you know perhaps if

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.060 
know as a reference you know perhaps if
you're<00:02:20.610> typing<00:02:20.940> an<00:02:21.540> email<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:22.110> needs<00:02:22.770> to

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
you're typing an email that needs to

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.510 
you're typing an email that needs to
include<00:02:23.970> some<00:02:24.240> web<00:02:24.420> data<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.220> simulcast<00:02:26.220> is

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
include some web data so simulcast is

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.410 
include some web data so simulcast is
definitely<00:02:27.030> neat<00:02:27.270> like<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.320> lot<00:02:29.300> now<00:02:30.300> what

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
definitely neat like that a lot now what

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.050 
definitely neat like that a lot now what
happens<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:30.960> when<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:31.740> do<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.280> let's<00:02:32.730> go<00:02:32.910> back

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
happens is when we do this let's go back

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.700 
happens is when we do this let's go back
to<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.330> home<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:33.720> just<00:02:33.900> put<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.200> tablet

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
to the home we just put it in tablet

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.070 
to the home we just put it in tablet
mode<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:35.550> tablet<00:02:36.030> mode<00:02:36.210> is<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.540> basically<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
mode so tablet mode is the basically the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.570 
mode so tablet mode is the basically the
big<00:02:37.290> big<00:02:37.920> big<00:02:38.220> screen<00:02:38.640> version<00:02:39.120> um<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:40.580> what's

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
big big big screen version um and what's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.730 
big big big screen version um and what's
going<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.820> happen<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.360> most<00:02:42.660> any<00:02:42.990> application

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
going to happen is most any application

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.550 
going to happen is most any application
that<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.980> want<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.250> use<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.760> going<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:44.970> work<00:02:45.270> in

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
that you want to use is going to work in

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.210 
that you want to use is going to work in
tablet<00:02:46.560> mode<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:48.180> example<00:02:48.210> let's<00:02:49.220> pick

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
tablet mode so for example let's pick

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.930 
tablet mode so for example let's pick
something<00:02:50.670> innocuous<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:52.760> let's<00:02:53.760> go<00:02:53.910> to

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
something innocuous like let's go to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.930 
something innocuous like let's go to
google<00:02:54.330> maps<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.950> Google<00:02:56.280> Maps<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.700> going<00:02:56.880> to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
google maps so Google Maps is going to

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.150 
google maps so Google Maps is going to
load<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.500> what<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:58.620> going<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:58.800> do<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.130> it's

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
load and what it's going to do is it's

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.400 
load and what it's going to do is it's
going<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.459> you<00:02:59.640> know<00:02:59.760> basically<00:03:00.480> pretend<00:03:01.110> that

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
going to you know basically pretend that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.750 
going to you know basically pretend that
this<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.709> one<00:03:01.950> large<00:03:02.190> display<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:04.370> yeah<00:03:05.370> okay

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
this is one large display and yeah okay

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.240 
this is one large display and yeah okay
yeah<00:03:05.970> we<00:03:06.120> get<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.420> yep<00:03:07.070> skip<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:08.330> and<00:03:10.100> if<00:03:11.100> it

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
yeah we get it yep skip that and if it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.650 
yeah we get it yep skip that and if it
ever<00:03:11.340> connects<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:11.910> network<00:03:11.940> here<00:03:12.480> you'll

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
ever connects to the network here you'll

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.449 
ever connects to the network here you'll
see<00:03:12.720> in<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.990> second<00:03:13.410> how<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.890> map<00:03:14.220> just

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
see in a second how the map just

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.540 
see in a second how the map just
basically<00:03:14.910> spreads<00:03:15.420> across<00:03:16.220> across<00:03:17.220> both

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
basically spreads across across both

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.390 
basically spreads across across both
pages<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:19.800> how<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.040> will<00:03:20.130> work<00:03:20.160> on

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
pages and this is how it will work on

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.690 
pages and this is how it will work on
most<00:03:20.550> applications<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.690> are<00:03:22.459> you<00:03:23.459> know<00:03:23.550> just

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
most applications that are you know just

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.790 
most applications that are you know just
basic<00:03:24.120> android<00:03:24.390> applications<00:03:25.110> and<00:03:25.260> just<00:03:25.440> span

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
basic android applications and just span

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.040 
basic android applications and just span
both<00:03:25.980> screens<00:03:26.400> it'll<00:03:27.300> kind<00:03:27.450> of<00:03:27.510> ignore<00:03:27.870> the

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
both screens it'll kind of ignore the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.750 
both screens it'll kind of ignore the
fact<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.440> there's<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.739> line<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.489> middle

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
fact that there's a line in the middle

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.500 
fact that there's a line in the middle
and<00:03:29.940> it'll<00:03:30.510> behave<00:03:30.780> as<00:03:30.989> normal<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:32.160> then

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
and it'll behave as normal but then

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.509 
and it'll behave as normal but then
there's<00:03:33.510> also<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:35.060> optimized<00:03:36.500> mode<00:03:37.500> for<00:03:38.160> a

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
there's also the optimized mode for a

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.940 
there's also the optimized mode for a
handful<00:03:39.030> lamp<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.420> applications<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.680> know<00:03:40.769> so

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
handful lamp of applications you know so

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.699 
handful lamp of applications you know so
one<00:03:41.160> application<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.300> optimized<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.380> the

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
one application that is optimized is the

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.979 
one application that is optimized is the
browser<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.580> see<00:03:44.730> we<00:03:44.850> have<00:03:44.989> two

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
browser so you can see we have two

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.660 
browser so you can see we have two
different<00:03:46.350> web<00:03:46.739> pages<00:03:46.769> open<00:03:47.340> at<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.640> same

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
different web pages open at the same

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.540 
different web pages open at the same
time<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.830> you<00:03:49.830> know<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.070> great<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.459> mean
