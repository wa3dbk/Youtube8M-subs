 you just think what they look like 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.600
 a little bit smarter is anxiety 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.450
 level 5 which means temporary 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.060
 conflict 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:46.069
 as if 2 tardis merged but 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.140
 there is only one tardis as 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.489
 as if 2 time zones and entered into conflict 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.450
