about<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.899> know<00:02:07.990> when<00:02:08.200> you're<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:13.180> know

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
about that you know when you're you know

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:20.070 
about that you know when you're you know
when<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:18.130> stadium<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.209> mean<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:19.930> like

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
when you stadium I mean it's just like

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.449 
when you stadium I mean it's just like
it's<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.470> replay<00:02:20.830> you're<00:02:21.040> sitting<00:02:21.370> there

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
it's a replay you're sitting there

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.160 
it's a replay you're sitting there
sometimes<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.970> want<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.209> see<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.510> replay

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
sometimes you want to see this replay

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.930 
sometimes you want to see this replay
you<00:02:23.500> know<00:02:23.620> like<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.340> see<00:02:24.519> at<00:02:24.610> home

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
you know like you see at home

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.610 
you know like you see at home
now<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.390> get<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.780> see<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.260> frightened

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
now you get to see the frightened

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.100

what<00:02:29.590> we<00:02:29.769> see<00:02:29.950> at<00:02:30.069> home<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.880> think<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.180> just

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
what we see at home and I think it just

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.349 
what we see at home and I think it just
adds<00:02:31.599> another<00:02:31.900> dimension<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.620> game<00:02:32.799> that

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:33.359 
adds another dimension to the game that

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.000 
adds another dimension to the game that
enhanced<00:02:34.359> the<00:02:34.959> fans<00:02:35.230> experience<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:35.920> the
