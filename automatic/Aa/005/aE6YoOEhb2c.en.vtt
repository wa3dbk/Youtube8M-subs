where I'm going with this but I'm going
to<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.890> making<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.310> platform<00:00:27.109> that<00:00:28.109> bolts<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:28.740> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to be making a platform that bolts on to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.089 
to be making a platform that bolts on to
go<00:00:29.130> back<00:00:29.340> here<00:00:29.929> now<00:00:30.929> kind<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.349> inspired<00:00:31.800> by<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
go back here now kind of inspired by the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.410 
go back here now kind of inspired by the
the<00:00:32.610> eighties<00:00:34.070> GT<00:00:35.070> standing<00:00:35.579> platform<00:00:36.180> that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
the eighties GT standing platform that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.530 
the eighties GT standing platform that
they<00:00:36.540> had<00:00:37.370> available<00:00:38.370> back<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> day<00:00:39.000> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
they had available back in the day and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.690 
they had available back in the day and
so<00:00:40.610> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:42.079> we've<00:00:43.079> got<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> clamp<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.430> here

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
so you can see we've got a clamp on here

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.110 
so you can see we've got a clamp on here
and<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.140> actually<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> part<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> stem

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
and this is actually a part of the stem

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
and this is actually a part of the stem
here<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.460> starting<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.239> heavy

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
here and so starting with this heavy

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.069 
here and so starting with this heavy
gauge<00:00:52.770> steel<00:00:53.309> band<00:00:53.670> clamp<00:00:54.120> I've<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
gauge steel band clamp I've got a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.709 
gauge steel band clamp I've got a
foundation<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.860> work<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.879> go

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
foundation to work from this you can go

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.869 
foundation to work from this you can go
forward<00:00:58.170> from<00:00:58.350> there<00:00:58.440> without<00:00:58.949> having<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
forward from there without having to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.110 
forward from there without having to
weld<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> frame<00:01:01.320> itself<00:01:01.910> I'm<00:01:02.910> going<00:01:02.969> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
weld on to the frame itself I'm going to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.310 
weld on to the frame itself I'm going to
stick<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:06.170> just<00:01:07.170> to

stick this in here just to just to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.230 
stick this in here just to just to
facilitate<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:08.040> little<00:01:08.400> support<00:01:08.880> while<00:01:09.210> I

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
facilitate a little support while I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.480

inside diameter to match the outside

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.530 
inside diameter to match the outside
diameter<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.920> we'll<00:02:32.100> have<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.340> foot<00:02:32.850> here

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
diameter and so we'll have a foot here

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.030 
diameter and so we'll have a foot here
so<00:02:34.140> be<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> footing<00:02:36.800> perfect<00:02:37.800> fit<00:02:39.860> okay<00:02:40.860> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
so be a footing perfect fit okay and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.100 
so be a footing perfect fit okay and
then<00:02:41.160> attach<00:02:41.519> to<00:02:41.760> just<00:02:42.000> imagine<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.630> footing

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
then attach to just imagine that footing

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.440 
then attach to just imagine that footing
staying<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.070> place<00:02:44.340> which<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.790> won't<00:02:45.000> while<00:02:45.420> I

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
staying in place which it won't while I

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.009 
staying in place which it won't while I
try<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.810> explain<00:02:46.170> things<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:47.360> then<00:02:48.360> bridging

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
try to explain things but then bridging

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.880 
try to explain things but then bridging
that<00:02:49.049> footing<00:02:49.709> I've<00:02:50.700> got<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.410> at<00:02:52.410> this<00:02:52.590> Dino

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
that footing I've got this at this Dino

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.130 
that footing I've got this at this Dino
fork<00:02:53.400> blade<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.540> I'm<00:02:54.690> getting<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.989> lot<00:02:55.110> of

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
fork blade and I'm getting a lot of

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.039 
fork blade and I'm getting a lot of
glare<00:02:55.440> I've<00:02:56.130> got<00:02:56.280> a<00:02:56.310> D<00:02:56.549> stamp<00:02:56.910> Dino<00:02:57.299> fork<00:02:57.780> blade

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
glare I've got a D stamp Dino fork blade

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.979 
glare I've got a D stamp Dino fork blade
this<00:02:58.799> is<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.340> piece<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.209> cut<00:03:00.420> off<00:03:00.630> from<00:03:00.870> a

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
this is a piece that I cut off from a

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.699 
this is a piece that I cut off from a
Dino<00:03:01.230> fork<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.860> was<00:03:03.110> completely<00:03:04.110> mangled<00:03:04.290> it

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
Dino fork that was completely mangled it

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.830 
Dino fork that was completely mangled it
was<00:03:04.860> bent<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.489> was<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:06.180> was<00:03:06.330> unsalvageable

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
was bent and it was it was unsalvageable

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.900 
was bent and it was it was unsalvageable
in<00:03:07.380> any<00:03:07.530> other<00:03:07.680> way<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:07.980> at<00:03:08.250> least<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.760> will

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
in any other way but at least it will

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.979 
in any other way but at least it will
live<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.209> through<00:03:10.100> this<00:03:11.150> gusset<00:03:12.150> here<00:03:12.480> I'm

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
live on through this gusset here I'm

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.250 
live on through this gusset here I'm
just<00:03:13.080> going<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.380> bridge<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:14.070> foot<00:03:14.940> piece<00:03:15.260> to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
just going to bridge that foot piece to

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.670 
just going to bridge that foot piece to
here<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.330> then<00:03:18.330> I'll<00:03:18.510> cut<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.170> straight<00:03:19.380> where

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
here and then I'll cut it straight where

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.740 
here and then I'll cut it straight where
I'm<00:03:19.799> straight<00:03:20.489> across<00:03:20.700> where<00:03:21.060> I'm<00:03:21.180> holding<00:03:21.390> it

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
I'm straight across where I'm holding it

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.920 
I'm straight across where I'm holding it
at<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.959> bone<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.790> know<00:03:23.820> draw<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.299> line<00:03:24.630> across

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
at the bone you know draw a line across

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.310 
at the bone you know draw a line across
there<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.390> so<00:03:27.390> that'll<00:03:27.630> be<00:03:27.750> our<00:03:27.959> little

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
there and so that'll be our little

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.740 
there and so that'll be our little
gusset<00:03:28.799> there<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:31.310> then<00:03:32.310> where<00:03:32.910> this<00:03:33.150> piece

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
gusset there and then where this piece

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.159 
gusset there and then where this piece
of<00:03:33.959> tubing<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:34.500> here<00:03:35.060> I'm<00:03:36.060> gonna<00:03:36.209> use<00:03:36.419> the

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
of tubing is here I'm gonna use the

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.470 
of tubing is here I'm gonna use the
shaft<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.250> quill<00:03:38.609> stem<00:03:38.820> that's<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.329> nice

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
shaft of the quill stem that's a nice

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.700 
shaft of the quill stem that's a nice
heavy<00:03:39.780> gauge<00:03:40.079> steel

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
heavy gauge steel

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.590 
heavy gauge steel
to<00:03:41.370> put<00:03:41.940> in<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.350> bridge<00:03:43.350> support<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.880> then<00:03:45.330> we'll

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
to put in a bridge support it then we'll

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.810 
to put in a bridge support it then we'll
have<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.810> bulb<00:03:46.200> going<00:03:46.500> in<00:03:46.830> from<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.130> bottom<00:03:47.250> to

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
have a bulb going in from the bottom to

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.660 
have a bulb going in from the bottom to
fix<00:03:48.180> it<00:03:48.390> there<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:48.870> it'll<00:03:49.050> fix<00:03:49.410> there<00:03:49.770> it'll

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
fix it there so it'll fix there it'll

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.260 
fix it there so it'll fix there it'll
rest<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:51.420> each<00:03:51.750> side<00:03:52.080> on<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.680> footing<00:03:53.070> and

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
rest on each side on the footing and

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.190 
rest on each side on the footing and
then<00:03:54.270> it'll<00:03:54.450> be<00:03:55.160> attached<00:03:56.160> by<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.970> clamp<00:03:57.420> to

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
then it'll be attached by the clamp to

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.760 
then it'll be attached by the clamp to
the<00:03:58.230> frame<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.280> so<00:04:00.440> that's<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.620> basic

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
the frame there and so that's the basic

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.500 
the frame there and so that's the basic
idea<00:04:02.220> when<00:04:02.700> I'm<00:04:02.790> going<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:02.940> do<00:04:03.060> there<00:04:03.240> and<00:04:03.360> then

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
idea when I'm going to do there and then

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.810 
idea when I'm going to do there and then
I'll<00:04:03.630> powder<00:04:04.050> coat<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.560> assembly<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.400> put<00:04:05.790> a

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
I'll powder coat the assembly and put a

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.370 
I'll powder coat the assembly and put a
little<00:04:07.010> stick<00:04:08.010> on<00:04:08.220> grip<00:04:08.580> tape<00:04:08.900> across<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.200> top

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
little stick on grip tape across the top

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.810 
little stick on grip tape across the top
around<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.980> ring<00:04:11.190> there<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:13.290> was

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
around the ring there and I was

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.550 
around the ring there and I was
considering<00:04:14.820> relocating<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.960> break<00:04:16.200> studs

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
considering relocating the break studs

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.020 
considering relocating the break studs
as<00:04:16.800> well<00:04:17.010> we'll<00:04:17.730> wait<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.090> see<00:04:18.210> um<00:04:19.110> you<00:04:20.070> know

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
as well we'll wait and see um you know

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.430 
as well we'll wait and see um you know
at<00:04:21.150> first<00:04:21.210> I<00:04:21.570> was<00:04:21.600> thinking<00:04:22.050> about<00:04:22.140> putting

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
at first I was thinking about putting

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.030 
at first I was thinking about putting
the<00:04:22.620> break<00:04:22.830> studs<00:04:23.190> underneath<00:04:23.700> here<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:25.710> free

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
the break studs underneath here to free

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.360 
the break studs underneath here to free
up<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:27.560> drivetrain<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.800> be<00:04:28.890> able<00:04:29.040> to<00:04:29.130> go<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.280> a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
up the drivetrain to be able to go to a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.920 
up the drivetrain to be able to go to a
smaller<00:04:29.730> sprocket<00:04:30.120> without<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.720> brakes

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
smaller sprocket without the brakes

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.230 
smaller sprocket without the brakes
getting<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.440> way<00:04:31.560> but<00:04:31.890> I<00:04:32.070> think<00:04:32.970> that<00:04:33.120> it

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
getting in the way but I think that it

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.540 
getting in the way but I think that it
might<00:04:33.360> look<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:33.690> little<00:04:33.720> busy<00:04:34.290> here<00:04:34.440> with<00:04:35.370> the

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
might look a little busy here with the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.130 
might look a little busy here with the
standing<00:04:35.940> platform<00:04:36.480> completed<00:04:37.020> and

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
standing platform completed and

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
standing platform completed and
everything<00:04:37.470> about<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.830> brake<00:04:38.010> assembly

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
everything about the brake assembly

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.000 
everything about the brake assembly
there<00:04:38.700> so<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:39.540> was<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.200> was<00:04:40.320> also<00:04:40.530> considering

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
there so I was I was also considering

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.240 
there so I was I was also considering
relocating<00:04:41.190> them<00:04:41.820> underneath<00:04:43.070> like<00:04:44.070> the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
relocating them underneath like the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.940 
relocating them underneath like the
older<00:04:44.520> style<00:04:44.820> gt's<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:46.110> that's<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.410> possibility

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
older style gt's so that's a possibility

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.740 
older style gt's so that's a possibility
that's<00:04:47.370> up<00:04:47.520> in<00:04:47.640> the<00:04:47.700> air<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:48.120> course<00:04:48.210> if<00:04:48.540> I<00:04:48.600> go

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
that's up in the air of course if I go

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.870 
that's up in the air of course if I go
that<00:04:48.960> road<00:04:49.200> will<00:04:49.800> still<00:04:50.100> have<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.430> maintain<00:04:50.580> a

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
that road will still have to maintain a

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.280 
that road will still have to maintain a
larger<00:04:51.300> diameter<00:04:51.450> sprocket<00:04:53.900> so<00:04:54.900> that<00:04:55.020> pretty

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
larger diameter sprocket so that pretty

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.880 
larger diameter sprocket so that pretty
much<00:04:55.440> covers<00:04:56.720> what<00:04:57.720> I've<00:04:57.840> got<00:04:58.080> going<00:04:58.110> on<00:04:58.560> right

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
much covers what I've got going on right

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.580 
much covers what I've got going on right
now<00:04:58.920> and<00:04:59.370> my<00:04:59.520> ideas<00:04:59.910> with<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.390> for<00:05:01.170> right<00:05:01.320> now

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
now and my ideas with it for right now

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.660 
now and my ideas with it for right now
so<00:05:02.450> get<00:05:03.450> those<00:05:03.600> done<00:05:03.900> and<00:05:04.310> on<00:05:05.310> to<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.580> next

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
so get those done and on to the next

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.330 
so get those done and on to the next
step<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.440> this<00:05:07.440> is<00:05:07.500> going<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.920> have<00:05:08.070> to<00:05:08.190> get

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
step and this is going to have to get

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.670 
step and this is going to have to get
sandblasted<00:05:08.900> part<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.020> reason<00:05:10.320> why<00:05:10.440> I<00:05:10.470> got

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
sandblasted part of the reason why I got

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.550 
sandblasted part of the reason why I got
a<00:05:10.710> gog<00:05:11.240> this<00:05:12.240> frame<00:05:12.540> at<00:05:12.720> a<00:05:12.750> great<00:05:12.960> price<00:05:13.260> is

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
a gog this frame at a great price is

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.490 
a gog this frame at a great price is
