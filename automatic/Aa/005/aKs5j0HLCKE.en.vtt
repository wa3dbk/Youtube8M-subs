close to the fingerboard see what's

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.160 
close to the fingerboard see what's
going<00:00:25.440> on<00:00:25.500> right<00:00:25.770> there<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.360> do<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.870> and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
going on right there so you do this and

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.980 
going on right there so you do this and
then<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.770> fourth<00:00:29.040> finger<00:00:29.430> as<00:00:29.520> well<00:00:29.990> so

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
then the fourth finger as well so

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.690 
then the fourth finger as well so
basically<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.710> fingers<00:00:32.070> straight<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.550> know

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
basically your fingers straight you know

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.880 
basically your fingers straight you know
and<00:00:33.060> it<00:00:33.660> won't<00:00:34.080> come<00:00:34.260> overnight<00:00:34.590> I'll

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and it won't come overnight I'll

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.860 
and it won't come overnight I'll
guarantee<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.480> fingers<00:00:36.780> are

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
guarantee you that if your fingers are

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.540 
guarantee you that if your fingers are
too<00:00:37.050> dry<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.530> might<00:00:37.680> slide<00:00:38.160> around<00:00:38.460> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
too dry they might slide around you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.100 
too dry they might slide around you
don't<00:00:38.670> want<00:00:38.850> them<00:00:38.970> to<00:00:39.060> slide<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.750> want<00:00:39.930> enough

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
don't want them to slide you want enough

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.810 
don't want them to slide you want enough
pressure<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> good

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
pressure so that you have a good

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.540 
pressure so that you have a good
connection<00:00:42.060> to<00:00:42.630> the<00:00:43.020> violin<00:00:43.440> right<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.430> they

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
connection to the violin right so they

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.650 
connection to the violin right so they
play<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> little<00:00:44.850> bit<00:00:45.000> at<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.210> angle<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
play a little bit at this angle so you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
play a little bit at this angle so you
could<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> then<00:00:46.740> I'll<00:00:46.980> slow<00:00:47.310> it<00:00:47.490> down

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
could see it and then I'll slow it down

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.460 
could see it and then I'll slow it down
on<00:00:48.060> the<00:00:48.240> video<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.900> could<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.320> what

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
on the video so you could see what

00:00:49.470 --> 00:02:20.210 
on the video so you could see what
happened

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.430 

anyway<00:02:21.220> that's<00:02:21.730> basically<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.930> don't<00:02:23.260> think

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
anyway that's basically it I don't think

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.680 
anyway that's basically it I don't think
you<00:02:23.530> can<00:02:23.680> catch<00:02:23.920> more<00:02:24.310> from<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:25.120> me<00:02:25.420> plane

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
you can catch more from the me plane

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.680 
you can catch more from the me plane
more<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.410> for<00:02:26.740> those<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.250> wondering<00:02:27.690> this
