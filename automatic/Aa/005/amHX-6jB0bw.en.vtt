actually if you want to you can pull the
drivers<00:01:55.290> off<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.250> swap<00:01:56.579> out<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
bands they have different colored bands

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.030 
bands they have different colored bands
I<00:01:58.140> think<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.500> purchase<00:01:58.649> them<00:01:58.829> separately

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
I think you can purchase them separately

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.530 
I think you can purchase them separately
so<00:01:59.340> this<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.610> black<00:01:59.790> they<00:02:00.030> also<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.360> white

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
so this is the black they also the white

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.969 
so this is the black they also the white
in<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.719> red<00:02:00.899> so<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.619> want<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.799> purchase

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
in the red so if you want to purchase

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.249 
in the red so if you want to purchase
some<00:02:02.219> different<00:02:02.729> separate<00:02:03.180> ones<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.140> do

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
some different separate ones you can do

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.469 
some different separate ones you can do
so<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.740> it's<00:02:05.280> beads<00:02:05.549> are<00:02:05.729> basically<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.329> can

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
so and it's beads are basically you can

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.910 
so and it's beads are basically you can
slide<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.869> up<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.049> down<00:02:07.170> completely<00:02:07.590> to

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
slide it up and down completely to

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.210 
slide it up and down completely to
adjust<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.700> exactly<00:02:09.360> what<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.660> need<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.929> go

equipping like this is that has a
removable<00:02:18.020> cable<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.740> cable<00:02:19.100> is

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
removable cable and the cable is

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.590 
removable cable and the cable is
interesting<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.640> never<00:02:19.790> seen<00:02:19.940> one<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.240> works

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
interesting is I never seen one it works

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.750 
interesting is I never seen one it works
like<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.320> actually<00:02:21.530> has<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.280> left<00:02:22.610> and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
like this it actually has the left and

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.090 
like this it actually has the left and
right<00:02:22.790> plugs<00:02:23.300> are<00:02:23.660> separated<00:02:24.560> out<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:24.920> there's

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
right plugs are separated out so there's

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.740 
right plugs are separated out so there's
two<00:02:25.250> plugs<00:02:25.490> right<00:02:25.610> here<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.420> when<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.570> plug

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
two plugs right here so when you plug

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.060 
two plugs right here so when you plug
them<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:26.960> you<00:02:27.020> need<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.530> make<00:02:27.620> sure<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.920> put

them in you need to make sure you put
them<00:02:28.160> in<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.280> right<00:02:28.370> one<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:28.880> is<00:02:29.060> left<00:02:29.330> so

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
underneath the of the headphones so you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.620 
underneath the of the headphones so you

the white the right right there and so I

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.850 
the white the right right there and so I
actually<00:02:41.030> splits<00:02:41.570> around<00:02:42.440> your<00:02:42.560> head<00:02:42.709> which

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
actually splits around your head which

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.560 
actually splits around your head which
is<00:02:42.890> interesting<00:02:43.400> go<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.120> bottom<00:02:44.240> here<00:02:44.390> and

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
is interesting go to the bottom here and

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.360 
is interesting go to the bottom here and
actually<00:02:44.690> does<00:02:45.020> have<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.230> built-in<00:02:45.650> microphone

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
actually does have a built-in microphone

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.890 
actually does have a built-in microphone
so<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.910> can't<00:02:47.120> talk<00:02:47.270> on<00:02:47.300> your<00:02:47.480> phone<00:02:47.540> while

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900

real stiff so it doesn't get tangled up

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.370 
real stiff so it doesn't get tangled up
or<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:01.760> gets<00:03:01.910> its<00:03:02.240> you're<00:03:02.480> easy<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.780> unclutter

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
or it gets its you're easy to unclutter

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.080 
or it gets its you're easy to unclutter
it<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:04.130> really<00:03:04.340> like<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.550> tip<00:03:04.730> as<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:04.970> can

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
it and I really like the tip as you can

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.730 
it and I really like the tip as you can
see<00:03:05.209> there<00:03:05.390> has<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.900> really<00:03:06.200> recess<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.680> a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
see there has a really recess it's a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.710 
see there has a really recess it's a
90-degree<00:03:07.100> plug<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.030> tip<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.330> recessed

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
90-degree plug but the tip is recessed

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.449 
90-degree plug but the tip is recessed
so<00:03:08.870> if<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.050> do<00:03:09.140> have<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.350> case<00:03:09.590> that's<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.280> little

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
so if you do have a case that's a little

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:11.500 
so if you do have a case that's a little
bit<00:03:10.550> thicker<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.940> case<00:03:11.090> with<00:03:11.240> a<00:03:11.270> small

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
bit thicker of a case with a small

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.850 
bit thicker of a case with a small
opening<00:03:11.810> for<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.020> headphone<00:03:12.260> jack<00:03:12.290> that

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.500
