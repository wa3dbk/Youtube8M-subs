left for position now his original

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.680 
left for position now his original
carbon<00:00:35.040> fifa<00:00:35.280> 13<00:00:35.309> came<00:00:35.880> out<00:00:36.059> was<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
carbon fifa 13 came out was a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
carbon fifa 13 came out was a
centre-forward<00:00:37.020> car<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.920> i<00:00:38.280> kind<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.610> wish

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
centre-forward car so i kind of wish

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.340 
centre-forward car so i kind of wish
that<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.059> card<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> center<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:39.930> as<00:00:40.140> well

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
that this card was a center for as well

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.260 
that this card was a center for as well
but<00:00:40.680> i<00:00:40.739> believe<00:00:40.829> since<00:00:41.250> milan<00:00:41.550> got<00:00:41.790> Balotelli

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
but i believe since milan got Balotelli

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.630 
but i believe since milan got Balotelli
they<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.510> since<00:00:42.750> shifted<00:00:42.989> over<00:00:43.320> l<00:00:44.010> shot<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
they have since shifted over l shot to

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.700 
they have since shifted over l shot to
the<00:00:44.910> left<00:00:45.239> winger<00:00:45.629> position<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.230> he<00:00:46.410> actually

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the left winger position so he actually

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.650 
the left winger position so he actually
is<00:00:46.950> an<00:00:47.010> in-form<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.520> left<00:00:47.730> wing<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.090> well<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.539> an

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
is an in-form at left wing as well as an

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.810 
is an in-form at left wing as well as an
upgraded<00:00:49.140> card<00:00:49.289> which<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.770> an<00:00:49.890> 81<00:00:50.250> overall<00:00:50.610> i

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
upgraded card which is an 81 overall i

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.760 
upgraded card which is an 81 overall i
believe<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.239> he<00:00:51.360> definitely<00:00:51.629> got<00:00:52.050> some<00:00:52.530> really

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
believe so he definitely got some really

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.799 
believe so he definitely got some really
