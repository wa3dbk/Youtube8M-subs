00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
those I'm not resting this in the bottom

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.020 
those I'm not resting this in the bottom
if<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.160> just<00:00:11.370> let<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.550> sit<00:00:11.759> all<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.849> way<00:00:11.910> in

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
if you just let this sit all the way in

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.150 
if you just let this sit all the way in
the<00:00:12.090> bottom<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.200> going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.349> puree<00:00:13.830> that

the bottom it's just going to puree that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.470 
the bottom it's just going to puree that
one<00:00:14.309> spot<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.790> then<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.179> stop

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
one spot and then it's going to stop

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.849 
one spot and then it's going to stop
because<00:00:15.870> nothing<00:00:16.199> else<00:00:16.289> can<00:00:16.410> get<00:00:16.529> sucked<00:00:16.740> up

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
because nothing else can get sucked up

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.529 
because nothing else can get sucked up
into<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.850> got<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.029> kind<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.180> hold<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.420> at

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
into it so you got to kind of hold it at

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.970 
into it so you got to kind of hold it at
an<00:00:18.600> angle<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:19.170> got<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.350> keep<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.590> moving

lift<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.100> up<00:00:26.720> stir<00:00:27.720> around<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:28.170> it

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.860 

at<00:00:32.930> this<00:00:33.110> point<00:00:33.290> you<00:00:33.470> could<00:00:33.560> also<00:00:33.740> strain<00:00:34.250> it

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.570 

once<00:00:38.870> you<00:00:38.990> thin<00:00:39.200> it<00:00:39.290> out<00:00:39.350> a<00:00:39.410> bit<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:39.860> can<00:00:40.430> also

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
know a lot of people who hand blend it

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.130 
know a lot of people who hand blend it
in<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.790> pot<00:02:03.970> like<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.750> then<00:02:04.990> they'll
