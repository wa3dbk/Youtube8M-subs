mean<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.560> technology<00:02:06.190> has<00:02:06.280> really<00:02:06.550> changed

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
mean the technology has really changed

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.389 
mean the technology has really changed
over<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.240> years<00:02:07.510> now<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.170> have<00:02:08.530> 12<00:02:08.830> cylinders

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
over the years now you have 12 cylinders

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.580 
over the years now you have 12 cylinders
it'll<00:02:09.640> generate<00:02:09.850> more<00:02:10.600> horsepower<00:02:11.200> than<00:02:11.350> you

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
it'll generate more horsepower than you

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.500 
it'll generate more horsepower than you
used<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:11.860> have<00:02:12.070> when<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.370> had<00:02:12.520> 16<00:02:13.000> cylinders

used to have when you had 16 cylinders

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.030 
used to have when you had 16 cylinders
it's<00:02:13.690> friendlier<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.500> environment

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
it's friendlier to the environment

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.260 
it's friendlier to the environment
because<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.310> don't<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.820> emissions

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
because you don't have the emissions

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.640

that<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.020> locomotive<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:51.010> sort<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.430> like<00:02:51.640> a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
that the locomotive is sort of like a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.150 
that the locomotive is sort of like a
hidden<00:02:52.360> gem<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.989> is<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.380> America<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.950> same

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.750 
thing as apple pie and baseball you
don't<00:02:56.590> really<00:02:56.739> think<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.250> you're<00:02:57.370> gonna

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
don't really think that you're gonna

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.149 
don't really think that you're gonna
build<00:02:58.239> them<00:02:58.360> when<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.659> grow<00:02:59.110> up<00:02:59.319> but<00:02:59.560> some

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
build them when you grow up but some

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.520 
build them when you grow up but some
people<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.610> it's<00:03:01.330> like<00:03:01.450> being<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.930> kid<00:03:01.959> all<00:03:02.230> over

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530

people do it's like being a kid all over
again<00:03:02.620> we're<00:03:02.980> bringing<00:03:03.220> everything<00:03:03.400> together

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
again we're bringing everything together

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.180 
again we're bringing everything together
by<00:03:04.330> locomotive<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.470> we<00:03:05.590> tried<00:03:05.769> doing<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.099> in<00:03:06.159> a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
by locomotive and we tried doing it in a

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.530 
by locomotive and we tried doing it in a
beautiful<00:03:06.370> way<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:06.970> pretty<00:03:07.120> much<00:03:07.180> takes<00:03:07.360> your

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
beautiful way it pretty much takes your

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.210 
beautiful way it pretty much takes your
breath<00:03:07.720> away<00:03:07.900> as<00:03:08.260> they<00:03:08.470> move<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.739> around<00:03:08.830> so

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
breath away as they move it around so

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.610 
breath away as they move it around so
it's<00:03:09.790> song<00:03:10.629> seems<00:03:10.930> appropriate<00:03:11.440> for<00:03:11.590> a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
it's song seems appropriate for a

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.790 
it's song seems appropriate for a
million<00:03:11.860> reasons

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.960 

when<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:18.820> see<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.060> locomotive<00:03:19.540> set<00:03:20.140> on<00:03:20.470> trucks

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970
