00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.210
 number 9 sam gibus that we do not present 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.680
 more in the genre tournaments and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.240
 tackling strong part lately 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.769
 in the gnt fence he finds here 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.390
 opponents within reach 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.699
 also know that it has nine 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.840
 podiums in as many outings on the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.849
 course that interests us 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 I also have three successes 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.840
 and three places in this service 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.010
 varies this quinté this resident of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 Sebastian Baude finds a new 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.960
 opportunity to reconnect with success the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
 rockefeller center that comes ahead of it 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.390
 will be a serious rival the horse remains 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.700
 by the way on two 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.620
 consecutive victory and convincing 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.510
 that the latest one obtained on the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.550
 plot that interests us to depend on 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.040
 than our favorite nothing stands in the way of 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.480
 a confirmation from him the number 10 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.860
 it's eric always presented to good 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.090
 this resident of franck ouvrie 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.489
 no lack of references to this 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.000
 level of competition him that was one 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.640
 protagonists of the circuit gmt 2013 of the 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.020
 national grand trot and if he is to 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.560
 rank among the priority choices of 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.229
 this course 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.729
 the number 13 renardo bello he was far 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.380
 to be beaten at the moment of his fault in 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.759
 at the entrance of the way the rights 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.200
 lately in the price of 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.180
 bagnoles-de-l'orne course in which 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.979
 rockefeller center and sam gibus se 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.460
 ranked first and 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.130
 second 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.899
 so we have to redeem this number 13 in 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.729
 the bike and the size of a vote on 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.500
 player he proved it actually I'm watching 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.539
 a number 5 safir-2 girl who comes serves 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.950
 to be wrong at the saddle but 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.759
 before the horse to collect them 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.950
 the good results 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.740
 Moreover, he recorded no less than 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.050
 ten successes during the 2013 fiscal year at 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.899
 horse legitimately count of 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.580
 logics supporters the 17 starter of the rib 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.899
 pay attention to him also the horse 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.060
 has just manifested a net surge of 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.520
 condition lately by ranking 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.200
 third of the Strasbourg prize 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.540
 the suns still there being forced 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.050
 to progress in thickness it does not 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.630
 let's not surprise a year 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.160
 the precedents cited for places I 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.170
 beware of number three is innate 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.930
 manon that last year at such a time 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.340
 had shone in the tournaments of this 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.380
 kind he also owns the best 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.580
 chrono of the peloton on this course he 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.810
 will interest fans 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.610
 valuable outsiders 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.440
 we will complete this selection that the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.080
 number 16 lamp hearts that seems to me 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.760
 able to steal the show at some 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.230
 of these cases knots this horse has 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.120
 finished fourth of this race in 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.690
 last 3rd also of the price of 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.760
 monflanquin 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.250
 also behind Eric and monkeys which moved 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.290
 figure in our selection after 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.690
 flanked words that took place in the end 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.970
 last winter so last winter 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.590
 this horse that is driven in south 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.420
 west so returns with intent to 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.640
 do well scheme and encrypted for this 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.160
 quinté of good quality on 9 saturday bus 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.800
 the 11 rockefeller center the 10-city rick 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.620
 the 13 renardo bello in front of the 5 safir 2 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.870
 girls and the 7 starter of the rib 3 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.270
 seguinel wagons and the cs of the ante 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.150
 following the vincennes program in the 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.660
 fifth I recommend the 503 downstream 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.250
 of the ap 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.960
 he was for the latest accessits 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.220
 in a lot be more than pretty good 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.810
 compose he finds here the opportunity to 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.670
 discuss the first places I him 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.230
 will put their priorities on the 501 vertigo 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.209
 of the cloud is the race aimed for 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.770
 protect the real ctma the horse is 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.510
 besides déferré posterior this 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.920
 times unlike his last run 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.690
 at 503.5 101 in the seventh the 710 if 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.310
 rejection of me seems once again in 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.660
 able to play the victory him who 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.890
 was long kept out of the tracks 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.330
 plus three years of absence 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.070
 there is now found a good 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.150
 part of his best feelings he has 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.250
 indeed won three of his four 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.300
 last races and in this lot I the 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.300
 think able to stand out 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.030
 will oppose 2,711 speed pacha confirmed 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.430
 and regular in similar society that 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.060
 races under saddle 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.010
 710,711 in the 8th still in vincennes 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.780
 I really like the 801 armstrong who 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.129
 is none other than the own father of a 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.540
 some quaker jet that in its time 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.819
 had made the arrival of a prize 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.829
 of america there are concerning the raid are 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.510
 eight hundred amstrong is obvious is done 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.150
 notice twice by his fans 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.319
 race here the commitment is good he has 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.400
 well finished lately I see the fact 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.609
 is a priori 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.709
 here he seems able to impose himself 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.909
 even though the 807 angela rock lighthouse cap that 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.760
 just finished in his near 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:10.180
 wake also has the means to him 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.340
 challenge the palm 800 1807 target course 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.930
 in vincennes in this Tuesday the fifth the 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.099
 seventh and eighth two shots of 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.889
 heart three favorites by drew 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.769
 also incarnated in meeting 2 with in 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.300
 the fourth the 413 urania of sweet 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.710
 it's just the race 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.430
 she now has two races of 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.139
 back to the legs 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.669
 she is deferré the four for this 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.270
 goal number so follow her in 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.190
 trust 413 uran of wolves the 516 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.710
 vega of walnut that last year had 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.330
 shone a thousand lights on this racecourse 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.690
 azuréen of size on sea where she had 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.520
 collected four victories here the 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.900
 mare so we find the theater of 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.099
 her best performances she comes 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.520
 to prove his form in a quinté to 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:47.949
 vincennes 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.169
 I think she is able here to 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.020
 to win in this lot that seems to his 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.370
 scope the 516 vega walnut a good 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.159
 mare, you have to trust him 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.570
 the 712 sun of the wolf that deserves 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.919
 also a mention is 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.190
 true that he will have to deal with a number 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.500
 in second line behind 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.840
 start but the horse in my opinion of the 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.490
 margin in the tomatoes people get booked 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.740
 to the computer driver he has besides 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.450
 won on this track of cagnes sur mer 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.840
 this summer a good horse 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.190
 a horse that can toughen the race to 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.990
 1000 m and in my opinion in this lot it must 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.630
 enough to contest the victory 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.930
 so race focused in meeting ii to 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:28.100
 cagnes-sur-mer the 413 uran to untie the 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.870
 516 vega rent 712 sun of the very 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.830
 good game to all my early week and to 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.830
 tomorrow on answers
