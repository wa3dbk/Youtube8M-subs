00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.059
 Good day in this video I you 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.059
 show how to do 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:16.090
 grain germination tanks 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.019
 many people ask how simple this is 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.810
 make see we need two 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:25.000
 the same capacity here, we assume 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:30.400
 take an example 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:36.100
 flywheel yoga plan see bucket enters 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:39.940
 without firewood what we do in this one in 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.239
 we have several capacities here 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.750
 holes I will not spoil this video because 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.820
 that I still need it but the principle 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.180
 I'll tell you, here are doing a few 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.989
 holes smaller than the diameter 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.890
 grains 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.879
 inserted into this bucket is a bucket whole 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.660
 put the grain here 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:12.130
 let's say we are about him or there 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:16.770
 added soda or any option in order 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:21.149
 so about Russia is this grain true 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:30.869
 raised up put two planochki and 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:30.869
 she had all the moisture left in the lower bucket 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:40.450
 then on this this liquid down below 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.750
 the dirty sphere is not everything and we can or 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.070
 leave this method let's cover 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.939
 something 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.560
 and the moisture will go away and ok she 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.520
 will pro develop here 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.710
 single we can put here cover 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.350
 something 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.540
 we need to add water we scored here 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.060
 water 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.000
 let's say i showed germination 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.399
 wheat here in a day we need 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.239
 add water for 2 hours here we go 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:17.670
 straight down the water waited for two hours 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:21.820
 two hours passed we raised the subway 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:27.340
 set the whole vlaha gone and like that 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:31.269
 method but we achieve that such 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:35.290
 very cheap let's say we have options 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:39.250
 we made ourselves this mini 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.650
 the equipment of the cheek itself is just 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.200
 super will be for take note 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.370
 it will be good to do this and that 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.950
 not a device for those involved 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.989
 sprouting grain for like food for 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:02.799
 birds and for our living creatures I have 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:06.010
 saw a lot of how to germinate on green 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:09.549
 hydroponic core shorter 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.920
 take note of this matter is not 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.530
 aware does not mean that should beat 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.200
 only buckets can be taken and let's say 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:23.290
 I have 40 liter such boxes 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.660
 Well, it's still from Soviet times, I have them 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.569
 adapted yourself to this thing and you 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.440
 You can take any option is possible 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.769
 even a hundred kilogram brothers 100 liters 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.620
 and 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.230
 it all depends on your needs and 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.980
