00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
on an alden's tower so yeah spike is a

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.830 
on an alden's tower so yeah spike is a
very<00:00:17.039> interesting<00:00:18.029> character<00:00:18.420> because<00:00:18.449> he

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
very interesting character because he

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.260 
very interesting character because he
gains<00:00:19.080> AP<00:00:19.980> very<00:00:20.430> very<00:00:20.670> quickly<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.119> his

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
gains AP very very quickly but his

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.359 
gains AP very very quickly but his
supers<00:00:21.630> aren't<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.289> greatest<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
supers aren't the greatest you have to

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.740 
supers aren't the greatest you have to
find<00:00:23.550> good<00:00:23.730> setups<00:00:24.060> more<00:00:24.240> than<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:24.630> being

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
find good setups more than just being

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.170 
find good setups more than just being
patient<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.439> even<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.460> miss<00:00:26.640> he<00:00:26.970> gains

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
patient and even if you miss he gains

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.670 
patient and even if you miss he gains
made<00:00:27.330> her<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.630> fast<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.199> probably<00:00:28.439> get

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
made her so fast you can probably get

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.230 
made her so fast you can probably get
away<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.099> bunch<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.400> times<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.849> he<00:00:29.939> has

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
train of thought but yeah spike yeah

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.880 
train of thought but yeah spike yeah
okay<00:01:19.920> huh<00:01:20.850> spike<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.470> don't<00:01:22.680> think<00:01:22.710> he's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
okay huh spike is not I don't think he's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.620 
okay huh spike is not I don't think he's
the<00:01:23.009> best<00:01:23.130> FFA<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.850> think<00:01:24.030> he's<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.270> very

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the best FFA but I think he's a very

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.570 
the best FFA but I think he's a very
strong<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:25.710> character<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> try<00:01:26.549> to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
strong one on one character so I try to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.429 
strong one on one character so I try to
isolate<00:01:26.909> people<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.630> much<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:27.930> i<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.080> because

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
isolate people as much as i can because

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.960 
isolate people as much as i can because
sometimes<00:01:28.890> his<00:01:29.040> combos<00:01:29.369> take<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> while<00:01:29.820> to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
sometimes his combos take a while to

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.910 
sometimes his combos take a while to
finish<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.720> they<00:01:30.840> will<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> lot<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.619> AP

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
finish but they will get you a lot of AP

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920 
finish but they will get you a lot of AP
and<00:01:32.189> spike<00:01:32.759> gains<00:01:32.970> meter<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.450> quickly<00:01:33.750> so

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and spike gains meter really quickly so

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.109 
and spike gains meter really quickly so
you<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.619> these<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.520> cluster

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
you get these this is like a cluster

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.080 
you get these this is like a cluster
kind<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> mess<00:01:36.960> down<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.090> one

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
kind of a mess down here so and one

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.520 
kind of a mess down here so and one
thing<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.329> don't<00:01:39.570> use<00:01:39.750> them<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.079> lot<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.409> this

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
thing I don't use them a lot in this

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.620 
thing I don't use them a lot in this
video<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> think<00:01:41.939> I'm<00:01:42.270> still

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
video but that I think I'm still

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.030 
video but that I think I'm still
learning<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.049> implicate<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:43.680> game<00:01:43.890> is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
learning to implicate it to my game is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.530 
learning to implicate it to my game is
the<00:01:44.189> teleport<00:01:44.700> boots<00:01:44.880> which<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.180> his<00:01:45.329> up

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
the teleport boots which is his up

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
the teleport boots which is his up
circle<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.649> good<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.920> getting<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.159> out<00:01:47.310> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
circle really good at getting you out of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.889 
circle really good at getting you out of
trouble<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.820> dodge<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.090> supers<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.600> stuff

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
trouble and dodge of supers and stuff

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.840 
trouble and dodge of supers and stuff
like<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.079> also<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.770> sky<00:01:49.979> flyer<00:01:50.220> helps<00:01:50.579> event

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
like that also the sky flyer helps event

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.690 
like that also the sky flyer helps event
to<00:01:50.970> giving<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.360> almost<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> triple<00:01:52.170> jump

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
to giving you almost like a triple jump

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.340 
to giving you almost like a triple jump
so<00:01:53.700> you're<00:01:54.090> finally<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.570> top<00:01:54.990> now<00:01:55.200> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
so you're finally at the top now of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.830 
so you're finally at the top now of
Alton's<00:01:55.649> tower<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.880> point<00:01:57.210> for

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
Alton's tower I'm at this point for

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.139 
Alton's tower I'm at this point for
spike<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.290> always<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.920> try<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.579> look<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.060> my

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
spike I always I try to look for my

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.490 
spike I always I try to look for my
level<00:02:00.420> 2<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> look<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> nice<00:02:01.200> horizontal

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
level 2 I look for a nice horizontal

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.649 
level 2 I look for a nice horizontal
area<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:03.210> an<00:02:03.390> opportunity

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
area but if I don't see an opportunity

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.480 
area but if I don't see an opportunity
to<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> i'll<00:02:04.469> go<00:02:04.649> ahead<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:05.040> my<00:02:05.159> level<00:02:05.460> 3

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
to get it i'll go ahead for my level 3

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.190 
to get it i'll go ahead for my level 3
so<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> freeze<00:02:06.509> miss<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.810> wait<00:02:07.020> for

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
so here I get a freeze miss I wait for

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.410 
so here I get a freeze miss I wait for
everyone<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.560> drop<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> triple<00:02:09.149> with

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
everyone to drop and get the triple with

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.020 
everyone to drop and get the triple with
level<00:02:09.780> 2<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:11.340> that's<00:02:11.520> what<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.849> do

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
level 2 so that's what you have to do

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.850 
level 2 so that's what you have to do
because<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.780> their<00:02:13.319> down<00:02:13.500> they<00:02:13.560> pretty

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
because that if their down they pretty

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.440 
because that if their down they pretty
much<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.160> no<00:02:14.340> chance<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.790> jump<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.180> long<00:02:15.330> as

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
much have no chance to jump as long as

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.030 
much have no chance to jump as long as
they're<00:02:15.569> already<00:02:15.900> down<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.770> can<00:02:16.860> see

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
they're already down and so you can see

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.680 
they're already down and so you can see
right<00:02:17.069> again<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.520> already<00:02:17.940> have<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.450> don't<00:02:18.629> know

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
right again I already have I don't know

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.720 
right again I already have I don't know
why<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.200> hit<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:19.590> loved<00:02:20.129> one<00:02:20.310> there<00:02:20.489> for<00:02:20.640> no

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
why I just hit I loved one there for no

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.150 
why I just hit I loved one there for no
reason<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.239> now<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:22.410> all<00:02:22.560> get<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.860> run<00:02:23.040> away

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
reason and now we all get to run away

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.770 
reason and now we all get to run away
from<00:02:23.280> Kratos<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> good<00:02:24.720> amount<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.989> time

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
from Kratos for a good amount of time

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.000 
from Kratos for a good amount of time
criticism<00:02:27.780> three<00:02:28.080> isn't<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.500> hard<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.830> dodge

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
criticism three isn't that hard to dodge

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.430 
criticism three isn't that hard to dodge
you<00:02:29.220> just<00:02:29.400> kind<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.640> have<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.849> like<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.750> don't

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
you just kind of have to like I don't

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.470 
you just kind of have to like I don't
know<00:02:31.560> stay<00:02:31.800> away<00:02:31.920> from<00:02:31.980> him<00:02:32.250> split<00:02:32.550> up<00:02:32.700> usually

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
know stay away from him split up usually

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.580 
know stay away from him split up usually
and<00:02:33.750> people<00:02:34.080> are<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.170> committing<00:02:34.560> suicide

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
and people are like committing suicide

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.559 
and people are like committing suicide
down<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.190> side<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.610> his<00:02:36.000> tower<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:36.480> away

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
down the side of his tower to get away

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.570 
down the side of his tower to get away
from<00:02:36.690> him<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.050> yeah<00:02:37.260> only<00:02:37.980> died<00:02:38.160> once<00:02:38.190> they're

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
from him but yeah only died once they're

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.339 
from him but yeah only died once they're
so<00:02:38.730> not<00:02:38.879> so<00:02:39.000> bad<00:02:39.180> again<00:02:39.599> controlling<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.170> top

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
so not so bad again controlling the top

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.960 
so not so bad again controlling the top
area<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.860> raceway<00:02:41.220> that's<00:02:41.430> very<00:02:41.610> important

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
area the raceway that's very important

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.070 
area the raceway that's very important
in<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.120> map<00:02:42.300> because<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.780> get<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.019> a

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
in this map because you can get you a

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.400 
in this map because you can get you a
lot<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.440> lot<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.890> AP<00:02:44.780> so<00:02:45.780> at<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.019> point<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.379> think

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
lot a lot of AP so at this point I think

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.160 
lot a lot of AP so at this point I think
of<00:02:46.739> winning<00:02:47.190> or<00:02:47.760> kratos<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.569> winning<00:02:49.019> either

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
of winning or kratos is winning either

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.690 
of winning or kratos is winning either
one<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.500> those<00:02:49.709> I'm<00:02:49.950> not<00:02:50.099> sure<00:02:50.250> how<00:02:50.340> many<00:02:50.519> kills

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
one of those I'm not sure how many kills

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.920 
one of those I'm not sure how many kills
you<00:02:50.790> got<00:02:50.970> anything<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.390> may<00:02:51.510> have<00:02:51.599> been<00:02:51.690> three

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
you got anything it may have been three

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.780 
you got anything it may have been three
or<00:02:51.959> four<00:02:52.260> yeah<00:02:52.920> here<00:02:53.129> i'm<00:02:53.220> looking<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.670> get

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
or four yeah here i'm looking to get

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.729 
or four yeah here i'm looking to get
some<00:02:53.970> quick<00:02:54.120> level<00:02:54.450> ones<00:02:54.629> before<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.560> game

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
some quick level ones before the game

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.040 
some quick level ones before the game
ends<00:02:55.950> because<00:02:56.160> i<00:02:56.340> don't<00:02:56.610> think<00:02:56.940> my<00:02:57.629> level<00:02:57.870> 2<00:02:57.989> is

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050
