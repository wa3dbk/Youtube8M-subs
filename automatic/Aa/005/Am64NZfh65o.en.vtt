a<00:02:30.450> longer<00:02:30.660> topic<00:02:31.080> warm<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:31.709> got<00:02:32.640> those

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
a longer topic warm it's got those

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.400 
a longer topic warm it's got those
rivets<00:02:33.060> on<00:02:33.360> there<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.810> it's<00:02:33.990> got<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.350> a

longer<00:02:35.190> tail<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:35.820> I'd<00:02:35.940> say<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:36.240> around<00:02:36.390> 12

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
longer tail but I'd say it's around 12

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.840 
longer tail but I'd say it's around 12
inches<00:02:36.930> long<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.440> then<00:02:38.250> these<00:02:38.430> retail<00:02:38.820> for

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850

from<00:02:39.120> $5<00:02:39.690> for<00:02:39.810> some<00:02:39.990> impact<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
from $5 for some impact so this is a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.580 
from $5 for some impact so this is a
three<00:02:41.370> pack<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.540> could<00:02:42.810> say<00:02:42.990> it's<00:02:43.410> worth

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
three pack so you could say it's worth

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.610 
three pack so you could say it's worth
whatever<00:02:43.950> dollar<00:02:44.550> two<00:02:44.940> dollars<00:02:45.300> back<00:02:46.110> and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
whatever dollar two dollars back and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.470 
whatever dollar two dollars back and
after<00:02:47.100> everything<00:02:47.520> even<00:02:47.850> if<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.030> say<00:02:48.270> this<00:02:48.420> is

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
after everything even if you say this is

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.790 
after everything even if you say this is
worth<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.810> dollar<00:02:49.020> two<00:02:49.260> dollars<00:02:49.530> which<00:02:49.560> is

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
worth a dollar two dollars which is

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.680 
worth a dollar two dollars which is
probably<00:02:50.340> more<00:02:50.489> worth<00:02:50.730> three<00:02:51.060> dollars<00:02:51.090> just

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
probably more worth three dollars just

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.470 
probably more worth three dollars just
since<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.080> pretty<00:02:52.320> much<00:02:52.440> half<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.800> pack<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.480> it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
since it's pretty much half a pack so it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.660 
since it's pretty much half a pack so it
still<00:02:54.840> comes<00:02:55.050> out<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.320> be<00:02:55.380> over<00:02:55.590> $15<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.489> that's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
still comes out to be over $15 so that's

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.720 
still comes out to be over $15 so that's
pretty<00:02:56.880> cool<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.620> that's<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.860> recon<00:02:59.220> worm<00:02:59.459> in<00:02:59.640> a
