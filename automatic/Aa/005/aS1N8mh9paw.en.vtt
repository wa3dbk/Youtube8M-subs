00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:29.130

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:49.980
 of the kind to the formation of game 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.770

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.629
 which will see things I can't say one 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.440
 place I saw at the beginning in the trailers 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.789
 and how much played that is stuck there 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.789
 by some people 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.030
 in fact here what of or murder of 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.080
 it seems to me that one of those hell was from 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.299
 a woman with video quality 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.610
 let's move on to how to download it I did 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.409
 also links ie files with all the links 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.080
 then the dishonored link to where 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:33.509
 download it premise this is a video 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:35.460
 that you will have to use win and skin or what I know 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.430
 I recommend using windscreen if you do 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.490
 you already know how to use or if you don't know it 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.320
 here is a little guide they have 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.040

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.170
 here it is there he conquers all how to do 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.090
 this guide is very well done 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.979
 I too used it for the first time 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:01.590
 was very useful and you can use faulty 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.689

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.650
 those who have less experience than many users 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.300
 I guess they are less experienced they can 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.800
 follow for the guide there which is written 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:52.010

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.940
 ask me to make a video for them but 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.330

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.170
 you also want to try the one with all the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:05.510
 written and do our problem 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:08.980
 ok while for the blogger or on the website of 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.510
 porting in team 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.610
 here there is also one more guide 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.630
 that tells you how to download it ie 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.230

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.350
 and here you have to select your file 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:26.970
 to download the rapper depends here on the 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:30.270
 your video card is video card 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.230
 even from where downloaded maybe driving 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:41.310
 mediafire here no hotter for the card 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:43.680
 video will advise you which depends 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.400
 computer you also have miac you have nvidia 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.560
 according to me you do the last maybe if you have 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.710
 envy 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.450
 but here you can immediately 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.630
 download while there is for example the 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:06.750
 according to which an authorization comes to me 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:08.360
 no weird and the game i fight was 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.690
 tried on another but that works 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.750
 very well apart from some sound because 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.520
 you know that there are some bugs with the sounds 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.860
 of with guiness king for example not 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.560
 he could hear the track or shoot but something 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:28.260
 of the kind that then were corrected by 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:32.610
 alone then to start the game i 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.870
 minimum requirements in my opinion are the money 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.280
 yes come on 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.210
 like those for skyrim and for others 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:43.130
 games from the minimum of intel core 2 duo 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:46.200
 4gb of ram is there to make it run 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:50.040
 discreetly that is then if you have the mac 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.950
 pro from 200 million gb of ram one 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.460
 800GB video card will go 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.990
 very well and give him nothing 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.290
 we also thank all the members 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:06.330
 support that gave you no paul channel 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:10.460
 as towards goals or message that not 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:16.560
 I will read and nothing to register 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:18.450

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.070
 download games from windows to mac 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.150
