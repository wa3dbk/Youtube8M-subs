00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.350
 Good morning, I'm going to teach you all 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.290
 prepare a recipe that is chicken avery 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.720
 sweet with pineapple and peach 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.720
 I call it that, then what makes us 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.840
 lack is peach that we have chopped 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.970
 pineapple pepper with loin chopped sauce 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.890
 bittersweet class service that you have it 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.810
 a video and the peach animal and the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.699
 pineapple it all together it is a step glass 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.199
 and a half or so then that's what 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.329
 we are going to do in the wok that you already see 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.000
 I've put it to warm up before 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.510
 hot and we also need minted 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.190
 cornstarch and flour and chicken but the chicken 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.770
 he showed it to me later first I'm going to 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.770
 teach how to prepare the sauce 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.550
 the butter as it is very hot 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.950
 with salt in a good first if you 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.220
 we take a little piece of oil the oil 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.780
 of sunflower no no olive then 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.789
 we think the pepper 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.550
 and while the peppers remembered the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.170
 large square 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.220
 and we have to make him go 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.770
 touching a little with the butter 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.850
 so how is this going to take about 3 45 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.130
 minutes let's cut 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.650
 how are you seeing this first in the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.049
 sauce then I'm going to teach the chicken well 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.690
 that now what we need to take the 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.180
 peach syrup and pineapple 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.400
 we throw the syrup 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.690
 and we toss the bittersweet sauce that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.370
 bittersweet sauce I have it in a video 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.920
 for those who do not know how to do it 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.270
 the amounts for four people does 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.180
 missing a glass of sweet and sour sauce and a 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.040
 glass of pineapple syrup and peaches 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.480
 say it would be half a glass of syrup 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.710
 peach and half a glass of pineapple honey 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.930
 then this is what we do 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.780
 wait for it to warm up a bit and with 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.280
 in a glass we are going to catch this is the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.750
 I dream that a lot of people are 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.660
 asking what is the dream then the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.070
 dream is potato flour this you can 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.300
 found in Latino shops 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.550
 that complicates us and a lot of you go to 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.440
 any Latino store and they sell it to you and 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.060
 now and latin stores all over the 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.830
 world in the event that you do not 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.350
 you will find what you can do substitute 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.360
 with cornstarch because they are express before 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.460
 it happens that the cornstarch gives it a flavor and 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.890
 changes the color a little bit 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.410
 the dream is more transparent then not 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.290
 it almost has flavor or changes the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.630
 color much then we miss two or 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.490
 Three spoonfuls depends on the quantity 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.510
 that you are going to prepare because I 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.280
 example this for six people 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.959
 so what we have to do is 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.530
 well move well because if not we 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.530
 there are lumps 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.160
 and he gives me what the pineapple has 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.840
 to leave reserved because this is checked 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.030
 again after we have 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.910
 finished the sauce we can finish 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.960
 the sauces we prepare the chicken then 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.020
 we already take and add this and it's so 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.670
 easy as let it go thinking 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.100
 as it warms up it will start going to 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.480
 I'm going to thicken it then 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.860
 now he spoke he taught when he goes is 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.230
 heavy 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.210
 well as you can see, he has already taken a 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.850
 heavier texture I'm going to remove it 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.350
 because if it is not it would weigh even more and the 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.640
 difference that the 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.830
 cornstarch changes the color a lot 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.590
 here you see it is more transparent 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.300
 then the color remains 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.440
 orange that is like the sauce 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.400
 bittersweet here you do not have to throw him or 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.260
 no sugar or salt or anything because the sauce 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.690
 Bittersweet already comes with sugar and 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.810
 vinegar then and the chicken comes with the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.150
 salty that is the contrast and now I'm going to 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.030
 aside this and continues to teach you how 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.310
 the chicken is made 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.530
 good as I have already removed it now 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.700
 we already throw out the fruit that would be the 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.640
 peach and pineapple 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.550
 but we mix a little bit and as you can see 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.560
 has put a pan to heat 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.170
 that this is to prepare the chicken 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.340
 the chicken have to leave it aligned 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.780
 with hijab and with sauce those who 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.400
 I do got that seduction there are people 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.260
 that there is only that question there are people 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.940
 They are milk like that, but I have done 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.430
 both because it gives a very good taste 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.750
 Now what we will do is prepare the 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.190
 flour to coat it because this is going 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.040
 then what we 're going to do 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.930
 is to mix batter flour and cornstarch 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.830
 spoon that we will use cornstarch that flour 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.040
 of batter 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:18.049
 so now I'm going to prepare it 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.560
 it is already you see it good now we are going to 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.370
 prepare the flour to rejuvenate it 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.620
 remember you here I do not need to 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.810
 EchÃ©is salt or nothing because both the sauce 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.380
 of oyster as the chair already have salt 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.150
 so just let it marinate if not 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.890
 you can stop from one day to another effect 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.390
 one day to another and if you do not have much 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.000
 then with this a couple of hours 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.410
 so then what we are going to throw is the 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.810
 batter flour that as I said 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.510
 it takes more cornstarch karina 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.850
 battered because the cornstarch more themes 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:51.860
 how to say it more is like sifting 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:53.420
 is the fine then we throw it and with a 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.150
 spoon same then we will mix it 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.340
 well then if we fall short then 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.530
 we will throw more 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.449
 if we stay short if it does not, it does not make me 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.320
 missing then if we 're going to 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.320
 mix well well well 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.919
 this is the only part that you can 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.270
 stain because it splashes a little 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.520
 flour is stained per garment with a 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.460
 trapito therefore does not fall put the fire 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.800
 more or less at a temperature of 7 more or 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.720
 less and this also is not necessary to happen nor 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.680
 by egg or anything directly 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.070
 Once you get the metes well in the flour and 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.540
 move a little bit so they mix and 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.630
 to see if the oil is hot 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.240
 confirm teysuno 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.800
 for example still lacks a bit because 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.900
 We climbed a bit and let throwing 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.770
 and this is the process that takes the longest 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.600
 that this is so we take it we let it 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.790
 it slips a little 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:51.470
 and inside to fry everything so now 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.970
 when it's fried I show it aside 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.380
 because we have to put it on a plate 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.139
 like a napkin to get all the 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.300
 grease 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.300
 and we already put it, you are opening 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.669
 well, as you can see, it takes very little 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.740
 that already what we can go taking out 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.189
 wait as well as now faced squids 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.169
 battered is very rich and nothing now 

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:18.069
 we keep frying then what are we going to 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.069
 to do is to throw more 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.240
 and so on until we have 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.250
 all the fried chicken 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.419
 good as you can see it is already separates 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.870
 egg because I need to be the 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.970
 egg 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.069
 the chicken is already fried all then 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.349
 Now what we do is throw it out so that 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:35.000
 will go mixing the flavors this is the 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.500
 last one that just took out that there is 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.419
 put them in front to drain the 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:43.550
 oil that there is and nothing now and this 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:46.250
 we move we let it go mixing 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.780
 all flavors and now I teach it in 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.780
 the presentation of the plate 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:55.790
 well I have already finished looking this is 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:58.190
 the presentation as you will see this fact 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.710
 a rice three delights and joined them with 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.560
 my chicken with sweet with lemon and ask with 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.690
 lemon with pineapple and peach look here 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.880
 you have the rice three delights you have it 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:11.110
 a recipe already and here you have the chicken 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:13.370
 lemon the lemon the chicken boiled the cce 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.600
 it's very easy to do what you've seen 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:21.590
 very fast nothing to remind you with subscribe 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.180
 in my channel that I share it and because if 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.060
 I shared it, a lot more people see it and 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.830
 better still and nothing for you to see that 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.190
 It's very good, I'll be the first one 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.190
 is going to try 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.780
 do not
