00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.500
 new edition of the walking dead 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.150
 season 2 follow 10 and follow 11 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.550
 we make a cohesion 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.290
 According to 10 does not offer as much content 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.780
 therefore, both follow to tell 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.520
 together before but the ref catches their 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.900
 can you like the playlist of the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.520
 watching walking dead there are all 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.439
 our videos as noticed now 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.720
 some videos with us very often marked 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.240
 will also follow in between 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.689
 come and others do not follow suit 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.399
 please click on the episodes 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.770
 for honest, what belongs on the playlist 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.450
 then you see the whole walking dead 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.590
 videos as you have to box with 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.020
 rating and and and follow 10 that 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.270
 important at the beginning of the episode is that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 shaikhs i try to utter 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.890
 in the time where she caught the prisoner 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.410
 They want to get away from the car 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.090
 a few kilometers further away, bring something like that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.590
 he does not even know where the colors are 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.699
 connect the place the eyes and the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.120
 ears and so on 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.649
 Now a little music on the ears 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.780
 as the prisoner wanted to expose 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.119
 then they will know that anyway 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.640
 Maggie knows and knows where the colors are 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.720
 that's why it makes no sense to him 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.170
 further away 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.280
 Rick wants him king King Eric Chaney 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.390
 was the same kill and of course 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.250
 red bull are but one day will be 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830
 Think about the two beating 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.960
 You also have to feel that way 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.130
 that damage is already pretty wet 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.200
 The whole thing takes a long time 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.180
 until the zombies come up very many 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.970
 Zombies came and the two become 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.520
 isolated beautiful and included 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.430
 a bus on a school bus and trick leaves 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.240
 him first there he will too 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.909
 implied that that also consciously does and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.590
 not as a tactical retreat later 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.689
 but saved him and it looks like that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.420
 from as if it is wanted by the per 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.939
 Rescue on the farm is the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.100
 suicide attempt by wef ruling 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.100
 all those who are still there so the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.200
 remaining characters fight with beth 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.329
 Some say they live , but some say 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.640
 Also, it is your decision what you are 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.700
 makes and if wants to kill itself 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.180
 know the one direction also equal to 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.319
 Eleventh result of being caught 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.269
 tortured they have 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.650
 not brought back he knows 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.030
 had brought nothing with the zombie 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.849
 we also have and and and I want 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.760
 they let the now but only kill dell 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.530
 fights for him beside bayer dye 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.819
 long winter comes that it gets colder 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:36.689
 and the whole result is actually 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.219
 Dominates that dell for the 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.540
 prisoner recruits that he shot himself 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.590
 but they are all they are 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.769
 pretty sure he shot 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.379
 must be because otherwise the evil were 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.769
 or that reaches deep reach the farm 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.900
 to such a small side story, too 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.120
 Karl wants to make a big impact at last 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.719
 a big man is going up 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.280
 A short one worries far away 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.579
 duration meets a zombie of the morass 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.849
 Hidden and of course Karin wants 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.849
 equal to 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.409
 with the clear kill goes there 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.159
 right up close the zombie said 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.680
 guilt in the morass sunk only as karl 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:17.459
 then the zombie can come from behind 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.680
 liberate himself because of that and then 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.879
 comes karl may of course just as 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.129
 he came from the Polish 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.169
 So almost packed that potash 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.769
 but karl grain is the next victim 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:30.120
 which fortunately save themselves 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.609
 that's exactly what ends first and on 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.590
 evening then stop over the prisoner 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:39.599
 decided to assemble all and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.459
 there would be something discussed again 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.379
 can happen with that with the 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.519
 Trapped options are discussed 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:51.290
 louis dale is actually for him and 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.870
 tried to save him again because he was 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.729
 that justifies the goals so 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.560
 civilization can not give up only 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.689
 because the grande is so very 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.889
 interesting aspects again 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.590
 socio-political very much 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.659
 nice but the group comes to or 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:11.780
 both groups come to him in the 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:14.129
 barn is to be shot karzai 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.469
 of course, that's just what it takes 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:20.190
 shoot as karl in the schools purely 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:22.860
 come and say dead to shoot it 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.150
 what makes you so shocked and 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.740
 do not shoot him and decide 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.599
 actually point it out 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.610
 the first is not to be shot 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:33.780
 So a prisoner of the prisoners lives 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.759
 on and they have to in order to 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.740
 do caught and of course that throws 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:42.960
 also often the group quite a lot 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.690
 Conflicts because the good fenin dead 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.520
 would like to see 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.710
 Thus, the result ends with a right 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.870
 tackle 10 again as I think 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.310
 because dale goes to the forest again 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.990
 So he goes so know the landscape 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.490
 accesses even complicit encounter 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.720
 him and he is also bitten and it 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.669
 turns out that's the same 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.919
 zombie was left to the carl 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.720
 but at least caused the e-mails 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.229
 that he was released 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.599
 and at the very circuit must stop the del 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:19.080
 to be shot dead by a member 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:21.060
 the group is otherwise a zombie 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.490
 transforms the eleventh episode ends 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.560
 super spectacular as I think 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.690
 many aspects of socio-political 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.610
 seen on the group of groups 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.669
 between tour through to the end 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.000
 again and karl the develop 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.710
 want 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.370
 So there was a lot on offer in Rahden 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.770
 Eleventh follow soon I suspect 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.659
 sunday I make the episode 12 and 13 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.099
 together fails again if it 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:46.219
 is the walking dead until the next 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.219
 times
