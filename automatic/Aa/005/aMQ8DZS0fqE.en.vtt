only<00:02:03.700> one<00:02:03.910> spar<00:02:04.240> blows<00:02:04.510> up<00:02:04.720> in<00:02:04.870> that<00:02:05.050> head<00:02:05.770> and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
only one spar blows up in that head and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.910 
only one spar blows up in that head and
when<00:02:07.150> they<00:02:07.300> touch<00:02:07.660> there's<00:02:08.110> two<00:02:08.320> contact

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
when they touch there's two contact

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.650 
when they touch there's two contact
points<00:02:08.979> that<00:02:09.399> touch<00:02:09.610> before<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:10.210> other<00:02:10.360> two

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
points that touch before the other two

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.040 
points that touch before the other two
and<00:02:11.880> then<00:02:12.880> it's<00:02:13.060> carried<00:02:13.390> up<00:02:13.480> into<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.870> air

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
and then it's carried up into the air

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.260 
and then it's carried up into the air
and<00:02:14.320> when<00:02:15.250> they<00:02:15.430> fuse

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
and when they fuse

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.690 
and when they fuse
it's<00:02:17.020> like<00:02:17.200> nuclear<00:02:17.470> fusion<00:02:18.070> except<00:02:18.640> a

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
it's like nuclear fusion except a

it's like nuclear fusion except a
