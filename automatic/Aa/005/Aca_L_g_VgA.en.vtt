00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.600
 j 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.580
 it's a kind of little thing 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:53.379
 age that can be used to reject a 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.450
 road to moor the boat for that one 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.960
 needs a goat arm that but ready 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.960
 combi tomorrow and two fingers like that 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.240
 start do not let yourself be ten 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.590
 centimeters of mud that sticks out and you 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.310
 wind up you do four rounds around 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:17.290
 of mozart and then you do tricks 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.140
 around 4 is such one made four 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.560
 turns without ever crossing the boot just 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.560
 tournaments 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.700
 yeah that's a two to four 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.640
 baths we can do it we can do 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.330
 - maybe do some more if we 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.330
 the bigger one 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.740
 it looks like that we serve it a little 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.670
 little by rotating the tournaments 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.610
 because that's when we put 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:55.250
 the city well placed the ball one goes place 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.750
 there in the middle between the fingers and after 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.850
 surrounds you what they servient 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.260
 surrounded by the first four holes and 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.260
 four more times always the same 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.489
 when you have passed the bear if you 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.930
 remove your fingers and stabilize yourself a 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:32.340
 little screw pretty much to that it has to 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:35.310
 look like to see the first rounds on 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.599
 encloses them then surrounds what 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.700
 served us in canvas and first round 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.049
 which surrounds them again with the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.980
 cathos to prepare your wife your 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.870
 love the one with which you have 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.310
 started where there were ten centimeters 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.409
 of death from pat on comes the past to 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.099
 instead of going over we'll go 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.099
 under the towers 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.500
 the ess of the past like this and like that a 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.780
 once we have tightened we will not have 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.969
 to cut there to burn it a little bit 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.519
 so that for that to avoid who 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:16.290
 fraying is actually in his ranks he 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.439
 is going to get stuck under these miles to 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.010
 essaouira more than move 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:28.519
 so we tightened up we leave for my blog 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.519
 this wind that intends to follow 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.730
 sorcerer 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.050
 he
