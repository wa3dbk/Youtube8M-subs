round and this is called knitting on

round and this is called knitting on
your<00:03:54.349> cast<00:03:54.590> on<00:03:54.920> it's<00:03:55.879> the<00:03:56.090> cable<00:03:56.510> cast<00:03:56.750> on<00:03:57.079> or

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
your cast on it's the cable cast on or

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.180 
your cast on it's the cable cast on or
it's<00:03:59.000> also<00:03:59.120> known<00:03:59.540> as<00:03:59.690> a<00:03:59.720> chain<00:04:00.109> cast<00:04:00.440> on<00:04:00.739> and

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
it's also known as a chain cast on and

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.909 
it's also known as a chain cast on and
the<00:04:02.000> reason<00:04:02.299> I<00:04:02.390> call<00:04:02.599> it<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.840> chain<00:04:03.169> castellan

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
the reason I call it a chain castellan

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.120 
the reason I call it a chain castellan
is<00:04:04.639> because<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.269> essentially<00:04:06.260> makes<00:04:06.739> the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
is because this essentially makes the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.539 
is because this essentially makes the
same<00:04:07.459> stitch<00:04:07.880> as<00:04:08.180> a<00:04:08.239> crochet<00:04:08.959> chain<00:04:09.549> except

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
same stitch as a crochet chain except

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:19.930 
same stitch as a crochet chain except
for<00:04:10.760> its<00:04:10.849> on<00:04:11.000> your<00:04:11.359> knee

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.760 

and<00:04:20.940> get<00:04:21.330> this<00:04:21.480> nice<00:04:21.840> neat<00:04:22.380> edge<00:04:23.930> it's<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.260> find

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
and get this nice neat edge it's I find

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.110 
and get this nice neat edge it's I find
it<00:04:25.920> easier<00:04:26.250> to<00:04:26.310> get<00:04:26.490> my<00:04:26.670> stitches<00:04:26.910> even<00:04:29.090> when<00:04:30.090> I

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
it easier to get my stitches even when I

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.450 
it easier to get my stitches even when I
do<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:30.570> cast<00:04:30.900> on<00:04:31.170> as<00:04:31.350> well<00:04:33.650> okay<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:35.190> is

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460
