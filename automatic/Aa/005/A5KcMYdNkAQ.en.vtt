00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.040
 video how to make a danish input card 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.400
 for this you will need minecraft 147 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:19.170
 go in a single game create the world 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:22.470
 call the world as we want so called 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.330
 choose game mode creative then 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.060
 advanced world settings and type 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.910
 Super flat 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:36.380
 customize choose a sand pattern oh 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:42.809
 damn sand we remove unnecessary layers 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.910
 everything is ready create the world the first time you 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.920
 the game may fly but it's nothing 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.710
 terrible to restart and everything is fine 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.530
 here we restarted minekravt we go 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:59.390
 to our map which we have created so 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.390
 looking for where u walk from the island appear 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.440
 Now we have a map here Maleh 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:19.110
 flew off everything is fine 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.940
 Here, in principle, build spawn if any 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.070
 want there with a friend ariadne 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.260
 then just nothing interesting 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.890
 We build shorter spawn any way you want or 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.630
 there is no idea what you can do 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.370
 maps are generated endlessly that is 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.470
 you can move from one island to 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.270
 other 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.690
 then when you do everything or start 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.960
 play 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.960
 be sure to switch mode 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:56.420
 turn off the 4th turn on 4 game mode 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:58.380
 make survival and open it up for 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.780
 the pipes danced 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.479
 comrades then you need to enter the command 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:11.450
 everything can now survive calmly 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.450
 there is everything as in the ordinary minecraft 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.060
