00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.800
Zija International is
constantly searching 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.366
for the greatest that
nature has to offer. 

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.099
We recognize
the significance 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.533
of living a healthy
and active life style, 

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.333
as well as using
natural ingredients

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.399
to erradicate
everyday problems. 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.500
While our nutritional
supplement products

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.900
have completely revolutionized the
health and wellness world,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.900
we’re taking it to a whole
new level, one drop at a time.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.333
Introducing
Améo Essential Oils

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.866
“Ame” means “soul”
in French. 

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.399
“Rico” means “rich”
in Spanish.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.966
Together
they create Améo, 

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.999
a line of products that’s
enriching to the soul. 

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.299
Essential oils are naturally
produced liquids 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.866
obtained from nature’s
most generous trees, 

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.899
herbs, plants,
seeds, and fruits. 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.566
They have been highly valued
and used throughout history 

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:02.099
for their advantageous therapeutic
and medicinal properties. 

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:05.066
Essential oils can solve
thousands of problems, 

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.732
improving the health and
well-being of all who use them.

00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:12.399
There are three different ways
to experience Améo Essential Oils.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.766
Aromatically, which involves
smelling or inhaling the oil 

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.066
directly through
the nose or mouth.

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.632
Internally, or swallowing
the oils,

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:23.899
and topically, applying
the oils to the skin.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.933
Extracting essential
oils requires 

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.633
sizable amounts
of raw botanicals. 

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:32.866
For example, it takes about 150
pounds of lavender flowers 

00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:37.032
to produce just one pound
of Améo True Lavender oil. 

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.633
This makes our oils
highly concentrated,

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.599
potent, and valuable. 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.966
Steam distillation is the
most common method 

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.999
of extracting
essential oils. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.433
Through this process,
the botanical is condensed 

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:50.933
into highly concentrated
and pure liquid, 

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.999
ready for use. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.466
Cold-pressing distillation is also
used to extract certain oils,

00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:01.766
especially citruses, like lemon,
tangerine, and bergamot.

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:05.132
Purity and quality are the
two most important aspects 

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:07.166
of any essential oil.  

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:09.199
Both affect its
therapeutic value, 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.233
aroma, color, potency,

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:12.966
and when applicable,
flavor. 

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.699
We take pride in
the purity and quality 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.800
of all Améo
Essential Oils,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.666
which is evident in our
precise and correct sourcing,

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:22.399
validating, and delivering
processes.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.066
All of these steps
are overseen

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:26.999
by the Améo Scientific
Advisory Board.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.866
To properly source
Améo Essential Oils, 

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.099
we have developed
valuable relationships

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.866
with farmers around the world
who perform cutting-edge, 

00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:37.899
eco-friendly, sustainable
and ethical growing

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.633
and harvesting
practices. 

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:41.966
Once we receive
the distilled oils, 

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:44.832
we validate each batch
through a series of tests 

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:47.999
to ensure that they are
safe, natural, and effective. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.233
While any company that sells
oils for therapeutic use 

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:52.966
should perform these tests,

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:54.799
Améo goes above
and beyond.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.366
Our oils must meet strict
Certi-5 requirements, 

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:02.032
which is a series of tests
available exclusively to Améo. 

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:04.933
Certi-5 validation
ensures that our oils 

00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:07.133
match or exceed
the quality of oils 

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:10.433
used in clinical and
peer-reviewed scientific studies 

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:13.133
and that they are
cell active and permeable, 

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:16.133
meaning that they are
easily and consistently absorbed 

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:19.233
by the body’s cells, the
way they were meant to be.

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:22.799
Because we are so confident in
the quality and purity of our oils, 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.066
we’ve created a complete
Améo Difference System. 

00:03:26.066 --> 00:03:29.466
Product users can go to
AmeoDifference.com, 

00:03:29.466 --> 00:03:32.366
enter the unique batch code
on the bottom of their bottle,

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:35.099
and instantly gain access
to the test performed 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.266
on that batch of oil
and the results.

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:41.032
We also include videos of
the oil permeating live cells. 

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.666
Once our oils are
Certi-5 validated, 

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:46.832
we continue incorporating
stringent delivery practices

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:50.399
to ensure that the end user
receives all of their benefits.

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:53.432
We set out to create
a product line 

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:55.933
that will help you continue
to feel your best,

00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:58.133
look your best,
be your best, 

00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:01.699
and have the energy and
vitality needed to enjoy your life. 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.200
This new life begins with
the numerous benefits 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.600
of using Améo Essential
Oils on a daily basis.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.000
We invite you

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.166
of this amazing,
new product line 

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:13.566
and business opportunity.

00:04:13.566 --> 00:04:15.099
Pure nature.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.633
Sound science.

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:18.133
Rich life.

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:21.633
