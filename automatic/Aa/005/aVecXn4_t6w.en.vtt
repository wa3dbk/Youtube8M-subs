00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.950
 the new bmw wx 4 seeks to replicate with 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.950
 more compact dimensions and more values 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.950
 accessible the success of the known x 6 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.400
 that's why it shows similar lines with a 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.740
 roof fall that gives it airs of 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.349
 I cope a style solution that challenge 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.930
 at the time the almost classicism 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.630
 all sport and utilities vans or 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.180
 off-road recently presented at 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.860
 Europe the x4 is developed on the 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.690
 3 x platform 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.440
 that's why its dimensions are similar 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.600
 with 4 with 67 meters long but all 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.150
 the set is almost 4 centimeters more 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.699
 under a tone down with your intentions 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.500
 sports not only in terms of style 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.500
 but also to dynamic behavior 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.519
 in its posterior zone seen so much of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.550
 other profile as the resemblance to the 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.860
 x6 is undeniable in the front area in 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.680
 I change the angled design of the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.170
 headlights remember the x3 but always in a 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.619
 more sporty set especially by 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.780
 the large lower air intakes 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.909
 the rear seats are comfortable only 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.770
 for two passengers and for the curvature 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.200
 of the roof shows some limitations 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.289
 in height but keeps change a trunk 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.119
 of good capacity with 500 liters 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.670
 in addition the gate can be opened with the 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.350
 smart open air function by just passing the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 foot below the bumper 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.130
 of course the driving position 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.500
 corresponds to that of a sports car and 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.290
 the design of the interior panel is a tracing 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.380
 almost perfect the one that uses the x3 with 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.900
 a style typically bm w is classic and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.030
 in its robust center console stands out 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.610
 a high definition top screen 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.710
 for navigation and to visualize 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.080
 all audio functions and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.450
 vehicle configurations is also 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.820
 traditional the board solution is 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.720
 say with four needles and minimum 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.720
 digitization 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.000
 all x4 have integral traction 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.490
 xdrive and electronic automatic box 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.710
 of 8 marches this transmission package 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:24.260
 It is combined with various engines 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:27.060
 between the nafteros a 2.0 turbo of 184 and 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.750
 245 horses while the height of 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.730
 range is located the 3.0 turbo of 306 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.750
 horses that corresponds to the version 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.950
 it extracts 35 and the diesel is 3 and they have 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.959
 powers between 190 and 313 horses is 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.030
 say that the latter is even more 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.030
 powerful than the best of the estuaries 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.720
 we still have not managed it but 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.150
 colleagues have told us that the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.850
 dynamic behavior is even better than 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.950
 the one of the x3 with a very sporty touch and 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.320
 sure not only by the action of the system 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.640
 of integral traction but also by the 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.820
 control intervention 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.820
 electronic 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.990
 in the next months the x4 will be 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.720
 reaching a wide range of markets 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.300
 around the world though by the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.470
 moment his arrival in Argentina is not 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.570
 defined in your offer there will also be 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.150
 sports and aesthetic packages and 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.350
 gossips are spoken of a version m 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.180
 with more powerful engines, what 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.760
 It is certain that the German brand sees a 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.770
 great potential in their x models and is by 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.510
 that which diversifies them just in a 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.790
 moment in which the world grows 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.790
 demand for sport and utility crossovers 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.489
 with blood
