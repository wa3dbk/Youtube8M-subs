00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
thumb so this is how you do it is you're

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.139 
thumb so this is how you do it is you're
an<00:00:57.210> example<00:00:57.480> all<00:00:57.719> right<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.079> hmm

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
an example all right here hmm

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.590 
an example all right here hmm
kind<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.660> grab<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> end<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.559> pull<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
kind of just grab the end and pull it

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.030 
kind of just grab the end and pull it
from<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> root<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.170> guess<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
from the root I guess you really have to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.500 
from the root I guess you really have to
practice<00:01:05.159> I've<00:01:05.640> been<00:01:05.909> doing<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.210> for<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> long

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
practice I've been doing it for a long

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.800 
practice I've been doing it for a long
time<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.260> here<00:01:07.500> pretty<00:01:07.799> fast<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.810> it's

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
time so I'm here pretty fast but it's

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.980 
time so I'm here pretty fast but it's
really<00:01:10.080> good<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.860> your<00:01:12.350> ends<00:01:13.350> -<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.280> you

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
really good for your ends - so if you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
really good for your ends - so if you
don't<00:01:15.990> know<00:01:16.080> how<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.740> if<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.159> use<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> regular

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
don't know how like if you use a regular

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.330 
don't know how like if you use a regular
and<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.479> can't<00:01:18.750> cover<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.830> ends<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.189> some

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
and you can't cover the ends for some

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.539 
and you can't cover the ends for some
reason<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.930> use<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.549> another

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
reason you can use this for that another

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.350 
reason you can use this for that another
trick<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:25.280> sometimes<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.610> leave<00:01:27.150> your

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
trick is sometimes when you leave your

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.219 
trick is sometimes when you leave your
lip<00:01:27.630> bones<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.170> your<00:01:28.200> car<00:01:29.570> like<00:01:30.570> tins<00:01:30.930> you

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
lip bones in your car like tins you

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.109 
lip bones in your car like tins you
looked<00:01:31.619> into<00:01:32.009> your<00:01:32.100> high<00:01:32.689> melts<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:35.790> most

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
looked into your high melts and it most

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.620 
looked into your high melts and it most
like<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> weird<00:01:36.780> boss<00:01:36.960> head<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.119> side<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
like a weird boss head to the side of a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.149 
like a weird boss head to the side of a
counter<00:01:39.930> or<00:01:40.290> 10<00:01:40.590> or<00:01:42.110> if<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.680> want<00:01:44.070> to

like<00:01:52.310> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.400> you<00:01:54.470> know<00:01:55.470> try<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:57.440> for<00:01:58.440> like

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
like kind of you know try it for like

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.130 
like kind of you know try it for like

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
around a minute or so and it looks like

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.500 
around a minute or so and it looks like
new<00:02:01.290> again<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.830> well<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.580> don't<00:02:02.670> know<00:02:02.880> nice<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
new again like well I don't know nice to

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.780 
new again like well I don't know nice to
see<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.810> buddy<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.800> looks<00:02:05.010> almost<00:02:05.190> open<00:02:05.460> again

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
see you buddy it looks almost open again

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.850 
see you buddy it looks almost open again
and<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.630> especially<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.080> billionaire<00:02:07.590> car

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and like especially a billionaire car

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.490 
and like especially a billionaire car
and<00:02:08.430> then<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.090> melts<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.420> funky<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.320> can

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and then it melts all funky then you can

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.920 
and then it melts all funky then you can
melt<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.160> back<00:02:11.220> why<00:02:11.580> because<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.720> don't<00:02:12.900> have

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
melt it back why because we don't have

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.890 
melt it back why because we don't have
flat<00:02:13.260> surface<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.830> just<00:02:13.980> melt<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.310> up<00:02:14.900> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
flat surface and just melt it up and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.110 
flat surface and just melt it up and
then<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.200> third<00:02:16.440> trick<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:17.120> sometimes

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
then the third trick is sometimes

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.510 
then the third trick is sometimes
whenever<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.230> get<00:02:19.380> really<00:02:19.530> crazy<00:02:19.830> flyaways<00:02:20.490> and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
whenever I get really crazy flyaways and

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.790 
whenever I get really crazy flyaways and
