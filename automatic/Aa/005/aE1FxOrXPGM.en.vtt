00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.870 
like it's not that big of a deal for me
so<00:04:54.440> I<00:04:54.740> love<00:04:55.070> it<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:56.860> the<00:04:57.860> only<00:04:58.040> negative<00:04:58.700> that

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
so I love it and the only negative that

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.340 
so I love it and the only negative that
I<00:04:59.060> would<00:04:59.270> fail

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
I would fail

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.310 
I would fail
is<00:05:01.040> that<00:05:02.650> basically<00:05:04.180> how<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.360> opened<00:05:05.840> like<00:05:06.170> the

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
is that basically how it opened like the

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.890 
is that basically how it opened like the
packaging<00:05:06.800> is<00:05:06.920> nice<00:05:07.130> and<00:05:07.430> all<00:05:07.550> but<00:05:07.900> some

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
packaging is nice and all but some

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.760 
packaging is nice and all but some
person<00:05:09.410> may<00:05:09.880> not<00:05:10.880> purchase<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:12.020> because<00:05:12.590> of

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
person may not purchase it because of

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.200 
person may not purchase it because of
the<00:05:12.890> fact<00:05:13.130> that<00:05:13.220> your<00:05:13.490> product<00:05:13.910> may<00:05:14.150> be

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
the fact that your product may be

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.300 
the fact that your product may be
exposed<00:05:14.780> to<00:05:15.170> bacteria<00:05:16.130> so<00:05:17.470> for<00:05:18.470> me<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.920> really

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
exposed to bacteria so for me it really

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.010 
exposed to bacteria so for me it really
doesn't<00:05:19.670> matter<00:05:19.760> because<00:05:20.270> I'm<00:05:20.480> kind<00:05:20.750> of<00:05:20.810> tied

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
doesn't matter because I'm kind of tied

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.980 
doesn't matter because I'm kind of tied
to<00:05:21.170> my<00:05:21.290> hand<00:05:21.560> like<00:05:23.710> prior<00:05:24.710> to<00:05:25.040> each<00:05:25.220> use<00:05:25.660> so<00:05:26.660> I

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
to my hand like prior to each use so I

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.660
