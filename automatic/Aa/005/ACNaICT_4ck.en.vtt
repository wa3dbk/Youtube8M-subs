ground I got over that lake and I could
not<00:02:49.720> see<00:02:50.019> it<00:02:50.140> was<00:02:50.260> like<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.409> mirror<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:52.540> just

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
not see it was like a mirror and I just

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.390 
not see it was like a mirror and I just
went<00:02:52.930> forever<00:02:53.640> before<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:54.670> touched<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.180> water
