going<00:03:30.079> to<00:03:30.109> lift<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.530> up<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.889> inside<00:03:31.700> here

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
going to lift it up and inside here

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.860 
going to lift it up and inside here
there's<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.180> little<00:03:32.389> trigger<00:03:32.600> that<00:03:32.780> you're

there's a little trigger that you're
going<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.049> pull<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.530> what<00:03:34.100> that<00:03:34.310> does<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.730> just

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
going to pull and what that does it just

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.210 
going to pull and what that does it just
lifts<00:03:35.150> up<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:35.810> top<00:03:36.019> part<00:03:36.049> of<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.590> proto-truk

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
and then you have this spaceship here's

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.729 
and then you have this spaceship here's
a<00:03:41.239> little<00:03:41.450> fan<00:03:41.600> or<00:03:41.750> sixty<00:03:42.049> degree<00:03:42.319> look<00:03:42.470> around

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739
