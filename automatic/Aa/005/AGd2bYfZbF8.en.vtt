00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello i am stefanie working and 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.160
 Today I would like to tell something about 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.670
 food 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.009
 the nutrition is in addition to yoga 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.199
 Another serious topic of mine with that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.630
 me now the last 15 years 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.529
 about very busy 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.660
 and a nice compliment that I always 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.699
 is get back to the people 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.619
 tell me you do not make up and 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.759
 Nevertheless, you are doing such a clean skin 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.140
 or you have been reading for 20 years now 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.690
 at first not older how do you do that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.010
 actually 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.469
 Of course, I 'm happy about that too 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.200
 hear but I write already for 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.520
 one in my yoga practice and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.440
 of course my diet 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.690
 There was time that was that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.700
 I was very different , for example 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.800
 formerly for a year in the us 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.480
 and since it was quite normal that one 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.090
 at least three times a week in almost 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.829
 Food restaurant has sat and the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.109
 remaining days were still in 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.270
 The microwave oven has been put up 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.189
 very quickly mirrored in again 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.619
 my skin and energies 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.500
 that always went on and on 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.880
 This year, I will have it for myself 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.590
 I have not bought myself anymore 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.009
 cooked home usual calm day 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.430
 I have often had to do this quickly 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.840
 go and do a workday for so long 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.680
 I need like dishes finished 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.740
 and seized 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.930
 the skin then became worse and worse 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.770
 The pick also puts some funny 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.450
 or bloody and at some point I have that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.729
 also in connection with it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.439
 brought that where also the nutrition 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.180
 I'm involved in that 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.380
 I see starting to order 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.550
 employ and that is an issue now 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.780
 it has become easy 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.770
 So, it's a great pleasure 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.010
 compulsive otherwise it can then completely 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.530
 a lot of fun and a few tips 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:01.770
 I would like to give you that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.500
 on the one hand finished products cans for the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.750
 Stir everything so sorted out everything 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.340
 So that's what's in my kitchen 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.870
 not earlier today and not anymore 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.490
 Besides, I do not mean that you are 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.260
 in the milk market but there is 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.430
 just keep adjusting that 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.290
 use for it 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.540
 For example, there is the blackboard here 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.170
 where I always like to go 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.150
 bring 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.550
 there food is passed on 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.130
 needy so maybe there's 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.370
 from now on and in the future you renounce 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.710
 just when you go shopping 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.610
 because you are healthy food 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.980
 just interested 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.540
 just stick to the principles of 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.000
 nature and that is, for a look here 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.320
 What is seasonal? What is it? 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.200
 seasonal offer 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.650
 I would not like strawberries, for example 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.510
 In January , there are growing and none 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.850
 strawberries or that regionally 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.420
 Of course, the strawberries go shopping 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.800
 in january anyway in the supermarket but 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.180
 that comes from somewhere else and 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.130
 probably that accordingly 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.680
 also sprayed so that it holds 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.900
 are over that long way off therefore 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.610
 Let's look at two important principles 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.220
 that it comes from the region and looks 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.530
 that it fits the season if you have the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.910
 opportunity then you like to pick up 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.910
 Bio back that you make organic products easy 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.900
 preferred because they usually rainer 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.750
 are of your quality 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.180
 not so much burdened with pesticides 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.770
 for example and it does not have to 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:44.290
 necessarily be more expensive if the 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:48.260
 Regional remains then is very important 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.480
 as diverse as possible to eat it 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.160
 gives a so-called rainbow principle 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.740
 where you always get a wealth of food 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.520
 those are the ones who take them back a lot 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.240
 varied on senders to 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.230
 for example, all colors are also integrated 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.940
 or that you stick to the natural one 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.560
 So food keeps that 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.090
 actually growing in nature and 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.610
 not what you advertise 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.420
 met and what is supposed to be so healthy 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.650
 As a rule, things get done for these things 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.330
 no advertising done 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.400
 yes, anyway in the fruit and vegetables part 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.980
 A supermarket can be found at 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:33.560
 Naturally, bioladen is looking for her 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.990
 well, yes it does not have much sense 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.180
 that you force something into what you do 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.220
 maybe not good at all 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.570
 Also because it just mindful what gets 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.830
 me fine and how are you after me 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:48.950
 if I ate that and now too 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.810
 lots of fruit vegetable salad perfect 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.990
 products integrated into yours 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.290
 nutritional plan and I have too 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.630
 race quite often and my day starts 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.770
 with a game in which I fruit a lot 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.530
 color but also with vegetables or nuts and 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.050
 which then lunch the always on 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.590
 There is then a large proportion of vegetables in the evening 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.290
 still 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.180
 a smaller meal and who two 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.310
 I do not eat meals a day either 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.990
 because I do not have my digestive tract either 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.500
 I would like to take the whole night 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.240
 day something in me to school 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.070
 and friends so easy little things 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.620
 but I think that's good too 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.510
 can implement if you learn more 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.080
 do you want to give the topic a book? 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.090
 the talks with yoga and jan yoga there 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.510
 you will find many more hints to 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.820
 nutrition and also my recipes 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:44.390
