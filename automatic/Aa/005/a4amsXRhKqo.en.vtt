00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.830
 or the erosion valuation lizÃ³n heras soy 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.619
 josema source and this is a market al 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.540
 day the market today coming from 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.640
 the brands that I personally have 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.380
 a special affection first for being a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.000
 our brand is a Spanish brand 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.940
 murciana for more signs of yecla and that 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.480
 has already been in the market for 16 seasons and 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.210
 year after year innovating and how could I 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.790
 to be otherwise the brand is cut line 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.420
 the pepe brand of the bouquet and specifically 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.300
 let's have two helmets the model 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.449
 compact the two the compact model but 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.640
 one that almost ten seasons ago because 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.089
 this helmet has been in ten seasons 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.940
 the market and let's see how the 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.499
 evolution to this one of mono exchange that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.100
 you know that it gives us a lot of cane during 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:08.960
 a few seasons 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:12.950
 and for 2013 an evolution of 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:16.610
 this mythical helmet already catlike but 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.840
 applying innovations and 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.940
 technology and materials for 2013 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.850
 When a brand is good and does things 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.520
 like this helmet the compact produces it 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.299
 one in such a way that it reaches the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.600
 2013 model with some materials 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.030
 comfort, ergonomics of the 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.610
 big trademark 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.960
 plan incorporated for 2013 something that 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.140
 for what we have clear front 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.690
 let's say it like this an anti-network 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.100
 insect mosquitoes that good there 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.240
 they're going to stop a few especially 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.369
 when we go down at great speed 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.770
 and then the back then in this 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.110
 case the back supports have been 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.619
 modified now rests on two 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.909
 points of the occipital bone of this 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.530
 way will you release the whole part 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.099
 central to the head of any 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.890
 pressure giving you much more comfort 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:13.110
 in this way it moves so 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.920
 horizontal and you can customize the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.190
 position to optimize comfort 21 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.489
 large bulky air intakes that what 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.420
 they make really very very comfortable already 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.420
 ventilates while ble 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.480
 the east system of rattle the wild 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.030
 detection system they name in cat 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.510
 light in this way the system can 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.600
 regulate horizontally giving it 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.920
 much more comfort 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.400
 have improved in this case the chips 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.200
 they are finite before in something else 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.630
 thick now they will provide us 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.040
 greater comfort 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.620
 especially when they rub against our 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.620
 face and breathability 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.290
 on the chin part at the time of 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.950
 close the helmet we have here 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.790
 this protection that will generate us is 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.610
 as a comfort 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.810
 the pads inside 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.760
 with a very well designed design every 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.980
 invest a lot in research and 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.770
 development and in this case the pad 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.090
 it will not stop being an element that 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.280
 I have escaped to this department 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.490
 providing comfort at the same time 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.500
 breathability 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.850
 structures people carcasses 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.310
 they have been improving year after year even 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.190
 have welcomed what is technology of the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.170
 aerospace industry and this has been 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.840
 translated into what we are giving 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.570
 we the cyclists we left 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.220
 day by day with the mountain bike or with 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.950
 the road bike we 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.230
 we benefit from all this technology and 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.430
 that gives us a very large 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.040
 security 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.709
 something that has improved a lot throughout 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.739
 the years since compact is the visor 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.049
 is still 'take off and put' and in this 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.079
 case will you provide us because when 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.120
 it rains especially as well slide the 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.090
 water and do not directly enter the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.090
 eyes and apart when we go down for 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.660
 areas of tree branches as we have 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.300
 that extra protection that gives us the 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.289
 visor is much firmer than in 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.289
 previous editions 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.099
 and it is perfectly adjusted I do not know about 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.349
 those visors that are often low but 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:44.310
 a branch pum and goes anywhere 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:46.530
 not in caldas make a product that the 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.740
 visor is where it has to be subject 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.530
 and well firm 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.350
 Well the only thing I can say that this 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.830
 helmet 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:00.639
 has owner is called josema source and what 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:02.979
 is going to study this same noon 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.969
 thanks everything that really 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.680
 makes a product be little makes us 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:12.460
 feel proud of having a brand 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.669
 very ours and how not to encourage them all 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.680
 you that if there is a helmet that 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.099
 differentiate when we see from afar 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.409
 that is cut line josema source and we 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.409
 we see in a next market day
