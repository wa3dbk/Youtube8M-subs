my sewing machine which doesn't fit on

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.020 
my sewing machine which doesn't fit on
but<00:03:20.470> um<00:03:20.680> just<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.250> give<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.430> an<00:03:21.520> idea<00:03:21.610> what<00:03:21.910> it

will look like okay so this is the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.310 
will look like okay so this is the
inside<00:03:24.010> piece<00:03:24.310> all<00:03:24.550> put<00:03:24.790> together<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.390> what

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
inside piece all put together and what

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.540 
inside piece all put together and what
I'm<00:03:26.440> going<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.620> do<00:03:26.800> is<00:03:26.950> I'm<00:03:27.100> actually<00:03:27.130> going<00:03:27.490> to

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.730 
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
turn<00:03:27.730> this<00:03:27.910> um<00:03:28.980> right<00:03:29.980> sides<00:03:30.220> in<00:03:30.490> now<00:03:31.740> keep

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
turn this um right sides in now keep

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.810 
turn this um right sides in now keep
this<00:03:32.950> right<00:03:33.220> sides<00:03:33.490> out<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.920> I'm<00:03:36.580> going<00:03:36.730> to

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
this right sides out and I'm going to

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.350 
this right sides out and I'm going to
tuck<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.950> inside<00:03:39.280> piece<00:03:39.550> into<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.000> outside

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
tuck the inside piece into the outside

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:52.050 
tuck the inside piece into the outside
piece<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:51.040> always<00:03:51.190> seems<00:03:51.640> like<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:51.850> good

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
piece so it always seems like a good

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.050 
piece so it always seems like a good
idea<00:03:52.120> it's<00:03:52.600> really<00:03:52.840> hard<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.790> I'm<00:03:54.880> going<00:03:55.030> to

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
idea it's really hard to so I'm going to

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.510 
idea it's really hard to so I'm going to
tuck<00:03:55.270> this<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:56.080> I'm<00:03:56.140> gonna<00:03:56.260> pin<00:03:56.620> them

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
tuck this in and I'm gonna pin them

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.040 
tuck this in and I'm gonna pin them
together<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.180> they're<00:03:58.330> right<00:03:58.510> sides<00:03:58.810> together

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
together so they're right sides together

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.490 
together so they're right sides together
and<00:04:01.709> here<00:04:02.709> let<00:04:02.980> me<00:04:03.010> do<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.459> this<00:04:03.880> time<00:04:04.500> okay

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
and here let me do that this time okay

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.350 
and here let me do that this time okay
so<00:04:05.560> here<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.040> is<00:04:06.160> right<00:04:06.190> sides<00:04:06.640> together<00:04:06.820> I

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
so here it is right sides together I

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.790 
so here it is right sides together I
pinned<00:04:07.959> it<00:04:08.050> only<00:04:08.200> at<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.440> corners<00:04:08.709> just

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
pinned it only at the corners just

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.949 
pinned it only at the corners just
because<00:04:09.220> I'm<00:04:09.459> lazy<00:04:09.730> but<00:04:09.940> if<00:04:10.510> you<00:04:10.660> want<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.900> be

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
really careful you could pin all along
