00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.280 
lot of players from calling you should
you<00:01:38.759> should<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.299> should<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.750> adjust<00:01:40.170> your

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you should you should really adjust your

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.830 
you should you should really adjust your
raise<00:01:40.470> sizes<00:01:40.979> i<00:01:41.100> think<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:42.299> every<00:01:42.540> particular

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
raise sizes i think for every particular

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.440 
raise sizes i think for every particular
game<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.829> there's<00:01:44.180> let's<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.360> say

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
game you know if there's let's just say

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.940 
game you know if there's let's just say
for<00:01:45.479> example<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.170> two<00:01:46.409> aces<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
for example you have two aces and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.160 
for example you have two aces and
there's<00:01:47.100> there's<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.579> guy<00:01:47.759> behind<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.360> who's

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
there's there's a guy behind you who's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.690 
there's there's a guy behind you who's
going<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.380> call<00:01:49.590> any<00:01:49.829> amount<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> raise

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
going to call any amount that you raise

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460 
going to call any amount that you raise
which<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.090> hypothetical<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.320> know<00:01:52.409> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
which is hypothetical you know you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.260 
which is hypothetical you know you
should<00:01:52.710> raise<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.040> ten<00:01:53.250> times<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.700> big<00:01:53.850> line<00:01:54.060> or

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
should raise to ten times a big line or

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.850 
should raise to ten times a big line or
15<00:01:54.600> times<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.930> big<00:01:55.079> line<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.439> doesn't<00:01:55.560> matter

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
15 times a big line it doesn't matter

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.190 
15 times a big line it doesn't matter
and<00:01:56.159> then<00:01:56.310> there's<00:01:56.490> other<00:01:56.670> games<00:01:56.909> where<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
and then there's other games where you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.050 
and then there's other games where you
know<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> opposite<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.030> really

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
know it's the opposite so so it really

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.880 
know it's the opposite so so it really
it<00:02:00.450> really<00:02:00.479> depends<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> lineup<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it really depends on the lineup and that

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.080 
it really depends on the lineup and that
that's<00:02:02.070> why<00:02:02.250> I'm<00:02:02.310> making<00:02:02.430> reads<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.939> so

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
that's why I'm making reads is so

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.020 
that's why I'm making reads is so
important<00:02:03.500> okay<00:02:04.500> well<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.490> other<00:02:05.610> question

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
important okay well the other question

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.660 
important okay well the other question
is<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.540> know<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:07.259> you're<00:02:07.530> playing<00:02:07.770> better

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
is you know when you're playing better

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.219 
is you know when you're playing better
players<00:02:08.940> usually<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.509> well<00:02:09.690> with<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> bigger

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
players usually do well with a bigger

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.410 
players usually do well with a bigger
stack<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.830> pot<00:02:11.009> size<00:02:11.250> ratio<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.030> seems<00:02:12.239> like

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
stack to pot size ratio so it seems like

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.380 
stack to pot size ratio so it seems like
you<00:02:12.450> might<00:02:12.690> want<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.050> key

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
you might want to key

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.320 
you might want to key
that<00:02:13.840> bigger<00:02:14.200> preflop<00:02:15.130> or<00:02:15.400> would<00:02:16.210> you<00:02:16.300> rather

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
that bigger preflop or would you rather

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.210 
that bigger preflop or would you rather
just<00:02:16.569> get<00:02:16.900> in<00:02:17.050> more<00:02:17.260> money<00:02:17.410> preflop<00:02:17.800> with<00:02:18.040> good

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
just get in more money preflop with good

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.160 
just get in more money preflop with good
hands<00:02:18.459> if<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:18.910> people<00:02:19.180> are<00:02:19.360> it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
hands if you know that people are it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.840 
hands if you know that people are it
depends<00:02:20.740> there<00:02:20.860> are<00:02:21.160> certain<00:02:21.430> hands<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.819> are

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
depends there are certain hands that are

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.370 
depends there are certain hands that are
better<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.240> narrow<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.690> field<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.350> know

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
better to narrow the field you know

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.500 
better to narrow the field you know
hounds<00:02:23.740> like<00:02:23.830> Jax<00:02:24.220> or<00:02:24.459> Queens<00:02:24.760> play<00:02:25.300> better

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
hounds like Jax or Queens play better

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.030 
hounds like Jax or Queens play better
against<00:02:25.810> one<00:02:26.020> opponent<00:02:26.290> where<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.680> have<00:02:26.830> like

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
against one opponent where I have like

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.790 
against one opponent where I have like
six<00:02:28.030> eight<00:02:28.209> of<00:02:28.330> hearts<00:02:28.720> or<00:02:28.990> five<00:02:29.350> seven<00:02:29.709> of

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
six eight of hearts or five seven of

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.990 
six eight of hearts or five seven of
Spades<00:02:30.040> those<00:02:30.250> hands<00:02:30.550> play<00:02:30.700> pretty<00:02:30.910> well

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
Spades those hands play pretty well

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.090 
Spades those hands play pretty well
multi-way<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.900> heads<00:02:32.170> up<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.560> mean<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:33.010> know

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
multi-way and heads up I mean you know

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.410 
multi-way and heads up I mean you know
those<00:02:33.280> hands<00:02:33.520> just<00:02:33.700> play<00:02:33.910> well<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.150> general

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
those hands just play well in general

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.020 
those hands just play well in general
but<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:35.050> think<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.890> really<00:02:36.280> depends<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
but I think it really depends on the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.030 
but I think it really depends on the
situation<00:02:37.209> it's<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.560> know<00:02:38.680> for<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.980> most

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
situation it's but you know for the most

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.770 
situation it's but you know for the most
part<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.520> do<00:02:39.670> want<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.970> adjust<00:02:40.060> your<00:02:40.390> raises

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780
