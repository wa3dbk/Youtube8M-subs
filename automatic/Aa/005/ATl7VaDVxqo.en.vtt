drop right for the saplings

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.490 
drop right for the saplings
and<00:00:38.520> once<00:00:39.360> you've<00:00:39.540> got<00:00:39.750> these<00:00:39.899> trees<00:00:40.110> planted

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and once you've got these trees planted

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.619 
and once you've got these trees planted
near<00:00:40.710> your<00:00:40.860> base<00:00:41.040> knock<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:41.879> all<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> ones

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
near your base knock out all of the ones

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.709 
near your base knock out all of the ones
that<00:00:42.750> don't<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.520> resin<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.390> them<00:00:45.539> leave

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
that don't have the resin on them leave

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.880 
that don't have the resin on them leave
the<00:00:45.870> ones<00:00:46.020> with<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.230> resin<00:00:46.530> because<00:00:46.739> they

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the ones with the resin because they

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.200 
the ones with the resin because they
will<00:00:47.070> eventually<00:00:47.250> respawn<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.059> can

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
will eventually respawn it you can

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.840 
will eventually respawn it you can
collect<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:49.219> next<00:00:50.219> thing<00:00:50.370> we're<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
collect more next thing we're going to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.250 
collect more next thing we're going to
need<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.149> make<00:00:51.270> some<00:00:51.510> rubber<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.079> so

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
need to make some rubber with it so

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.840 
need to make some rubber with it so
stick<00:00:52.530> some<00:00:52.739> sticky<00:00:53.010> resin<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.489> furnace

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
stick some sticky resin in your furnace

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.369 
stick some sticky resin in your furnace
try<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> be<00:00:54.420> stamp<00:00:54.660> sparing<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.230> this

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
try to be stamp sparing with this

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.720 
try to be stamp sparing with this
because<00:00:55.559> once<00:00:55.800> you've<00:00:55.890> got<00:00:56.039> an<00:00:56.129> extractor<00:00:56.579> you

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
because once you've got an extractor you

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.880 
because once you've got an extractor you
can<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.059> better<00:00:57.469> but<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.649> stick<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.859> in

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
can do this better but just stick it in

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.020 
can do this better but just stick it in
the<00:00:58.980> furnace<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.370> get<00:00:59.460> yourself<00:00:59.730> some<00:00:59.850> rubber

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the furnace and get yourself some rubber

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.580 
the furnace and get yourself some rubber
next<00:01:00.989> we're<00:01:01.109> also<00:01:01.199> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> need<00:01:01.530> some

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
next we're also going to need some

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.389 
next we're also going to need some
refined<00:01:02.010> iron

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
refined iron

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.160 
refined iron
regular<00:01:02.850> iron<00:01:03.090> ingots<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> furnace<00:01:03.960> gets

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
regular iron ingots in the furnace gets

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.950 
regular iron ingots in the furnace gets
you<00:01:04.350> refined<00:01:05.010> iron<00:01:05.369> we've<00:01:05.820> got<00:01:06.030> tin<00:01:06.450> ore<00:01:06.689> which

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you refined iron we've got tin ore which

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.149 
you refined iron we've got tin ore which
looks<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.530> you're<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.920> refine

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
looks like this you're going to refine

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.280 
looks like this you're going to refine
up<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.970> copper<00:01:09.750> ore<00:01:09.900> looks

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
up some of that and copper ore looks

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.960 
up some of that and copper ore looks
like<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.799> you're<00:01:11.040> also<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.460> refine<00:01:11.790> up

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
like so you're also going to refine up

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.070 
like so you're also going to refine up
some<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.450> make<00:01:12.540> some<00:01:12.570> ingots<00:01:12.930> with

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
some of that and make some ingots with

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.780 
some of that and make some ingots with
it<00:01:13.200> now<00:01:13.530> remember<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> copper<00:01:14.430> ore<00:01:14.580> can

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it now remember that the copper ore can

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700 
it now remember that the copper ore can
be<00:01:14.909> found<00:01:15.150> relatively<00:01:15.900> near<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.200> surface<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
be found relatively near the surface and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.249 
be found relatively near the surface and
the<00:01:17.009> tin<00:01:17.280> ore<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.759> found<00:01:18.060> kind<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.509> midway<00:01:18.960> down

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the tin ore is found kind of midway down

eu<00:03:59.430> the<00:04:00.239> generator<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.140> think<00:04:01.470> it's<00:04:01.560> storage<00:04:01.829> is

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
eu the generator I think it's storage is

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.350 
eu the generator I think it's storage is
something<00:04:02.190> like<00:04:02.310> 8000<00:04:02.880> it's<00:04:02.970> really<00:04:03.180> not<00:04:03.299> all

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
something like 8000 it's really not all

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.330 
something like 8000 it's really not all
that<00:04:03.480> great<00:04:03.780> but<00:04:04.049> it'll<00:04:04.530> store<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.829> power<00:04:04.950> and

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
that great but it'll store the power and

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.009 
that great but it'll store the power and
can<00:04:05.549> transmit<00:04:05.850> it<00:04:06.000> at<00:04:06.180> any<00:04:06.390> time<00:04:06.480> its

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
you cannot pick these back up so be sure

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.270 
you cannot pick these back up so be sure
about<00:04:24.660> their<00:04:24.840> placement<00:04:25.320> before<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:26.070> put

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
about their placement before you put

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.020 
about their placement before you put
them<00:04:26.430> down

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
them down

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.870 
them down
I'd<00:04:27.510> like<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:27.960> start<00:04:28.200> with<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:29.070> battery<00:04:29.490> box

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
I'd like to start with the battery box

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.580 
I'd like to start with the battery box
because<00:04:30.390> this<00:04:30.540> is<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.810> one<00:04:30.930> that's<00:04:31.110> very<00:04:31.170> very

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
because this is the one that's very very

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.970 
because this is the one that's very very
dependent<00:04:32.550> upon<00:04:32.850> its<00:04:33.270> direction<00:04:33.570> so<00:04:34.380> I'm

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
dependent upon its direction so I'm

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.220 
dependent upon its direction so I'm
going<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.370> be<00:04:35.580> facing<00:04:35.790> here<00:04:36.390> I'm<00:04:36.570> going<00:04:37.170> to

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
going to be facing here I'm going to

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.180 
going to be facing here I'm going to
make<00:04:37.350> sure<00:04:37.440> I've<00:04:37.530> got<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.680> really<00:04:37.860> good<00:04:38.010> angle

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
make sure I've got a really good angle

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.400 
make sure I've got a really good angle
and<00:04:38.580> put<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.330> down<00:04:39.480> and<00:04:39.780> there<00:04:39.990> we<00:04:40.110> go<00:04:40.200> now

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
and put it down and there we go now

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.930 
and put it down and there we go now
you'll<00:04:40.530> notice<00:04:40.770> how<00:04:40.890> this<00:04:41.010> one<00:04:41.220> side<00:04:41.490> has<00:04:41.760> the

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
you'll notice how this one side has the

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.970 
you'll notice how this one side has the
single<00:04:42.210> little<00:04:42.540> copper<00:04:42.870> dot<00:04:43.110> on<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:43.740> is

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
single little copper dot on it that is

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.940 
single little copper dot on it that is
the<00:04:44.010> output<00:04:44.400> any<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.900> other<00:04:46.110> five<00:04:46.530> sides

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
the output any of the other five sides

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.560 
the output any of the other five sides
including<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.850> one<00:04:47.970> on<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.150> bottom<00:04:48.270> our

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
including the one on the bottom our

the<00:04:51.450> generator<00:04:51.900> right<00:04:52.380> here<00:04:52.740> then<00:04:53.640> we'll<00:04:53.820> add

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
the generator right here then we'll add

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.850 
the generator right here then we'll add
a<00:04:53.940> couple<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.450> copper<00:04:54.780> cables<00:04:55.170> to<00:04:55.350> the<00:04:55.440> output

our<00:04:59.700> extractor<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.450> top<00:05:00.780> I'll<00:05:01.230> put<00:05:01.410> the

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
our extractor on top I'll put the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.860 
our extractor on top I'll put the
macerator<00:05:02.250> down<00:05:02.550> here<00:05:02.790> on<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.000> bottom<00:05:03.180> and

macerator down here on the bottom and
now<00:05:04.290> if<00:05:04.440> we<00:05:04.560> put<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.770> little<00:05:04.830> bit<00:05:05.010> of<00:05:05.130> power<00:05:05.340> into

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
now if we put a little bit of power into

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.500 
now if we put a little bit of power into
the<00:05:05.700> generator

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
the generator

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.010

we'll<00:05:06.990> get<00:05:08.360> nice<00:05:09.360> little<00:05:09.510> humming<00:05:09.870> noise

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
we'll get nice little humming noise

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.960 
we'll get nice little humming noise
tells<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:10.500> it's<00:05:10.620> working<00:05:10.890> and<00:05:10.980> it<00:05:11.670> starts<00:05:11.910> to

tells you it's working and it starts to

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.730 
tells you it's working and it starts to
generate<00:05:12.150> power<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.960> you'll<00:05:13.320> notice<00:05:13.620> how

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
generate power and you'll notice how

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.710 
generate power and you'll notice how
your<00:05:13.860> machines<00:05:14.190> begin<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.670> fill<00:05:14.910> up<00:05:15.120> and<00:05:15.390> as

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
your machines begin to fill up and as

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.360 
your machines begin to fill up and as
soon<00:05:15.750> as<00:05:15.960> they're<00:05:16.140> both<00:05:16.290> full<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.890> bat<00:05:17.070> box

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
soon as they're both full the bat box

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.550 
soon as they're both full the bat box
will<00:05:17.640> then<00:05:17.670> begin<00:05:18.060> to<00:05:18.180> charge<00:05:18.450> as<00:05:18.630> well<00:05:18.870> now

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
will then begin to charge as well now

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.560 
will then begin to charge as well now
once<00:05:19.950> the<00:05:20.130> bat<00:05:20.280> box<00:05:20.550> reaches<00:05:20.940> its<00:05:21.060> full<00:05:21.240> charge

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
once the bat box reaches its full charge

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.870 
once the bat box reaches its full charge
your<00:05:21.780> generator<00:05:22.200> will<00:05:22.410> also<00:05:22.740> begin<00:05:22.950> to<00:05:23.160> fill

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
your generator will also begin to fill

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.270 
your generator will also begin to fill
up<00:05:24.030> so<00:05:24.690> I<00:05:24.720> usually<00:05:25.110> recommend<00:05:25.440> only<00:05:25.920> putting

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
up so I usually recommend only putting

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.730 
up so I usually recommend only putting
in<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.550> few<00:05:26.730> pieces<00:05:27.000> at<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.330> time<00:05:27.420> I<00:05:27.930> usually<00:05:28.320> find

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
in a few pieces at a time I usually find

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.310 
in a few pieces at a time I usually find
eight<00:05:29.040> from<00:05:29.880> a<00:05:29.940> completely<00:05:30.300> empty<00:05:30.420> level<00:05:31.170> is

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
eight from a completely empty level is

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.020 
eight from a completely empty level is
just<00:05:31.770> about<00:05:31.980> right<00:05:32.250> it<00:05:32.490> won't<00:05:32.610> fill<00:05:32.880> it<00:05:33.000> up

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
just about right it won't fill it up

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.490 
just about right it won't fill it up
completely<00:05:33.540> but<00:05:33.840> it'll<00:05:34.050> get<00:05:34.170> you<00:05:34.290> pretty

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
completely but it'll get you pretty

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.180 
completely but it'll get you pretty
close<00:05:35.180> and<00:05:36.350> there<00:05:37.350> you<00:05:37.440> go<00:05:37.590> those<00:05:37.800> are<00:05:37.980> first

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
close and there you go those are first
