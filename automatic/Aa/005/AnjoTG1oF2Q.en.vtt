00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
really long time to dry the texture

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
with two coats another thing I wanted to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.540 
with two coats another thing I wanted to
say<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.659> days<00:01:09.930> went<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.979> texture

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
say was as the days went on the texture

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.359 
say was as the days went on the texture
kind<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.880> wore<00:01:12.149> down<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> started<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.070> feel

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
kind of wore down and it started to feel

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.520 
kind of wore down and it started to feel
like<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.550> normal<00:01:14.700> nail<00:01:15.240> polish<00:01:15.690> rather<00:01:16.290> than

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
like a normal nail polish rather than

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.830 
like a normal nail polish rather than
and<00:01:17.090> textured<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:20.390> checked<00:01:21.390> how<00:01:21.540> long<00:01:21.690> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
and textured one I checked how long it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.780 
and textured one I checked how long it
would<00:01:21.930> last<00:01:21.960> by<00:01:22.680> taking<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.130> picture<00:01:23.280> every<00:01:23.640> day

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
would last by taking a picture every day

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.960 
would last by taking a picture every day
to<00:01:23.850> see<00:01:24.410> when<00:01:25.410> it<00:01:25.560> started<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> chip<00:01:26.280> in

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
to see when it started to chip in

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
to see when it started to chip in
reality<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> did<00:01:28.229> thought<00:01:28.470> Jim<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.979> second

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
reality it did thought Jim the second

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
reality it did thought Jim the second
day<00:01:29.429> but<00:01:29.640> I'd<00:01:29.789> say<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.119> was<00:01:30.240> more<00:01:30.300> noticeable

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
day but I'd say it was more noticeable

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.639 
day but I'd say it was more noticeable
from<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.800> third<00:01:32.070> day<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.520> onwards<00:01:33.649> which

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
from the third day and onwards which

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.950 
from the third day and onwards which
isn't<00:01:34.979> too<00:01:35.880> good<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.300> it<00:01:36.420> isn't<00:01:36.630> too<00:01:36.750> bad

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
isn't too good but it isn't too bad

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.149 
isn't too good but it isn't too bad
