00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello to all and that's the dr provides 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.130
 today I have the pleasure of you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.259
 do an unpacking so a boxing man 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.300
 from the last phone or rico the week to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.440
 axes and that's very important why 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.090
 simply because know that he 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.590
 there is still barely an hour I was in 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.540
 the northern leagues the locals by our 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.220
 please use nvidia for the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.660
 presentation of this yes kovacs why 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.039
 nvidia simply because 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.470
 look good in the corner of the box 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.090
 here's powered by nvidia tell each other everything 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 simply that the processor is a 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.220
 tegra kadri what you need to know is 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.599
 that this wimax smartphone is the first 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.079
 smartphone available in europe 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.180
 equipped with this tegra 4 i processor which 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.739
 normally at the graphic level should 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.879
 send pony then we will already do 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.719
 a little trick of the box in you of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.950
 make a complete unpacking and well 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.020
 heard you will know a lot a lot 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.059
 a lot more especially on nvidia and 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.160
 on this phone during the full test 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.660
 so let's look at the box already a visual 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.289
 very very very different from what can 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.469
 propose us 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.969
 yes that usually so here is a 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.010
 a little bit flatter a little bit more 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.809
 wide all had it done that a finish 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.410
 I find quite a visual really 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.059
 nice 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.559
 we will stop there we will see everything from 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.920
 Following what has marked on this 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.000
 box 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.739
 so when we go back what is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.920
 we have we have some spectra 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.330
 of this phone so we already know they 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.799
 are called wax that we are on a 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.350
 4.7 inch screen a hd ready screen 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.700
 since it's 720p at the level of 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.619
 camera and at the level of peace we 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.030
 have 8 million pixels for the peÃ±a 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.549
 there were 5 million pixels for the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.950
 hardly before we are on 4 gigas 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.220
 of internal memory it's not huge with 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.200
 a gig of ram that fortunately there is 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.210
 a microsd extension called accepting 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.299
 32 gigabits extra that we 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.829
 are on an android and 4.3 g the ebit 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.689
 no is not yet on the 4 points 4 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.950
 but it will come 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.540
 know that when presenting this 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.250
 phone speaking especially with 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.229
 wilco and with the nvidia managers 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.700
 they told us that in the months to 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.659
 come to the years around two months can 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.960
 to be a little bit more 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.610
 there should be an update 4.4 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.170
 so kat kit something really 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.630
 friendly so for tracking it's 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.640
 nickel and that the look at this logo that 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.909
 waited all we are finally on the 4g 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.979
 and the famous logo nvidia nvidia sli de 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.939
 nvidia well known gamers 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.619
 of course when I do not do you 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.890
 wear longer since we are going to a 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.830
 box and immediately 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:17.319
 this phone as usual uses 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:22.630
 to dexter faithful companion to do his 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.700
 own hand and you admit that I am 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.160
 just as impatient of you to see a 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.280
 little what does the inside of the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.540
 box and bundle so something 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.220
 really very very cool of what so 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.630
 I tell you there is still hardly a 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.700
 hour I was in the premises of nvidia 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.550
 for the official presentation of this we 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.489
 come back 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.870
 so here is the veil a very light 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.450
 so take a great impression 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:56.080
 light to awesome one makes everyone 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.340
 is happy and here I like 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.160
 hung up on someone's nose but that's 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.950
 not serious then look at the visual 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.290
 from this phone something rather 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.610
 rather classic we will say about 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.850
 to what we can usually see in 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.500
 ricoh so here are critical nsts that do not 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.720
 do not jump directly to the eyes we say 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.500
 not like it's a phone 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.630
 extraordinary from a point of view of a 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.590
 visual visually for hec 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.840
 pray games that we do not ski 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.709
 battery still inside excuse me 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.320
 for this little fact she still 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.100
 and so here is once removed the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.329
 plastic looks like this so that 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.470
 with a 10 and a little bit different from 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:31.750
 what we can see usually see with 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.040
 a little border here future in packets 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.130
 in 40 not bad really they are not going 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.570
 badly so listen I put on the sides 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.829
 and send us right away what's there 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:44.700
 inside the box so the bundle 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.780
 the battery obviously here it is 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.680
 today a little bit the phone 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.130
 but that's normal 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.510
 the little classic documentation 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.579
 obviously we find in all 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:01.850
 we qu both aspect level 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:04.250
 identical at the practical level 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.730
 there as uncle usb charger 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.820
 obviously and I imagine a priori there 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.640
 in there are headphones and that's 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.350
 well that's great adapters 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.290
 and that's a very, very good 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:22.520
 thing the the classic earphones one 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.410
 found the same elsewhere in all 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.520
 waste every week at the si 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.820
 you look well what they know 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.350
 are used with a kind cable did 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.010
 something quite appreciable 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.640
 visual level 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.780
 of course we will also hate 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.050
 USB cable 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.140
 course chain then listen here 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.730
 for unpacking swico wiko axis 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.640
 so I call you back with a 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.410
 processor nvidia tegra 4 ri so who 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.420
 normally at the level of games at the level 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.610
 graph front sent from the pony but that 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.530
 we'll see of course during the test 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.700
 complete which I recall the price of this 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.960
 phone on Thursday with an nvidia 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.890
 inside it will cost the skin of 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.030
 buttocks to the really very very listened 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.730
 expensive and actually 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.800
 finally I'm like a little bit since 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.960
 199 euros here for a phone like 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.410
 that with nvidia inside and the 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.880
 4g 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.430
 here I think that at the level 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.810
 price positioning this weekend with axes 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.730
 rather not bad now we'll see in 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.530
 the more in-depth tests if it's worth 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.910
 actually blow or no I leave you 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.190
 do another last little tour of 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.290
 owner before putting the phone 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.430
 and I tell you very, very very 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.730
 soon for the full test 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.730
 Hi
