there's two options in the Yamaha
student<00:00:16.500> range<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.859> saxophones<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.580> lot<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
student range of saxophones a lot of

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.179 
student range of saxophones a lot of
attention<00:00:18.570> has<00:00:18.660> been<00:00:18.720> paid<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.289> both<00:00:19.770> models

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
attention has been paid to both models

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.980 
attention has been paid to both models
in<00:00:20.340> terms<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.670> their<00:00:20.820> ergonomic<00:00:20.970> s'<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
in terms of their ergonomic s' the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.689 
in terms of their ergonomic s' the
saxophone<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.070> obviously<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> little<00:00:23.580> bit

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
saxophone is obviously a little bit

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.609 
saxophone is obviously a little bit
heavier<00:00:24.060> than<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.689> flute<00:00:24.930> or<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> clarinet

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
heavier than the flute or the clarinet

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.990 
heavier than the flute or the clarinet
so<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.189> really<00:00:26.340> important<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.849> they're

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
so it's really important that they're

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.790 
so it's really important that they're
comfortable<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.599> hold<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.140> therefore<00:00:28.529> easy
