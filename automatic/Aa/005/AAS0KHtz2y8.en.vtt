00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
that I think it was I think it was so it

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.210 
that I think it was I think it was so it
slowed<00:03:22.080> down

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220

might be a challenge wouldn't it because

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:39.640 
might be a challenge wouldn't it because
you<00:03:38.359> get<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:38.689> used<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.079> your<00:03:39.230> muscle<00:03:39.530> memory

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
yeah playing in a certain speed you

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.539 
yeah playing in a certain speed you
actually<00:03:42.650> have<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.859> kind<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.099> relearn<00:03:43.370> it

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549

alright here's my theory on this part if

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.149

you're<00:04:28.729> good<00:04:29.000> enough<00:04:29.030> to<00:04:29.360> play<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:30.159> you're

you're good enough to play that you're

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
probably good enough not to have to

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.450 
probably good enough not to have to
learn<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.169> off<00:04:33.430> this<00:04:35.470> yeah<00:04:36.470> I<00:04:36.710> mean<00:04:37.069> really

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
learn it off this yeah I mean really

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.640 
learn it off this yeah I mean really
it's<00:04:38.000> it's<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:38.780> look<00:04:38.960> really<00:04:39.229> hard<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.560> me

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
it's kind of complicated but it's also

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.320

not<00:04:42.080> that<00:04:42.139> complicated<00:04:42.710> just<00:04:43.159> do<00:04:43.909> it<00:04:44.090> kind<00:04:44.270> of

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
not that complicated just do it kind of

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.249 
not that complicated just do it kind of
how<00:04:44.419> do<00:04:44.479> you<00:04:44.509> do<00:04:44.659> it<00:04:44.690> it's<00:04:44.990> like<00:04:45.080> a<00:04:45.169> little

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
how do you do it it's like a little

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550
