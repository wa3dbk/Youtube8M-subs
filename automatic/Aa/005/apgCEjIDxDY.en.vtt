 yt 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.720
 hi everyone I 'm a stopped jet 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.970
 Welcome to another message chapter 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.220
 direct where we tell you what happened 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.559
 this week on twitter I do not know if 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.059
 you have taken the icfes but if 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.350
 are those who presented today or are 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.960
 to present in the very near future 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.680
 You will already know in the terrible news that 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.680
 now they will have 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.490
 and james 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.230
 that's not happy with how difficult it is 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.670
 it was the exam itself because now 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.560
 He gave them a round of questions 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.210
 rehearsal type and those that will touch talk 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.530
 more shit than school bathroom but for 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.660
 all those who feel that they are not 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.890
 prepared for the relaxed icfes that 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.120
 here in direct message we get up 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.900
 some of the questions that are going to 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.900
 appear on the exam 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.729
 good and now that this exam is more 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.979
 difficult that never tells that it is more 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.299
 difficult that weeks we write on twitter 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.470
 or in the comments of this video and 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:32.880
 we will show the best answers 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:34.950
 pity us that a number of which had 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.570
 a lot of water this week was more and it's not 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.070
 pekerman referring to the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.930
 possible departure of the technical director of 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.570
 Colombia selection in that sense not 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.370
 I hope 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.630
 if already small do not base on the selection 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.840
 Colombia are not receiving sheets of 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.840
 lifetime 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.220
 guarded teacher that is what is going to 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.320
 distinguish your process as a director 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.100
 technique in principle the good treatment to the 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.290
 ball 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.409
 do not kick the so hard let's say with 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.560
 honey and then handle the times this 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.300
 the present the past them with perfect and 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.850
 obviously yes we do have the opportunity 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.600
 of the future summon as for Leonel 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.400
 Messi to Cristiano Ronaldo released but 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.000
 sorry teacher is that those players do not 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.000
 They are Colombians 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.290
 the balls that matter good 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.650

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.650

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.860
 we preach again that it is the 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.730
 out of the game but the captors 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.730
 I do not understand the rest 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.170
 ready guys for gorgeous 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.010
 were we going to the showers 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.330
 arias are going to come to the office like this 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.330
 Do not wear your shirt 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.620
 well it's good I do not know anything about soccer 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.620
 but that did not stop Carlos Antonio Vélez 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.489
 of course we can not stay without 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.870

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.579
 direct that was carried out in the new 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.230
 urban station headquarters for those who 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.060
 they attended they will know that we passed it bacán and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.530
 maximum and that contribution did not supply wine 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.939

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.530

 they were because they do not live in Bogota and 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.989
