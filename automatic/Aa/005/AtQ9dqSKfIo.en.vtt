if<00:00:00.949> you<00:00:02.030> can't<00:00:03.030> get<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.449> shader<00:00:03.750> much<00:00:04.020> working

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
if you can't get the shader much working

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
showed you it goes to the path and

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.480 
showed you it goes to the path and
starts<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.450> control<00:01:27.450> panel<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.369> when<00:01:29.369> you

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
starts the control panel and when you

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.240 
starts the control panel and when you
finally<00:01:29.790> make<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.200> click<00:01:31.380> 3d

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
finally make it here you click 3d

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.330 
finally make it here you click 3d
settings<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:34.490> here<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:36.780> will<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:38.100> add

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
settings and here you will have to add

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
settings and here you will have to add
Java<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.920> set<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.670> use<00:01:41.930> Nevada<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.290> not

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
Java and set it to use Nevada and not

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.020 
Java and set it to use Nevada and not
the<00:01:43.979> Intel<00:01:44.729> card<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.920> why<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:46.979> works<00:01:47.670> is

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
the Intel card and why this works is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.460 
the Intel card and why this works is
because<00:01:48.560> Nevada<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> stronger<00:01:50.990> card<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
because Nevada is a stronger card to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.490 
because Nevada is a stronger card to
render<00:01:52.829> Minecraft<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.790> minecraft<00:01:54.570> normally

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
render Minecraft and minecraft normally

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.410 
render Minecraft and minecraft normally
starts<00:01:56.399> with<00:01:57.329> Intel<00:01:58.939> and<00:02:01.009> because<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.490> it

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
starts with Intel and because of that it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.240 
starts with Intel and because of that it
doesn't<00:02:03.869> work<00:02:04.020> because<00:02:04.229> Intel<00:02:04.770> doesn't<00:02:05.130> have

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
doesn't work because Intel doesn't have

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.330 
doesn't work because Intel doesn't have
enough<00:02:05.520> power<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.680> wait<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> show<00:02:08.129> you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
enough power and wait I show you

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.690 
enough power and wait I show you
so<00:02:08.910> without<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.690> Java<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.440> should

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
so without the Java it should

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:22.080 
so without the Java it should
let's<00:02:13.700> wait<00:02:13.939> a<00:02:13.969> bit<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:18.140> should<00:02:18.650> say<00:02:19.069> that

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.449 

where<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:25.810> own<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:27.319> well<00:02:27.530> now<00:02:27.829> it's<00:02:28.069> using

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
where is it own it well now it's using

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.140 
where is it own it well now it's using
the<00:02:28.579> g-force<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.599> will<00:02:29.780> work<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:31.849> show

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
the g-force and it will work you show

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:42.420 
the g-force and it will work you show
you<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:36.530> should<00:02:37.280> work<00:02:37.519> now<00:02:38.439> yeah<00:02:39.439> it<00:02:39.920> works<00:02:40.480> but

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
you it should work now yeah it works but

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.050 
you it should work now yeah it works but
if<00:02:44.769> we<00:02:45.769> don't<00:02:46.010> have<00:02:46.220> Java<00:02:46.549> edit<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:48.639> will<00:02:49.639> crash

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
if we don't have Java edit it will crash

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:58.569 
if we don't have Java edit it will crash
you<00:02:50.810> will<00:02:50.989> see<00:02:51.230> soon<00:02:52.269> okay<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.560> when<00:02:58.400> we

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
you will see soon okay so and when we

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:05.699 
you will see soon okay so and when we
don't<00:02:58.790> have<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.389> Nvidia<00:02:59.810> card<00:03:00.079> selected<00:03:02.439> here

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.740 

it's<00:03:06.709> now<00:03:07.099> using<00:03:08.230> what's<00:03:09.230> loading<00:03:10.419> it's<00:03:11.419> now

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
it's now using what's loading it's now

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.050 
it's now using what's loading it's now
using<00:03:12.349> the<00:03:12.609> Intel<00:03:13.609> HD<00:03:13.970> graphics<00:03:14.859> and<00:03:15.909> let<00:03:16.909> me

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
using the Intel HD graphics and let me

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.949 
using the Intel HD graphics and let me
do<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:17.389> first<00:03:17.690> none<00:03:18.169> and<00:03:19.329> when<00:03:20.329> I<00:03:20.359> select<00:03:20.870> a

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
do this first none and when I select a

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.189 
do this first none and when I select a
shader<00:03:21.229> now<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:23.720> will<00:03:23.900> simply<00:03:24.379> crash

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
shader now it will simply crash

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:31.589 
shader now it will simply crash
so<00:03:27.199> the<00:03:27.530> fix<00:03:27.769> for<00:03:27.979> this<00:03:28.159> is<00:03:28.599> to<00:03:29.599> add<00:03:29.870> Java<00:03:30.620> and

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
so the fix for this is to add Java and

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.849 
so the fix for this is to add Java and
select<00:03:32.599> DVD<00:03:32.979> and<00:03:34.419> now<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:36.530> can<00:03:36.739> play

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
select DVD and now you can play

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.300 
select DVD and now you can play
Minecraft<00:03:37.519> with<00:03:37.970> your<00:03:38.299> shaders<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:39.129> hope<00:03:40.129> it

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
Minecraft with your shaders I hope it

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.930 
Minecraft with your shaders I hope it
helped<00:03:40.729> if<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.419> did<00:03:41.690> please<00:03:42.639> subscribe<00:03:43.639> and
