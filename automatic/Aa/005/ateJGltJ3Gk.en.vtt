at the highest point the fabric should
pull<00:04:08.450> out<00:04:08.980> easily<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.519> then<00:04:11.120> you<00:04:11.269> snip<00:04:11.720> the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
pull out easily and then you snip the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.219 
pull out easily and then you snip the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
kind of pull on it that fabric should be

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.100 
kind of pull on it that fabric should be
nice<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.830> tight<00:04:28.070> together<00:04:28.510> you<00:04:29.510> shouldn't<00:04:29.930> be

nice and tight together you shouldn't be

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.960 
nice and tight together you shouldn't be

fabric again turn it sideways and give

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
it a good snap check and make sure that

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.950 
it a good snap check and make sure that

threads are still good then your tension

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.710 
threads are still good then your tension
is<00:04:57.260> probably<00:04:57.919> about<00:04:58.580> where<00:04:58.880> it<00:04:59.030> needs<00:04:59.270> to<00:04:59.450> be

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
is probably about where it needs to be
