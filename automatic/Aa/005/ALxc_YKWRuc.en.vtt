way<00:05:34.629> this<00:05:34.810> right<00:05:35.020> here<00:05:35.199> is<00:05:35.229> actually<00:05:35.319> an<00:05:35.620> MP

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
way this right here is actually an MP

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.850 
way this right here is actually an MP
nine<00:05:36.159> Moab<00:05:36.639> I<00:05:36.879> got<00:05:37.300> one<00:05:37.539> kill<00:05:37.779> at<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:37.960> ACR<00:05:38.500> what

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
nine Moab I got one kill at the ACR what

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.379 
nine Moab I got one kill at the ACR what
you<00:05:39.039> know<00:05:39.190> it's<00:05:39.580> only<00:05:39.699> because<00:05:40.000> I<00:05:40.150> was<00:05:40.180> out<00:05:40.360> of

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
you know it's only because I was out of

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.469 
you know it's only because I was out of
ammo<00:05:40.690> like<00:05:40.870> I<00:05:41.050> am<00:05:41.169> right<00:05:41.199> now<00:05:41.560> but<00:05:42.370> I<00:05:42.580> got<00:05:42.879> 23

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
ammo like I am right now but I got 23

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.709 
ammo like I am right now but I got 23
out<00:05:43.599> of<00:05:43.629> the<00:05:43.750> 24<00:05:44.229> kills<00:05:44.529> with<00:05:45.219> the<00:05:45.460> mp9<00:05:45.819> so<00:05:46.360> this

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:46.719 
out of the 24 kills with the mp9 so this

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:49.050 
out of the 24 kills with the mp9 so this
is<00:05:46.839> a<00:05:46.870> secondary<00:05:47.409> only<00:05:47.800> Moab<00:05:47.979> so<00:05:48.339> maybe<00:05:48.969> you

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
is a secondary only Moab so maybe you

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.249 
is a secondary only Moab so maybe you
guys<00:05:49.180> could<00:05:49.330> go<00:05:49.509> ahead<00:05:49.599> and<00:05:49.719> rate<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.110> video

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
guys could go ahead and rate the video

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:52.469 
guys could go ahead and rate the video
because<00:05:50.800> i<00:05:50.830> only<00:05:51.189> use<00:05:51.430> my<00:05:51.639> secondary<00:05:52.089> weapon

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
because i only use my secondary weapon

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.809 
because i only use my secondary weapon
which<00:05:52.629> puts<00:05:52.900> me<00:05:52.960> at<00:05:53.139> up<00:05:53.319> you<00:05:53.620> know<00:05:53.710> a<00:05:53.819> fairly

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819 
which puts me at up you know a fairly

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:56.429 
which puts me at up you know a fairly
big<00:05:54.969> disadvantage<00:05:55.389> considering<00:05:56.259> you<00:05:56.409> know

00:05:56.429 --> 00:05:56.439 
big disadvantage considering you know

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.379 
big disadvantage considering you know
this<00:05:57.039> gun<00:05:57.279> can't<00:05:57.550> really<00:05:57.729> keep<00:05:57.879> up<00:05:58.029> with<00:05:58.240> some

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
this gun can't really keep up with some

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.390 
this gun can't really keep up with some
of<00:05:58.479> the<00:05:58.569> other<00:05:58.599> submachine<00:05:59.560> gun<00:05:59.740> shotgun<00:06:00.039> some

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
of the other submachine gun shotgun some

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.760 
of the other submachine gun shotgun some
assault<00:06:00.699> rifles<00:06:01.089> but<00:06:01.930> i<00:06:02.139> do<00:06:02.259> think<00:06:02.379> this

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
assault rifles but i do think this

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.260 
assault rifles but i do think this
secondary<00:06:03.250> is<00:06:03.460> better<00:06:03.699> than<00:06:03.879> some<00:06:04.120> of<00:06:04.210> the

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
secondary is better than some of the

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.179 
secondary is better than some of the
primaries<00:06:04.839> and<00:06:05.080> i<00:06:05.620> think<00:06:05.830> it's<00:06:05.949> better<00:06:06.099> than

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:06.189 
primaries and i think it's better than

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:12.089 
primaries and i think it's better than
the<00:06:06.339> pm-9<00:06:07.500> the<00:06:08.500> mp5<00:06:09.009> and<00:06:09.430> that<00:06:10.919> probably<00:06:11.919> the

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
the pm-9 the mp5 and that probably the

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.529 
the pm-9 the mp5 and that probably the
m16<00:06:12.669> as<00:06:12.909> well<00:06:13.089> but<00:06:13.389> oh<00:06:14.009> well<00:06:15.389> something<00:06:16.389> else

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
m16 as well but oh well something else
