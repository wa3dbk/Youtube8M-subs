00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.770 
videos on standing meditation that I
recommend<00:02:17.269> to<00:02:17.599> everybody<00:02:18.549> so<00:02:19.549> if<00:02:19.970> he<00:02:20.329> if<00:02:20.540> he

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
recommend to everybody so if he if he

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.479 
recommend to everybody so if he if he
starts<00:02:20.989> putting<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.410> pressure<00:02:21.980> over<00:02:22.280> here<00:02:22.459> I

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
starts putting the pressure over here I

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.360 
starts putting the pressure over here I
can<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:23.239> take<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:23.599> in<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.829> I<00:02:24.950> can<00:02:25.099> just<00:02:25.220> feel

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
can you take it in and I can just feel

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.210 
can you take it in and I can just feel
like<00:02:25.489> that<00:02:25.700> with<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> energy<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.380> it's

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
like that with the energy and so it's

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.640 
like that with the energy and so it's
not<00:02:28.400> using<00:02:28.760> force<00:02:29.090> it's<00:02:29.569> actually<00:02:29.959> yielding

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
not using force it's actually yielding

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.930 
not using force it's actually yielding
and<00:02:30.799> taking<00:02:31.099> it<00:02:31.250> in<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.400> giving<00:02:31.849> your

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
and taking it in and giving your

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.349 
and taking it in and giving your
bathroom<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:33.049> I<00:02:33.079> go<00:02:33.290> like<00:02:33.440> theirs<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.579> can<00:02:35.180> I

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
bathroom so I go like theirs and I can I

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.729 
bathroom so I go like theirs and I can I
have<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:35.870> push<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.470> back<00:02:36.709> into<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.459> center

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
have it and push it back into the center

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.819 
have it and push it back into the center
okay<00:02:39.850> alright<00:02:40.850> so<00:02:41.569> that's<00:02:41.660> just<00:02:41.810> using<00:02:42.319> Cheat

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
okay alright so that's just using Cheat

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:47.080 
okay alright so that's just using Cheat
energy<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:45.280> push<00:02:46.280> your<00:02:46.430> opponent's<00:02:46.850> around

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
energy to push your opponent's around

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.509 
energy to push your opponent's around
that<00:02:47.329> using<00:02:47.630> force<00:02:48.190> one<00:02:49.190> last<00:02:49.340> example

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
that using force one last example

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.430 
that using force one last example
actually<00:02:49.940> using<00:02:50.389> force<00:02:50.750> would<00:02:50.930> be<00:02:50.989> something

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
actually using force would be something

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.680 
actually using force would be something
more<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:51.970> okay<00:02:52.970> if<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.180> use<00:02:53.209> force<00:02:55.690> it's

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
more like this okay if I use force it's

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.710 
more like this okay if I use force it's
not<00:02:56.810> very<00:02:56.870> effective<00:02:57.579> if<00:02:58.579> I<00:02:58.819> want<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.090> use<00:02:59.150> just

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
not very effective if I want to use just

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.780 
not very effective if I want to use just
my<00:03:00.160> Chi<00:03:01.160> energy<00:03:03.280> it's<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.370> little<00:03:04.430> bit<00:03:04.549> more

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
my Chi energy it's a little bit more

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.379 
my Chi energy it's a little bit more
effective<00:03:05.329> if<00:03:05.989> I<00:03:06.340> get<00:03:07.340> this<00:03:07.519> Center<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.150> go

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
effective if I get this Center and I go

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.039 
effective if I get this Center and I go
ahead<00:03:08.569> my<00:03:08.750> push<00:03:09.019> them<00:03:09.200> okay<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.370> way<00:03:10.549> I<00:03:11.049> got

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
ahead my push them okay that way I got

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.780 
ahead my push them okay that way I got
to<00:03:12.139> find<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:12.470> center<00:03:12.889> and<00:03:13.220> go<00:03:13.459> through<00:03:13.730> it

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
to find the center and go through it

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.920 
to find the center and go through it
like<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> straight<00:03:14.389> line<00:03:16.239> also<00:03:17.239> with<00:03:17.359> bhajan<00:03:17.810> as

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
like a straight line also with bhajan as

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.050 
like a straight line also with bhajan as
he<00:03:18.079> pushes<00:03:18.349> and<00:03:18.650> i<00:03:18.739> want<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:18.980> i<00:03:19.280> want<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.910> take

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
he pushes and i want it i want to take

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.819 
he pushes and i want it i want to take
it<00:03:20.090> into<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.450> ground<00:03:20.599> and<00:03:21.349> give<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:21.590> back<00:03:21.680> to

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
it into the ground and give it back to

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.370 
it into the ground and give it back to
her<00:03:22.099> that's<00:03:23.060> gonna<00:03:23.209> hurt<00:03:23.450> him<00:03:23.660> if<00:03:23.870> he<00:03:23.959> doesn't
