00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.190
 Today I continue with the pokémon 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.420
 show you how to sign bisasam 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.420
 I wish you a lot of fun 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.219
 so today we start with an oval 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.219
 which we immediately share with a grid 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.950
 from the oval to the right leads offer 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.660
 out again 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.660
 That will later take his body 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.130
 behind the head and out of his body 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.220
 Let's draw his buds or blossom 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.920
 what it should be is just something 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.920
 softe-shaped or onion left 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.040
 Below we outline his 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.680
 paws that are as long as the half 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.960
 his head outlines one below 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.700
 horizontal so that her paws 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.700
 evenly spaced signs 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.170
 from the silhouette you can already 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.680
 know this same now we come to the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.680
 details 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.350
 makes this sams face a little edgier 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.940
 and with two simple triangles 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.940
 Let's sketch it up 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.720
 his eyes are straight down in the course 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.610
 up 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.910
 you are right in the middle of the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.240
 Facial is located in the lower half 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.009
 his banana-shaped mouth turns into 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.940
 his mouth also recognizes his 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.040
 sharp shareholders directly above his 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.500
 nose with two simple strokes 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.080
 is drawn 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.450
 specifically to his face we equal to the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.800
 also knew that bisasam on his 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.800
 have all the time klub 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.319
 and on we go with his post 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.020
 back now we still define the 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.000
 individual leaves the bisasam arbitrarily 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.150
 for a juicy so was ray open 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.150
 can 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.480
 his dead are each 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.470
 three little number 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.940
 then you know that yet 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.940
 square had on his body 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.290
 now you can with the fineliner the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.510
 neighbor my material for that is the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.390
 comic model one with 0 5 millimeter 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.180
 million thick for the difficulty 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.100
 I now three as ten point 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.140
 these very little difficulties 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.030
 exhibit like the posts for example 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.069
 actually it is not a criterion 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.290
 but I think we have the right color selection 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.660
 with these pokémon is relatively hard to 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.670
 although he is only green, it is 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.670
 important which green tones one uses 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.940
 when you're done with the fineliner 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.910
 and have made the sketch erased 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.970
 we like the whole bunch i like my pictures 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.400
 just colorful here certainly also around the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.690
 Today's material is as usual 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.690
 the comic strip marca 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.449
 By the way, with this tutorial we have 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.220
 the first three pokémon now finally in the 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.440
 pott of course follow the 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.050
 developments to whichever 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.639
 I do not know what eternal pokemon 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.530
 you have or which are the most popular 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.199
 At the moment this is just writing in the 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.889
 comments and write why you 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.889
 she moves so 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.640
 yes and that's it you already know 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.380
 Now how to regain pokémon 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.450
 draws a lot of fun 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.450
 until next time your comic world
