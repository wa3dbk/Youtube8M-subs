00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.660
 hi everyone today i'm going 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:06.540
 show you how to make cookies 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.860
 with oatmeal 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.900
 it's simple for this recipe you 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:15.610
 will need 120 g of flakes 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:18.250
 oats 240 grams of flour 200 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.800
 of chocolate chip guns 100 g of 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.810
 red sugar month at the cottage eight months i 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.570
 used cane sugar you can 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:30.730
 use normal sugar 120 g of butter 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.140
 except that I do not have one and yes I 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.960
 do not have any butter so I use a 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.160
 yogurt quite simply sojasun you 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.320
 can use other heavy cases 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.860
 as compotes or high-valleys 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.110
 nature 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.809
 no matter or just butter 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.420
 it works also in a packet of yeast 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.460
 and a bag of vanilla sugar 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.640
 initially it will come to the m 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.820
 preheating oven at 180 degrees then 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:59.769
 then we will mix the flour 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:05.500
 we add hawks as well as the 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:12.640
 sugar and we're going to mix and mix 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:17.799
 by hand, then we add the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:21.479
 eggs vanilla sugar and yeast 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.380
 chemical or in mixture 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.369
 once it's mixing well 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.549
 just add the chocolate chips on 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.360
 just add now the butter or the 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:40.030
 yogurt loop here for me this is a 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:45.040
 soy yogurt hop as it is 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.299
 avoid the milk they will mix well a 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.829
 once you mix well you 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.799
 go have a little paw so that's 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.030
 a step there thanks to yoghurt 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.770
 pretty sticky dough 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.630
 so I want to say it's good you 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.100
 you have mixed enough we just 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.869
 take the dough 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.250
 effect receives small flat pebbles all 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.810
 that little flat pebbles or 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.790
 groups compared to what you want 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.259
 as a coki size so for the most 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.569
 greedy it will be big with lots of 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.459
 chocolate and for the little festivities get 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.810
 will make little ones 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:21.010
 so we go on Saturday to make a small 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.230
 detail at the level of thicknesses tried 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:29.230
 to do all that same thickness for 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:33.450
 cooking and finally even in August this 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.450
 will be the big big one 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:47.080
 it sticks a little bit and so that's it 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:49.420
 it will be it will be the office and it will be the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:59.310
 last for cooking it will be 10 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:03:01.600
 minutes in the oven preheated to 180 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.180
 ten minutes no more 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.590
 to know that once the cookies exit 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.630
 oven still continues to cook 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.140
 and here are the people after ten minutes of 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.160
 cooking we find our kochi then 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.579
 let them cool anyway 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.549
