comfortable strangely so it has a gaming
pad<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.269> course<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:25.019> call<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> macros<00:00:26.090> but<00:00:27.090> you

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
pad of course we call the macros but you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
engine has for media has volume and has

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.799 
engine has for media has volume and has
these<00:01:02.579> things<00:01:02.850> which<00:01:03.059> i'm<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.300> sure<00:01:03.510> what

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
these things which i'm not sure what

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.670 
these things which i'm not sure what
they're<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.199> i<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.400> programmable<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
they're for i think is programmable and

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.500 
they're for i think is programmable and
it<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.890> change<00:01:08.100> three<00:01:08.700> colors<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:10.010> purple<00:01:11.510> red

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
it can change three colors so purple red

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.870 
it can change three colors so purple red
blue<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:14.010> change<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.909> dimness<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.549> turn<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
blue and change the dimness and turn it

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.440 
blue and change the dimness and turn it
off<00:01:18.030> turn<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.600> dark<00:01:19.250> turn<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.580> bright

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
off turn it dark turn it really bright

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.429 
off turn it dark turn it really bright
and<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:24.130> it's<00:01:24.969> pretty<00:01:25.240> good-looking<00:01:25.810> not<00:01:26.350> as

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
and so it's pretty good-looking not as

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.440 
and so it's pretty good-looking not as
good-looking<00:01:26.619> as<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.500> razors<00:01:29.890> but<00:01:30.579> generally

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
good-looking as the razors but generally

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.940 
good-looking as the razors but generally
better<00:01:31.600> keyboard<00:01:31.869> because<00:01:32.259> it<00:01:32.530> does<00:01:32.710> have<00:01:32.740> a

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
better keyboard because it does have a

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.889 
better keyboard because it does have a
better<00:01:33.189> game<00:01:33.429> pad<00:01:33.729> you'll<00:01:34.539> have<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.780> buy

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
better game pad you'll have to buy

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.560 
better game pad you'll have to buy
another<00:01:34.929> one<00:01:35.350> for<00:01:35.469> 70<00:01:35.829> bucks<00:01:36.039> and<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:37.329> only

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
another one for 70 bucks and the only

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.669 
another one for 70 bucks and the only
real<00:01:37.960> problem<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.500> have<00:01:38.679> with<00:01:38.710> this<00:01:39.039> is<00:01:39.460> that<00:01:40.679> it

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
real problem I have with this is that it

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.429 
real problem I have with this is that it
says<00:01:42.039> has<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.909> number<00:01:43.179> of<00:01:43.240> heads<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:43.750> delete

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
says has the number of heads and delete

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.550 
says has the number of heads and delete
copy<00:01:45.039> all<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.520> control<00:01:46.149> things<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.229> if<00:01:47.380> you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
number lock is on you have to turn it

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.929 
number lock is on you have to turn it
off<00:01:52.479> if<00:01:53.110> we<00:01:53.259> actually<00:01:53.469> do<00:01:53.799> it<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.759> other

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
off if we actually do it and the other

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.320 
off if we actually do it and the other
thing<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.179> bothers<00:01:55.630> me<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:58.090> whole

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
thing that bothers me is that this whole

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.389 
thing that bothers me is that this whole
shiny<00:01:58.599> section<00:01:59.080> up<00:01:59.170> here<00:01:59.200> gets<00:01:59.560> very<00:01:59.860> dusty

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
shiny section up here gets very dusty

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.870 
shiny section up here gets very dusty
and<00:02:00.640> basically<00:02:01.360> every<00:02:01.659> day<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:03.520> has

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
and basically every day and here has

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.039 
and basically every day and here has
headphones<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:06.280> mic<00:02:06.459> I<00:02:06.789> don't<00:02:07.599> use<00:02:07.840> this

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
headphones and the mic I don't use this

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.529 
headphones and the mic I don't use this
because<00:02:08.319> I<00:02:09.039> have<00:02:09.489> a<00:02:09.519> soundcard<00:02:10.000> and<00:02:10.329> this

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
because I have a soundcard and this

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.150 
because I have a soundcard and this
really<00:02:10.899> interferes<00:02:11.440> with<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.680> sound<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.040> lot

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
really interferes with the sound a lot

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.449 
really interferes with the sound a lot
so<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.819> sounds<00:02:13.180> pretty<00:02:13.390> disgusting<00:02:14.459> comes

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
so it sounds pretty disgusting comes

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.979 
so it sounds pretty disgusting comes
with<00:02:15.670> two<00:02:16.060> USB<00:02:16.510> ports<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:18.569> here<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
with two USB ports and here it is the

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.299 
with two USB ports and here it is the
mark<00:02:20.170> stealth<00:02:20.910> pretty<00:02:21.910> nice<00:02:22.060> keyboard
