scientists at NASA have given us some

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.599 
scientists at NASA have given us some
amazing<00:00:18.300> images<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.380> they<00:00:19.949> discover<00:00:20.460> this

yeah<00:00:29.730> what<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.720> weather<00:00:31.500> map<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> Sun

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
yeah what is this weather map on the Sun

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.280 
yeah what is this weather map on the Sun
you'll<00:00:32.489> notice<00:00:32.759> part<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> Sun<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.750> missing

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
you'll notice part of the Sun is missing

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
you'll notice part of the Sun is missing
but<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.520> picture<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
but so this is this is a picture of the

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.270 
but so this is this is a picture of the
Sun<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.540> ultraviolet<00:00:37.350> rays<00:00:37.649> what<00:00:38.160> you're

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
Sun in ultraviolet rays what you're

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.970 
Sun in ultraviolet rays what you're
seeing<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.660> three<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> half

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
seeing is this is three and a half

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.369 
seeing is this is three and a half
million<00:00:41.399> degree<00:00:41.820> plasma<00:00:42.390> erupting<00:00:43.140> from<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
million degree plasma erupting from the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.319 
million degree plasma erupting from the
surface<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> Sun<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.879> part<00:00:45.149> that's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
surface of the Sun this part that's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.450 
surface of the Sun this part that's
missing<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.020> reason<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.410> dark<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.219> that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
missing the reason it's dark is that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.580 
missing the reason it's dark is that
whole<00:00:47.700> chunk<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.090> Sun<00:00:48.270> basically<00:00:48.590> ripped

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
whole chunk of the Sun basically ripped

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.130 
whole chunk of the Sun basically ripped
off<00:00:49.800> blew<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.030> coming<00:00:51.360> our<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:51.629> at

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
off blew out and is coming our way at

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
off blew out and is coming our way at
about<00:00:52.379> two<00:00:52.649> million<00:00:53.010> miles<00:00:53.399> an<00:00:53.579> hour<00:00:53.670> our<00:00:53.969> way

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
about two million miles an hour our way

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.680 
about two million miles an hour our way
our<00:00:54.660> way<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:56.760> doesn't<00:00:57.030> sound<00:00:57.329> good

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
our way that doesn't sound good

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.799 
our way that doesn't sound good
well<00:00:58.969> this<00:00:59.969> kind<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:00.329> happens<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
well this kind of thing happens all the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.360 
well this kind of thing happens all the
time<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.410> don't<00:01:01.440> very<00:01:01.920> often<00:01:02.190> see

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
time but you don't very often see

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.640 
time but you don't very often see
something<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.510> big<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.989> I'm<00:01:04.350> gonna<00:01:04.470> go<00:01:04.619> on

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
something that big so I'm gonna go on

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.500 
something that big so I'm gonna go on
Carl<00:01:05.040> Sagan<00:01:05.339> on<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> second<00:01:06.330> so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
Carl Sagan on you here for a second so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.859 
Carl Sagan on you here for a second so
this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.010> about<00:01:08.250> 80<00:01:08.549> times<00:01:08.909> as<00:01:09.360> wide

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
this is this is about 80 times as wide

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.210 
this is this is about 80 times as wide
as<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> earth<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> were<00:01:10.860> looking<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
as the earth if you were looking at the

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.590 
as the earth if you were looking at the
earth<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.670> scale<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.180> about<00:01:12.330> that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
earth on this scale think about that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.260 
earth on this scale think about that
large<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.950> an<00:01:14.130> incredible<00:01:14.820> chunk<00:01:15.150> of

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
large so this is an incredible chunk of

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.899 
large so this is an incredible chunk of
the<00:01:15.330> Sun<00:01:15.570> that's<00:01:16.020> flying<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:17.580> happens

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the Sun that's flying out what happens

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.440 
the Sun that's flying out what happens
when<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.600> hits<00:01:19.110> our<00:01:19.200> planet<00:01:19.770> it

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
when it when it hits our planet it

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
when it when it hits our planet it
causes<00:01:21.450> Aurora's<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.350> both<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.590> magnetic

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
causes Aurora's and we both the magnetic

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.679 
causes Aurora's and we both the magnetic
field<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.970> most<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> thing<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.659> really

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
field the most the thing you really

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.170 
field the most the thing you really
worry<00:01:25.020> about<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:25.979> disrupt<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.759> GPS

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
worry about is it can disrupt your GPS

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.609 
worry about is it can disrupt your GPS
it<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.930> mess<00:01:28.049> with<00:01:28.080> your<00:01:28.290> communication

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
it can mess with your communication

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
it can mess with your communication
satellites<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.640> mess<00:01:29.790> with<00:01:29.820> your<00:01:30.000> power

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
satellites it can mess with your power

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.120 
satellites it can mess with your power
lines<00:01:30.479> sound<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.140> solar<00:01:31.290> flare<00:01:31.650> so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
lines sound like it's solar flare so

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.399 
lines sound like it's solar flare so
yeah<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.960> these

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
yeah so this is so this is so these

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.160 
yeah so this is so this is so these
hotspots<00:01:35.250> are<00:01:35.729> where<00:01:35.820> things<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.990> where

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
hotspots are where things are it's where

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
hotspots are where things are it's where
the<00:01:37.350> things<00:01:37.950> are<00:01:38.100> really<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.369> kind<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.670> tense

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the things are really in kind of tense

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
the things are really in kind of tense
and<00:01:39.119> bubbling<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.110> where<00:01:40.290> it's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and bubbling this is where it's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.080 
and bubbling this is where it's
basically<00:01:41.159> reached<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> point<00:01:41.850> where<00:01:42.030> it

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
basically reached the point where it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.120 
basically reached the point where it
just<00:01:42.210> kind<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.420> completely<00:01:42.930> blew<00:01:43.320> off<00:01:43.500> you're

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
just kind of completely blew off you're

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.679 
just kind of completely blew off you're
actually<00:01:44.430> not<00:01:44.610> seeing<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> hot<00:01:45.240> gas<00:01:45.450> here

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
actually not seeing the hot gas here

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.289 
actually not seeing the hot gas here
because<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.500> lot<00:01:46.649> around<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> Sun<00:01:47.299> coming

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
because it's a lot around the Sun coming

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.760 
because it's a lot around the Sun coming
in<00:01:48.420> down<00:01:48.570> where<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:49.049> ever<00:01:49.170> know<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.530> before

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
in down where you ever know this before

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.389 
in down where you ever know this before
or<00:01:50.640> did<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.180> not<00:01:51.210> take<00:01:52.049> no<00:01:52.290> Goblin<00:01:52.680> well<00:01:53.159> we

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
or did we not take no Goblin well we

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.249 
or did we not take no Goblin well we
know<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.420> very<00:01:54.540> recent<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.140> we've

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
know it's really very recent that we've

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.959 
know it's really very recent that we've
even<00:01:55.619> been<00:01:55.710> able<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.009> see<00:01:56.219> these<00:01:56.369> things<00:01:56.670> and

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
even been able to see these things and

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.270 
even been able to see these things and
so<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.390> kind<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.719> knew<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.740> know<00:01:58.799> there's<00:01:59.159> this

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
so we kind of knew you know there's this

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.899 
so we kind of knew you know there's this
constant<00:01:59.820> low-level<00:01:59.939> thing<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:02.310> few

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
constant low-level thing you know a few

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.660 
constant low-level thing you know a few
million<00:02:03.119> dollars<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> year<00:02:03.860> damages<00:02:04.860> more<00:02:05.549> or

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
million dollars a year damages more or

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.059 
million dollars a year damages more or
less<00:02:05.820> just<00:02:06.060> our<00:02:06.960> solar<00:02:07.200> satellites<00:02:07.710> power

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
less just our solar satellites power

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.949 
less just our solar satellites power
lines<00:02:08.369> things<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:08.789> knew<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.179> Sun<00:02:09.390> was<00:02:09.599> was

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
lines things we knew the Sun was was

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.089 
lines things we knew the Sun was was
messing<00:02:10.289> with<00:02:10.319> us<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.709> didn't<00:02:10.890> exactly

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
messing with us and we didn't exactly

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.890 
messing with us and we didn't exactly
know<00:02:11.340> why<00:02:11.520> no<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.390> see

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
know why no you see

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.199 
know why no you see
and<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.260> real<00:02:13.470> worry<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.129> this<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.940> actually

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
and the real worry is this is actually

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.210 
and the real worry is this is actually
not<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.049> is<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.230> small<00:02:16.470> one<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:16.830> is<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.010> minor

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
not this is a small one this is a minor

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.059 
not this is a small one this is a minor
Wow<00:02:17.659> can<00:02:18.659> you<00:02:18.750> tell<00:02:18.989> us<00:02:19.019> what<00:02:19.349> this<00:02:19.470> means<00:02:19.799> then

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
Wow can you tell us what this means then

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.289 
Wow can you tell us what this means then
so<00:02:20.909> what<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.569> means<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:22.909> this<00:02:23.909> is<00:02:23.970> what<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
so what this means is this is what the

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.869 
so what this means is this is what the
Sun<00:02:24.480> does<00:02:24.510> all<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> time<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.670> we<00:02:26.670> don't

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
Sun does all the time and we don't

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.270 
Sun does all the time and we don't
really<00:02:27.120> know<00:02:27.360> why<00:02:27.659> it<00:02:27.720> does<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.190> there's<00:02:29.190> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
really know why it does it there's a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.740 
really know why it does it there's a
there's<00:02:29.579> an<00:02:29.640> 11-year<00:02:30.060> cycle<00:02:30.269> of<00:02:30.510> solar

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
there's an 11-year cycle of solar

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.410 
there's an 11-year cycle of solar
activity<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.440> right<00:02:32.099> now<00:02:32.280> we're<00:02:32.970> going<00:02:33.239> into

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
activity and right now we're going into

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.830 
activity and right now we're going into
a<00:02:33.540> time<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:33.959> peak<00:02:34.230> activity<00:02:34.379> and<00:02:35.569> that's<00:02:36.569> when

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
a time of peak activity and that's when

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.479 
a time of peak activity and that's when
all<00:02:37.110> those<00:02:37.409> things<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:38.010> was<00:02:38.129> talking<00:02:38.250> about

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
all those things I was talking about

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.949 
all those things I was talking about
before<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.790> know<00:02:39.060> we<00:02:39.239> really<00:02:39.569> need<00:02:39.659> to<00:02:39.810> watch

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
before you know we really need to watch

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.630 
before you know we really need to watch
for<00:02:39.989> power<00:02:40.349> lines<00:02:40.650> or<00:02:40.950> satellites<00:02:41.340> for<00:02:41.519> all

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
for power lines or satellites for all

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.250 
for power lines or satellites for all
that<00:02:41.849> but<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.329> just<00:02:42.360> said<00:02:42.720> something<00:02:42.989> there

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
that but you just said something there

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.479 
that but you just said something there
you<00:02:43.290> said<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.560> happens<00:02:43.950> all<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.159> time

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
you said it happens all the time

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.610 
you said it happens all the time
if<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.269> happens<00:02:45.629> all<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.810> time<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.410> there<00:02:46.560> a

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
if it happens all the time is there a

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.430 
if it happens all the time is there a
real<00:02:46.890> risk<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.340> us<00:02:47.569> well<00:02:48.569> we<00:02:48.750> just<00:02:48.900> noticing

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
real risk to us well we just noticing

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.289 
real risk to us well we just noticing
now<00:02:49.620> well<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.549> there<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.120> there's

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
now well so that so there so there's

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.699 
now well so that so there so there's
there's<00:02:51.720> two<00:02:51.750> parts<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.200> mean<00:02:52.319> there's<00:02:52.470> there's

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
there's two parts I mean there's there's

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.440 
there's two parts I mean there's there's
stuff<00:02:53.340> like<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.549> like<00:02:53.609> I<00:02:53.819> said<00:02:53.849> this<00:02:54.269> is

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
stuff like this like I said this is

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.119 
stuff like this like I said this is
actually<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:54.810> even<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:55.079> pretty<00:02:55.230> bad<00:02:55.650> one<00:02:55.920> so

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
actually not even a pretty bad one so

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.460 
actually not even a pretty bad one so
this<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.579> what<00:02:56.819> happens<00:02:57.120> all<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.019> time<00:02:58.140> we

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
this is what happens all the time we

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.780 
this is what happens all the time we
weren't<00:02:58.620> really<00:02:58.829> noticing<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.489> that's<00:02:59.640> now

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
weren't really noticing and that's now

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.220 
weren't really noticing and that's now
we're<00:03:00.030> starting<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.329> understand<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.840> forecast

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
we're starting to understand a forecast

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.319 
we're starting to understand a forecast
but<00:03:01.799> they're<00:03:02.069> also<00:03:02.220> they're<00:03:02.700> much<00:03:03.090> more

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
but they're also they're much more

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.380 
but they're also they're much more
intense<00:03:03.690> ones<00:03:04.190> there<00:03:05.190> was<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> giant<00:03:05.909> Sun<00:03:06.060> flare

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
intense ones there was a giant Sun flare

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.750 
intense ones there was a giant Sun flare
in<00:03:06.540> 1962<00:03:07.349> right<00:03:07.950> before<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:08.579> had<00:03:08.730> a

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
in 1962 right before we really had a

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.250 
in 1962 right before we really had a
whole<00:03:08.909> lot<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.060> satellites<00:03:09.510> an<00:03:09.870> even<00:03:10.109> bigger

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
whole lot of satellites an even bigger

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.009 
whole lot of satellites an even bigger
one<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.859> 1859<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:12.000> if<00:03:12.510> something<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:12.959> that

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
one in 1859 and if something like that

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.949 
one in 1859 and if something like that
happened<00:03:13.470> again<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:14.280> could<00:03:14.930> cause<00:03:15.930> a

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
happened again that could cause a

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.690 
happened again that could cause a
blackout<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.709> always<00:03:16.950> talking<00:03:17.310> about<00:03:17.370> you

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
blackout you always talking about you

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.339 
blackout you always talking about you
know<00:03:17.819> solar<00:03:18.060> flares<00:03:18.419> is<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.870> biggest<00:03:19.169> danger

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
know solar flares is the biggest danger

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.039 
know solar flares is the biggest danger
on<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.280> large<00:03:20.549> scale<00:03:20.849> so<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.359> will<00:03:21.540> see<00:03:21.690> Cory

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
on a large scale so we will see Cory

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.960 
on a large scale so we will see Cory
