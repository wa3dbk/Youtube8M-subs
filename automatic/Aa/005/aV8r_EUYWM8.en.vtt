00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.410 
thing is that you guys got to have a lot
of<00:00:51.530> neighbors<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.739> my<00:00:52.949> ninja<00:00:53.340> that's<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.210> main

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
of neighbors in my ninja that's the main

of neighbors in my ninja that's the main
thing<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:55.110> main<00:00:55.140> thing<00:00:55.379> out<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.340> everything

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
thing the main thing out of everything

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.869 
thing the main thing out of everything
and<00:00:57.390> because<00:00:58.320> i'll<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.620> explaining<00:00:59.160> why<00:00:59.579> now

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
and because i'll be explaining why now

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
and because i'll be explaining why now
is<00:01:00.059> because<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.930> more<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> neighbors<00:01:01.680> you

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
is because the more the neighbors you

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.710 
is because the more the neighbors you
have<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.219> more<00:01:02.430> chances<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.960> more<00:01:05.720> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
have the more chances and the more the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.770 
have the more chances and the more the
more<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.560> say<00:01:07.860> well<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.820> rationalizes

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
more this to say well it rationalizes

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
more this to say well it rationalizes
everything<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.369> be<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
okay see it was a safe example you have

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
okay see it was a safe example you have
around<00:01:14.909> 50<00:01:15.240> neighbors<00:01:15.900> that's<00:01:16.320> actually

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
experience increased by 20 which is kind

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.100 
experience increased by 20 which is kind
of<00:02:13.650> all<00:02:13.860> right<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:14.280> sometimes<00:02:14.960> you<00:02:15.960> just

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
gotta bear with it and you might

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.330 
gotta bear with it and you might
actually<00:02:17.700> win<00:02:18.090> XP<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.800> coins<00:02:19.800> at<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.160> same

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
actually win XP and coins at the same

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.570 
actually win XP and coins at the same
time<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.820> never<00:02:20.940> know<00:02:21.710> anyways<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:22.980> six<00:02:23.340> be

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
time you never know anyways that six be

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.530 
time you never know anyways that six be
5x<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.240> five<00:02:25.140> coins<00:02:25.680> five<00:02:26.460> more<00:02:26.670> coins<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.390> you

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
5x be five coins five more coins and you

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.370 
5x be five coins five more coins and you
can<00:02:27.660> see<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.830> goes<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.310> through<00:02:30.380> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
can see and this goes on through the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.580 
can see and this goes on through the
whole<00:02:32.030> visiting<00:02:33.030> procedures<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.990> also<00:02:34.350> stuff

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
whole visiting procedures and also stuff

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.890 
whole visiting procedures and also stuff
and<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.190> can<00:02:35.340> also<00:02:35.460> share<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:36.000> rewards<00:02:36.480> maybe

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
and you can also share the rewards maybe

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.620 
and you can also share the rewards maybe
because<00:02:37.860> I'm<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.700> lot<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:38.940> my<00:02:39.060> friends<00:02:39.240> share

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
is actually normally just sign in well

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.600 
is actually normally just sign in well
log<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.750> daily<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.650> actually<00:02:55.800> receive<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
log in daily so you actually receive the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.880 
log in daily so you actually receive the
rewards<00:02:57.030> danger<00:02:57.360> awards<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.870> actually<00:02:58.709> go

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
rewards danger awards and actually go

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.710 
rewards danger awards and actually go
around<00:02:59.130> my<00:02:59.310> friends<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.760> just<00:02:59.940> make<00:03:00.390> around

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
200 x be yourself I'm not even sure so

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.130 
200 x be yourself I'm not even sure so
yeah<00:03:04.380> um<00:03:04.730> again<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.120> point<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.810> have<00:03:06.959> to

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
yeah um again the point that you have to

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.750 
yeah um again the point that you have to
have<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.320> lot<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.620> neighbors<00:03:08.100> just<00:03:08.280> comes<00:03:08.580> in

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
have a lot of neighbors just comes in

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.680 
have a lot of neighbors just comes in
guys<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.810> anyways<00:03:10.050> let's<00:03:10.080> just<00:03:10.440> move<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.830> okay

guys so anyways let's just move on okay
Lego<00:03:12.690> artists<00:03:13.140> quickly<00:03:13.470> go<00:03:13.680> through<00:03:13.709> this

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
Lego artists quickly go through this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.000 
Lego artists quickly go through this
that's<00:03:15.330> five<00:03:15.630> five<00:03:15.959> more<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.560> we<00:03:16.709> were<00:03:16.830> at

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
that's five five more so we were at

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.720 
that's five five more so we were at
9,000<00:03:17.730> when<00:03:17.850> we<00:03:17.970> started<00:03:19.040> well<00:03:20.040> my<00:03:20.160> ex<00:03:20.370> he<00:03:20.489> was

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
9,000 when we started well my ex he was

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.780 
9,000 when we started well my ex he was
at<00:03:20.880> 9,000<00:03:21.420> when<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.660> store<00:03:21.959> in

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
at 9,000 when you store in

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.030 
at 9,000 when you store in
now<00:03:23.299> going<00:03:23.540> visited<00:03:24.049> three<00:03:24.290> people<00:03:24.769> and

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
now going visited three people and

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.880 
now going visited three people and
ninety<00:03:25.519> percent<00:03:25.640> 90<00:03:26.299> HP<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.959> I'm<00:03:27.530> not<00:03:27.680> even

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
ninety percent 90 HP and I'm not even

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.559 
ninety percent 90 HP and I'm not even
sure<00:03:27.920> about<00:03:28.129> my<00:03:28.370> goal<00:03:28.579> but<00:03:28.849> you<00:03:29.060> got<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.390> guys

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
sure about my goal but you got you guys

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.330 
sure about my goal but you got you guys
via<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:29.989> you<00:03:30.230> guys<00:03:30.409> will<00:03:30.680> be<00:03:30.739> able<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:31.040> see<00:03:31.219> the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
via but you guys will be able to see the

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.229 
via but you guys will be able to see the
difference<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:33.709> priority<00:03:34.370> again<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.819> this<00:03:35.030> is

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
difference the priority again of this is

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.300 
difference the priority again of this is
actually<00:03:35.659> having<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:36.079> lot<00:03:36.109> of<00:03:36.319> my<00:03:36.859> ninja

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
actually having a lot of my ninja

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.670 
actually having a lot of my ninja
neighbors<00:03:37.760> ie<00:03:38.030> friends<00:03:39.019> I<00:03:39.170> don't<00:03:39.379> know<00:03:39.439> why

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
neighbors ie friends I don't know why

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.679 
neighbors ie friends I don't know why
I'm<00:03:39.829> saying<00:03:40.040> neighbors<00:03:40.430> for<00:03:40.640> what<00:03:40.849> for<00:03:41.659> what

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
I'm saying neighbors for what for what

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.369 
I'm saying neighbors for what for what
reason<00:03:42.379> whatsoever<00:03:42.709> but<00:03:43.609> okay<00:03:44.359> let's<00:03:45.170> just

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
reason whatsoever but okay let's just

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.710 
reason whatsoever but okay let's just
continue<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:45.950> can<00:03:46.069> see<00:03:46.250> that<00:03:46.280> by

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
continue and you can see that by

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.509 
continue and you can see that by
energies<00:03:47.720> 40<00:03:48.049> out<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.290> 35<00:03:48.739> now<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.220> can<00:03:49.370> also

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
energies 40 out of 35 now you can also

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.539 
energies 40 out of 35 now you can also
just<00:03:49.879> when<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:50.750> have<00:03:50.870> zero<00:03:51.139> energy<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.400> can

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
just when you have zero energy you can

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.009 
just when you have zero energy you can
visit<00:03:52.760> your<00:03:53.000> neighbors<00:03:53.389> and<00:03:53.420> when<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:53.840> have

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
visit your neighbors and when you have

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.589 
visit your neighbors and when you have
for<00:03:54.530> energy<00:03:55.189> you<00:03:55.670> can<00:03:55.790> tell<00:03:55.970> whether<00:03:56.150> them<00:03:56.420> and

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
for energy you can tell whether them and

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.440 
for energy you can tell whether them and
the<00:03:56.780> energy<00:03:57.590> get<00:03:58.069> stored<00:03:58.370> up<00:03:58.519> instead<00:03:58.909> of<00:03:58.970> not

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
the energy get stored up instead of not

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.119 
the energy get stored up instead of not
increasing<00:03:59.900> which<00:04:00.409> is<00:04:00.560> actually<00:04:00.739> quite<00:04:01.010> a
