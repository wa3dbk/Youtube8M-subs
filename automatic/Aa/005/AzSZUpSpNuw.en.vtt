there's no way with the demon I could

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.860 
there's no way with the demon I could
just<00:04:16.870> go<00:04:17.019> throw<00:04:17.889> my<00:04:17.949> hair<00:04:18.389> like<00:04:19.389> I<00:04:19.419> can<00:04:19.720> with

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
just go throw my hair like I can with

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.790 
just go throw my hair like I can with
this<00:04:19.989> brush<00:04:20.229> it<00:04:20.500> just<00:04:21.070> what<00:04:21.310> happened

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.450 

but<00:04:28.610> also<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.930> reason<00:04:30.289> I'm<00:04:30.410> able<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:31.009> just

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
but also the reason I'm able to just

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.140 
but also the reason I'm able to just
brush<00:04:31.879> to<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.419> easily<00:04:32.810> is<00:04:33.139> because<00:04:33.500> I

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
brush to it this easily is because I

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.969 
brush to it this easily is because I
moisturize<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.900> use<00:04:36.379> a<00:04:36.740> lot<00:04:37.729> of<00:04:37.759> moisturizer

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
moisturize I use a lot of moisturizer

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.059 
moisturize I use a lot of moisturizer
and<00:04:39.979> the<00:04:40.550> reason<00:04:41.000> is<00:04:41.270> that<00:04:41.330> it's<00:04:42.229> because<00:04:42.590> if<00:04:42.860> I

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
and the reason is that it's because if I

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:49.089 
and the reason is that it's because if I
don't<00:04:44.650> yeah<00:04:45.729> it<00:04:46.729> tangles<00:04:47.300> like<00:04:47.629> it<00:04:47.750> not<00:04:47.990> I<00:04:48.650> had
