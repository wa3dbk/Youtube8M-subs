00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
decided to give it a try and we liked it

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.289 
decided to give it a try and we liked it

among the trades people I mean we like

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.470 
among the trades people I mean we like
it<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> office<00:00:19.070> because<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.970> find<00:00:21.270> that

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
it in the office because it we find that

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.320 
it in the office because it we find that
it<00:00:21.630> saves<00:00:21.869> us<00:00:22.050> time<00:00:22.230> material<00:00:23.189> which<00:00:23.519> saves<00:00:24.150> us

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
it saves us time material which saves us

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.050 
it saves us time material which saves us
money<00:00:24.359> keeps<00:00:25.320> us<00:00:25.500> competitive<00:00:26.160> i<00:00:26.369> would<00:00:26.849> i

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
money keeps us competitive i would i

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.330 
money keeps us competitive i would i
would<00:00:27.090> say<00:00:27.300> definitely<00:00:27.599> picked<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.340> twenty

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
would say definitely picked up twenty

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.009 
would say definitely picked up twenty
percent<00:00:29.640> or<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:29.820> maybe<00:00:30.150> fifteen<00:00:30.750> twenty

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
percent or so maybe fifteen twenty

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.920 
percent or so maybe fifteen twenty
percent<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.500> her<00:00:31.880> on<00:00:32.880> our<00:00:33.030> install<00:00:33.360> time<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
percent on her on our install time and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.240 
percent on her on our install time and
then<00:00:34.050> there's<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.290> savings<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.770> material<00:00:35.190> as

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
then there's a savings in material as

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.520 
then there's a savings in material as
well<00:00:35.280> i<00:00:35.670> had<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> lot<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.329> no<00:00:36.750> coat<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.170> put<00:00:37.350> on

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
well i had a lot of no coat to put on

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.889 
well i had a lot of no coat to put on
and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.160> had<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> very<00:00:38.940> little<00:00:39.270> guys<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
and I had a very little guys to do it

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.720 
and I had a very little guys to do it
with<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.469> when<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.770> started<00:00:41.160> putting<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.550> they

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
with so when we started putting on they

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.810 
with so when we started putting on they
went<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.180> fast<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.770> through<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.010> my<00:00:44.219> my

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
went so fast that I got through it my my

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.540 
went so fast that I got through it my my
they<00:00:45.660> will<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> took<00:00:46.140> four<00:00:46.440> days<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:47.039> got<00:00:47.340> done

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
they will it took four days I got done

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850 
they will it took four days I got done
in<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> day<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.239> half<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.989> takes<00:00:49.320> less<00:00:49.559> mud

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
in a day and a half it takes less mud

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.369 
in a day and a half it takes less mud
and<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:50.579> still<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.899> paintable<00:00:52.199> surface

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and then still it's a paintable surface

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.510 
and then still it's a paintable surface
also<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.930> works<00:00:55.199> good<00:00:55.440> especially<00:00:56.370> when

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
also so it works good especially when

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670 
also so it works good especially when
you<00:00:56.670> don't<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> whole<00:00:57.239> lot<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.539> people<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you don't have a whole lot of people the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.799 
you don't have a whole lot of people the
one<00:00:58.859> thing<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.250> could<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.000> would<00:01:00.270> say<00:01:00.690> is

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
one thing I could that I would say is

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.479 
one thing I could that I would say is
that<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> biggest<00:01:01.530> benefit<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> us<00:01:02.129> has<00:01:02.340> been

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that the biggest benefit to us has been

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.830 
that the biggest benefit to us has been
the<00:01:03.049> reduction<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.140> material<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.309> just

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
the reduction in material and and just

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.420 
the reduction in material and and just
just<00:01:06.840> by<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> nature<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.439> less<00:01:07.770> material<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
just by the nature of less material it

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.520 
just by the nature of less material it
takes<00:01:08.640> less<00:01:09.000> labor<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.450> put<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
takes less labor to put it on so it's a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.800 
takes less labor to put it on so it's a
pickup<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.950> both<00:01:11.159> areas<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.729> had<00:01:12.270> no<00:01:12.479> employee

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
pickup in both areas I had no employee

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
pickup in both areas I had no employee
they<00:01:12.960> used<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> another<00:01:13.590> job<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> he<00:01:14.159> says
