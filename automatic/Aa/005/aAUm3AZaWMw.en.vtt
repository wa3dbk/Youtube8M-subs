00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.560
 good for me 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.109
 it's a great honor to be here with the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.189
 colombia selection to be arriving here 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.189
 I'm going to give all the runners 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.840
 for me, it's an honor to do 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.970
 part of the colombia good selection 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.130
 Carlos with what expectations 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.870
 we know he was shooting in the 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.390
 different races and it's a return to 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.309
 Spain- complete for this world cup in 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.550
 what conditions do you feel for 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.940
 to have a good presentation of the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.719
 return 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 that's me many kilometers a lot 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.489
 tired but good now we are 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.600
 recovering what we are already a bit 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:06.390
 better and try to represent well that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.759
 T-shirt because it 's better when you also 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.830
 who has history in this world cup 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.960
 first in junior with a silver now the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.060
 great dream of conquering the great 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.060
 trophy that is the the yes 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.070
 I already have my first medal in its 23rd 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.090
 blessing 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.510
 for me it would be an honor to have her in the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.900
 elite but I think it's a bit difficult 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.540
 but good 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.020
 I think you have to dream that you dream in 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.070
 great and I like it and get to the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.570
 world champion 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.310
 on the podium dream a carlos slope in 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.590
 particular even in the races of a 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.990
 have greatly favored this 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.390
 circuit this race with the level that 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.790
 there as soon as it can benefit and where 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.790
 think you can take advantage of good 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:05.880
 There are 4000 and some meters of vertical drop 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.520
 in a very hard world but like I think 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.560
 which is the different choices 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.470
 they bring fast runners install 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.600
 then it is not the same will have to 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.780
 wait and see how we are going to be in the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.780
 race and look at how it's going
