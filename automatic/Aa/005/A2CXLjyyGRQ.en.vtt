your<00:04:44.630> mind<00:04:44.780> when<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.200> went<00:04:45.380> out<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.680> bat

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
your mind when you went out to bat

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.590 
your mind when you went out to bat
knowing<00:04:46.250> that<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.520> weather<00:04:46.700> was<00:04:46.940> not<00:04:47.360> very

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
knowing that the weather was not very

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.970 
knowing that the weather was not very
good<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:47.900> you<00:04:47.990> had<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.169> sleep<00:04:48.230> task<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.770> chase

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
good and you had to sleep task to chase

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.520 
good and you had to sleep task to chase
yeah<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:49.580> think<00:04:49.730> because<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.810> wet

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
yeah I think because of the wet

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.200 
yeah I think because of the wet
conditions<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.310> ball<00:04:52.490> was<00:04:52.640> skidding<00:04:52.880> through

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
conditions the ball was skidding through

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.360 
conditions the ball was skidding through
so<00:04:53.419> if<00:04:53.660> I<00:04:54.140> was<00:04:54.320> trying<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.710> sit<00:04:55.160> straight

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
so if I was trying to sit straight
