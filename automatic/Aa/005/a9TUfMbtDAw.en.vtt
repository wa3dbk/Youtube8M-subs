popular<00:00:50.820> theory<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.690> Jones<00:00:52.050> theory<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:53.820> has

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
popular theory the Jones theory this has

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.700 
popular theory the Jones theory this has
been<00:00:54.000> slightly<00:00:54.510> misinterpreted<00:00:55.230> over<00:00:55.469> time

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
been slightly misinterpreted over time

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.889 
been slightly misinterpreted over time
let<00:00:55.980> me<00:00:56.070> give<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:57.120> mostly<00:00:57.510> right

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
let me give you the the mostly right

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.330 
let me give you the the mostly right
interpretation<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.829> theory<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.250> then

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
interpretation of this theory and then

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.670 
interpretation of this theory and then
I'll<00:00:59.430> refine<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.690> idea<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.440> if

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
I'll refine it the idea here is that if

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
I'll refine it the idea here is that if
you<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.949> more<00:01:02.190> than<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:02.399> game<00:01:02.940> within<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you have more than one game within a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.200 
you have more than one game within a
specific<00:01:03.780> genre<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.610> should<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:05.970> rid

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
specific genre then you should get rid

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.230 
specific genre then you should get rid
of<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.049> mix<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:08.090> let's<00:01:09.090> say<00:01:09.210> for

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
of all the mix up for one let's say for

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.000 
of all the mix up for one let's say for
example<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.960> deck<00:01:10.200> builders<00:01:10.619> you're

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
example you have to deck builders you're

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
example you have to deck builders you're
not<00:01:11.220> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.640> them<00:01:11.820> both<00:01:11.939> equally<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
not going to like them both equally and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.000 
not going to like them both equally and
probably<00:01:13.020> when<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.229> go<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> play<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> deck

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
probably when you go to play a deck

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.530 
probably when you go to play a deck
builder<00:01:14.340> you're<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> continue<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.240> grab

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
builder you're going to continue to grab

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.810 
builder you're going to continue to grab
one<00:01:15.869> ignoring<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.799> other<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.310> why<00:01:17.490> keep<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
one ignoring the other so why keep that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.960 
one ignoring the other so why keep that
one<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.450> you're<00:01:18.570> not<00:01:18.750> playing<00:01:19.759> now<00:01:20.759> that's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
one that you're not playing now that's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480 
one that you're not playing now that's
not<00:01:21.119> exactly<00:01:21.509> accurate<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.250> Cody

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
not exactly accurate really what Cody

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.399 
not exactly accurate really what Cody
Jones<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:23.970> getting<00:01:24.299> at<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.930> idea<00:01:25.320> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
Jones was getting at is the idea that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.960 
Jones was getting at is the idea that
you<00:01:25.650> should<00:01:25.830> play<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.189> games<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.700> have

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you should play the games that you have

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
you should play the games that you have
and<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.270> you're<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.509> playing<00:01:27.900> them<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:28.619> get

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and if you're not playing them then get

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.280 
and if you're not playing them then get
rid<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.100> them<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.369> if<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.000> do<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.020> deck

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
rid of them so if you do have to deck

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.740 
rid of them so if you do have to deck
builders<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.159> playing<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.640> a

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
builders that you are playing on a

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.420 
builders that you are playing on a
frequent<00:01:33.750> basis<00:01:34.140> almost<00:01:34.320> equally<00:01:34.920> then

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
frequent basis almost equally then

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.560 
frequent basis almost equally then
there's<00:01:35.759> no<00:01:35.850> need<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.210> rid<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.360> both<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
there's no need to get rid of both of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.810 
there's no need to get rid of both of
them<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.079> case<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.729> know

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
them in that case it's just you know

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.730 
them in that case it's just you know
when<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.150> have<00:01:39.360> five<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.320> these<00:01:40.380> deck

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
when you have five of these deck

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.920 
when you have five of these deck
builders<00:01:41.100> odds<00:01:41.549> are<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> aren't<00:01:42.240> playing<00:01:42.600> all

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
builders odds are you aren't playing all

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.389 
builders odds are you aren't playing all
of<00:01:43.110> them<00:01:43.290> equally<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.920> let's<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.220> rid<00:01:44.369> of

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
of them equally so let's get rid of

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.830 
of them equally so let's get rid of
those<00:01:44.520> ones<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.450> aren't<00:01:45.659> playing

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.779 
point out something that I'm not playing
now<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.710> meant<00:02:08.160> something<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.550> me<00:02:08.640> at

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
now but that meant something to me at

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.600 
now but that meant something to me at
one<00:02:08.940> time<00:02:09.119> or<00:02:09.179> now

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
one time or now

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.470 
one time or now
that<00:02:09.789> I<00:02:09.820> really<00:02:10.119> enjoyed<00:02:10.479> playing<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:12.210> get<00:02:13.210> kind

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
that I really enjoyed playing I get kind

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.150 
that I really enjoyed playing I get kind
of<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.750> sentimental<00:02:14.260> value<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.650> think<00:02:15.010> from

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
of a sentimental value I think from

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.640 
of a sentimental value I think from
looking<00:02:15.220> at<00:02:15.730> an<00:02:16.030> older<00:02:16.360> game<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:17.320> I<00:02:17.350> remember

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
looking at an older game that I remember

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.260 
looking at an older game that I remember
from<00:02:17.800> my<00:02:18.010> childhood<00:02:18.040> playing<00:02:18.700> several<00:02:19.000> times

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
from my childhood playing several times

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.050 
from my childhood playing several times
or<00:02:19.450> even<00:02:19.480> just<00:02:19.660> from<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.710> year<00:02:20.920> or<00:02:21.010> two<00:02:21.160> ago<00:02:21.310> that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
or even just from a year or two ago that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.030 
or even just from a year or two ago that
when<00:02:22.180> i<00:02:22.210> first<00:02:22.600> played<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.020> really<00:02:23.560> really<00:02:23.800> got

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
when i first played it really really got

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.900 
when i first played it really really got
me<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.370> i<00:02:24.430> really<00:02:25.000> enjoyed<00:02:25.390> playing<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:26.860> I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
me and i really enjoyed playing and so I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.180 
me and i really enjoyed playing and so I
struggle<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.060> get<00:02:28.210> rid<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.510> those<00:02:28.810> but

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
struggle to get rid of those but

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.620 
struggle to get rid of those but
recently<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.280> decided<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.120> maybe<00:02:31.240> it<00:02:31.480> was

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
recently I decided that maybe it was

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.840 
recently I decided that maybe it was
time<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:32.290> get<00:02:32.920> rid<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.100> some<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.340> my<00:02:33.460> games<00:02:33.700> you

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
time to get rid of some of my games you

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.460 
time to get rid of some of my games you
know<00:02:33.910> unlike<00:02:34.360> books<00:02:34.780> where<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.110> can<00:02:35.230> store

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
know unlike books where you can store

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.910 
know unlike books where you can store
hundreds<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.459> them<00:02:36.550> on<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.000> single<00:02:37.420> bookshelf

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
hundreds of them on a single bookshelf

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.530 
hundreds of them on a single bookshelf
you<00:02:38.920> can't<00:02:39.160> quite<00:02:39.340> do<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:39.640> with<00:02:40.150> board<00:02:40.450> games

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
you can't quite do that with board games

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.110 
you can't quite do that with board games
so<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:40.959> had<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.230> make<00:02:41.500> some<00:02:41.680> tough<00:02:41.740> decisions

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
so I had to make some tough decisions

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.250 
so I had to make some tough decisions
the<00:02:43.120> thing<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.630> don't<00:02:43.690> have<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> lot<00:02:44.230> of

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
the thing is I don't have a lot of

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.620 
the thing is I don't have a lot of
options<00:02:44.770> locally<00:02:45.250> for<00:02:45.490> selling<00:02:46.000> my<00:02:46.120> games<00:02:46.390> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
options locally for selling my games and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.180 
options locally for selling my games and
I'm<00:02:47.290> certainly<00:02:47.590> not<00:02:47.709> trying<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.040> make<00:02:48.130> a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
I'm certainly not trying to make a

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.000 
I'm certainly not trying to make a
profit<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:49.570> vast<00:02:49.750> majority<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.380> games<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.860> my

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
profit the vast majority of games in my

received games that I don't have to pay

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.190 
received games that I don't have to pay
for<00:02:59.500> so<00:03:00.090> keeping<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.120> in<00:03:01.270> mind<00:03:01.420> what<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.900> did

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
for so keeping that in mind what I did

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.220 
for so keeping that in mind what I did
is<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.530> took<00:03:02.650> all<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:04.510> games<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.870> was<00:03:04.989> trying

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
is I took all of the games I was trying

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.140 
is I took all of the games I was trying
to<00:03:05.290> get<00:03:05.410> rid<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.920> my<00:03:06.040> local<00:03:06.280> game<00:03:06.610> group<00:03:06.940> and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
to get rid of to my local game group and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.090 
to get rid of to my local game group and
I<00:03:07.840> offered<00:03:08.020> them<00:03:08.200> at<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> flat<00:03:08.680> rate<00:03:08.709> of<00:03:08.950> five

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
I offered them at a flat rate of five

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.600 
I offered them at a flat rate of five
dollars<00:03:09.430> each<00:03:09.580> so<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:11.680> was<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.920> good<00:03:12.100> deal<00:03:12.310> in

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
dollars each so this was a good deal in

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.090 
dollars each so this was a good deal in
most<00:03:13.600> cases<00:03:13.870> but<00:03:14.080> especially<00:03:14.410> good<00:03:14.860> when

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
most cases but especially good when

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.250 
most cases but especially good when
you're<00:03:15.250> talking<00:03:15.640> about<00:03:15.820> games<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:16.420> sedition

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.620 
wars which I think was north of a
hundred<00:03:19.540> dollars<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.950> kick<00:03:21.160> start<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:22.510> you

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
could sell them as someone who didn't

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.030 
could sell them as someone who didn't
have<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:47.720> lot<00:04:47.960> of<00:04:47.990> practice<00:04:48.500> in<00:04:48.650> this<00:04:48.770> area<00:04:49.010> I
