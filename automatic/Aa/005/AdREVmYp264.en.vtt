our tutorial of how to do a selling and

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.240 
our tutorial of how to do a selling and
basically<00:00:08.809> we<00:00:09.809> started<00:00:10.230> off<00:00:10.349> with<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.710> 18

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
basically we started off with the 18

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.620 
basically we started off with the 18
inch<00:00:11.460> as<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.780> can<00:00:12.960> see<00:00:13.200> I<00:00:13.410> laid<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.070> trick

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
inch as you can see I laid the trick

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.599 
inch as you can see I laid the trick
coming<00:00:15.630> from<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.500> from<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.130> left<00:00:17.340> side

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
coming from this in from the left side

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.090 
coming from this in from the left side
and<00:00:18.060> make<00:00:18.240> sure<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.570> put<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.900> up<00:00:19.109> under<00:00:19.619> look

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and make sure you put it up under look

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.910 
and make sure you put it up under look
under<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.820> brain<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:22.500> all<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> way

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
under the brain and going all the way

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.420 
under the brain and going all the way
around<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.240> transit<00:00:24.810> two<00:00:25.680> tracks<00:00:26.130> as

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
around I like to transit two tracks as

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.810 
around I like to transit two tracks as
you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.539> one<00:00:28.050> two<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.680> all<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.550> way

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
you can see one two and all the way

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.370 
you can see one two and all the way
around<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.630> other<00:00:30.750> side<00:00:32.420> and<00:00:33.420> stopping

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
around to the other side and stopping

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.430 
around to the other side and stopping
right<00:00:34.800> here<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.570> started<00:00:37.320> up

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
right here so you can see I started up

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.040 
right here so you can see I started up
here<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.460> two<00:00:38.730> tricks<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:39.930> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
here for the two tricks and then I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.200 
here for the two tricks and then I
stopped<00:00:40.410> right<00:00:40.770> here<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.430> then<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.989> back

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
stopped right here and then for the back

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.410 
stopped right here and then for the back
I'm<00:00:45.210> trying<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.140> feel<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:48.000> bed<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.390> be

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I'm trying to feel and so the bed can be

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
I'm trying to feel and so the bed can be
much<00:00:48.809> fuller<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.559> meet<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.070> rest<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
much fuller to meet with the rest of the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.680 
much fuller to meet with the rest of the
18<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.649> started<00:00:53.340> right<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.510> is

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
18 and I started right here so this is

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.860 
18 and I started right here so this is
my<00:00:54.870> third<00:00:55.140> trip<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.640> came<00:00:56.940> across<00:00:57.120> all<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
my third trip and I came across all the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.540 
my third trip and I came across all the
way<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.410> other<00:00:58.590> side<00:00:59.750> as<00:01:00.770> you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
way to the other side as you can see and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.450 
way to the other side as you can see and
I<00:01:03.329> didn't<00:01:03.690> cut<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.960> track<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.710> folded<00:01:05.280> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
I didn't cut the track I just folded it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.899 
I didn't cut the track I just folded it
back<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.570> meet<00:01:06.840> across<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.340> I'm<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> pick

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
back to meet across so I'm going to pick

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.950 
back to meet across so I'm going to pick
up<00:01:08.939> where<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> left<00:01:09.540> off<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:11.780> continue<00:01:12.780> with

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
up where I left off and continue with

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.170 
up where I left off and continue with
folding<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:17.369> traits<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:18.000> each<00:01:18.240> side<00:01:20.180> turn

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
folding the traits on each side turn

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
folding the traits on each side turn
around<00:01:21.479> for<00:01:21.810> me<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:25.590> might<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.130> able<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
around for me you might not be able to

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.429 
around for me you might not be able to
see<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.090> i'm<00:01:27.240> getting<00:01:27.479> ready<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> follow<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
see and i'm getting ready to follow the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.999 
see and i'm getting ready to follow the
truth<00:01:28.680> once<00:01:28.979> again<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.880> go<00:01:30.060> across<00:01:30.860> just<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
truth once again to go across just to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.499 
truth once again to go across just to
feel<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.270> back<00:01:33.509> part<00:01:34.790> like<00:01:35.790> i<00:01:35.820> said<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.299> do

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
feel in the back part like i said you do

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:47.850 
feel in the back part like i said you do
want<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.700> bottom<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:39.090> fool

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.319 

cycled<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.950> little<00:01:49.310> bit<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:49.759> it's<00:01:49.970> all<00:01:50.119> right

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
cycled a little bit but it's all right

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.560 
cycled a little bit but it's all right
with<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.689> untangle<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:51.820> keep<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:53.030> on<00:01:53.329> the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
with it untangle and keep this on the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:01.670 
with it untangle and keep this on the
road

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.620 

sometimes<00:02:02.680> your<00:02:03.490> strength<00:02:03.820> can<00:02:04.060> get<00:02:04.270> title

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
sometimes your strength can get title

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.980 
sometimes your strength can get title
because<00:02:04.960> it's<00:02:05.110> too<00:02:05.260> long<00:02:05.500> but<00:02:05.860> if<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.990> be

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
because it's too long but if you be

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.510 
because it's too long but if you be
cautious<00:02:08.290> you<00:02:08.770> can<00:02:08.920> get<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.929> untangled<00:02:14.520> see

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
cautious you can get it untangled see

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.700 
cautious you can get it untangled see
this<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:15.970> long<00:02:16.360> string<00:02:16.930> like<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.710> jump<00:02:18.130> rope

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
this is a long string like a jump rope

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.080 
this is a long string like a jump rope
but<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:20.860> longer<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.340> better<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.880> know<00:02:22.030> you

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
but the longer the better you know you

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.190 
but the longer the better you know you
don't<00:02:22.360> have<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.630> keep<00:02:22.810> threading<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:25.200> answer

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
don't have to keep threading and answer

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.400 
don't have to keep threading and answer
to<00:02:26.320> see<00:02:26.530> I'm<00:02:26.680> flipping<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.250> bed<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:29.170> go

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
to see I'm flipping this bed to go

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.790 
to see I'm flipping this bed to go
across<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:31.240> a<00:02:31.720> check<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.470> tricks

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
across and a check and the tricks

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.220 
across and a check and the tricks
artbeat<00:02:33.610> like<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.410> it's<00:02:35.590> kind<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.890> hard<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:37.230> get

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
artbeat like so it's kind of hard to get

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.380 
artbeat like so it's kind of hard to get
the<00:02:38.380> needle<00:02:38.770> through<00:02:38.800> with<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.910> all<00:02:40.150> right

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
the needle through with this all right

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.380 
the needle through with this all right
now<00:02:41.459> I'm<00:02:42.459> going<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:42.940> make<00:02:43.120> sure<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.540> tight

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
now I'm going to make sure this tight

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.470 
now I'm going to make sure this tight
and<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.630> don't<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.140> go<00:02:47.610> too<00:02:48.610> far<00:02:48.640> over<00:02:49.150> on

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
and you don't have to go too far over on

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.190
