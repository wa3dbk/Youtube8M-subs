 unless you can take less 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.270
 with more time depends on the speed 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.800
 of your internet but anyway I'm going to 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.080

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.300
 video so waiting for it to download 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.760
 I'm going to close here and then one time 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.740
 downloaded the gtc in adarias point that 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.780
 you have to pass it to the desk or where 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.840
 you want but do not let them go 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.090
 to lose nothing more 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.179
 we double click and you will read us 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.200
 this extractor or extracted as 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:39.630
 want to call installer and we give you 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.399
 we are going to click at this point that is not 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.829

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.420
 where we want to keep it here 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.119
 example I have it saved in this 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.710
 folder that ended up creating that little bit 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.930
 is it so 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.490
 and since already looking for they do not want to keep it 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.530
 here for example I'm going to do the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 proof that if I have it in extract and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.010
 cancel because you create will not 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.910
 give in cancel because they do not 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.190
 they still have but they just wait 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.200
 five minutes in which they are extracted if it is 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.690
 more or less what is extracted and then 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.310
 it would be all has nothing science just 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.230

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.540

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.670

 Well, we're going to where they kept it 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.060

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.660
