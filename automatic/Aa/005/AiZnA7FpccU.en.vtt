going to just not do them anymore I mean

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.580 
going to just not do them anymore I mean
I've<00:05:34.400> never<00:05:34.580> liked<00:05:34.940> how<00:05:35.540> I<00:05:35.570> do<00:05:35.720> tutorials<00:05:36.140> it's

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590

reason<00:05:40.130> that<00:05:40.160> I<00:05:40.280> ever<00:05:40.460> do<00:05:40.790> looks<00:05:41.300> is<00:05:41.600> because

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
reason that I ever do looks is because

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.600 
reason that I ever do looks is because
they're<00:05:42.229> requested<00:05:42.770> or<00:05:42.950> because<00:05:43.190> i<00:05:43.280> just<00:05:43.460> want

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610

a<00:06:03.979> lot<00:06:04.940> of<00:06:05.210> tutorials<00:06:05.690> that<00:06:06.169> I've<00:06:06.350> seen<00:06:06.620> in<00:06:06.740> the

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
a lot of tutorials that I've seen in the

that I always want to do tutorials is to

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.510 
that I always want to do tutorials is to

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
that's kind of the main reason I even

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.550

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
them but I just kind of don't like them

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.150 
them but I just kind of don't like them
I<00:06:29.330> don't<00:06:29.510> feel<00:06:29.660> like<00:06:29.810> I'm<00:06:29.990> so<00:06:30.410> blind<00:06:30.770> you<00:06:31.039> can

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
I don't feel like I'm so blind you can

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.950 
I don't feel like I'm so blind you can
never<00:06:31.280> get<00:06:31.460> a<00:06:31.490> good<00:06:31.669> angle<00:06:31.820> and<00:06:32.360> whatever<00:06:32.599> and

never get a good angle and whatever and

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.080 
never get a good angle and whatever and
the<00:06:33.620> thing<00:06:33.770> that<00:06:33.830> I<00:06:33.979> really<00:06:34.160> truly<00:06:34.580> enjoyed

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
the thing that I really truly enjoyed

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.909 
the thing that I really truly enjoyed
doing<00:06:35.300> are<00:06:35.660> the<00:06:35.900> splurge<00:06:36.140> vs.<00:06:36.500> deals<00:06:36.710> even

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
doing are the splurge vs. deals even

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.920 
doing are the splurge vs. deals even
though<00:06:37.190> I<00:06:37.460> know<00:06:37.820> I<00:06:37.970> dragged<00:06:38.330> to<00:06:38.479> put<00:06:38.660> them<00:06:38.810> out

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
though I know I dragged to put them out

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.540 
though I know I dragged to put them out
it<00:06:39.080> does<00:06:39.260> take<00:06:39.500> a<00:06:39.680> while<00:06:39.710> to<00:06:40.039> do<00:06:40.190> them<00:06:40.340> but

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
it does take a while to do them but

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.870 
it does take a while to do them but
