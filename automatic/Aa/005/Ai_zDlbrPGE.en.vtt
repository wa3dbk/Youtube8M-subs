00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
a grenade and on explosion we're both

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.459 
a grenade and on explosion we're both
going<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:48.969> go<00:00:49.149> that<00:00:49.600> way<00:00:49.659> it's<00:00:49.899> as<00:00:50.050> fair<00:00:50.350> as

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
possible all right there at the same

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.669 
possible all right there at the same
time<00:00:54.519> zentorno<00:00:55.269> takes<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:56.050> lead<00:00:56.289> with<00:00:56.559> that

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
time zentorno takes the lead with that

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.540 
time zentorno takes the lead with that
acceleration

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.150 

and<00:00:59.670> regret<00:01:00.660> i'm<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.440> sure<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.649> i'm<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.040> sure

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and regret i'm not sure if i'm not sure

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.090 
and regret i'm not sure if i'm not sure
if<00:01:02.250> there's<00:01:02.399> enough<00:01:02.640> length<00:01:02.940> for<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:04.100> ladder

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
if there's enough length for the ladder

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.859 
if there's enough length for the ladder
now<00:01:05.220> both<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.550> these<00:01:05.820> vehicles<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.450> stock

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
now both of these vehicles are stock

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.500 
now both of these vehicles are stock
they<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.860> absolutely<00:01:08.670> no<00:01:08.909> performance

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
they have absolutely no performance

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.890 
they have absolutely no performance
upgrades<00:01:09.930> whatsoever<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.030> this<00:01:12.030> intorno<00:01:12.510> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
upgrades whatsoever and this intorno is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.920 
upgrades whatsoever and this intorno is
just<00:01:13.500> destroying<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.640> now<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.090> think<00:01:15.750> the

just destroying right now I think the
toilet<00:01:16.440> is<00:01:16.560> better<00:01:16.800> without<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:18.030> stock

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
toilet is better without or with stock

oh well well I mean yeah the cousin
torno<00:01:26.040> has<00:01:26.159> insane<00:01:26.580> acceleration<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:28.670> ya<00:01:29.670> like

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
torno has insane acceleration so ya like

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.730 
torno has insane acceleration so ya like
like<00:01:30.509> there's<00:01:30.720> more<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.080> a<00:01:31.140> lead<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:31.619> they

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
like there's more of a lead when they

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.150 
like there's more of a lead when they
see<00:01:32.490> right<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.330> with<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.990> near<00:01:34.740> using

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
see right here like with a near using

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
stuff alright so we're about to toss the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.859 
stuff alright so we're about to toss the
grenade<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.440> back<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:44.009> another<00:01:44.160> round

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
grenade and go back with another round

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.660 
grenade and go back with another round
first<00:01:45.869> round<00:01:46.140> wasn't<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.039> good<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.520> adder

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
first round wasn't so good for the adder

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.650 
first round wasn't so good for the adder
and<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:50.340> intorno<00:01:50.700> again<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.240> going<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.479> take

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that lead and it's just it's nice not

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
that lead and it's just it's nice not
even<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> race

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
even a race

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.130 
even a race
Wow

track<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.120> with<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.450> outer<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.870> wind<00:02:08.110> but

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
track you with the outer of wind but

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.430 
track you with the outer of wind but
there<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.160> no<00:02:09.340> long<00:02:09.610> tracks<00:02:09.970> in<00:02:10.209> GTA<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:11.170> mean

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
authority were to go against each other

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.720 
authority were to go against each other
it's<00:02:23.500> really<00:02:23.680> going<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.860> depend<00:02:23.920> on<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.340> racer

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
it's really going to depend on the racer

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.990 
like we're on the straightaway that's
all<00:02:26.890> that's<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.250> yeah<00:02:27.580> well<00:02:27.760> it's<00:02:27.880> gonna

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
all that's that yeah well it's gonna

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.790 
all that's that yeah well it's gonna
come<00:02:28.209> down<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.450> down<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.290> straightaway<00:02:29.680> like

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
come down to down the straightaway like

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.949 
come down to down the straightaway like
if<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.550> racer<00:02:30.880> can<00:02:31.120> drive<00:02:31.390> good<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.900> I

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
if the racer can drive good and I

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.120 
if the racer can drive good and I
thought<00:02:32.110> that's<00:02:32.290> always<00:02:32.590> gonna<00:02:32.709> come<00:02:32.920> down<00:02:33.069> to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
thought that's always gonna come down to

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.990 
thought that's always gonna come down to
here<00:02:33.310> yeah<00:02:34.030> but<00:02:34.239> anyways<00:02:34.510> there<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.050> guys

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
here yeah but anyways there it is guys

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.390 
here yeah but anyways there it is guys
stock<00:02:37.000> vehicles<00:02:37.540> adder<00:02:37.810> versus<00:02:38.320> intorno<00:02:38.800> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
stock vehicles adder versus intorno the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.360 
stock vehicles adder versus intorno the
center<00:02:40.239> no<00:02:40.420> completely<00:02:41.200> annihilated<00:02:42.100> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
center no completely annihilated the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.580 
center no completely annihilated the
adder<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.970> had<00:02:43.450> previously<00:02:43.959> done<00:02:44.050> this<00:02:44.290> video

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
adder I had previously done this video

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.640 
adder I had previously done this video
both<00:02:45.040> cars<00:02:45.430> were<00:02:45.580> maximum<00:02:46.480> upgrades<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:48.330> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
both cars were maximum upgrades and the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.710 
both cars were maximum upgrades and the
adder<00:02:50.650> actually<00:02:51.280> still<00:02:51.610> lost<00:02:51.880> but<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.600> was<00:02:52.690> a

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
adder actually still lost but it was a

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.380 
adder actually still lost but it was a
lot<00:02:52.930> closer<00:02:53.170> of<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.560> race<00:02:53.769> now<00:02:53.800> with<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.850> stock

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
lot closer of a race now with this stock

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.570 
lot closer of a race now with this stock
version<00:02:55.690> both<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.320> them<00:02:56.410> stock<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:57.370> adder

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
version both of them stock the adder

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.670 
version both of them stock the adder
just<00:02:58.030> completely<00:02:58.510> had<00:02:58.750> no<00:02:58.989> chance<00:02:59.290> with<00:02:59.560> an

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
just completely had no chance with an

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.910 
just completely had no chance with an
acceleration<00:02:59.950> thats<00:03:00.580> intorno<00:03:01.000> has<00:03:01.209> so<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:02.470> hope

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
acceleration thats intorno has so I hope

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.229 
acceleration thats intorno has so I hope
