00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.100
 today, August 15 is singles' day 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.189
 and to celebrate this date the cars will 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.990
 introduce two passionate bachelors 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.680
 but for their cars 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.320
 Hello, my name is Felipe, I'm 33 years old. 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.750
 hello my name is small at 28 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.769
 I collect my hobby modify the car 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.140
 cars 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.140
 I'm looking for I'm looking for 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.610
 then my first car was a 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.740
 I cut a lot of the cost I could find a 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.530
 with little girl 1.0 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.110
 That was the first one, that's when I saw 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.780
 that I would not have been able to start there 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.729
 In this automotive branch, my image 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.400
 of the seven years occurred on the first floor 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.850
 I had the will of the father had some cars 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.680
 and sells it so well it's dust and even that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.290
 could have kept that bid 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.990
 This is my best friend, turn and move. 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.240
 Barbecue machines at her house instead 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.509
 to stay there and talk a lot 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.580
 people to mess around in cars washing 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.009
 waiting enveloping whatever you have to 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.360
 do not be doing anything after I come 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.670
 and chongqing though it is later I come back in the day 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.880
 I'm going to touch others then I have 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.100
 a certain routine really had 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.530
 subaru wrx and I had to choose 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.930
 between him and richard generate would not choose 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.390
 a more comprehensive text with certainty 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.540
 but there's nothing like that, girlfriend. 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.850
 get jealous, netÃ£o, do you think he likes 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.459
 more of the car than her 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.350
 another love is for the cars is one or the other 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.280
 but it's a reflection I'm liking 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.140
 accompanied me to accompany the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.660
 things do not like or for nothing no more 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.730
 few people see here until today have a 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.209
 brother of mine who never came here brother 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.549
 also 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.519
 everybody asks me, is it because son? 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.830
 is to pretend because so first he is 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.269
 sloth does not thirst for ice age yet 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.080
 very lazy 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:54.040
 so it was my 1.0 car so he is 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:56.530
 well delivered soso even comes home in the 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.640
 Saturday night by girlfriend was well on 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.970
 gasoline the time she liked it 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.770
 not right but she understands but not right 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.810
 is that the car does not have a history is 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.069
 sold before still has enough time 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.380
 I know by understanding our girlfriend in my 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.180
 foot car matters I like this one myself 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.140
 I like her for the car now . 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.050
 currently 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.070
 Looks is like living sums up in one word 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.470
 just think I'm in love with all 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.450
 my cars if possible I think I 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.030
 I would find everyone to leave them 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.690
 kept in mind that this is how each 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.900
 story is I lived good and bad times 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.410
 Not everyone was here for me, just like that. 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.450
 We're understanding that they're not for 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.410
 me he has the name of my value 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.900
 the one that my grandmother never 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.150
 So I say I'm going to give you a name on the 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.349
 story 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.349
 everyone here takes place 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.780
 for two singles in love with 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.420
 same subject nothing like a conversation 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.330
 common about cars people who give more 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.440
 I work boyfriend girlfriend or car 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:14.530
 boyfriend 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.810
 the band of the night because it does not speak nor 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.400
 lack there tranquilinho not reach 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.960
 time difference in angola where nobody 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.150
 Mother's boyfriend there and for you. 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.230
 need I agree I also think 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.050
 in car you go there do everything you want 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.830
 in the car he does not complain they are if you 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.120
 Whether or not you send it your way, it's not 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.520
 dedicated to cars and home 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.740
 girlfriend at night time 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:47.530
 car and the two should not be together not 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:49.360
 combine well but be single 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.010
 makes this love much easier in this 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.590
 passion for the cars, right? 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.750
 to my side makes it a little easier because 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.840
 I participate a lot of championship event 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.690
 the club then let's say so the 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.130
 have to accept that 99% of the 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.630
 my friends are men 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.110
 I ended up having to think a little more 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.060
 even occurs as an option to exit 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.530
 with the cars in the race so I think 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.040
 ends up having a little more time 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.600
 if it were batch cause then more concerned 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.550
 so I think it has a little more 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.040
 time for a trophy 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.020
 so now I'll leave them alone but 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.169
 as the passion of their lives 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.910
 the car because in this case the le mer before 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.910
 only poorly transported 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:37.419
 only adds another context 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.990
 What about 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.800
 and it looks like it was painted on the way and that 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.800
 at the end of the morning there is no
