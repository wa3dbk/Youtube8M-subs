set up of the speed runner now I'm not
gonna<00:01:32.340> play<00:01:32.579> back<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.030> footage<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.450> real<00:01:33.630> time

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
gonna play back the footage in real time

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.990

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
built nowhere escape mission guardians

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.310 
built nowhere escape mission guardians
of<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.269> galaxy<00:04:18.329> set

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
of the galaxy set

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.680 
of the galaxy set
I<00:04:19.350> started<00:04:19.919> at<00:04:20.070> 8<00:04:20.250> 49<00:04:20.729> 52<00:04:21.740> finished<00:04:22.740> at<00:04:23.000> 942<00:04:24.000> 24

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
I started at 8 49 52 finished at 942 24

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.620 
I started at 8 49 52 finished at 942 24
so<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.770> I'm<00:04:25.919> doing<00:04:25.949> my<00:04:26.370> math<00:04:26.610> right<00:04:26.880> that's<00:04:27.240> 52

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
so if I'm doing my math right that's 52

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.469 
so if I'm doing my math right that's 52
minutes<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.380> 32<00:04:28.770> seconds<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.729> really<00:04:30.330> don't

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
minutes and 32 seconds I really don't

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.540 
minutes and 32 seconds I really don't
know<00:04:30.600> if<00:04:30.630> that's<00:04:30.870> good<00:04:31.110> or<00:04:31.139> bad<00:04:31.320> I<00:04:31.650> know<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.310> am

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
know if that's good or bad I know I am

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.460 
know if that's good or bad I know I am
