00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.649
 Together I am the tom of the pc 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.030
 games hardware and i got myself today 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.559
 again with the editorial 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.139
 but not taken to the test lab 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.429
 but directly in the editorial with 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.139
 not no no behind me 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.630
 usually the man with the beard 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.580
 stefan sit if he was there and 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.039
 I present you today the boulder 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.140
 eco that is a small compact model 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.590
 from the ever-popular and well-known 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.230
 brocken two of our readers already 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.520
 it should be known a while 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.130
 model is a whole bit again 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.930
 cheaper namely about 25 euros in the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.510
 free trade is common for all 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.750
 suitable base 11 50 11 55 11 56 3 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.489
 1 3 + m 2 and co 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:53.579
 and let's see what I'm into 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:56.910
 this pack everything finds one 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.649
 plastic cover then we have here 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.190
 once the foot two fans with a y 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.960
 electric wire 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.420
 there can also be a second fan 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.159
 then connect four pwm 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.970
 Connections of the cooler itself which you good 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.119
 able to see 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.259
 the heatpipes with dcm surface that 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.000
 means those are down here plan 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.450
 ground and are thus directly on 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.650
 the cpu on we do the whole thing to the side 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.360
 also quite good to see is that the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.270
 dimensions be relatively small that one 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.820
 120 mm fan and we have it 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.610
 yet another plastic cover and 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:39.210
 under here again we find the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.860
 assembly kit for intel and amd then four 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.570
 ventilators in general means that means you 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.189
 can easily synonymous a second fan 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.570
 to the cooler then a small 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.570
 syringe with thermal grease 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:01.330
 fastening screws for the various 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:03.860
 sock even more fixing screws 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.770
 that here the vacation already four small 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.530
 These are rubber spacers which are nubs 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.000
 he can stick to the fan and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.370
 thus for a decoupling of the fan 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.370
 could provide something less 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.290
 range noise pollution then 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.050
 is beneficial and then we have here 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.730
 still the backplate will be there then 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.970
 Fastening screws pushed by 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.890
 the back of the mainboard and to 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:35.080
 good last then another folder with 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.100
 a German and very sufficient 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.030
 arrogantly illustrated 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.620
 user manual assembly instructions the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.440
 it was what we found in the carton space 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.210
 a bit fun with the unboxing the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.610
 test results from the cooler you read 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.290
 loaded in the articles of this video here 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.290
 have fun and see you next time
