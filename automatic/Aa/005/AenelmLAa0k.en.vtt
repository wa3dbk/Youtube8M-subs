00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
clean your hands just like you do your

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.170 
clean your hands just like you do your
trial<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.800> you<00:01:57.160> run<00:01:57.370> them<00:01:57.550> back<00:01:57.730> on<00:01:57.970> there

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
trial and you run them back on there

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.090 
trial and you run them back on there
you'll<00:01:58.330> lay<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.540> lot<00:01:58.750> of<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:58.990> fiber<00:01:59.320> down<00:01:59.680> and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
you'll lay a lot of that fiber down and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.060 
you'll lay a lot of that fiber down and
you<00:02:00.940> won't<00:02:01.120> be<00:02:01.240> engaging<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:01.840> again<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:05.140> it's

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
you won't be engaging it again it it's

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.460 
you won't be engaging it again it it's
it's<00:02:06.400> it's<00:02:06.610> ok<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.120> think<00:02:07.300> we'll<00:02:07.540> be<00:02:07.720> we're<00:02:08.440> just

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
it's it's ok I think we'll be we're just

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.970 
it's it's ok I think we'll be we're just
going<00:02:08.740> to<00:02:08.800> do<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.010> like<00:02:09.130> we<00:02:09.250> did<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:10.770> or<00:02:11.770> you

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
going to do it like we did that or you

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.240 
going to do it like we did that or you
can<00:02:12.130> just<00:02:12.280> texture<00:02:12.670> over<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:16.739> well<00:02:17.739> it<00:02:17.860> depends

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
can just texture over it well it depends

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.320 
can just texture over it well it depends
on<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.370> rock<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.850> you're<00:02:19.000> dealing<00:02:19.180> with

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
on the rock that you're dealing with

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:30.630 
on the rock that you're dealing with
actually<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.850> lot<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:22.000> times

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.100 

before<00:02:31.640> exactly<00:02:32.210> did<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> word<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.840> can't

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
before exactly did the word you can't

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.020 
before exactly did the word you can't
really<00:02:33.380> move<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:34.340> depends<00:02:34.850> on<00:02:34.910> the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
really move it depends on the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.460 
really move it depends on the
temperature<00:02:35.510> today<00:02:35.720> it's<00:02:36.080> going<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.290> be<00:02:36.380> an

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
temperature today it's going to be an

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.540 
temperature today it's going to be an
hour<00:02:36.620> maybe<00:02:37.370> two<00:02:37.700> it's<00:02:38.480> colder<00:02:39.140> as<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:40.100> start

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
hour maybe two it's colder as you start

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.970 
hour maybe two it's colder as you start
getting<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.540> ninety<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:42.290> going<00:02:42.620> off<00:02:42.770> in

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
getting it in ninety it's going off in

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.730 
getting it in ninety it's going off in
five<00:02:43.190> ten<00:02:43.460> minutes<00:02:43.490> honest<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.390> god

summertime<00:02:55.430> just<00:02:55.550> keeping<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:55.970> moving<00:02:56.090> if<00:02:56.660> you

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
summertime just keeping it moving if you

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.420 
summertime just keeping it moving if you
keep<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:57.200> moving<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.680> can<00:02:57.800> extend<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.280> if

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
keep it moving then you can extend it if

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.860 
keep it moving then you can extend it if
you<00:02:58.550> just<00:02:58.760> let<00:02:58.940> it<00:02:59.030> sit<00:02:59.180> there<00:02:59.330> five<00:02:59.630> 10

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
if you want an at a 90 you know how you

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.230 
if you want an at a 90 you know how you
get<00:03:24.740> that<00:03:24.890> crisp<00:03:25.250> like<00:03:25.520> let's<00:03:25.880> see<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.090> edge

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
get that crisp like let's see that edge

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.040 
get that crisp like let's see that edge
how<00:03:26.390> it's<00:03:26.540> crisp

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
how it's crisp

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.390 
how it's crisp
I'm<00:03:27.110> going<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.620> reduce<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.100> amount<00:03:28.340> of

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
I'm going to reduce the amount of

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.700 
I'm going to reduce the amount of
grinding<00:03:28.850> we<00:03:29.330> take<00:03:29.570> one<00:03:29.810> mil<00:03:30.020> plastic<00:03:30.560> or

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
grinding we take one mil plastic or

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.620 
grinding we take one mil plastic or
shrink<00:03:30.980> wrap<00:03:31.220> lay<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.760> over<00:03:31.880> here<00:03:32.150> work<00:03:32.420> out

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
shrink wrap lay it over here work out

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.050 
shrink wrap lay it over here work out
the<00:03:32.780> air<00:03:32.900> bubbles<00:03:33.260> it's<00:03:33.470> smooth<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:34.880> there's<00:03:35.030> a

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
the air bubbles it's smooth so there's a

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.760 
the air bubbles it's smooth so there's a
lot<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.330> ways<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.600> looking<00:03:35.720> at<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.110> as<00:03:36.320> far<00:03:36.680> as

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
lot of ways of looking at this as far as

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.410 
lot of ways of looking at this as far as
texture<00:03:37.070> with<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.400> rougher<00:03:37.820> Rock<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.270> our

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
texture with this rougher Rock to our

texture with this rougher Rock to our
texture<00:03:38.870> mud<00:03:39.020> you<00:03:39.440> wouldn't<00:03:39.680> have<00:03:39.770> to<00:03:39.860> grind

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
texture mud you wouldn't have to grind

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.260 
texture mud you wouldn't have to grind
this<00:03:40.280> if<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.550> didn't<00:03:40.760> want<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.120> can<00:03:41.239> just

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
this if you didn't want to you can just

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.670 
this if you didn't want to you can just
put<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.570> texture<00:03:41.870> mode<00:03:42.020> right<00:03:42.290> over<00:03:42.560> it

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
put the texture mode right over it

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.290 
put the texture mode right over it
there's<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.340> lot<00:03:43.550> of<00:03:43.700> ways<00:03:43.820> and<00:03:43.970> we're<00:03:44.090> trying

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
there's a lot of ways and we're trying

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.390 
there's a lot of ways and we're trying
to<00:03:44.390> show<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:45.230> different<00:03:45.680> aspects<00:03:46.250> of

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
to show you the different aspects of

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.240 
to show you the different aspects of
procedure<00:03:47.390> there<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:48.110> not<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.770> depends<00:03:49.190> on

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
procedure there is not it depends on

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.770 
procedure there is not it depends on
what<00:03:49.430> you're<00:03:49.550> making<00:03:52.090> what<00:03:53.170> do<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.230> mean<00:03:55.780> what

what you're making what do you mean what

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.300 
what you're making what do you mean what
do<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:56.930> mean<00:03:57.020> by<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:57.260> adding<00:03:57.800> more<00:03:57.830> acrylic
