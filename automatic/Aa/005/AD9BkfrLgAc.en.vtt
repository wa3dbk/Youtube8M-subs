00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
Vandenberg also in July SpaceX is hoping

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.670 
Vandenberg also in July SpaceX is hoping
to<00:02:24.580> launch<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.970> jason-3<00:02:25.410> spacecraft<00:02:26.410> for

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
to launch the jason-3 spacecraft for

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.770 
to launch the jason-3 spacecraft for
NASA<00:02:26.890> but<00:02:27.670> then<00:02:27.790> back<00:02:28.000> at<00:02:28.180> Cape<00:02:28.360> Canaveral

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
NASA but then back at Cape Canaveral

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.660 
NASA but then back at Cape Canaveral
later<00:02:29.260> on<00:02:29.500> this<00:02:29.680> year<00:02:29.739> they're<00:02:30.160> also<00:02:30.310> hoping

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
later on this year they're also hoping

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.150 
later on this year they're also hoping
to<00:02:30.880> have<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.270> first<00:02:31.630> Falcon<00:02:32.410> Heavy<00:02:32.650> test

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
to have the first Falcon Heavy test

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.490 
to have the first Falcon Heavy test
flight<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.849> that's<00:02:34.720> going<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.020> give<00:02:35.260> them<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
flight and that's going to give them a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.380 
flight and that's going to give them a
lot<00:02:35.739> of<00:02:35.890> capability<00:02:36.489> if<00:02:36.640> that's<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.970> success

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
lot of capability if that's a success

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.479 
lot of capability if that's a success
but<00:02:38.020> they're<00:02:38.170> also<00:02:38.319> planning<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.160> launch

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
but they're also planning to launch

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.309 
but they're also planning to launch
several<00:02:39.730> other<00:02:40.030> communication<00:02:40.780> satellites

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
several other communication satellites

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.309 
several other communication satellites
this<00:02:41.560> year<00:02:41.860> for<00:02:42.160> word<00:02:42.550> calm<00:02:42.880> space<00:02:43.420> calm<00:02:43.780> Asia

this year for word calm space calm Asia
broadcast<00:02:45.069> satellite<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.880> more<00:02:46.270> providers

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
broadcast satellite and more providers

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.140 
broadcast satellite and more providers
and<00:02:47.110> all<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:48.010> those<00:02:48.130> targeted<00:02:48.610> launch<00:02:48.790> dates

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
and all of those targeted launch dates

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.360 
and all of those targeted launch dates
are<00:02:49.420> probably<00:02:50.170> going<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.650> move<00:02:50.830> it's<00:02:51.130> never

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
are probably going to move it's never

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.180 
are probably going to move it's never
quite<00:02:51.700> final<00:02:52.300> until<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:53.319> know<00:02:53.440> leading<00:02:53.860> right

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
quite final until you know leading right

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.940 
quite final until you know leading right
up<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.550> launch<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.970> even<00:02:55.300> then<00:02:55.540> you<00:02:55.900> know

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
up to the launch and even then you know

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.470 
up to the launch and even then you know
weather<00:02:56.950> delays<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.760> different<00:02:58.060> things<00:02:58.270> like

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
weather delays and different things like

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.630 
weather delays and different things like
that<00:02:58.540> can<00:02:58.989> cause<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.530> targeted<00:03:00.069> launch<00:03:00.190> date<00:03:00.489> to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
that can cause a targeted launch date to

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.000 
that can cause a targeted launch date to
slip<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.150> day<00:03:01.390> or<00:03:01.510> two<00:03:01.720> so<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:02.260> don't<00:03:02.650> want<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.860> get

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
slip a day or two so I don't want to get

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.440 
slip a day or two so I don't want to get
too<00:03:03.220> much<00:03:03.250> into<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.790> dates<00:03:04.060> for<00:03:04.330> those

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
too much into the dates for those

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.310 
too much into the dates for those
launches<00:03:04.930> but<00:03:05.230> let's<00:03:05.890> just<00:03:06.720> it's<00:03:07.720> easy<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.140> say

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
launches but let's just it's easy to say

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.510 
launches but let's just it's easy to say
that<00:03:08.350> SpaceX<00:03:08.980> has<00:03:09.040> a

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
that SpaceX has a

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.520 
that SpaceX has a
a<00:03:09.550> busy<00:03:10.030> year<00:03:10.300> for<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.660> rest<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.110> year<00:03:11.320> so

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
a busy year for the rest of the year so

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.700 
a busy year for the rest of the year so
at<00:03:12.280> least<00:03:12.400> concerning<00:03:12.970> Cru<00:03:13.390> capability<00:03:14.170> after

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
at least concerning Cru capability after

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.130 
at least concerning Cru capability after
the<00:03:14.830> in-flight<00:03:15.310> abort<00:03:15.700> test<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.600> big<00:03:16.810> flights

the in-flight abort test the big flights

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.080 
the in-flight abort test the big flights
after<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.710> as<00:03:17.860> SpaceX<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.460> planning<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.850> have

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
after that as SpaceX is planning to have

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.560 
after that as SpaceX is planning to have

International Space Station and after

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.280 
International Space Station and after
the<00:03:27.340> critical<00:03:27.520> design<00:03:27.910> review<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.750> after

the critical design review and after
passing<00:03:29.740> all<00:03:29.830> of<00:03:29.980> NASA's<00:03:30.370> tests<00:03:30.790> they<00:03:31.450> will<00:03:31.840> be

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
passing all of NASA's tests they will be

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.070 
passing all of NASA's tests they will be
able<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.380> be<00:03:32.500> certified<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.370> begin<00:03:33.820> crew<00:03:34.570> taxi

services from the international space

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.060 
services from the international space
station<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.540> that's<00:03:38.050> awesome<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.740> once<00:03:38.890> they

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
station so that's awesome and once they

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.620 
station so that's awesome and once they
have<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.640> certification<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.600> that

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
have that certification and that

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.500 
have that certification and that
capability<00:03:41.260> stuff<00:03:42.220> like<00:03:42.520> Bigelow<00:03:43.150> Space

vehicles to start sending people up to

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.440 
vehicles to start sending people up to
those<00:03:50.560> space<00:03:50.830> stations<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.850> course<00:03:52.150> he<00:03:52.270> has<00:03:52.420> to

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
those space stations of course he has to

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.090 
those space stations of course he has to
launch<00:03:52.870> one<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.170> these<00:03:53.410> larger<00:03:53.800> space

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
launch one of these larger space

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.390 
launch one of these larger space

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
stations the B a330 first but that is
