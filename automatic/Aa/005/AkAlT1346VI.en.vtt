00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 is that the very first north derby has it 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.250
 was a trophy game that funnily enough the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.840
 scored the first goal 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.269
 motto who also played this 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.350
 first goal like that would have to be relatively high 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.449
 have been victorious 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.900
 I think 41 meters won that was 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.170
 I have to think about quarterfinal 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.269
 89 the first time from the beginning 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.800
 I have not believed yet 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.140
 a ball contact until then and got 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.880
 by bruno pezzey with a long pass 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.260
 Tor said human but wanted the heat 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.250
 that's what I think if I'm 35 right now 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.719
 you do not have any more 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.809
 you can send one is young 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.059
 enough yes and then the stairs were up and 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.780
 with it the ball in and then 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.010
 all the dams broke 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.440
 Clearly you all first come from 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.570
 started and did not come through individual 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.070
 career has made career back then 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.120
 It still the wonderful man I cover 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.050
 have the then playmaker thomas 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.149
 from heesen completely out of the game 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.770
 taken as individual and that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.420
 was actually the start of the career 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.210
 for me too here was a nice 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.240
 experience and would be happy to original 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.409
 marco bode then by hoe I can 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.049
 I have to remember that too 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.180
 say how this is so then you have Libyan 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.590
 because also much visited had and on 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.869
 find a house since this evening 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.369
 Let's crack because it's your goal 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.840
 One can then also made one was 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.159
 short night for me and my boys 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.450
 could then also in this tree 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.030
 sleep i had to go back to training 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.610
 I did not play and then leave 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.509
 The training starts at 10 and usually 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:39.299
 2011 had ended and it was 12 15 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.409
 what we training and 30 128 hours ago 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.210
 has made us really round 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.170
 You can do it according to the principle 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.890
 The Thomas is campaigning the training 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.630
 usually less done 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.710
 but since I knew what was going on yesterday 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.659
 we have a little bit more in the evening 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.659
 did you really deserve it?
