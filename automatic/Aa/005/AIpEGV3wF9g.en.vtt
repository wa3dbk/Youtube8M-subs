00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
you have Netflix because most of the

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.740 
you have Netflix because most of the
episodes<00:06:16.710> on<00:06:16.889> this<00:06:17.039> DVD<00:06:17.250> are<00:06:17.820> already<00:06:18.539> on

episodes on this DVD are already on

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.200 
episodes on this DVD are already on
Netflix<00:06:19.789> so<00:06:21.770> like<00:06:22.770> if<00:06:23.009> you<00:06:23.039> if<00:06:23.580> you<00:06:23.759> travel<00:06:24.150> on

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210

the<00:06:24.360> road<00:06:24.570> a<00:06:24.599> lot<00:06:24.840> and<00:06:24.900> you<00:06:25.169> don't<00:06:25.349> have<00:06:25.470> a

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
the road a lot and you don't have a

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.710

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
winter internet connection or whatever

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.260 
winter internet connection or whatever
I'd<00:06:28.530> recommend<00:06:28.919> getting<00:06:29.009> this<00:06:29.280> but<00:06:29.520> if<00:06:29.970> you're

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
I'd recommend getting this but if you're

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.810 
I'd recommend getting this but if you're
available<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:31.349> internet<00:06:31.949> most<00:06:32.430> of<00:06:32.520> the<00:06:32.610> time

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
available to internet most of the time

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.459 
available to internet most of the time

00:06:34.459 --> 00:06:34.469 
or whatever you'd like to watch this

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:36.140 
or whatever you'd like to watch this
kind<00:06:34.650> of<00:06:34.770> DVD<00:06:35.159> and<00:06:35.370> you're<00:06:35.729> available<00:06:35.909> to

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
kind of DVD and you're available to

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.750 
kind of DVD and you're available to
internet<00:06:36.479> connection<00:06:36.930> I<00:06:37.080> just<00:06:37.800> recommend

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
internet connection I just recommend

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.940 
internet connection I just recommend
not<00:06:39.120> spending<00:06:39.540> the<00:06:39.630> $10<00:06:40.170> and<00:06:40.440> just<00:06:40.650> watching

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
not spending the $10 and just watching

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.490 
not spending the $10 and just watching
on<00:06:41.100> Netflix<00:06:41.130> because<00:06:41.820> you<00:06:41.970> know<00:06:42.500> they're

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
on Netflix because you know they're

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.200 
on Netflix because you know they're
already<00:06:43.650> on<00:06:43.830> Netflix<00:06:44.340> but<00:06:44.370> they<00:06:44.910> could<00:06:45.060> take

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
already on Netflix but they could take

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.670 
already on Netflix but they could take
it<00:06:45.390> off<00:06:45.480> Netflix<00:06:45.960> and<00:06:46.080> this<00:06:46.170> could<00:06:46.380> become<00:06:46.530> a

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
it off Netflix and this could become a

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.040 
it off Netflix and this could become a
collector<00:06:47.190> as<00:06:47.310> a<00:06:47.340> dish<00:06:47.580> or<00:06:47.790> collector's<00:06:48.690> item

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050
