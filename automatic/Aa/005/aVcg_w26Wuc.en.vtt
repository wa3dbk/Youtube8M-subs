one<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.289> them<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.560> going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.480> little

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
one of them is going to be a little

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.050 
one of them is going to be a little
oxalate<00:00:28.080> because<00:00:28.980> some<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> people<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:29.970> our

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
oxalate because some of people in our

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.020 
oxalate because some of people in our
family<00:00:30.090> are<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:30.900> suspect<00:00:31.529> our<00:00:31.769> allergic<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.850> it

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
family are we suspect our allergic to it

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.280 
family are we suspect our allergic to it
more<00:00:33.270> sensitive<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:34.010> oxalates<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:36.020> one<00:00:37.020> just

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
more sensitive to oxalates and one just

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.690 
more sensitive to oxalates and one just
regular<00:00:37.649> juice<00:00:37.860> it'll<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.190> everything<00:00:38.579> in

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
regular juice it'll have everything in

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.600 
regular juice it'll have everything in
it<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.050> base<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.590> our<00:00:40.770> juice<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
it so the base for our juice is going to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.840 
it so the base for our juice is going to
be<00:00:43.070> celery<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.370> green<00:00:45.059> leaf<00:00:45.329> lettuce<00:00:46.850> we're

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
