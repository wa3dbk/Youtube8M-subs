00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.670 
love but if I was going for a long walk
where<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.820> might<00:02:22.970> be<00:02:23.150> doing<00:02:23.300> some<00:02:23.570> hiking<00:02:23.810> or<00:02:24.350> if

where I might be doing some hiking or if

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.160 
where I might be doing some hiking or if
I<00:02:24.830> was<00:02:24.980> going<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.400> gym<00:02:25.760> or<00:02:26.060> going<00:02:26.930> for<00:02:27.110> a

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
I was going to the gym or going for a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.960 
I was going to the gym or going for a
jog<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.650> last<00:02:27.860> thing<00:02:28.010> I<00:02:28.040> would<00:02:28.130> want<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.460> do<00:02:28.700> is

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
jog the last thing I would want to do is

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.360 
jog the last thing I would want to do is
risk<00:02:29.360> this<00:02:29.720> as<00:02:29.900> my<00:02:30.080> music<00:02:30.380> player<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.980> risk

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
risk this as my music player and risk

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
risk this as my music player and risk
damaging<00:02:32.030> it

damaging it

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.830 
damaging it
so<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.290> Archos<00:02:33.650> clipper<00:02:34.420> not<00:02:35.420> only<00:02:35.690> is<00:02:35.750> it
