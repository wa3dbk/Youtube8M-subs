as<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.860> see<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> added<00:01:17.759> just<00:01:18.450> one

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
as you can see here it added just one

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.090 
as you can see here it added just one
track<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.860> entire<00:01:20.220> project<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.920> also

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
track in the entire project and it also

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.539 
track in the entire project and it also
actually<00:01:23.580> loaded<00:01:24.299> up<00:01:24.509> some<00:01:25.439> preset<00:01:26.159> guitar

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
actually loaded up some preset guitar

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.830 
actually loaded up some preset guitar
here<00:01:28.369> these<00:01:29.369> are<00:01:29.579> good<00:01:29.850> starting<00:01:30.420> points<00:01:30.750> I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
here these are good starting points I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.649 
here these are good starting points I
guess<00:01:31.340> they're<00:01:32.340> very<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.729> very<00:01:32.939> specific<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
guess they're very all very specific and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.649 
guess they're very all very specific and
I<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:34.170> don't<00:01:34.380> prefer<00:01:34.770> any<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> presets

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
I just don't prefer any of the presets

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.120 
I just don't prefer any of the presets
really<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.780> any<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.409> these<00:01:37.500> programs<00:01:37.710> they're

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
really in any of these programs they're

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.420 
really in any of these programs they're
just<00:01:38.310> not<00:01:39.590> they<00:01:40.590> don't<00:01:40.680> zoom<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:41.009> made<00:01:41.280> by

just logic
you<00:02:38.970> know<00:02:39.120> logic<00:02:39.570> amp<00:02:39.870> program<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.950> comes

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
you know logic amp program that comes

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.440 
you know logic amp program that comes
with<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:42.300> mono<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:44.550> as<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.000> can<00:02:45.180> see

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
with it and then mono and as you can see

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.800 
with it and then mono and as you can see
that<00:02:45.690> loaded<00:02:46.110> up<00:02:46.260> here<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.660> amp

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
that loaded up here the the amp

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.350 
that loaded up here the the amp
simulator<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.740> program<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:51.180> just

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
simulator in the program and it just

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.360 
simulator in the program and it just
defaulted<00:02:51.840> here<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.500> one<00:02:52.770> here<00:02:53.600> up<00:02:54.600> here

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
defaulted here to this one here up here

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.440 
defaulted here to this one here up here
these<00:02:56.370> are<00:02:56.610> all<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.910> know<00:03:00.030> basic

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
kind of get to the basic amp model is

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.410 
kind of get to the basic amp model is
the<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:14.250> know<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.490> combo<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:14.940> at<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.090> load<00:03:15.240> of<00:03:15.330> a

keep<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:28.080> basic<00:03:28.560> amp<00:03:28.770> on<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.959> logic<00:03:31.470> you

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
keep a basic amp on the in logic you

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.210 
keep a basic amp on the in logic you
know<00:03:31.709> not<00:03:31.920> no<00:03:32.070> effects<00:03:32.430> no<00:03:32.820> delays<00:03:33.150> no

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
can see here the amp I'll go ahead and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.640 
can see here the amp I'll go ahead and
select<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:47.220> like<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:49.170> know<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:49.290> modern

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.240 

so<00:06:40.720> none<00:06:40.900> of<00:06:40.930> them<00:06:41.140> sounds<00:06:41.470> specifically<00:06:42.040> bad

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
so none of them sounds specifically bad

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:51.490 
so none of them sounds specifically bad
but<00:06:42.580> they're<00:06:42.700> all<00:06:42.790> very<00:06:42.820> specific<00:06:43.780> sounding

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.900 

are<00:06:52.500> the<00:06:52.650> delays<00:06:53.010> in<00:06:53.040> there<00:06:53.460> and<00:06:53.610> things<00:06:53.760> like

are the delays in there and things like

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.000 
are the delays in there and things like
that<00:06:53.970> so<00:06:54.840> I<00:06:54.870> mean<00:06:55.140> they're<00:06:55.440> fun<00:06:55.710> to<00:06:55.740> play
