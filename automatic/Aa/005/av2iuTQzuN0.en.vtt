and<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.110> just<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.469> final<00:00:02.460> look<00:00:02.879> or<00:00:03.149> a

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
and this is just a final look or a

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.150 
and this is just a final look or a
wrap-up<00:00:03.689> I<00:00:04.049> guess<00:00:04.440> you<00:00:04.529> could<00:00:04.650> call<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:04.859> of

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
wrap-up I guess you could call it of

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.220 
wrap-up I guess you could call it of
Rick's<00:00:07.550> just<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.700> see<00:00:08.910> whatever<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.929> haven't

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
Rick's just to see whatever I haven't

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.870 
Rick's just to see whatever I haven't
covered<00:00:10.410> yet<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.160> guess<00:00:11.280> I'll<00:00:11.519> start<00:00:11.700> with

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
covered yet so I guess I'll start with

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.810 
covered yet so I guess I'll start with
how<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.330> make<00:00:12.570> his<00:00:13.410> arm<00:00:13.620> cannon<00:00:13.980> take<00:00:14.549> Leo's

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
how to make his arm cannon take Leo's

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.820 
how to make his arm cannon take Leo's
canon<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.240> course<00:00:17.359> and<00:00:18.359> then<00:00:18.690> take<00:00:18.960> Fordyce's

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
canon of course and then take Fordyce's

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.450 
canon of course and then take Fordyce's
guns<00:00:20.869> fold<00:00:21.869> them<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.220> start

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
guns fold them in you do have to start

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.120 
guns fold them in you do have to start
with<00:00:23.730> Fordyce's<00:00:24.180> guns<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.810> make<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> gun<00:00:25.230> you

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
with Fordyce's guns to make the gun you

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.890 
with Fordyce's guns to make the gun you
just<00:00:26.250> notice<00:00:26.550> they<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.910> these<00:00:27.269> ridges<00:00:27.720> cut

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
just notice they have these ridges cut

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.060 
just notice they have these ridges cut
out<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.170> them<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.429> simply<00:00:29.609> slide<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.510> on

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
out of them but you simply slide one on

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.959 
out of them but you simply slide one on
like<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:34.410> when<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.190> are<00:00:35.340> doing<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.760> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
like so and when you are doing this you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.049 
like so and when you are doing this you
want<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.149> make<00:00:36.210> sure<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.260> little

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
want to make sure that one of the little

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.340 
want to make sure that one of the little
bits<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> inside<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> guns<00:00:40.050> are

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
bits on the inside of the guns are

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.810 
bits on the inside of the guns are
flipped<00:00:40.680> around<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.489> need<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.730> be

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
flipped around because they need to be

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.810 
flipped around because they need to be
on<00:00:41.940> opposite<00:00:42.300> sides<00:00:42.980> they<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:44.280> rotate

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
on opposite sides they do just rotate

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.869 
on opposite sides they do just rotate
inside<00:00:45.059> there<00:00:46.129> you<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.280> slide<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> other

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
inside there you just slide the other

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.590 
inside there you just slide the other
one<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:49.770> they<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.399> tap<00:00:51.059> together<00:00:51.329> very

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
one on and they will tap together very

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.479 
one on and they will tap together very
tightly<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.500> did<00:00:52.680> find<00:00:52.949> when<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> first

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
tightly and I did find when I first

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.369 
tightly and I did find when I first
combined<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> can<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.780> very<00:00:55.170> hard

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
combined the can and they was very hard

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.170 
combined the can and they was very hard
to<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.739> these<00:00:55.920> off<00:00:56.129> once<00:00:56.579> they<00:00:56.760> were<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
to get these off once they were on that

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.069 
to get these off once they were on that
so<00:00:58.129> be<00:00:59.129> careful<00:00:59.579> i<00:00:59.670> guess<00:00:59.850> maybe<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.899> should

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
so be careful i guess maybe I should

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.479 
so be careful i guess maybe I should
have<00:01:01.170> shaved<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.500> plastic<00:01:01.829> down<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.219> out

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
have shaved a plastic down a little out

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.200 
have shaved a plastic down a little out
of<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:04.189> because<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.489> because<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.790> painted

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
of it because it's because they painted

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
of it because it's because they painted
the<00:01:06.299> whole<00:01:06.390> cannon<00:01:06.780> makes<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> joints<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the whole cannon makes it the joints a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
the whole cannon makes it the joints a
little<00:01:08.040> tighter<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.700> were<00:01:08.820> okay<00:01:09.240> next

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
little tighter and you were okay next

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.460 
little tighter and you were okay next
you<00:01:09.659> want<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> take<00:01:09.990> um<00:01:11.720> tigresses<00:01:12.720> shotguns

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
you want to take um tigresses shotguns

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.340 
you want to take um tigresses shotguns
and<00:01:13.740> they<00:01:14.130> slide<00:01:14.580> into<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> side<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:16.380> oh

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
and they slide into the side here oh

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.179 
and they slide into the side here oh
wait<00:01:19.350> no<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.799> don't<00:01:20.549> know<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:22.189> bobasa's

peg them on top like so and then talons
rifle<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.600> just<00:01:46.810> peg<00:01:47.080> in<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.530> center<00:01:49.500> then

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
the cannon on like so I'm going to do a

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.820 
the cannon on like so I'm going to do a
lineup<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.020> holds<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.380> their<00:02:17.560> very

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
lineup and it holds on their very

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.300 
lineup and it holds on their very
sturdily<00:02:18.990> as<00:02:19.990> you<00:02:20.110> can<00:02:20.170> see<00:02:20.350> my<00:02:20.530> Rex<00:02:20.770> is<00:02:20.950> quite

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
sturdily as you can see my Rex is quite

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.650 
sturdily as you can see my Rex is quite
heavy<00:02:21.580> at<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.600> moment<00:02:22.780> because<00:02:23.770> he<00:02:23.950> has<00:02:24.660> my

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
heavy at the moment because he has my

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.500 
heavy at the moment because he has my
second<00:02:26.080> talent<00:02:26.440> on<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.740> back<00:02:26.860> there<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.390> he

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
second talent on the back there so he

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
any major complaints it would have been

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.040 
any major complaints it would have been
nice<00:05:35.879> if<00:05:35.909> some<00:05:36.270> of<00:05:36.360> his<00:05:36.449> joints<00:05:36.779> were<00:05:36.869> just<00:05:36.990> a

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
nice if some of his joints were just a

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.570 
nice if some of his joints were just a
little<00:05:37.289> tired<00:05:37.499> i<00:05:37.680> like<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.919> knees<00:05:38.129> and<00:05:38.490> the

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580

hips and the ankles and all that

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.679 
hips and the ankles and all that

not<00:05:46.860> drooping<00:05:47.279> I<00:05:47.459> guess<00:05:48.330> that's<00:05:48.479> just<00:05:48.599> a

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:48.779 
not drooping I guess that's just a

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:50.510 
not drooping I guess that's just a
tolerances<00:05:49.289> thing<00:05:49.559> and<00:05:49.800> Mike<00:05:50.039> happened<00:05:50.459> to

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
tolerances thing and Mike happened to

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.259 
tolerances thing and Mike happened to
get<00:05:50.639> lucky<00:05:50.669> mine<00:05:51.180> doesn't<00:05:51.509> seem<00:05:51.659> to<00:05:51.779> droop<00:05:52.019> I

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:53.269 
get lucky mine doesn't seem to droop I

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:58.070 
get lucky mine doesn't seem to droop I
did<00:05:54.269> notice<00:05:54.419> that<00:05:54.599> our<00:05:55.309> tigresses<00:05:56.990> seemed<00:05:57.990> a

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
did notice that our tigresses seemed a

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.809 
did notice that our tigresses seemed a
little<00:05:58.259> bit<00:05:58.439> tighter<00:05:58.649> so<00:05:58.919> maybe<00:05:59.129> he<00:05:59.339> can<00:05:59.369> hold

00:05:59.809 --> 00:05:59.819 
little bit tighter so maybe he can hold

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:02.449 
little bit tighter so maybe he can hold
the<00:05:59.999> sword<00:06:00.209> a<00:06:00.509> little<00:06:00.719> better<00:06:00.929> if<00:06:01.649> your<00:06:01.949> talent

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:02.459 
the sword a little better if your talent

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:06.409 
the sword a little better if your talent
is<00:06:02.610> drooping<00:06:03.029> a<00:06:03.119> bit<00:06:04.759> but<00:06:05.759> I<00:06:05.879> personally<00:06:06.180> like

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.540

having<00:06:06.689> him<00:06:06.779> as<00:06:06.959> a<00:06:06.990> left<00:06:07.259> arm<00:06:07.439> thought<00:06:08.129> might

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
having him as a left arm thought might

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.709 
having him as a left arm thought might
make<00:06:08.729> him<00:06:08.849> the<00:06:08.999> right<00:06:09.180> arm<00:06:09.389> when<00:06:09.509> i<00:06:09.539> get
