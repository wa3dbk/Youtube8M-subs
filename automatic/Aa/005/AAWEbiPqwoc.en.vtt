00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
right side is the other battery so you

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.750 
right side is the other battery so you
want<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.290> park<00:02:28.500> them<00:02:28.739> as<00:02:28.950> near<00:02:29.280> as<00:02:29.310> possible

this<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.540> sideways<00:02:30.989> which<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.440> in<00:02:31.590> this

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
this can be sideways which is in this

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.460 
this can be sideways which is in this
case<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.580> can<00:02:32.790> be<00:02:32.849> across<00:02:33.360> one<00:02:33.599> another<00:02:33.630> or<00:02:34.140> so

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
case it can be across one another or so

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.850 
case it can be across one another or so
on

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.890

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.600 

here's<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:46.170> battery<00:02:46.739> from<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.099> car<00:02:47.370> that's

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
here's the battery from the car that's

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.290 
here's the battery from the car that's
good<00:02:48.319> you<00:02:49.319> can<00:02:49.530> see<00:02:49.709> me<00:02:49.890> can't<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:51.030> first

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
thing you do as you know a battery has

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.650 
thing you do as you know a battery has
two<00:02:53.280> terminals<00:02:53.730> okay<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.180> plus<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.600> the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
the plus terminal we put it together

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.699 
the plus terminal we put it together
then<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:29.790> go<00:03:29.970> on<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.420> plus<00:03:30.750> terminal<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.440> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
then we go on the plus terminal on the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.020 
then we go on the plus terminal on the
other<00:03:31.829> car<00:03:32.190> okay<00:03:32.459> here<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.880> goes
