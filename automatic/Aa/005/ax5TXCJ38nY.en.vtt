here we have these little cars here
let's<00:00:53.250> say<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> car<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.059> enter<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
let's say a car is to enter the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.810 
let's say a car is to enter the
intersection<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:55.320> underneath<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.550> pad

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
intersection here underneath this pad

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.150 
intersection here underneath this pad
here<00:00:56.930> picture<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.770> actually<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
here picture this that is actually a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.920 
here picture this that is actually a
metal<00:00:59.489> detector<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> second<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.629> car

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
metal detector so the second this car

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.810 
metal detector so the second this car
crosses<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> intersection<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.309> gonna<00:01:02.699> be

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
crosses the intersection is gonna be

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.969 
crosses the intersection is gonna be
picked<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.899> actually<00:01:04.350> flashes

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
picked up and then it actually flashes

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
picked up and then it actually flashes
gonna<00:01:05.129> go<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.580> Big<00:01:05.760> Brother's<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.360> okay

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960

called the phantom plate photo shield
cover<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.479> lens<00:01:27.869> inside

cover and what it is is a lens inside

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.899 
cover and what it is is a lens inside
actually<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.070> goes<00:01:29.220> right<00:01:29.430> over<00:01:29.490> your<00:01:29.729> plate

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909

just<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.170> you'll<00:01:31.350> notice<00:01:31.409> what

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
just like that and if you'll notice what

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800 
just like that and if you'll notice what
happens<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.310> when<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.549> rotate<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.240> you're

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
happens is when we rotate this you're

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
happens is when we rotate this you're
actually<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.979> can't<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.310> too<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.549> there<00:01:35.759> we

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
actually you can't see too out there we

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.789 
actually you can't see too out there we
go<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.180> actually<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> blur<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
go it's actually going to blur the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.069 
go it's actually going to blur the
actual<00:01:38.250> plate<00:01:38.490> number<00:01:38.820> there<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.630> that's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
actual plate number there so that's

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.030 
actual plate number there so that's
pretty<00:01:40.259> cool<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.680> when<00:01:40.770> you're<00:01:40.890> driving

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
pretty cool so when you're driving

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.530 
pretty cool so when you're driving
through<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.310> intersection<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.850> flash<00:01:42.240> goes

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
through the intersection that flash goes

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.749 
through the intersection that flash goes
off<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.710> actually<00:01:43.890> captures<00:01:44.310> that

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
off and that it actually captures that

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.160 
off and that it actually captures that
image<00:01:45.090> they're<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.689> gonna<00:01:45.780> be<00:01:45.869> able<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.079> read

answer<00:02:44.980> but<00:02:45.700> it's<00:02:46.690> going<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.989> create<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.230> nice

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
answer but it's going to create a nice

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.630 
answer but it's going to create a nice
little<00:02:47.500> shiny<00:02:47.950> plate<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.400> what's<00:02:48.520> gonna

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
little shiny plate and what's gonna

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.699 
little shiny plate and what's gonna
happen<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.300> that<00:02:49.600> when<00:02:50.020> when<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.470> actual

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
happen is that when when the actual

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.590 
happen is that when when the actual
flash<00:02:51.160> takes<00:02:51.489> place<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:52.180> gonna<00:02:52.330> reflect

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
flash takes place it's gonna reflect

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.850 
flash takes place it's gonna reflect
that<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.020> it's<00:02:53.110> gonna<00:02:53.230> you're<00:02:53.530> taking<00:02:53.800> a
