00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
My art in general, I describe it as streetart

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:36.001
a street art that I've lived for a long time

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:44.002
I've had that experience with all my previous jobs

00:00:44.003 --> 00:00:49.003
Trough my other jobs I was able to know the city thoroughly

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:55.004
My first job was as a handyman. That's how I knew the city, I felt it.

00:00:55.005 --> 00:01:02.005
Until now, that's very important in my artwork.

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:09.006
I will never loose that perspective. I have it in my head

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:15.007
My design style has to do with the city. Has to do with tattooing.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:21.008
I circulate the city, I exhibit my tattoos.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.009
It comes from skate, comes from graffitti.
My style has to do with that.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:51.010
Graffitti is outrageous.
You adapt yourself to the wall, to the canvas you're intervening.

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:57.011
I've painted walls, cars.
It doesn't matter where, I adapt myself to the medium I paint.

00:01:57.012 --> 00:02:05.012
attooing is that, but in a smaller scale.
Very minimal, very thorough.

00:02:05.013 --> 00:02:13.013
You have to know the materials you're using, the kinds of needles.

00:02:13.014 --> 00:02:23.014
You have to really know your machine.
It's much more technical than graffitti.
When tattooing you can't make any mistakes.

00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:33.015
Graffitti has that characteristic.
When people look at it, they don't know when or who did it.

00:02:35.016 --> 00:02:40.016
Tattoo neither.
Has that same aggression.

00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:45.017
I see a similarity between them.

00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:50.018
Both are expressions that attack.

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:05.019
When I received the invitation to this Puma project,
a project called Tatt200,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.020
It seemed pretty free to me,
I just had to show my style.

00:03:09.021 --> 00:03:12.021
And that's why I loved it.

00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:16.022
I loved being able to gather everything I've done until now.

00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:21.023
And the first thing I drew was a pirate skull.

00:03:25.024 --> 00:03:31.024
it looks very gloomy, but to me, the skull represents life.

00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:39.025
And then I was able to visualize Sao Paulo.

00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:54.026
I used the side walk pattern of Sao Paulo streets,

00:03:54.027 --> 00:04:01.007
that in fact represent the state of Sao Paulo.

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:10.008
One of the main designs,
is the Puma cat jumping over the elevated highway.

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:19.009
 It's one of the city's main points.
It's my inspiration.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.010
To me, the future has comed.

00:04:29.011 --> 00:04:36.011
If I would live 100 years, I'd be very happy, because I went way farther than I dreamed

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:41.012
I'm Markone, from San Pablo, Brasil.

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:46.013
This is my city.
Puma and I walk through its veins.

00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:48.014
This is our life
