00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
tried it I did not like it I thought it

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.410 
tried it I did not like it I thought it
was<00:02:31.069> just<00:02:31.540> too<00:02:32.540> light<00:02:32.750> too<00:02:33.440> milky<00:02:33.879> really<00:02:34.879> and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
was just too light too milky really and

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.000 
was just too light too milky really and
it<00:02:35.599> was<00:02:35.690> just<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.930> lot<00:02:36.079> of<00:02:36.110> work<00:02:36.349> for<00:02:36.680> me<00:02:36.769> I<00:02:36.799> mean

it was just a lot of work for me I mean
it's<00:02:37.310> still<00:02:37.579> a<00:02:37.640> little<00:02:38.000> bit<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.209> work<00:02:38.390> for<00:02:38.599> me

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
it's still a little bit of work for me

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.780 
it's still a little bit of work for me
to<00:02:38.720> get<00:02:38.989> it<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.319> look<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.069> way<00:02:40.099> I<00:02:40.250> want<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.670> to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
to get it to look the way I want it to

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.850 
to get it to look the way I want it to
look<00:02:40.940> like<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.660> said<00:02:41.900> well<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.470> don't<00:02:42.650> know<00:02:42.709> if<00:02:42.769> I

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
look like I said well I don't know if I

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.199 
look like I said well I don't know if I
said<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.129> but<00:02:43.310> you<00:02:43.430> definitely<00:02:43.670> made<00:02:44.000> a

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
said that but you definitely made a

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.020 
said that but you definitely made a
brown<00:02:44.569> lip<00:02:45.170> liner<00:02:45.410> or<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.980> darker<00:02:46.609> lip<00:02:46.790> liner

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
brown lip liner or a darker lip liner

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.300 
brown lip liner or a darker lip liner
underneath<00:02:47.599> it<00:02:47.780> if<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.140> are<00:02:48.319> my<00:02:48.859> skin<00:02:49.129> tone

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
underneath it if you are my skin tone

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.150 
underneath it if you are my skin tone
are<00:02:49.459> probably<00:02:49.819> darker<00:02:50.269> um<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.829> simply

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
are probably darker um just simply

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.280 
are probably darker um just simply
because<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.760> color<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.599> much<00:02:53.810> lighter<00:02:54.170> and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
because the color is so much lighter and

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.229 
because the color is so much lighter and
it's<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.859> stark<00:02:55.129> if<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.489> apply<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.760> by<00:02:55.940> itself

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
it's so stark if you apply it by itself

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.960 
it's so stark if you apply it by itself
it's<00:02:56.870> also<00:02:57.109> an<00:02:57.290> amplified<00:02:57.829> so<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.370> puts<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.790> lot

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
it's also an amplified so it puts a lot

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.610 
it's also an amplified so it puts a lot
of<00:02:59.000> product<00:02:59.420> down<00:02:59.569> really<00:03:00.049> quickly<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:00.560> you

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
of product down really quickly so you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.949 
of product down really quickly so you
definitely<00:03:01.069> cannot<00:03:01.400> go<00:03:01.670> gung-ho<00:03:02.450> with<00:03:02.840> the

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
definitely cannot go gung-ho with the

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.599 
definitely cannot go gung-ho with the
lipstick<00:03:03.319> all<00:03:03.500> around<00:03:03.829> your<00:03:03.950> lips<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.549> just

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
lipstick all around your lips and just

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.300 
lipstick all around your lips and just
think<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.329> it's<00:03:05.569> gonna<00:03:05.750> look<00:03:05.930> ok<00:03:06.349> so<00:03:06.980> you

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
think that it's gonna look ok so you

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.710 
think that it's gonna look ok so you
definitely<00:03:07.489> have<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.910> tweak<00:03:08.150> with<00:03:08.329> it<00:03:08.480> play

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
definitely have to tweak with it play

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.360 
definitely have to tweak with it play
with<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.290> can<00:03:09.440> make<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.650> work<00:03:09.919> it<00:03:10.160> just

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
with it and you can make it work it just

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.190 
with it and you can make it work it just
takes<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.060> little<00:03:11.180> bit<00:03:11.329> of<00:03:11.450> work<00:03:11.599> for<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.139> you

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
takes a little bit of work for it so you

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.940
