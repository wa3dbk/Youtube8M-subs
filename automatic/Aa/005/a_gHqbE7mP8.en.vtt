in<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.280> phase<00:00:35.719> they<00:00:36.719> explain<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.410> idea<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
in this phase they explain the idea of

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.299 
in this phase they explain the idea of
overreaching<00:00:38.910> vs.<00:00:39.450> overtraining<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.950> the

overreaching vs. overtraining so the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.060 
overreaching vs. overtraining so the
idea<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.850> over<00:00:42.180> reaching<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.890> that<00:00:43.890> you're

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
idea was over reaching is that you're

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.619 
idea was over reaching is that you're
going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.280> increase<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> training<00:00:45.210> stimulus

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
going to increase the training stimulus

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.779 
going to increase the training stimulus
in<00:00:45.809> order<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.620> ultimately<00:00:46.860> decrease

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
in order to ultimately decrease

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.560 
in order to ultimately decrease
performance<00:00:48.480> temporarily<00:00:49.250> then<00:00:50.250> use<00:00:51.120> super

let's<00:03:23.109> get<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.590> some<00:03:23.829> exercise

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
let's get on to some exercise

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.319 
let's get on to some exercise
demonstration<00:03:25.380> what<00:03:26.380> I'm<00:03:26.530> dumbbell<00:03:26.919> world

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
demonstration what I'm dumbbell world

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.240 
demonstration what I'm dumbbell world
the<00:03:28.329> idea<00:03:28.630> here<00:03:28.959> is<00:03:29.139> that<00:03:29.230> you're<00:03:29.919> hitting

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
the idea here is that you're hitting

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.559 
the idea here is that you're hitting
four<00:03:30.669> sets<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.329> eight<00:03:32.200> without<00:03:32.919> any<00:03:33.280> rest<00:03:33.700> so

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
four sets of eight without any rest so

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.780 
four sets of eight without any rest so
you<00:03:34.660> start<00:03:34.989> with<00:03:35.560> eight<00:03:35.889> to<00:03:36.099> ten<00:03:36.220> reps<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:36.700> the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
you start with eight to ten reps on the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.240 
you start with eight to ten reps on the
weak<00:03:36.940> side<00:03:36.970> first<00:03:37.590> alternate<00:03:38.590> sides<00:03:38.919> until

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
weak side first alternate sides until

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.180 
weak side first alternate sides until
you<00:03:39.609> do<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:40.030> total<00:03:40.359> of<00:03:40.599> four<00:03:40.959> set<00:03:41.290> without<00:03:41.620> any

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
you do a total of four set without any

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.659 
you do a total of four set without any
reps<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:43.380> ideas<00:03:44.380> you're<00:03:44.620> hitting<00:03:44.950> about

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
reps and ideas you're hitting about

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.509 
reps and ideas you're hitting about
eight<00:03:45.970> reps<00:03:46.450> on<00:03:46.750> each<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.069> consecutive

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
eight reps on each of the consecutive

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.990 
eight reps on each of the consecutive
sets<00:03:49.000> without<00:03:49.660> any<00:03:50.260> risk<00:03:50.579> if<00:03:51.579> you<00:03:51.730> can<00:03:51.849> see

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
sets without any risk if you can see

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.860 
sets without any risk if you can see
from<00:03:52.150> my<00:03:52.239> set<00:03:52.540> up<00:03:52.799> my<00:03:53.799> working<00:03:54.639> harms<00:03:55.150> leg<00:03:55.510> that

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
from my set up my working harms leg that

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.559 
from my set up my working harms leg that
one's<00:03:56.109> far<00:03:56.590> out<00:03:56.919> to<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.190> side<00:03:57.430> this<00:03:58.060> minimizes

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
one's far out to the side this minimizes

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.020 
one's far out to the side this minimizes
the<00:03:59.200> support<00:03:59.769> given<00:03:59.980> by<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.489> bench<00:04:00.790> and

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
the support given by the bench and

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.199 
the support given by the bench and
focuses<00:04:01.900> all<00:04:02.139> the<00:04:02.500> tension<00:04:02.950> in<00:04:03.129> on<00:04:04.030> that

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
focuses all the tension in on that

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.290 
focuses all the tension in on that
working<00:04:04.629> life

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.630 

and<00:04:08.530> here<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.680> can<00:04:09.770> see<00:04:09.830> I<00:04:09.980> get<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.250> full

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
and here you can see I get a full

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.590 
and here you can see I get a full
stretch<00:04:11.120> at<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.450> bottom<00:04:12.220> almost<00:04:13.600> protracting

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
stretch at the bottom almost protracting

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.560 
stretch at the bottom almost protracting
and<00:04:14.750> pushing<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.290> weight<00:04:15.410> down<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:17.239> want<00:04:17.480> to

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
and pushing the weight down you want to

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.039 
and pushing the weight down you want to
maintain<00:04:17.750> an<00:04:18.350> even<00:04:19.070> back<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:20.330> don't<00:04:20.360> twist<00:04:20.840> too

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
maintain an even back so don't twist too

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.010 
maintain an even back so don't twist too
much<00:04:21.260> at<00:04:21.470> your<00:04:21.500> back<00:04:21.769> when<00:04:22.070> you're

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
much at your back when you're

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.240 
much at your back when you're
protracting<00:04:24.020> your<00:04:24.170> shoulder<00:04:24.560> blade<00:04:24.740> forward

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
protracting your shoulder blade forward

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.820 
protracting your shoulder blade forward
but<00:04:25.730> you<00:04:25.850> do<00:04:26.090> want<00:04:26.390> a<00:04:26.480> full<00:04:26.780> retraction<00:04:27.500> of

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
but you do want a full retraction of

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.750 
but you do want a full retraction of
that<00:04:27.980> shoulder<00:04:28.550> blade<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:30.550> can<00:04:31.550> see<00:04:31.730> for

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
that shoulder blade and you can see for

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.750 
that shoulder blade and you can see for
my<00:04:32.000> setup<00:04:32.330> even<00:04:32.990> my<00:04:33.110> back<00:04:33.380> leg<00:04:33.740> is<00:04:34.010> further

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
my setup even my back leg is further

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.740 
my setup even my back leg is further
back<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.920> again<00:04:36.920> that<00:04:37.160> just<00:04:37.400> minimizes<00:04:38.240> the

support given by the bench and allows

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.980
