00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello and welcome back to the lake that 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.830
 today I have a recipe for winter very 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.990
 Easy to prepare and perfect for days 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.990
 ice cream and sad is like this 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.610
 today we are going to prepare an English soup of 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.290
 mushrooms we go to recipe because it's super 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.260
 easy to prepare and in results 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.490
 irresistibly tasty in addition it is a 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.560
 very good way to go back to the 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.070
 normal after eating so much in 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.070
 those holidays 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.730
 you have the ingredients under the 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.350
 video and on the blog a note about 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.149
 our protagonist can use 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.010
 any type of fungus you find in 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.470
 the supermarket and here I am doing 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.070
 for example a variety of mushrooms 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.650
 Shiitake carried the mushrooms 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.989
 boletus and here I have the clinical pongos 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.550
 they are delicious the more variety of 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.550
 mushrooms better a party 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.190
 and we're going first we melt our 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.310
 butter in a pot over fire 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.729
 slow fry our mushrooms and 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.280
 chopped shallots about 5 minutes until 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.619
 that we see that they become tender 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.530
 we add the flour this goes a little bit 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.560
 likes the more we put more dense 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.390
 soup will not come out judge you but 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.310
 important to throw the flour only before 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.100
 pour our liquid ingredients if 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.710
 they do not want lumps left 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.320
 Now I'll pour the caldito a little 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.009
 let's let it cook over a heat 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.960
 slow stirring gently so that 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.160
 the mushrooms share their weapons with 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:46.080
 the rest of the ingredients at 5 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.080
 minutes can add whole milk 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.930
 m 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.780
 and sprinkle salt and pepper well 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.940
 like a little thyme that everything 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.940
 hot but do not let it boil 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.940
 and ready I hope you enjoyed 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.830
 start will be so fast and delicious 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.780
 tell me in the comments how they 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.459
 It was left and four cans of Indian women did not 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.590
 Like me I also want to learn from 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.880
 thank you for watching and see you in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.880
