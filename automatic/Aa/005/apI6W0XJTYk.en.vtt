00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
you basically follow the steps in

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469 
you basically follow the steps in
Reverse<00:02:01.799> spin<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.700> got<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> second<00:02:03.270> pair<00:02:03.450> of

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
Reverse spin you got a second pair of

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.080 
Reverse spin you got a second pair of
signs<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.409> lens<00:02:05.100> right<00:02:05.399> here<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.759> called

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
signs so this lens right here is called

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.190 
signs so this lens right here is called
the<00:02:06.560> VR<00:02:07.560> 28<00:02:08.280> black<00:02:08.610> iridium<00:02:09.179> lens<00:02:09.750> so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the VR 28 black iridium lens so

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.290 
the VR 28 black iridium lens so
basically<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.830> lens<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.459> specific<00:02:12.270> for

black<00:02:20.440> iridium<00:02:20.980> lenses<00:02:21.489> now<00:02:21.849> these<00:02:22.060> lenses

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
black iridium lenses now these lenses

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.970 
black iridium lenses now these lenses
are<00:02:22.540> really<00:02:22.840> good<00:02:23.020> for<00:02:23.200> really<00:02:23.380> bright<00:02:23.739> days

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
are really good for really bright days

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.760 
are really good for really bright days
as<00:02:24.220> well<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:24.670> if<00:02:24.880> you're<00:02:25.030> going<00:02:25.239> out<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.840> you

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
protected so some other key features for

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.630 
protected so some other key features for
this<00:02:32.140> pair<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.410> sunglasses<00:02:32.680> are<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.310> vent

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
this pair of sunglasses are the vent

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.080 
this pair of sunglasses are the vent
holes

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
holes

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.759 
holes
it<00:02:34.209> definitely<00:02:34.450> prevents<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> lenses<00:02:35.590> from

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
it definitely prevents the lenses from

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.920 
it definitely prevents the lenses from
fogging<00:02:36.190> up<00:02:36.550> when<00:02:36.880> you're<00:02:37.030> out<00:02:37.150> cycling<00:02:37.810> or

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
fogging up when you're out cycling or

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.320 
fogging up when you're out cycling or
running<00:02:37.959> also<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.010> does<00:02:39.250> have<00:02:39.519> another<00:02:39.849> pair

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
running also it does have another pair

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.900 
running also it does have another pair
of<00:02:40.360> ventilation<00:02:41.349> here<00:02:41.709> on<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.010> side<00:02:42.310> now<00:02:42.880> I

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
of ventilation here on the side now I

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.880 
of ventilation here on the side now I
did<00:02:43.239> have<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> few<00:02:43.750> occasions<00:02:44.050> where<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.470> came<00:02:44.709> to

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
did have a few occasions where I came to

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.610 
did have a few occasions where I came to
a<00:02:44.920> complete<00:02:45.220> stop<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.780> lenses<00:02:47.140> did<00:02:47.350> fog

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
a complete stop and the lenses did fog

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.590 
a complete stop and the lenses did fog
up<00:02:47.860> but<00:02:48.040> as<00:02:48.130> soon<00:02:48.370> as<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.580> started<00:02:49.090> moving<00:02:49.269> again

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
up but as soon as I started moving again

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.570 
up but as soon as I started moving again
these<00:02:50.080> started<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.500> clear<00:02:50.769> up<00:02:50.890> again<00:02:51.190> just

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
these started to clear up again just

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.490 
these started to clear up again just
like<00:02:51.760> if<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.120> were<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.390> press<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.660> defroster

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
like if you were to press a defroster

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.340 
like if you were to press a defroster
for<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.130> car<00:02:54.370> windshield<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:55.510> that's<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.810> great

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
for a car windshield so that's a great

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.380 
for a car windshield so that's a great
great<00:02:56.650> feature<00:02:57.010> because<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.819> always<00:02:58.120> hated

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
great feature because I always hated

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.690

wear my old pair of sunglasses would

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.430 
wear my old pair of sunglasses would
just<00:03:00.880> fog<00:03:01.180> up<00:03:01.450> in<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.690> middle<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.049> ride<00:03:02.260> and

just fog up in the middle of a ride and

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.050 
just fog up in the middle of a ride and
I<00:03:02.500> had<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.799> clean<00:03:03.069> them<00:03:03.250> off<00:03:03.400> Oakley<00:03:03.910> has

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
designed the arms of the radar lock to

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.670 
designed the arms of the radar lock to
actually<00:03:06.549> attach<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.720> your<00:03:07.840> head<00:03:08.110> as<00:03:08.349> opposed

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
to just resting on your ears gives much

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.140 
to just resting on your ears gives much
more<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.319> snug<00:03:11.620> feel<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.280> less<00:03:12.610> likely<00:03:13.120> for

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
more of a snug feel and less likely for

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.120 
more of a snug feel and less likely for
the<00:03:13.390> sunglasses<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.200> fall<00:03:14.440> off<00:03:14.650> while<00:03:14.980> you're

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
the sunglasses to fall off while you're

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
riding on the bike and I should say that

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.660 
riding on the bike and I should say that
the<00:03:17.080> radar<00:03:17.380> lock<00:03:17.530> does<00:03:17.859> offer<00:03:18.130> different
