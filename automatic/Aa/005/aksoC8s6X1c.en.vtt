hi I'm Dave Thomas at cars dot com and
this is a 2010

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.510
Acura MDX now offers a lot a premium
features are pretty good price

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.699
but comes up short cargo and tears base
however the one thing people gonna

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.320
notice right away the big change is this
new nose

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.699
when you get the base and the exit 42
thousand dollars

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.490
we lead up to the top of the line like
we have here at fifty-five thousand

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.169
dollars

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.599
they'll come with the same v6 engine
putting up 300 horsepower

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.610
as plenty fast for most drivers you're
not gonna miss any power with this thing

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.320
for forty thousand dollars you get them
he said luxury features

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.560
star with heated leather seats allude to

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.560
a rear view camera and electronic tell
the telescoping steering

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.570
but you really wanna get though is a
technology package about three thousand

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.480
dollars more

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.810
you get a navigation system upgrades

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.270
they have lots of actress namely real
time traffic updated weather

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.890

and the screen is much clearer it's a
really improve system might actually

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.560
recommended now

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.780
or before I wouldn't I want the best
features is it has real time traffic

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.050
like me here in Chicago I can play when
it goes from red to yellow to green

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.830
it is pinpoint and really accurate
months ago thirty red

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.520

exactly what you can and can't say

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.010
and what options you have to hit it
again and say play artist

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.240
Flaming Lips artist planning group

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.460
and/or bring up all the albums playlist
songs

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.590
%uh that are as for you can search by
song playlist anything you want it works

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.399
flawlessly and they actually the voice
recognition is a little better than

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.149
ports think

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.299
so it's definitely need feature for the
NDX comes up a little bit short for the

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:15.680
second and third row space

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.099
but that come to play in the second row
in the driver's seat is exactly where

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.719
had at that

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.810
I'm 5'10 but when you put the kids sit
back here

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.409
and my two-year-old for example well his
feet are kicking off highway to

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:28.200
Grandma's house

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.840
so not really optimum the third row
they've a smaller so you wanna do it all

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.109
about the Buick Enclave at Lincoln MKT

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.879
to other competitors a lot more room if
you have a big family so who should buy

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.909
the MDX

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.409
of families with two kids we're just
days a third row sparingly it would be

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.870
perfect for it otherwise

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.629
anyone is gonna get a lot easier this
cargo area like baby boomers golfers

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.939
people like that because it has plenty
of room just make sure you get the

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.879
Technology Package at the Great
navigation system I showed you

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:01.879
and that's a lot of value for luxury
crossover for more car-related new Skoda
