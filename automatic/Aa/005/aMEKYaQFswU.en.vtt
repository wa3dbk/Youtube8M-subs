00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.859 
deal with that like I said it's one of
my<00:01:39.840> best<00:01:40.079> game<00:01:40.320> plays<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.630> thought<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.780> guys

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
my best game plays so I thought you guys

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.149 
my best game plays so I thought you guys
might<00:01:43.200> enjoy<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.799> not<00:01:44.700> whatever<00:01:46.009> but<00:01:47.009> it's

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
might enjoy it if not whatever but it's

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.149 
might enjoy it if not whatever but it's
a<00:01:47.220> 194<00:01:48.119> 25<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> mat<00:01:49.229> plaza<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
a 194 25 on the mat plaza I think at the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.370 
a 194 25 on the mat plaza I think at the
time<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.640> was<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.090> most<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.899> game<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
time it was the most the game with the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.770 
time it was the most the game with the
most<00:01:52.590> kills<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.520> map<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.659> obviously

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
most kills on this map but obviously

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.480 
most kills on this map but obviously
that<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.470> record<00:01:55.770> doesn't<00:01:55.890> stand<00:01:56.189> anymore

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that that record doesn't stand anymore

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.330 
that that record doesn't stand anymore
i'm<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:56.939> sure<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.619> i'm<00:01:58.619> using<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> vector

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
i'm pretty sure and i'm using the vector

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.520 
i'm pretty sure and i'm using the vector
with<00:01:59.700> silence<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.479> probably<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:00.899> grip<00:02:01.380> i

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
with silence and probably for grip i

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.499 
with silence and probably for grip i
like<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.860> keep<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.159> actress<00:02:02.490> even<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.360> this

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
like to keep the actress even on this

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.940 
like to keep the actress even on this
vector<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.110> pretty<00:02:04.320> good<00:02:04.530> back<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
vector it was pretty good back in the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.639 
vector it was pretty good back in the
day<00:02:05.479> but<00:02:06.479> i<00:02:06.540> can't<00:02:06.899> talk<00:02:07.049> too<00:02:07.229> much<00:02:07.320> about<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
day but i can't talk too much about the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.839 
day but i can't talk too much about the
gameplay<00:02:07.860> since<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.310> lot<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.489> things<00:02:08.670> have

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
gameplay since a lot of things have

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.240 
gameplay since a lot of things have
changed<00:02:08.879> no<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:09.599> uses<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.289> perk<00:02:10.739> set<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.129> that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
changed no one uses the perk set up that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.480 
changed no one uses the perk set up that
I<00:02:11.340> was<00:02:11.489> rocking<00:02:11.760> anymore

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
I was rocking anymore

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.190 
I was rocking anymore
this<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.850> hard<00:02:13.180> line<00:02:13.360> ghosts<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.990> think

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
this is hard line ghosts I think

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.720 
this is hard line ghosts I think
scavenger<00:02:14.650> dexterity<00:02:15.220> or<00:02:15.310> something<00:02:15.640> like

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
scavenger dexterity or something like

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.240 
scavenger dexterity or something like
that<00:02:15.870> um<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.410> this<00:02:17.500> gameplay<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.010> little

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
that um so this gameplay is a little

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.560 
that um so this gameplay is a little
older<00:02:18.490> but<00:02:18.520> I<00:02:18.640> think<00:02:18.910> you<00:02:19.000> might<00:02:19.120> enjoy<00:02:19.300> was

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
older but I think you might enjoy was

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.610 
older but I think you might enjoy was
one<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.810> those<00:02:19.870> games<00:02:20.080> were<00:02:20.290> literally

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
one of those games were literally

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.620 
one of those games were literally
everything<00:02:21.580> went<00:02:22.000> right<00:02:22.180> from<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.510> beginning

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
everything went right from the beginning

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.700 
everything went right from the beginning

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
you saw my opening streak i got a V set

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.870 
you saw my opening streak i got a V set
unfortunately<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:26.740> died<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.550> picked<00:02:27.820> it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
unfortunately I died but I picked it

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.780 
unfortunately I died but I picked it
right<00:02:27.940> back<00:02:28.210> up<00:02:28.480> with<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.780> quad<00:02:28.990> c4<00:02:29.500> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
right back up with the quad c4 and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.760 
right back up with the quad c4 and
things<00:02:30.790> just<00:02:30.910> went<00:02:31.090> my<00:02:31.270> way<00:02:31.480> this<00:02:31.690> game<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.200> it

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
things just went my way this game and it

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.860 
things just went my way this game and it
was<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.950> fun<00:02:33.220> game<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.460> play<00:02:33.610> fun<00:02:34.420> game<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.630> watch

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
the YouTube scene and my thoughts about

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.090 
the YouTube scene and my thoughts about
it<00:02:51.070> since<00:02:51.280> although<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:52.090> wish<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.540> was<00:02:52.660> closer

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
it since although I wish it was closer

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
long days of the summer and I feel like

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.550 
long days of the summer and I feel like
a<00:03:00.400> lot<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.640> people<00:03:01.180> have<00:03:01.870> lost<00:03:02.200> their

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
a lot of people have lost their

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.410 
a lot of people have lost their
enthusiasm<00:03:03.310> for<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.730> game<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.240> that's

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
enthusiasm for this game and that's

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.210 
enthusiasm for this game and that's
evident<00:03:05.020> you<00:03:05.140> guys<00:03:05.290> probably<00:03:05.590> know<00:03:05.770> all<00:03:06.070> about

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
evident you guys probably know all about

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.380 
evident you guys probably know all about
that<00:03:06.370> already<00:03:06.820> um<00:03:07.150> but<00:03:07.960> I<00:03:08.020> do<00:03:08.110> miss<00:03:08.560> like<00:03:09.390> for
