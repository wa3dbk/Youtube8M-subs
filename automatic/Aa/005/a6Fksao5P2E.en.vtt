and that is force brand new feature

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.209 
and that is force brand new feature
that's<00:00:33.750> been<00:00:33.899> present<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> few<00:00:34.649> games<00:00:34.860> here

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219

and<00:00:35.340> there<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:35.730> most<00:00:36.000> recently<00:00:36.420> The<00:00:36.600> Witcher

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and there but most recently The Witcher

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.139 
and there but most recently The Witcher
3<00:00:36.899> which<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.469> called<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.149> rubber-banding

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
3 which is called the rubber-banding

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.840 
3 which is called the rubber-banding
system<00:00:39.629> now<00:00:39.780> what<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.890> rubber-banding

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
system now what is this rubber-banding

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.500 
system now what is this rubber-banding
system<00:00:42.210> addy

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
system addy

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.540 
system addy
the<00:00:42.629> rubber-banding<00:00:43.260> system<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.800> fall<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.460> it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the rubber-banding system in fall for it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
the rubber-banding system in fall for it
is<00:00:44.640> basically<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.360> such<00:00:45.870> there<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.350> regions

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
is basically as such there are regions

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.830 
is basically as such there are regions
in<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.579> world<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.090> had<00:00:48.329> their<00:00:48.510> certain

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
in the world that had their certain

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.779 
in the world that had their certain
level<00:00:49.200> thresholds<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:49.890> you'll<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.340> area

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
level thresholds so you'll have a area

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.689 
level thresholds so you'll have a area
that's<00:00:51.030> 5<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.690> 10<00:00:51.899> min<00:00:52.170> area<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:52.739> 30<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.250> 35

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
that's 5 to 10 min area that's 30 to 35

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.330 
that's 5 to 10 min area that's 30 to 35
in<00:00:53.940> an<00:00:54.059> area<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:54.690> 27<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.620> 30<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.980> don't<00:00:56.219> know

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
in an area that's 27 to 30 I don't know

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.830 
in an area that's 27 to 30 I don't know
and<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.610> now<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.940> kind<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.420> probably<00:00:57.690> see

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and so now you kind of probably see

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.090 
and so now you kind of probably see
where<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.140> getting<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.039> does

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
where I'm getting at what this does

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.849 
where I'm getting at what this does
essentially<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.030> diminishes<00:01:00.750> exploration<00:01:01.559> in

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
essentially is diminishes exploration in

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.130 
essentially is diminishes exploration in
the<00:01:02.129> game<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.059> said<00:01:03.120> Witcher<00:01:03.750> 3<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the game like I said Witcher 3 is a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
the game like I said Witcher 3 is a
fantastic<00:01:04.890> game<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.250> love<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.760> game<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.119> death

fantastic game I love that game to death

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.420 
fantastic game I love that game to death
but<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.110> really<00:01:07.439> didn't<00:01:07.680> feel<00:01:07.830> free<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.340> its

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
but I really didn't feel free in its

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.640 
but I really didn't feel free in its
world<00:01:08.670> why<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.330> because<00:01:09.840> when<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.260> decide

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
world why is that because when I decide

to go out and explore I end up trekking

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
to go out and explore I end up trekking
into<00:01:12.780> lands<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.380> shouldn't<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.159> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
forced down these pads work I might have

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.420 
forced down these pads work I might have
to<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.320> story<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.950> little<00:01:38.159> bit<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
can level up and then go do some side

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.590 
can level up and then go do some side
stuff<00:01:40.530> now<00:01:40.740> there<00:01:40.979> are<00:01:41.159> obviously<00:01:41.460> perks<00:01:42.270> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
stuff now there are obviously perks to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.630 
stuff now there are obviously perks to
this<00:01:43.009> rubber-banding<00:01:44.009> system<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> only

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
this rubber-banding system and the only

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.490 
this rubber-banding system and the only
one<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.030> can<00:01:45.090> truly<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.350> fact

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
one I can truly think of is the fact

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.980 
one I can truly think of is the fact
that<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.770> feel<00:01:47.100> rewarded<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> level<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
that I feel rewarded when I level up and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.840 
that I feel rewarded when I level up and
go<00:01:49.140> into<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> area<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.890> conquer<00:01:50.399> that

cuz it makes other areas in the game
kind<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.930> useless<00:02:27.200> once<00:02:27.770> you're<00:02:28.010> leveled<00:02:28.460> past

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
kind of useless once you're leveled past

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.850 
kind of useless once you're leveled past
them<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.150> go<00:02:29.270> in<00:02:29.450> there<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.810> boom<00:02:30.140> one<00:02:30.470> pistol

sense everything's useful now obviously

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.150 
sense everything's useful now obviously
and<00:02:41.330> that's<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.810> huge<00:02:42.200> component<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.800> this<00:02:42.920> game

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
and that's a huge component to this game

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.920 
and that's a huge component to this game
but<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.670> also<00:02:43.820> kind<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.150> bothers<00:02:44.480> me<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:44.660> now

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.360 
but it also kind of bothers me that now
I'll<00:02:45.170> be<00:02:45.260> able<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.530> walk<00:02:45.680> into<00:02:45.860> areas<00:02:46.160> when<00:02:46.280> I'm

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
I'll be able to walk into areas when I'm

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.010 
I'll be able to walk into areas when I'm
fully<00:02:46.610> bubbled<00:02:46.910> up<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.210> one-shot<00:02:47.600> everything

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
fully bubbled up and one-shot everything

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.210 
fully bubbled up and one-shot everything
and<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.230> removes<00:02:48.560> some<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.890> challenge

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
and that removes some of the challenge

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.370 
and that removes some of the challenge
of<00:02:49.250> areas<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.730> haven't<00:02:50.120> even<00:02:50.270> explored<00:02:50.780> yet<00:02:51.050> so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
of areas I haven't even explored yet so

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.810 
of areas I haven't even explored yet so
now<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.560> get<00:02:51.770> what<00:02:51.860> I'm<00:02:51.920> saying<00:02:51.980> it's<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.490> big

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
now you get what I'm saying it's a big

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.000 
now you get what I'm saying it's a big
problem<00:02:53.330> in<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.750> way<00:02:53.900> if<00:02:54.170> it's<00:02:54.380> done<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.830> way<00:02:54.980> I

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
problem in a way if it's done that way I

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.310 
problem in a way if it's done that way I
could<00:02:55.220> be<00:02:55.400> entirely<00:02:55.790> wrong<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.870> they'll

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
could be entirely wrong and that they'll

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.510 
could be entirely wrong and that they'll
be<00:02:57.530> quests<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:57.920> are<00:02:58.010> interesting<00:02:58.430> enough

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
be quests that are interesting enough

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.560 
be quests that are interesting enough
that<00:02:58.730> I'm<00:02:58.820> gonna<00:02:58.910> want<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.180> do<00:02:59.270> involved<00:02:59.480> with

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
that I'm gonna want to do involved with

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.790 
that I'm gonna want to do involved with
that<00:02:59.720> but<00:02:59.990> like<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.290> said<00:03:00.350> I'm<00:03:00.560> kind<00:03:00.710> of

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
that but like I said I'm kind of

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.320 
that but like I said I'm kind of
comparing<00:03:01.190> this<00:03:01.310> The<00:03:01.460> Witcher<00:03:01.790> 3<00:03:01.820> because

comparing this The Witcher 3 because

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.370 
comparing this The Witcher 3 because
that's<00:03:02.450> kind<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.750> what<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.020> games<00:03:03.260> been

that's kind of what this games been

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.610 
that's kind of what this games been
resembling<00:03:04.010> mostly<00:03:04.430> as<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:04.940> as<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.990> blueprint

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
resembling mostly as a as a blueprint

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.740

when<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:07.100> comes<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.460> designing<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.180> game<00:03:08.210> it's

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
when it comes to designing the game it's

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.390 
when it comes to designing the game it's
very<00:03:08.810> similar<00:03:09.320> in<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.680> way<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.070> that's<00:03:10.220> not

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
very similar in that way and that's not

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.740 
very similar in that way and that's not
a<00:03:10.460> bad<00:03:10.670> thing<00:03:10.730> as<00:03:11.030> The<00:03:11.120> Witcher<00:03:11.360> 3<00:03:11.390> is<00:03:11.720> a
