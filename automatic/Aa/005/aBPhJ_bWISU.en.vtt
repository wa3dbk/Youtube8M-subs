years where your career could have taken

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.380 
years where your career could have taken

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
a completely different turn yeah you had

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.880 
a completely different turn yeah you had
the<00:01:48.509> drugs<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.960> had<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> prison<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.770> had

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the drugs you had the prison and you had

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.570 
the drugs you had the prison and you had
the<00:01:49.920> rehab<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:51.500> then<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.950> pulled<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.430> all<00:01:53.550> out

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
the rehab and then you pulled it all out

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.420 
the rehab and then you pulled it all out
of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.660> fire<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.320> speak<00:01:55.440> I<00:01:55.920> mean<00:01:56.250> how<00:01:56.369> did

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
of the fire so to speak I mean how did

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.480 
of the fire so to speak I mean how did
you<00:01:56.729> manage<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.090> get<00:01:57.869> from<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.500> position<00:01:58.710> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
you manage to get from that position to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.990 
you manage to get from that position to
this<00:02:00.000> position<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.869> easy<00:02:01.470> to<00:02:01.979> believe<00:02:02.250> that

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
this position it's easy to believe that

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.660 
this position it's easy to believe that
things<00:02:03.600> are<00:02:04.080> gathering<00:02:04.830> momentum<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.430> going

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
things are gathering momentum and going

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
things are gathering momentum and going
into<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.910> negative<00:02:06.360> place<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.930> mean<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.290> think

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
into a negative place I mean I think

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.280 
into a negative place I mean I think
human<00:02:08.519> nature<00:02:08.880> can<00:02:09.209> tend<00:02:09.480> to<00:02:09.600> be<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> little<00:02:09.959> bit

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
human nature can tend to be a little bit

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.310 
human nature can tend to be a little bit
critical<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.190> itself<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.360> bit<00:02:12.540> society<00:02:13.140> and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
critical of itself and a bit society and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.680 
critical of itself and a bit society and
rather<00:02:13.920> than<00:02:14.070> quantifying<00:02:14.970> good<00:02:15.269> times<00:02:15.480> or

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
rather than quantifying good times or

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.990 
rather than quantifying good times or
bad<00:02:15.720> times<00:02:16.110> or<00:02:16.440> highs<00:02:16.709> or<00:02:16.739> lows<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.519> think<00:02:17.880> it's

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
bad times or highs or lows I think it's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.240 
bad times or highs or lows I think it's
really<00:02:18.209> just<00:02:18.420> about<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:19.350> know<00:02:19.470> we're<00:02:19.769> kind<00:02:20.190> of

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.640 
really just about you know we're kind of
evolved<00:02:20.790> apes<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:22.080> think<00:02:22.320> we're<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> lot

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
evolved apes and we think we're a lot

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.070 
evolved apes and we think we're a lot
smarter<00:02:22.980> than<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.430> are<00:02:23.459> but<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.239> we<00:02:24.480> survive

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
smarter than we are but if we survive

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.040 
smarter than we are but if we survive
