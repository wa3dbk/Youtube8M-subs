00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.480
 The prostate is a walnut-sized, exocrine gland of the male reproductive system. Its location 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.920
 Just under the bladder, covering the anterior segment of the male urethra. 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.840
 The prostate produces a milky white fluid that is discharged into the urethra and mixed with the sperm. 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.840
 When ejaculation, the liquid acts as a lubricant and provides sperm nutrients. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Benign prostatic hyperplasia, called BPH, or benign prostatic hyperplasia or enlargement 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.320
 Is a condition in which the prostate is enlarged in size. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.399
 It is said to be “benign” because, unlike cancer, it does not increase the risk of cancer. 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.750
 However, when it is increased to a certain volume, the prostate tissue will be pressed to the urethra 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 Blocks urine flow and causes multiple urination problems and urinary tract infections. 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:14.139
 Prostatic hyperplasia is common in older men: about 50% of 60-year-old males increase with age and have some degree of benign prostatic hyperplasia. 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.740
 Half of them showed clinically obvious symptoms. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a hormone 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.450
 The result of the change is considered to be the normal condition of male aging. In aging prostate tissue, 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.530
 The rate of cell proliferation caused by male hormones has exceeded the extent 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.530
 The speed of apoptosis. This leads to an increase in the number of cells and an enlarged prostate. 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.090
 There are two main types of BPH treatments: 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.380
 The first type is the alpha receptor inhibitor: the drug relaxes the smooth muscle of the prostate and the bladder neck. 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.380
 Thereby slowing the blockage of the urine flow. The second category is 5-alpha reductase inhibitors: 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:11.149
 These drugs inhibit local dihydrotestosterone (DHT) production, and DHT is the prostate. 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.530
 The cause of hypertrophy. For patients who do not respond well to drug treatment, 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.540
 Minimally invasive treatment is available. These non-general surgical therapies are high fever 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.690
 Causes cell death or necrosis in prostate tissue. High heat is delivered in small amounts 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.510
 Go to a specific location to reduce unnecessary tissue damage. The difference between different treatment methods is mainly 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.520
 It is the type of energy used. 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.200
 Transurethral resection of the prostate 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.540
 Surgery to remove prostate tissue through the urethra. 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.690
 This therapy has been used for a long time and is still considered the gold standard for severe BPH treatment. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.220
 To date, this treatment has been used when drug treatment and minimally invasive methods fail.
