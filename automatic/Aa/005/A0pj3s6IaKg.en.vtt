00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.720 

here's<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:02.040> Delco<00:00:02.639> a.m.<00:00:03.120> car<00:00:03.570> radio<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.730> I

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
here's a Delco a.m. car radio and I

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.020 
here's a Delco a.m. car radio and I
think<00:00:06.000> that<00:00:06.180> this<00:00:06.359> was<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:07.370> let's<00:00:08.370> see<00:00:08.670> here

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
think that this was from let's see here

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.190 
think that this was from let's see here
I<00:00:09.860> think<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.099> from<00:00:11.420> 1981<00:00:12.420> see<00:00:12.870> if<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.110> can

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
I think this is from 1981 see if we can

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:22.670 
I think this is from 1981 see if we can
get<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.349> date<00:00:13.620> code<00:00:13.980> here<00:00:19.070> yeah<00:00:20.130> 81<00:00:20.670> 16<00:00:21.500> this<00:00:22.500> is

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
get a date code here yeah 81 16 this is

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.980 
get a date code here yeah 81 16 this is
actually<00:00:23.160> using<00:00:23.550> an<00:00:23.640> integrated<00:00:23.910> circuit<00:00:24.510> for

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
actually using an integrated circuit for

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.890 
actually using an integrated circuit for
the<00:00:25.080> if'<00:00:25.519> stages<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.060> output

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
the if' stages and the output

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
the if' stages and the output
it's<00:00:28.470> got<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> power<00:00:29.010> IC<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.859> this<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.189> here

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it's got a power IC on it this one here

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.330 
it's got a power IC on it this one here
looks<00:00:32.759> almost<00:00:33.300> exactly<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.260> same<00:00:34.309> but<00:00:35.309> I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
looks almost exactly the same but I

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.060 
looks almost exactly the same but I
think<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.820> uses<00:00:36.030> conventional<00:00:36.739> transistors<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
think it uses conventional transistors I

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.549 
think it uses conventional transistors I
haven't<00:00:38.879> tried<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.210> yet<00:00:42.050> I've<00:00:43.050> got<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.440> hooked

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
haven't tried it yet I've got it hooked

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.150 
haven't tried it yet I've got it hooked
up<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.219> an<00:00:44.340> as<00:00:44.550> Tron<00:00:46.160> heavy-duty

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
up here with an as Tron heavy-duty

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.529 
up here with an as Tron heavy-duty
12-volt<00:00:47.940> power<00:00:48.180> supply<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> let's<00:00:50.969> plug<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.390> in

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
12-volt power supply so let's plug it in

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.369 
12-volt power supply so let's plug it in
and<00:00:51.750> check<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.350> performance<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
and check the performance of it I

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.630 
and check the performance of it I
haven't<00:00:55.379> done<00:00:55.530> anything<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.579> just

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
haven't done anything to it I just

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.630 
haven't done anything to it I just
hooked<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.910> plug<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:01.640> Obama

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
hooked it up and plug it in here Obama

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.509 
hooked it up and plug it in here Obama
just<00:01:02.940> said<00:01:03.470> economic<00:01:04.470> activity<00:01:04.949> once<00:01:05.189> again

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
just said economic activity once again

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:17.260 
just said economic activity once again
is<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:08.010> down

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.899 

I<00:01:17.500> think<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.619> computer<00:01:19.159> equipment<00:01:19.399> in<00:01:19.700> here

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
I think the computer equipment in here

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.500 
I think the computer equipment in here
may<00:01:20.030> be<00:01:20.060> causing<00:01:20.630> some<00:01:20.659> noise

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.720 

cute<00:01:26.510> these<00:01:26.690> Muslims<00:01:27.230> saying<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.220> plan<00:01:28.490> was

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
cute these Muslims saying the plan was

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.970 
cute these Muslims saying the plan was
more<00:01:28.970> aspirational<00:01:29.630> than<00:01:30.140> operational

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
more aspirational than operational

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.920 
more aspirational than operational
that's<00:01:31.610> like<00:01:31.880> saying<00:01:32.210> we<00:01:32.390> caught<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.780> guy

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
that's like saying we caught the guy

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.530 
that's like saying we caught the guy
with<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.140> sizzling<00:01:33.620> bomb<00:01:33.860> in<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.790> synagogue

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
with the sizzling bomb in the synagogue

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.600 
with the sizzling bomb in the synagogue
toilet<00:01:36.050> but<00:01:36.590> because<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.010> bomb<00:01:37.250> didn't<00:01:37.580> go

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
toilet but because the bomb didn't go

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.520 
toilet but because the bomb didn't go
off<00:01:37.900> we<00:01:38.900> not<00:01:39.080> gonna<00:01:39.230> prosecute<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.990> appreciate

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
off we not gonna prosecute to appreciate

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.590 
off we not gonna prosecute to appreciate
that<00:01:42.680> very<00:01:42.830> much<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:43.400> would<00:01:44.000> love<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.330> learn

so<00:03:37.320> there's<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.770> Delco<00:03:38.540> a.m.<00:03:39.540> radio<00:03:43.160> here's

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
so there's the Delco a.m. radio here's

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.280 
so there's the Delco a.m. radio here's
the<00:03:44.340> antenna<00:03:44.700> trimmer<00:03:45.180> adjustment<00:03:45.900> here<00:03:46.260> I

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
the antenna trimmer adjustment here I

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.860 
the antenna trimmer adjustment here I
found<00:03:47.040> this<00:03:47.250> antenna<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.090> just<00:03:48.330> plugs<00:03:48.660> right

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
found this antenna that just plugs right

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.060 
found this antenna that just plugs right
into<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.440> Motorola<00:03:50.040> genic<00:03:50.750> here<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.710> had<00:03:52.920> to

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
into a Motorola genic here and had to

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.040 
into a Motorola genic here and had to
adjust<00:03:53.400> this<00:03:53.760> because<00:03:54.690> this<00:03:54.870> helps

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
metal plate and the chassis so you have

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.870 
metal plate and the chassis so you have
to<00:04:32.280> make<00:04:32.460> sure<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.540> don't<00:04:33.720> get<00:04:33.870> a<00:04:33.930> short

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
to make sure that you don't get a short

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.280 
to make sure that you don't get a short
through<00:04:35.880> that<00:04:36.120> cuz<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.360> actually<00:04:36.780> serves<00:04:37.020> as<00:04:37.260> a

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
through that cuz it actually serves as a

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.990 
through that cuz it actually serves as a
capacitor<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:38.070> then<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.730> noise

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
capacitor and then this is a noise

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.370
