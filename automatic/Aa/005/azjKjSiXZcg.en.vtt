00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
has a really interesting unique power

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.339 
has a really interesting unique power
that<00:04:14.510> provides<00:04:14.900> some<00:04:15.530> some<00:04:16.099> nice<00:04:16.430> gameplay<00:04:17.349> so

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
that provides some some nice gameplay so

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:19.960 
that provides some some nice gameplay so
that<00:04:18.500> guy<00:04:18.650> has<00:04:18.859> taught<00:04:19.190> which<00:04:19.400> means<00:04:19.639> if<00:04:19.849> I'm

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
that guy has taught which means if I'm

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.060 
that guy has taught which means if I'm
going<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.329> attack<00:04:20.630> in<00:04:20.840> any<00:04:20.959> way<00:04:21.169> it's<00:04:21.590> gotta<00:04:21.950> be

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
going to attack in any way it's gotta be

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.870 
going to attack in any way it's gotta be
to<00:04:22.340> him<00:04:22.490> so

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
to him so

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.220 
to him so
I'm<00:04:24.150> not<00:04:24.300> quite<00:04:24.540> sure<00:04:24.570> how<00:04:24.750> I'm<00:04:24.900> going<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.050> deal

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
I'm not quite sure how I'm going to deal

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.120 
I'm not quite sure how I'm going to deal
with<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.560> right<00:04:25.860> now<00:04:27.500> let's<00:04:28.500> see<00:04:28.680> here<00:04:28.950> I

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
with that right now let's see here I

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.070 
with that right now let's see here I
think<00:04:29.790> I'm<00:04:29.880> going<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.030> hold<00:04:30.300> off<00:04:30.480> for<00:04:30.540> now<00:04:30.810> and

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
think I'm going to hold off for now and

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.110 
think I'm going to hold off for now and
just<00:04:31.140> due<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.740> damage<00:04:32.400> directly<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.940> rogue

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
just due to damage directly to the rogue

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.540 
just due to damage directly to the rogue
so<00:04:33.480> that<00:04:34.020> wasn't<00:04:34.650> really<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.860> creature<00:04:35.190> attack

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
so that wasn't really a creature attack

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.980 
so that wasn't really a creature attack
it<00:04:35.700> was<00:04:35.790> it<00:04:35.880> more<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.120> spell<00:04:36.390> but<00:04:36.660> once<00:04:36.900> I

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
it was it more of a spell but once I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.120 
it was it more of a spell but once I
start<00:04:37.170> getting<00:04:37.260> creatures<00:04:37.680> in<00:04:37.800> play<00:04:37.950> they're

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
start getting creatures in play they're

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.060 
start getting creatures in play they're
going<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.370> have<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.700> attack<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.180> guy<00:04:39.360> talk

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
going to have to attack that guy talk

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.380 
going to have to attack that guy talk
it's<00:04:41.070> a<00:04:41.340> it's<00:04:41.670> a<00:04:41.790> really<00:04:42.090> really<00:04:42.300> interesting

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
it's a it's a really really interesting

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.210 
it's a it's a really really interesting
little<00:04:42.840> game<00:04:43.050> here<00:04:43.080> you've<00:04:43.770> even<00:04:43.890> got<00:04:44.190> the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
little game here you've even got the

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.890 
little game here you've even got the
analyst<00:04:44.970> on<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.210> side<00:04:45.420> here<00:04:45.450> in<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.720> bottom

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
analyst on the side here in the bottom

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.930 
analyst on the side here in the bottom
right<00:04:46.170> of<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.380> little<00:04:46.680> catapult<00:04:47.430> here<00:04:47.640> I<00:04:47.670> can

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
right of that little catapult here I can

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.260 
right of that little catapult here I can
play<00:04:48.690> around<00:04:48.810> with<00:04:49.080> while<00:04:49.260> it's<00:04:49.350> their<00:04:49.500> turn

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
play around with while it's their turn

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.610 
play around with while it's their turn
much<00:04:51.270> like<00:04:51.450> magic<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.840> gathering<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.380> can't

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
much like magic the gathering you can't

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.290 
much like magic the gathering you can't
attack<00:04:52.770> with<00:04:53.130> creatures<00:04:53.550> on<00:04:53.730> the<00:04:53.820> first<00:04:54.060> turn

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
attack with creatures on the first turn

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.250 
attack with creatures on the first turn
but<00:04:54.980> that<00:04:55.980> I<00:04:56.010> think<00:04:56.450> many<00:04:57.450> players<00:04:57.780> will<00:04:58.080> be

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
but that I think many players will be

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.430 
but that I think many players will be
used<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:59.030> so<00:05:00.030> what<00:05:00.780> am<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:00.930> going<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.200> go<00:05:01.290> with

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
used to so what am I going to go with

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.100 
used to so what am I going to go with
here<00:05:01.800> I've<00:05:02.430> got<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:03.360> rifleman<00:05:03.780> here<00:05:03.930> who<00:05:04.020> can

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
here I've got a rifleman here who can

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.200 
here I've got a rifleman here who can
deal<00:05:04.290> 1<00:05:04.530> damage<00:05:04.560> but<00:05:05.040> ideally<00:05:05.670> I<00:05:05.700> like<00:05:06.000> taking

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
deal 1 damage but ideally I like taking

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.540 
deal 1 damage but ideally I like taking
out<00:05:06.510> characters<00:05:07.290> as<00:05:07.440> soon<00:05:07.650> as<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.800> can<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.250> if<00:05:08.430> I

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
out characters as soon as I can and if I

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.520 
out characters as soon as I can and if I
put<00:05:08.760> him<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.180> play<00:05:09.360> then<00:05:09.660> he'll<00:05:10.230> actually<00:05:10.380> be

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
put him and play then he'll actually be

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.400 
put him and play then he'll actually be
able<00:05:10.680> to<00:05:10.800> attack<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.310> rifleman<00:05:11.730> directly<00:05:12.410> so

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
able to attack the rifleman directly so

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.350 
able to attack the rifleman directly so
um<00:05:14.370> this<00:05:15.180> is<00:05:15.450> tricky<00:05:15.870> let's<00:05:16.110> go<00:05:16.410> with

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
um this is tricky let's go with

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.210 
um this is tricky let's go with
explosive<00:05:18.360> trap<00:05:18.600> is<00:05:18.990> a<00:05:19.290> pretty<00:05:19.740> big<00:05:19.920> deal<00:05:20.070> what

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
explosive trap is a pretty big deal what

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.220 
explosive trap is a pretty big deal what
I'm<00:05:20.310> going<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.460> do<00:05:20.550> first<00:05:20.760> here<00:05:21.060> is<00:05:21.210> snipe<00:05:21.600> so

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
I'm going to do first here is snipe so

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.640 
I'm going to do first here is snipe so
