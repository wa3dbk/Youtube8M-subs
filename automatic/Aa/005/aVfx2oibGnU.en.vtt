cannot get stuck as it's sitting here

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.380 
cannot get stuck as it's sitting here
when<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.070> flings<00:00:23.369> out<00:00:23.669> you<00:00:23.880> got<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.119> make<00:00:24.239> sure

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
else you know it might get stuck and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.280 
else you know it might get stuck and
then<00:00:28.910> you<00:00:29.910> know<00:00:30.029> your<00:00:30.599> squirrel<00:00:31.079> or<00:00:31.259> something

doing this but we can set it up for
right<00:00:42.420> now<00:00:45.019> put<00:00:46.019> your<00:00:46.109> stick<00:00:47.329> put<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.420> around

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
right now put your stick put it around

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.150 
right now put your stick put it around
your<00:00:51.379> longer<00:00:52.379> stick<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.800> between<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.339> two<00:00:53.519> L's

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
your longer stick in between the two L's

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.139 
your longer stick in between the two L's
here's<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.339> of<00:00:56.429> those<00:00:56.489> spots<00:00:56.820> where<00:00:57.059> you're

here's one of those spots where you're
gonna<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.690> take<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.379> time<00:00:58.589> and<00:00:58.620> figure

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
gonna have to take some time and figure

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.960 
gonna have to take some time and figure
it<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.510> but<00:01:00.920> your<00:01:01.920> trigger<00:01:04.489> this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.670> gonna<00:01:05.790> be

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
it out but your trigger this is gonna be

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.470 
it out but your trigger this is gonna be
a<00:01:06.000> spot<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.740> really<00:01:07.740> work<00:01:08.190> on<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.330> how

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
a spot to really work on but see how

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.140 
a spot to really work on but see how
this<00:01:09.990> stick<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.410> so<00:01:10.620> far<00:01:10.950> bending<00:01:11.310> back<00:01:11.490> it's

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
this stick is so far bending back it's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
this stick is so far bending back it's
not<00:01:12.300> supposed<00:01:12.660> to<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.470> actually<00:01:13.650> supposed

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
not supposed to it's actually supposed

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.060 
not supposed to it's actually supposed
to<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.220> about<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:15.350> but<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.710> right<00:01:16.890> now

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
to be about here but for right now

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.670 
to be about here but for right now
that'll<00:01:17.820> work<00:01:18.030> I'll<00:01:18.330> fix<00:01:18.660> it<00:01:18.900> after<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.350> movie

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that'll work I'll fix it after the movie

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.320 
that'll work I'll fix it after the movie
and<00:01:21.950> then<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.070> take<00:01:23.280> make<00:01:24.240> sure<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:26.330> there's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and then you take make sure that there's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.100 
and then you take make sure that there's
no<00:01:27.690> there's<00:01:28.440> nothing<00:01:28.800> touching<00:01:29.310> your<00:01:29.430> trigger

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
no there's nothing touching your trigger

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.950 
no there's nothing touching your trigger
because<00:01:31.110> even<00:01:31.440> you<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:32.540> small<00:01:33.540> pieces<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
because even you know small pieces of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.890 
because even you know small pieces of
grass<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.880> might<00:01:36.300> have<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.660> chance

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
grass like that it might have a chance

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.500 
grass like that it might have a chance
of<00:01:37.110> holding<00:01:37.410> it<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.770> doubt<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:39.390> know

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
of holding it up I doubt it but you know

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.030 
of holding it up I doubt it but you know
you<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.690> want<00:01:39.870> to<00:01:39.930> take<00:01:40.050> any<00:01:40.200> chances<00:01:40.770> if

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you don't want to take any chances if

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.100 
you don't want to take any chances if
you're<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.180> wilderness<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:42.990> you're

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you're on the wilderness and you're

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.430 
you're on the wilderness and you're
hungry<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.480> you<00:01:45.480> only<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.810> probably<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.230> day

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
hungry and you only got probably a day

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.560 
hungry and you only got probably a day
to<00:01:46.500> live<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:47.760> want<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:48.030> make<00:01:48.120> sure<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.390> don't

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
to live you want to make sure you don't

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.350 
to live you want to make sure you don't
mess<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:48.900> on<00:01:49.080> this<00:01:49.230> or<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:51.000> doing<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.240> for

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
mess up on this or it just doing it for

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.220 
mess up on this or it just doing it for
fun<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.550> make<00:01:53.730> your<00:01:53.940> loop<00:01:54.660> again<00:01:55.020> by

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
fun so you make your loop again by

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.010 
fun so you make your loop again by
taking<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.310> end<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.580> your<00:01:56.670> string<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.210> just

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
taking the end of your string and just

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.040 
taking the end of your string and just
feeding<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.620> other<00:01:58.770> string<00:01:59.610> through<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.050> now

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
feeding the other string through it now

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.200 
feeding the other string through it now
the<00:02:01.470> size<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.980> hole<00:02:02.130> does<00:02:02.340> matter<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the size of the hole does matter you

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.540 
the size of the hole does matter you
make<00:02:03.390> you're<00:02:03.660> going<00:02:03.690> for<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.050> squirrel

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
make you're going for a squirrel

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.600 
make you're going for a squirrel
probably<00:02:05.550> about<00:02:06.020> this<00:02:07.020> big<00:02:07.369> just<00:02:08.369> big<00:02:08.580> enough

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
probably about this big just big enough

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.880 
probably about this big just big enough
so<00:02:09.030> it'll<00:02:09.179> go<00:02:09.269> around<00:02:09.360> maybe<00:02:10.200> even<00:02:10.530> smaller

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so it'll go around maybe even smaller

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.470 
so it'll go around maybe even smaller
like<00:02:11.430> put<00:02:11.610> your<00:02:11.700> food<00:02:11.849> right<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.270> middle

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
like put your food right in the middle

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.690 
like put your food right in the middle
of<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.780> and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.250 

oh<00:02:15.730> but<00:02:16.360> if<00:02:16.480> you're<00:02:16.630> going<00:02:16.750> for<00:02:16.930> something<00:02:17.020> a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
oh but if you're going for something a

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.110 
oh but if you're going for something a
little<00:02:17.470> bigger<00:02:17.709> maybe<00:02:18.160> your<00:02:18.580> squirrels<00:02:18.880> are

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
little bigger maybe your squirrels are

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.729 
little bigger maybe your squirrels are
fat<00:02:20.050> or<00:02:20.890> something<00:02:21.660> mom<00:02:22.660> or<00:02:22.930> dad<00:02:23.110> feed<00:02:23.620> them

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
fat or something mom or dad feed them

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.190 
fat or something mom or dad feed them
way<00:02:23.860> too<00:02:23.890> much<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.849> I<00:02:25.150> need<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> little<00:02:26.110> bit

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
way too much so I need a little bit

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.449 
way too much so I need a little bit
bigger<00:02:26.380> but<00:02:26.620> it's<00:02:26.739> going<00:02:26.950> around<00:02:27.160> their<00:02:27.250> neck

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
bigger but it's going around their neck

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.770 
bigger but it's going around their neck
so<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.849> doesn't<00:02:28.060> have<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.239> be<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:28.540> big<00:02:29.069> now<00:02:30.780> you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
so it doesn't have to be so big now you

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.360 
so it doesn't have to be so big now you
know<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.260> can<00:02:32.470> make<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.709> as<00:02:32.860> small<00:02:32.890> as<00:02:33.130> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
know you can make it as small as you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.420 
know you can make it as small as you
want<00:02:33.400> for<00:02:33.730> maybe<00:02:33.910> like<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.150> chipmunk<00:02:35.430> don't

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
want for maybe like a chipmunk don't

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.030 
want for maybe like a chipmunk don't
worry<00:02:36.580> about<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.910> extra<00:02:37.780> stuff<00:02:38.050> it's<00:02:38.890> gonna

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
worry about the extra stuff it's gonna

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.040 
worry about the extra stuff it's gonna
be<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.400> fast<00:02:39.700> they're<00:02:39.940> not<00:02:40.150> gonna<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.780> won't

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
be so fast they're not gonna this won't

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.610 
be so fast they're not gonna this won't
even<00:02:41.260> matter<00:02:41.410> but<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.220> circle<00:02:42.640> will<00:02:42.819> matter

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
even matter but the circle will matter

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.309 
even matter but the circle will matter
now<00:02:44.620> there's<00:02:45.310> two<00:02:45.519> ways<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:46.269> could<00:02:46.450> put<00:02:46.660> you

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
now there's two ways you could put you

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.640 
now there's two ways you could put you
could<00:02:47.530> put<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.980> string<00:02:48.250> under<00:02:49.290> your<00:02:50.290> trigger

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
could put the string under your trigger

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.020 
could put the string under your trigger
and<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.790> thing's<00:02:52.000> just<00:02:52.090> about<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.660> go<00:02:54.030> well

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
and this thing's just about to go well

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.360 
and this thing's just about to go well
I'm<00:02:55.780> not<00:02:55.930> gonna<00:02:56.110> do<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.260> now<00:02:56.380> but<00:02:56.590> if<00:02:57.069> you<00:02:57.220> put

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
I'm not gonna do it now but if you put

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.699 
I'm not gonna do it now but if you put
it<00:02:57.459> under<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:58.600> have<00:02:58.720> a<00:02:58.780> better<00:02:58.989> chance<00:02:59.049> I

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
it under you have a better chance I

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.690 
it under you have a better chance I
think<00:02:59.739> of<00:03:00.220> getting<00:03:00.959> an<00:03:01.959> animal<00:03:02.290> if<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.430> put<00:03:03.610> it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
think of getting an animal if you put it

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.280 
think of getting an animal if you put it
above<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.500> have<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.680> quicker<00:03:06.810> it's<00:03:07.810> quicker

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
above you have a quicker it's quicker

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.330 
above you have a quicker it's quicker
it's<00:03:08.560> not<00:03:08.920> as<00:03:09.220> accurate<00:03:10.620> because<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.890> string

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
it's not as accurate because the string

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.910 
it's not as accurate because the string
is<00:03:12.400> just<00:03:12.459> gonna<00:03:12.700> all<00:03:12.940> move<00:03:13.330> at<00:03:13.510> once<00:03:13.769> when<00:03:14.769> you

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
is just gonna all move at once when you

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.800 
is just gonna all move at once when you
put<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.190> under<00:03:15.549> it's<00:03:15.790> got<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.090> move<00:03:16.209> through

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
put it under it's got to move through

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.490 
put it under it's got to move through
that<00:03:17.170> stick<00:03:17.620> your<00:03:18.040> trigger<00:03:18.989> so<00:03:19.989> either<00:03:20.230> way

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
that stick your trigger so either way

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.699 
that stick your trigger so either way
will<00:03:20.650> work<00:03:20.680> you<00:03:21.430> know<00:03:21.549> just<00:03:21.850> try<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.329> maybe<00:03:22.720> you

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
will work you know just try it maybe you

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.340 
will work you know just try it maybe you
try<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.070> twice<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:25.090> can't<00:03:25.810> get<00:03:26.019> any<00:03:26.140> things

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
try this twice and can't get any things

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.410 
try this twice and can't get any things
to<00:03:26.560> try<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.920> other<00:03:26.950> way<00:03:27.250> put<00:03:27.970> it<00:03:28.090> on<00:03:28.150> tap

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
to try it the other way put it on tap

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.199 
to try it the other way put it on tap
ring<00:03:28.690> something<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:32.590> set<00:03:32.829> it<00:03:32.950> up<00:03:33.150> you<00:03:34.150> have

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
ring something so you set it up you have

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.330 
ring something so you set it up you have
everything<00:03:34.720> ready<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.970> I'm<00:03:36.970> gonna<00:03:37.180> put<00:03:37.390> this

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
everything ready and I'm gonna put this

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.530 
everything ready and I'm gonna put this
thing<00:03:39.340> as<00:03:39.489> string<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:40.000> don't<00:03:40.209> know<00:03:40.299> if<00:03:40.420> it'll

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
thing as string I don't know if it'll

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.069 
thing as string I don't know if it'll
catch<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.989> this<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:41.440> pretty<00:03:41.650> short<00:03:42.160> but<00:03:43.079> all

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
catch it this is pretty short but all

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.770 
catch it this is pretty short but all
it's<00:03:44.260> gotta<00:03:44.410> do<00:03:44.590> is<00:03:44.709> come<00:03:44.920> over<00:03:44.950> Oh

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.180 

as<00:03:49.780> we<00:03:50.410> can<00:03:50.620> see<00:03:50.829> didn't<00:03:51.310> work<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.950> dirt

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
as we can see didn't work this the dirt

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.620 
as we can see didn't work this the dirt
under<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:54.790> was<00:03:54.940> way<00:03:55.180> too<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:58.180> was<00:03:58.359> touching

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
under it was way too it was touching

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.500 
under it was way too it was touching
when<00:03:59.290> it<00:03:59.410> came<00:03:59.739> down<00:03:59.799> it<00:04:00.310> touch<00:04:00.579> now<00:04:01.269> either

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
when it came down it touch now either

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.870 
when it came down it touch now either
it's<00:04:01.810> gonna<00:04:01.930> get<00:04:02.140> pushed<00:04:02.380> away<00:04:02.640> or<00:04:03.640> it's<00:04:03.730> gonna

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
it's gonna get pushed away or it's gonna

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.140 
it's gonna get pushed away or it's gonna
get<00:04:04.000> pushed<00:04:04.299> down<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:06.040> what<00:04:06.400> what<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:06.970> can<00:04:07.180> do<00:04:09.150> is

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
get pushed down so what what I can do is

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.430 
get pushed down so what what I can do is
just<00:04:10.420> make<00:04:10.569> us<00:04:10.780> bigger<00:04:11.170> trench

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:23.780 

with<00:04:14.860> my<00:04:15.010> hammer<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:18.820> should<00:04:19.180> work

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.100 

say<00:04:24.390> it's<00:04:24.570> spending<00:04:25.200> even<00:04:25.560> farther<00:04:26.040> back<00:04:26.220> now

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
say it's spending even farther back now

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.020 
say it's spending even farther back now
that's<00:04:28.110> not<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.590> huge<00:04:28.920> problem<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:29.490> huge

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
that's not a huge problem that huge

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.840 
that's not a huge problem that huge
trench<00:04:30.420> because<00:04:31.230> watch<00:04:31.520> they're<00:04:32.520> gonna<00:04:32.640> come

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
trench because watch they're gonna come

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.520 
trench because watch they're gonna come
over<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:33.480> they're<00:04:33.780> not<00:04:33.930> gonna<00:04:34.050> know<00:04:34.260> it<00:04:34.410> and

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
over and they're not gonna know it and

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.410 
over and they're not gonna know it and
all<00:04:34.590> Sun<00:04:36.260> now<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:37.290> didn't<00:04:37.620> grab<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:38.070> a<00:04:38.420> couple

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
all Sun now I didn't grab it a couple

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.940 
all Sun now I didn't grab it a couple
reasons<00:04:39.720> one<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.110> had<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.650> circle<00:04:41.520> way<00:04:42.060> too<00:04:42.120> big

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
reasons one I had the circle way too big

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.130 
reasons one I had the circle way too big
but<00:04:43.950> also<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:48.120> is<00:04:48.180> not<00:04:48.510> very<00:04:48.780> big

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
but also that this is not very big

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.980 
but also that this is not very big
normally<00:04:49.770> it<00:04:50.070> would<00:04:50.100> have<00:04:50.600> something<00:04:51.600> to<00:04:51.720> grab

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
normally it would have something to grab

on to this is a thing is I'll set it up

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.940 
on to this is a thing is I'll set it up
one<00:04:55.320> more<00:04:55.380> time<00:04:57.170> and<00:04:58.170> I'll<00:04:58.440> show<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.650> maybe

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.670 
one more time and I'll show you maybe
this<00:04:59.310> time<00:04:59.550> I'll<00:05:00.020> this<00:05:01.020> time<00:05:01.260> I'll<00:05:01.380> try<00:05:01.620> to

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
this time I'll this time I'll try to

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.420 
this time I'll this time I'll try to
grab<00:05:01.920> the

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.600 

the<00:05:08.910> thing<00:05:09.570> is<00:05:09.690> string<00:05:10.280> I'll<00:05:11.280> make<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.580> a

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
the thing is string I'll make it a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:12.439 
the thing is string I'll make it a
little<00:05:11.790> smaller

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
little smaller

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.080 
little smaller
so<00:05:13.260> maybe<00:05:13.560> your<00:05:13.770> squirrels<00:05:14.130> or<00:05:14.460> something<00:05:14.880> or

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
so maybe your squirrels or something or

whatever you're trying to catch for food
a<00:05:18.990> little<00:05:19.740> smaller<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.910> keep<00:05:21.090> missing

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
a little smaller and keep missing

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.120 
a little smaller and keep missing
because<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.169> might<00:05:22.410> think<00:05:22.860> that<00:05:22.919> you're

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
because you might think that you're

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.400 
because you might think that you're
trying<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.370> get<00:05:23.520> squirrel<00:05:24.030> but<00:05:24.780> you<00:05:24.990> actually

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
trying to get squirrel but you actually

getting a chipmunk eating your food so

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.350 
getting a chipmunk eating your food so
here<00:05:28.620> we<00:05:28.680> go<00:05:28.800> again

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
here we go again

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.110 
here we go again
throw<00:05:30.360> your<00:05:30.740> excess<00:05:31.740> string<00:05:33.590> close<00:05:34.590> and

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
throw your excess string close and

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.210 
throw your excess string close and
better

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
better

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.910 
better
I'll<00:05:37.730> show<00:05:38.000> a<00:05:38.030> faraway<00:05:38.420> distance<00:05:38.870> in<00:05:39.410> a<00:05:39.500> second

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:39.920 
I'll show a faraway distance in a second

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.510 
I'll show a faraway distance in a second
but<00:05:40.450> if<00:05:41.450> you<00:05:41.810> mess<00:05:42.020> up<00:05:42.050> one<00:05:42.410> time<00:05:42.710> maybe<00:05:43.220> two

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
but if you mess up one time maybe two

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.160 
but if you mess up one time maybe two
maybe<00:05:43.850> even<00:05:43.970> ten<00:05:44.740> because<00:05:45.740> I<00:05:46.010> set<00:05:46.370> this<00:05:46.490> up<00:05:47.170> six

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
maybe even ten because I set this up six

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.450 
maybe even ten because I set this up six
times<00:05:48.470> before<00:05:48.740> I<00:05:48.920> finally<00:05:49.310> got<00:05:49.340> something<00:05:50.080> so

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
times before I finally got something so

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.670 
times before I finally got something so
take<00:05:52.460> your<00:05:52.580> time<00:05:53.530> you<00:05:54.530> know

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
take your time you know

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.660 
take your time you know
fine-tune<00:05:55.400> stuff<00:05:56.080> you're<00:05:57.190> like<00:05:58.190> some<00:05:58.460> things

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
fine-tune stuff you're like some things

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.030 
fine-tune stuff you're like some things
you<00:05:58.760> can<00:05:58.850> have<00:05:58.940> to<00:05:59.030> fine-tune<00:05:59.560> right<00:06:00.560> here

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
you can have to fine-tune right here

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.080 
you can have to fine-tune right here
this<00:06:01.790> big<00:06:02.420> trench<00:06:02.780> maybe<00:06:03.290> this<00:06:03.560> is<00:06:03.710> too<00:06:04.190> thin

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
this big trench maybe this is too thin

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.730 
this big trench maybe this is too thin
like<00:06:05.630> if<00:06:05.810> it's<00:06:05.990> pushing<00:06:06.230> it<00:06:06.440> and<00:06:06.560> it's

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
like if it's pushing it and it's

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.700 
like if it's pushing it and it's
touching<00:06:06.950> the<00:06:07.190> wall<00:06:07.550> or<00:06:08.450> something<00:06:08.720> or<00:06:09.140> maybe

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
touching the wall or something or maybe

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.910 
touching the wall or something or maybe
it's<00:06:10.010> getting<00:06:10.220> stuck<00:06:10.990> maybe<00:06:11.990> that's<00:06:12.230> it<00:06:12.530> or

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:12.920 
it's getting stuck maybe that's it or

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.260 
it's getting stuck maybe that's it or
maybe<00:06:13.070> you<00:06:13.220> don't<00:06:13.340> have<00:06:13.460> enough<00:06:13.550> tension<00:06:13.970> on

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
maybe you don't have enough tension on

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.630 
maybe you don't have enough tension on
your<00:06:14.330> tree<00:06:15.080> maybe<00:06:15.710> your<00:06:15.950> tree<00:06:16.190> is<00:06:16.250> just<00:06:16.370> too

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
your tree maybe your tree is just too

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.580 
your tree maybe your tree is just too
weak<00:06:16.880> you<00:06:17.540> might<00:06:17.690> have<00:06:17.810> to<00:06:17.900> find<00:06:18.140> out<00:06:18.290> thicker

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
weak you might have to find out thicker

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.210 
weak you might have to find out thicker
tree<00:06:18.980> to<00:06:19.490> use<00:06:19.670> or<00:06:20.110> on<00:06:21.110> this<00:06:21.590> piece<00:06:21.830> of<00:06:21.860> wood

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
tree to use or on this piece of wood

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.600 
tree to use or on this piece of wood
here<00:06:22.820> trigger<00:06:23.320> you<00:06:24.320> can<00:06:24.560> put<00:06:25.250> it<00:06:25.340> more<00:06:25.430> to<00:06:25.580> a

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
here trigger you can put it more to a

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.940 
here trigger you can put it more to a
point<00:06:26.000> but<00:06:26.630> they<00:06:26.750> make<00:06:26.930> it<00:06:27.050> flat<00:06:27.470> at<00:06:27.680> the<00:06:27.710> end

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
point but they make it flat at the end

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.100 
point but they make it flat at the end
because<00:06:28.400> if<00:06:28.520> it's<00:06:28.670> if<00:06:29.090> it's<00:06:29.240> more<00:06:29.510> of<00:06:29.540> a<00:06:29.720> sharp

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
because if it's if it's more of a sharp

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.660 
because if it's if it's more of a sharp
point<00:06:30.380> it's<00:06:30.590> going<00:06:30.740> to<00:06:30.800> stick<00:06:31.040> into<00:06:31.190> your<00:06:31.400> wood

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670 
point it's going to stick into your wood

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.390 
point it's going to stick into your wood
and<00:06:34.180> then<00:06:35.180> it<00:06:35.330> just<00:06:35.480> won't<00:06:35.600> fire<00:06:36.020> so<00:06:36.980> I'll<00:06:37.220> show

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
and then it just won't fire so I'll show

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.399 
and then it just won't fire so I'll show
you<00:06:37.430> one<00:06:37.640> more<00:06:37.700> time<00:06:37.970> from<00:06:38.180> far<00:06:38.480> away<00:06:38.570> distance

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:46.089 

all<00:06:42.979> right<00:06:43.779> one<00:06:44.779> more<00:06:44.839> time<00:06:45.349> I've<00:06:45.679> set<00:06:46.069> the

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
all right one more time I've set the

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:48.609 
all right one more time I've set the
whole<00:06:46.279> thing<00:06:46.459> up<00:06:46.849> let's<00:06:47.809> see<00:06:47.959> if<00:06:48.050> we<00:06:48.199> can<00:06:48.349> catch

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:48.619 
whole thing up let's see if we can catch

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:56.070 
whole thing up let's see if we can catch
the<00:06:49.219> thing<00:06:49.849> of<00:06:49.969> spring<00:06:51.279> so<00:06:52.279> scroll<00:06:53.149> comes<00:06:53.419> by

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080

all right
one<00:07:05.900> more<00:07:06.110> time<00:07:06.380> I've<00:07:06.800> set<00:07:07.160> the<00:07:07.340> whole<00:07:07.370> thing

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
one more time I've set the whole thing

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
up let's see if we can catch the thing

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:18.280 
up let's see if we can catch the thing
of<00:07:11.060> spring<00:07:12.340> so<00:07:13.340> scroll<00:07:14.240> comes<00:07:14.540> by<00:07:17.200> there<00:07:18.200> you

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.290 
of spring so scroll comes by there you

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.930 
of spring so scroll comes by there you
go

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:22.940 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:31.010
