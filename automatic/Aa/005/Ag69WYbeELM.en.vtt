00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.049 
chase some wires you're trying to figure
out<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.740> wiring<00:00:11.010> diagram<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.790> they<00:00:11.880> had<00:00:12.030> a

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.749 
out the wiring diagram and they had a
red<00:00:12.929> wire<00:00:13.170> going<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:13.830> we're<00:00:14.309> gonna<00:00:14.639> do

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
red wire going in we're gonna do

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.760 
red wire going in we're gonna do
something<00:00:14.940> crazy<00:00:15.120> yeah<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:16.170> goes<00:00:16.320> from<00:00:16.500> red

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
there and it's like half the so you got

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.020 
there and it's like half the so you got
one<00:00:33.870> yr<00:00:34.079> three<00:00:34.410> colors<00:00:34.739> yeah<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.340> wonder<00:00:35.940> we

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
one yr three colors yeah I wonder we

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.520 
one yr three colors yeah I wonder we
couldn't<00:00:36.149> figure<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.630> within<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:37.320> foot

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
couldn't figure it out within a one foot

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.319 
couldn't figure it out within a one foot
span<00:00:37.800> yeah<00:00:38.160> yeah<00:00:38.430> yeah<00:00:38.820> we're<00:00:38.969> trying<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> hook

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
span yeah yeah yeah we're trying to hook

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.880 
span yeah yeah yeah we're trying to hook
the<00:00:39.480> ignition<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> neutral<00:00:40.829> safety

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the ignition up with the neutral safety

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.459 
the ignition up with the neutral safety
switch<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.300> there's<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.780> blue<00:00:42.960> wire<00:00:43.200> we're

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
switch and so there's a blue wire we're

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.170 
switch and so there's a blue wire we're
trying<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.770> trace<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.340> all<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:45.000> all

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
trying to trace it and all these all

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.630 
trying to trace it and all these all
these<00:00:45.210> wires<00:00:45.510> underneath<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.980> insulation

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
these wires underneath to the insulation

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.549 
these wires underneath to the insulation
the<00:00:47.850> sound<00:00:48.300> insulation<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.140> vlogging

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the sound insulation and vlogging

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.889 
the sound insulation and vlogging
everything<00:00:49.969> then<00:00:50.969> why<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.539> had<00:00:51.750> this

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
everything then why like they had this

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.430 
everything then why like they had this
off<00:00:52.250> shake<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.280> shift<00:00:53.910> eraser<00:00:54.180> yeah<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
off shake that shift eraser yeah it's a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.680 
off shake that shift eraser yeah it's a
4-speed<00:00:55.920> realized<00:00:56.730> they<00:00:56.879> don't<00:00:57.239> want<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> move

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
4-speed realized they don't want to move

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.630 
4-speed realized they don't want to move
like<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.899> they<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.129> towers<00:00:59.520> not

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
like that they see that the towers not

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.209 
like that they see that the towers not
supposed<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.000> move<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.070> all
