okay annealing the burger VOD is not a

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.240 
okay annealing the burger VOD is not a
great<00:00:05.190> deal<00:00:05.339> different<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:06.210> annealing<00:00:06.899> brass

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
great deal different to annealing brass

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.490 
great deal different to annealing brass
in<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.670> pan<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.300> water<00:00:09.450> I've<00:00:10.080> got<00:00:10.290> my<00:00:10.410> little

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
in the pan of water I've got my little

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.310 
in the pan of water I've got my little
pan<00:00:10.980> or<00:00:11.130> water<00:00:11.280> yet<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.450> it's<00:00:12.660> just<00:00:12.960> enough<00:00:13.170> to

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
pan or water yet and it's just enough to

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.200 
pan or water yet and it's just enough to
cover<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:14.059> projectile<00:00:15.059> up<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:16.460> Hogan<00:00:17.460> I'm

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
cover the projectile up to the Hogan I'm

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.519 
cover the projectile up to the Hogan I'm
going<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> put<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> nut<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.020> pan<00:00:19.230> if<00:00:19.470> you

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
going to put a nut on the pan if you

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.380 
going to put a nut on the pan if you
want<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:20.100> multiple<00:00:20.580> projectiles<00:00:21.090> then

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
want to do multiple projectiles then

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.439 
want to do multiple projectiles then
pull<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.750> several<00:00:22.140> nuts<00:00:22.699> order<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.910> diameter

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
pull in several nuts order a diameter

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.660 
pull in several nuts order a diameter
that<00:00:24.660> some<00:00:24.930> large<00:00:25.590> enough<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.890> house<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
that some large enough to house the

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.480 
that some large enough to house the
projectile<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:28.470> helps<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> projectile<00:00:29.279> set

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
projectile it helps the projectile set

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:44.160 
projectile it helps the projectile set
up<00:00:29.609> right<00:00:32.450> startup<00:00:33.450> amp<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> watch

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.840 

so<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.559> purpose<00:00:44.890> of<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.100> pan<00:00:45.280> of<00:00:45.430> water<00:00:45.550> has

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
so the purpose of the pan of water has

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.110 
so the purpose of the pan of water has
to<00:00:46.000> stop<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:47.100> lead<00:00:48.100> from<00:00:48.399> popping<00:00:48.850> out<00:00:48.940> at<00:00:49.059> the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
to stop the lead from popping out at the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.430 
to stop the lead from popping out at the
top<00:00:49.270> of<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:49.420> projectile<00:00:49.870> which<00:00:50.020> would<00:00:50.170> happen

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
top of the projectile which would happen

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.630 
top of the projectile which would happen
otherwise<00:00:50.649> because<00:00:51.160> we're<00:00:51.309> going<00:00:51.430> to<00:00:51.489> take

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
otherwise because we're going to take

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.960 
otherwise because we're going to take
this<00:00:51.790> up<00:00:51.970> to<00:00:52.500> considerable<00:00:53.500> heat<00:00:53.970> mentioning

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
this up to considerable heat mentioning

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.580 
this up to considerable heat mentioning
looking<00:00:55.510> for<00:00:55.720> a<00:00:55.750> color<00:00:55.989> change<00:00:56.290> in<00:00:56.500> the

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
looking for a color change in the

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.940 
looking for a color change in the
projectile

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.430 

the<00:01:01.220> purpose<00:01:01.610> of<00:01:01.760> us<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:02.390> weaken<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.200> tip

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
the purpose of us is to weaken the tip

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.580 
the purpose of us is to weaken the tip
of<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:03.770> VLT

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.310 

so<00:01:10.159> that<00:01:10.399> it<00:01:11.210> long<00:01:11.479> range

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
so that it long range

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.860 
so that it long range
we<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:14.040> full<00:01:14.220> fragmentation<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.510> the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
we get full fragmentation and the

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.570 
we get full fragmentation and the
mineral<00:01:16.170> resistance<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
mineral resistance you do really have to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.090 
mineral resistance you do really have to
make<00:01:20.820> sure<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:22.320> heated<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.800> and<00:01:23.010> if

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
make sure that it's heated up and if

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:52.090 
make sure that it's heated up and if
you've<00:01:23.220> got<00:01:23.400> some<00:01:23.640> color<00:01:23.940> change

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.719 

here<00:01:52.640> we<00:01:52.729> go<00:01:52.880> we're<00:01:53.030> just<00:01:53.060> kidding

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.810 

for<00:01:56.240> us<00:01:56.330> come<00:01:56.840> up<00:01:56.869> through<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.350> blue<00:01:57.610> grass<00:01:58.610> see

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
for us come up through to blue grass see

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.420 
for us come up through to blue grass see
blue<00:01:59.000> color<00:01:59.530> so<00:02:00.530> that's<00:02:00.770> just<00:02:00.950> about<00:02:01.130> it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
blue color so that's just about it

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.160 
blue color so that's just about it
those<00:02:01.700> projectiles<00:02:02.180> pretty<00:02:02.600> much<00:02:02.750> really<00:02:03.140> go

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.139 

be<00:02:08.530> easier<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.039> wear<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.280> guys<00:02:09.459> do<00:02:09.819> this<00:02:10.000> at

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
be easier to wear you guys do this at

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.839 
be easier to wear you guys do this at
night<00:02:10.179> if<00:02:10.569> you're<00:02:10.720> not<00:02:10.840> familiar<00:02:10.990> with

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
night if you're not familiar with

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.940 
night if you're not familiar with
annealing<00:02:12.849> and<00:02:12.970> looking<00:02:13.239> for<00:02:13.360> color

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.640 

okay<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.370> beggar<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.910> annealed<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
okay so the beggar is annealed and the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.809 
okay so the beggar is annealed and the
most<00:02:21.830> important<00:02:22.220> thing<00:02:22.340> he<00:02:22.430> has<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.670> make<00:02:22.790> sure

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
most important thing he has to make sure

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.160 
most important thing he has to make sure
that<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.150> cools<00:02:23.360> down<00:02:23.450> naturally

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
that it cools down naturally

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.110 
that it cools down naturally
so<00:02:24.319> don't<00:02:24.560> tip<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.920> into<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.190> water<00:02:25.370> and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
so don't tip it into the water and

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.699 
so don't tip it into the water and
either<00:02:26.540> pull<00:02:26.780> it<00:02:26.840> out<00:02:26.990> with<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> welding<00:02:27.500> glove

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
either pull it out with a welding glove

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.580 
either pull it out with a welding glove
and<00:02:28.010> place<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.850> on<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:28.970> soft<00:02:29.240> rag<00:02:29.540> or<00:02:30.140> just<00:02:30.470> let

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
and place it on a soft rag or just let

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.960 
and place it on a soft rag or just let
it<00:02:30.620> cool<00:02:30.830> down<00:02:31.040> for<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.280> while<00:02:31.400> this<00:02:31.790> one's

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
it cool down for a while this one's

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.460 
it cool down for a while this one's
actually<00:02:32.150> cooled<00:02:32.660> down<00:02:32.840> enough<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.260> me<00:02:33.350> to

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
actually cooled down enough for me to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.350 
actually cooled down enough for me to
handle<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:33.800> me<00:02:33.920> up<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:36.730> we'll<00:02:37.730> zoom<00:02:37.910> in<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.209> a

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
handle it me up and we'll zoom in on a

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.699 
handle it me up and we'll zoom in on a
moment<00:02:38.660> and<00:02:38.780> have<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.959> look<00:02:39.110> at<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.350> actual

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
moment and have a look at that actual

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.750 
moment and have a look at that actual
color<00:02:39.920> change<00:02:41.920> okay<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:42.980> hopefully<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.640> can

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
color change okay so hopefully you can

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.270 
color change okay so hopefully you can
see<00:02:44.000> there<00:02:44.300> is<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.600> color<00:02:44.900> change<00:02:45.230> through<00:02:46.130> this

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
see there is a color change through this

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.910 
see there is a color change through this
area<00:02:46.550> here<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:48.170> can<00:02:48.320> see<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.620> watermark

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
area here and you can see the watermark

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.229 
area here and you can see the watermark
on<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:50.480> burger<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:52.160> that's<00:02:52.340> ready<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.610> go<00:02:52.730> for

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
on the burger so that's ready to go for

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.140 
on the burger so that's ready to go for
a<00:02:53.269> long<00:02:53.540> range<00:02:53.840> hunting<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:55.370> other<00:02:55.400> option<00:02:56.000> is
