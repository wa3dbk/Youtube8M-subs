 George Thomomaz was a well-known English preacher 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.439
 he appeared one day in his preaching carrying a cage 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.229
 according to the public 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:16.309
 and then 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.900
 started talking I was walking down the street yesterday 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.109
 and I saw the boy carrying this cage 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.839

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.189

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.560

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.570

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.780

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.010

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.110
 I'm going to have fun with them. 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.040
 so 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.990
 he asked 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.680
 What do you want for these airline tickets? 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.290
 the boy answered 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.880

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.960
 they are of no use then the preacher bought them for 10 bucks 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.770
 exhorted in a tree 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.860
 a goal 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.110
 jesus satan were talking 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.340
 jesus asked satan 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.650
 what he was doing people here on earth he replied I'm me 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.330

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.990
 need to make bombs 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.679
 was going to kill while using revolver to hate each other's house to get divorced 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.810
 we teach little children 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.440
 these young people to use drugs 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.340

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.880
 and do all that is not due and what will lead them to curse culture 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.470
 I'm having a lot of fun with them. 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.280
 jesus asked 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.780
 and then 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.060
 What are you going to do with them? I'll kill them and end them. 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.660
 So Jesus said how much you want for them. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.630
 Ironically 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.170
 - answered 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.170
 You're not going to want these people. 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.810
 they are treacherous 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.200
 meteorites 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.290
 false 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.000
 seven achievements and the sticks 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.030
 I will not really love you 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.909
 he spit at your cost 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.099
 source dismiss boy taken into account 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.099
 whatever you want 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.439
 How much do you want for her to know? 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.589
 They want to tear up tears. 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.099
 and jesus paid 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.119
 the price of our freedom as we can forget it 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.300
 believing 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.410
 everything that teaches us but we always question the things that come from God 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.549
 everyone wants to one day be with him but do not want to meet him and loved 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.299
 many say 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.409
 I believe in god 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.409
 They do not do anything for him. 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.659
 people 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.099
 Send jokes by email 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.620
 this action to the others at a bus speed but when the 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.200
 message about god 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.539
 people 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:01.539
 two daughters before sharing with the health 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.429
 everytime 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:05.339
 with a team you twist 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:07.639
 with the car you like the most 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:13.829
 what's your favorite band your favorite song with death think twice 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.629
 before they say 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.349
 I am of Christ 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.909
 and I love God 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.109
 try to be invisible will be that when you have just heard this message you 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.680
 creates the courage to kill a friend is not sure what people will think 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.519
 about you if you send talk about jesus christ is not a subject that the 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.739
 people want to listen, just want to act together 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:39.959
 when they are in big trouble 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.959
 so I thought we do not have another way 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.469
 unless 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.169
 mingardi euros 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.699
 if you are a person who believes in God 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:55.289
 and love then send your message to as many people as you can 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.339
 I can because if it was a song 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.659
 I would make sure that you at the same time 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.339
 would be sharing with your friends 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:09.449
 may god bless you apparently immediately on friday 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:11.069
 It's fair
