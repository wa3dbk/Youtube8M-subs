00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
more dolly look I recommend starting

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.080

really high up on the top of your crown

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.209 
really high up on the top of your crown
but<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.840> also<00:00:34.020> depends<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.530> how<00:00:34.590> much<00:00:34.829> hair<00:00:35.100> you

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
but it also depends on how much hair you

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.709 
but it also depends on how much hair you
are<00:00:35.309> willing<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.670> sacrifice<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.300> bangs<00:00:36.510> as

are willing to sacrifice for bangs as

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.810 
are willing to sacrifice for bangs as
well<00:00:36.899> how<00:00:37.620> wide<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.100> triangle<00:00:38.520> should<00:00:38.640> be

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
well how wide the triangle should be

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.520 
well how wide the triangle should be
depends<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.270> your<00:00:39.420> eyebrows<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.350> hold

depends on your eyebrows I like to hold

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.470 
depends on your eyebrows I like to hold
my<00:00:40.680> comb<00:00:40.950> at<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.309> ends<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:41.700> eyebrows<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.180

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
then I angle it towards the point at the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
then I angle it towards the point at the
top<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.670> triangle<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.809> that's<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.079> kind

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
dye red alrighty so like I mentioned
before<00:01:26.159> I'm<00:01:26.820> souping<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.360> hair<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> left

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
before I'm souping my hair to the left

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.899 
before I'm souping my hair to the left
so<00:01:28.380> I'm<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:29.130> hold<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> right

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
so I'm going to hold it to the right

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.149 
so I'm going to hold it to the right
side<00:01:30.180> while<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:30.570> cutting<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.290> next<00:01:31.590> guide<00:01:31.829> is

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
side while I'm cutting the next guide is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.190 
side while I'm cutting the next guide is
the<00:01:32.189> hollow<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.939> your<00:01:32.970> cheeks<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.780> best<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the hollow of your cheeks it's best to

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.660 
the hollow of your cheeks it's best to
cut<00:01:34.439> right<00:01:34.619> there<00:01:34.650> because<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.430> got<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
cut right there because you got to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.830 
cut right there because you got to
remember<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.240> your<00:01:36.420> hair<00:01:36.630> will<00:01:36.810> look

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
remember that your hair will look

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.319 
remember that your hair will look
shorter<00:01:37.439> when<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.770> dry<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.400> using<00:01:39.299> your

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
shorter when it's dry so using your

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.670 
shorter when it's dry so using your
shears<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.900> ahead<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.200> cut<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> straight<00:01:40.619> line

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
shears go ahead and cut a straight line

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.230 
shears go ahead and cut a straight line
and<00:01:41.159> your<00:01:41.280> finger<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.700> going<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.030> your

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and your finger is going to be your

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.660 
and your finger is going to be your
guide<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.100> looks<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.490> bit

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
guide for this so it looks a little bit

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.249 
guide for this so it looks a little bit
funky<00:01:45.090> right<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.960> sweep<00:01:46.170> it

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
funky right now but when you sweep it

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.960 
funky right now but when you sweep it
over<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> side<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.399> was<00:01:47.549> intended

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
over to the side that it was intended

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.030 
over to the side that it was intended
for<00:01:48.270> you'll<00:01:48.720> notice<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.350> hair<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.649> cut

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
for you'll notice that your hair is cut

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
for you'll notice that your hair is cut
at<00:01:50.189> an<00:01:50.310> angle<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.360> enables<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
at an angle and this enables you to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.080 
at an angle and this enables you to
swoop<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.500> hair<00:01:52.770> over<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.369> without<00:01:53.520> too<00:01:53.939> much

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
swoop your hair over it without too much

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060 
swoop your hair over it without too much
wool<00:01:54.390> also<00:01:55.079> by<00:01:55.200> using<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.590> hull<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.920> your

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
wool also by using the hull of your

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160 
wool also by using the hull of your
cheeks<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.520> guide<00:01:56.820> your<00:01:57.149> bangs<00:01:57.360> will<00:01:57.600> end<00:01:57.840> up

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
cheeks as a guide your bangs will end up

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.050 
cheeks as a guide your bangs will end up
there<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> doesn't<00:01:59.219> look<00:01:59.280> too<00:01:59.340> choppy<00:01:59.820> when

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
there so it doesn't look too choppy when

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.580 
there so it doesn't look too choppy when
it<00:02:00.180> blends<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.869> rest<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.229> your<00:02:01.380> hair

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it blends in with the rest of your hair

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
it blends in with the rest of your hair
so<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.430> last<00:02:02.670> thing<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.420> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
so then the last thing I like to do is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
so then the last thing I like to do is
section<00:02:03.750> my<00:02:04.020> bangs<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.530> leaving<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> bottom

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.910

bottom of the bangs now you can use a
razor<00:02:12.780> here<00:02:13.230> but<00:02:13.440> I'm<00:02:13.590> avoiding<00:02:13.890> them<00:02:14.250> because
