00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.829
 the vehicle in our garage today 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.890
 is a dodge caravan 2002 with a motor 3 point 3 viedma 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.429
 and about 104 thousand miles of travel 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.279
 was introduced because they have two fault codes 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.890
 the third 4 4 2 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.220
 that indicates a small escape 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.450
 and the third 4 5 5 that indicates 1 this cathedral 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.370
 There are several causes 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.329
 very common for these codes 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.800
 in this vehicle 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.590
 for example a hose that has a crack shortly after disconnects you 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.490
 the inflation ring of the rusty fuel 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.230
 an intersection pump with a leak a loose gas cap missing 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.450
 peru that has escape we could simply replace all this fault 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.540
 common and trust that everything goes well 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.539
 but the best thing is that the source is finished 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.270
 foreign sources 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.759
 this can be achieved 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.299
 sealing the system 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.740
 filling with smoke 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.550
 and looking for the point where it does not escape 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.660
 we connect the smoke machine with the system 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.580
 through nephew's hose to debug instead of the green port 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.300
 because it's so much easier in this vehicle 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.550
 if we use the test port 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.300
 we would also need to block the vacuum hose from the motor boom with 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.200
 some noise 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.200
 to cut the flow of motor humor 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.640
 after jiegu and in it the system 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.730
 we start with testing a back-to-front system 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.110
 checking the whole ibiza system that we miss some escape or some 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.770
 repercussion 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.360
 the first place we look at is the gas cap 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.770
 as you can see 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.650
 without an apparent escape 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.350
 The caps can also be tested to verify the pressure and avoid problems 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.439
 we checked later he had input 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:16.129
 the tank hoses near the tank to see if there are sewn and leaks 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.799
 everything seems fine 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.579
 then there are the steam deposits 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.409
 This vehicle has two tanks 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.339
 the majority usually has only one 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.989
 we can not see any sign of smoke escape 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.329
 we have the same result as with the detection pump of these 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:39.959
 Under the air filter box there are several collections of 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:40.580
 bang 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.010
 who suffer too 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.889
 failures commonly 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.059
 here we see or another escape in the hose that leads spent tip lennon 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:53.319
 this time the crack could be made to have been found simply as a 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.709
 visual inspection 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.659
 but the smoke did not make it much easier 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.859
 all we have to do now is replace this short vacuum hose 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.639
 connect again this air box 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.649
 clean fault codes 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:09.649
 and a little death 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:11.940
 see you 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.180
 next time in the garage the text points
