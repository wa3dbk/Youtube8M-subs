so<00:00:54.679> for<00:00:55.070> me<00:00:55.300> I<00:00:56.530> find<00:00:57.530> that<00:00:57.800> each<00:00:58.519> toshin<00:00:59.210> foam

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
so for me I find that each toshin foam

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.680 
so for me I find that each toshin foam
soap<00:01:00.370> moisturizes<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.429> skin<00:01:01.519> while<00:01:02.510> I'm

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
soap moisturizes the skin while I'm

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.900 
soap moisturizes the skin while I'm
tattooing<00:01:03.289> so<00:01:03.620> for<00:01:03.769> example<00:01:04.220> if<00:01:04.339> I'm<00:01:04.519> working

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
tattooing so for example if I'm working

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.000 
tattooing so for example if I'm working
on<00:01:05.150> a<00:01:05.210> piece<00:01:05.480> and<00:01:05.750> then<00:01:05.870> six<00:01:06.320> hours<00:01:06.680> in<00:01:06.890> the
