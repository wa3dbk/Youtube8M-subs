I just<00:00:00.269> finished<00:00:00.480> a<00:00:00.719> record<00:00:01.020> so<00:00:01.140> it's<00:00:01.290> easy

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
I just finished a record so it's easy

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.970 
I just finished a record so it's easy
for<00:00:01.560> me<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:02.040> start<00:00:02.730> comparing<00:00:03.470> what<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.500> do<00:00:04.620> with

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
for me to start comparing what I do with

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.099 
for me to start comparing what I do with
how<00:00:05.130> I<00:00:05.160> just<00:00:05.580> produced<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.270> last<00:00:06.540> record<00:00:06.810> and

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
how I just produced this last record and

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.150 
how I just produced this last record and
I<00:00:08.040> used<00:00:08.760> one<00:00:09.150> marshall<00:00:09.750> jcm800<00:00:10.410> for<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.010> whole

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
I used one marshall jcm800 for the whole

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.400 
I used one marshall jcm800 for the whole
album<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.730> that's<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.570> some<00:00:12.750> marshall<00:00:13.290> that

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
album and that's just some marshall that

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.169 
album and that's just some marshall that
i<00:00:13.440> found<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:14.219> know<00:00:14.309> i<00:00:14.340> have<00:00:14.580> like<00:00:14.759> stuff<00:00:15.000> i've

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
i found you know i have like stuff i've

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.670 
i found you know i have like stuff i've
collected<00:00:15.360> over<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> years<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.350> sits<00:00:16.560> in

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
collected over the years that sits in

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.439 
collected over the years that sits in
storage<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.400> i<00:00:17.640> think<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:17.970> was<00:00:18.060> one<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> my

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
storage and i think it was one of my

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.890 
storage and i think it was one of my
live<00:00:18.690> live<00:00:19.410> rigs<00:00:19.770> from<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.220> 80s<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.820> i<00:00:21.660> took<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
live live rigs from the 80s and i took a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.990 
live live rigs from the 80s and i took a
handful<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.380> amps<00:00:23.010> into<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.340> studio<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.910> i

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
handful of amps into the studio and i

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.370 
handful of amps into the studio and i
checked<00:00:24.240> them<00:00:24.359> all<00:00:24.480> out<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.840> ended<00:00:25.109> up<00:00:25.199> with

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
checked them all out and ended up with

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.290 
checked them all out and ended up with
this<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.769> particular<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.430> sounds<00:00:26.730> amazing

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
this one particular it sounds amazing

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.120 
this one particular it sounds amazing
and<00:00:27.539> that's<00:00:27.779> usually<00:00:28.019> how<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:28.890> amps

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and that's usually how it is for amps

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.620 
and that's usually how it is for amps
you<00:00:29.220> just<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.609> through<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> bunch<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.390> them

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
you just go through a bunch of them

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.330 
you just go through a bunch of them
until<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.960> find<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.590> sounds<00:00:31.949> really

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
until you find one that sounds really

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.400 
until you find one that sounds really
you<00:00:32.969> know<00:00:33.030> particularly<00:00:33.450> pleasing<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.320> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
you know particularly pleasing to you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.950 
you know particularly pleasing to you
again<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.210> something<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.750> comes

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
again it's it's something that comes

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.889 
again it's it's something that comes
over<00:00:37.260> time<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.829> know<00:00:38.300> checking<00:00:39.300> stuff<00:00:39.660> out

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
over time you know checking stuff out

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.799 
over time you know checking stuff out
and<00:00:40.290> then<00:00:40.579> you<00:00:41.579> know<00:00:41.610> finding<00:00:42.450> something<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and then you know finding something that

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.630 
and then you know finding something that
really<00:00:43.170> appeals<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.829> sticking<00:00:44.610> with

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
really appeals to you and sticking with

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.250 
really appeals to you and sticking with
that<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.270> developing<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.899> from<00:00:46.079> there

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that and developing it from there

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.080 
that and developing it from there
there's<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:46.920> three<00:00:47.870> main<00:00:48.870> amps<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.850> real

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
there's like three main amps the real

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.959 
there's like three main amps the real
simple<00:00:51.600> jcm800<00:00:52.440> from<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> 80s<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
simple jcm800 from the 80s is what I

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.180 
simple jcm800 from the 80s is what I
just<00:00:54.270> used<00:00:54.480> recording<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.140> record<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.949> often

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
just used recording a record and I often

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520 
just used recording a record and I often
will<00:00:57.090> use<00:00:57.270> those<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.809> sessions<00:00:58.289> because

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
will use those in sessions because

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.459 
will use those in sessions because
they're<00:00:58.680> easy<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.010> find<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> vintage<00:01:01.170> modern
