giant nose but yes they are they're

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.530 
giant nose but yes they are they're
pretty<00:00:32.040> evenly<00:00:32.550> matched<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:33.090> us<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.360> guess

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
pretty evenly matched with us I guess

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.970 
pretty evenly matched with us I guess
but<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:33.899> think<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.469> we're<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> little<00:00:34.770> bit

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
but I do think that we're a little bit

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.330 
but I do think that we're a little bit
better<00:00:35.130> than<00:00:35.309> them<00:00:36.620> yeah<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> would<00:00:38.040> agree<00:00:38.129> that

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
better than them yeah I would agree that

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.799 
better than them yeah I would agree that
so<00:00:39.559> dude<00:00:40.559> can't<00:00:40.800> even<00:00:40.980> get<00:00:41.250> his<00:00:41.460> uh<00:00:41.660> there<00:00:42.660> we

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
so dude can't even get his uh there we

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.130 
so dude can't even get his uh there we
go

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
go

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.740 
go
can't<00:00:43.469> even<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.770> his<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> circle<00:00:44.969> clicked<00:00:45.570> on

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
can't even get his a circle clicked on

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.160 
can't even get his a circle clicked on
or<00:00:45.899> whatever<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.270> was<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> messing

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
or whatever and so I was kind of messing

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.080 
or whatever and so I was kind of messing
up<00:00:49.320> all<00:00:49.500> day<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.129> ace<00:00:50.280> surf<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.000> at

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
up all day with the ace surf but at

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.290 
up all day with the ace surf but at
least<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.390> got<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.110> somebody<00:00:52.890> did

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
least I got it there and somebody did

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.369 
least I got it there and somebody did
specifically<00:00:54.300> come<00:00:54.480> out<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> comment<00:00:55.199> when<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
specifically come out and comment when I

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.770 
specifically come out and comment when I
said<00:00:55.710> ace<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.340> don't<00:00:56.910> mean<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> literal

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
said ace I don't mean that as a literal

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.299 
said ace I don't mean that as a literal
tennis<00:00:58.079> ace<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.469> just<00:00:58.649> calling<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> ace

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
tennis ace I'm just calling it the ace

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.310 
tennis ace I'm just calling it the ace
serve<00:00:59.579> cuz<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.940> awesome<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.539> supposedly<00:01:01.170> an

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
serve cuz it's awesome but supposedly an

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.869 
serve cuz it's awesome but supposedly an
ace<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.890> guess<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.160> real<00:01:02.309> tennis<00:01:02.550> when<00:01:02.760> they

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
ace is I guess in real tennis when they

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.119 
ace is I guess in real tennis when they
don't<00:01:03.000> even<00:01:03.149> hit<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:05.010> like

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
don't even hit it you know so it's like

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.500 
don't even hit it you know so it's like
it<00:01:05.280> goes<00:01:05.489> past<00:01:05.880> them<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.240> they<00:01:06.299> don't<00:01:06.420> even

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
it goes past them and they don't even

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.750 
it goes past them and they don't even
hit<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:06.960> yeah<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> little<00:01:08.400> bit<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.580> lag

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
hit it so yeah a little bit of lag

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.250 
hit it so yeah a little bit of lag
actually<00:01:09.270> this<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> first<00:01:09.990> time<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
actually this was like the first time I

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.469 
actually this was like the first time I
really<00:01:10.619> saw<00:01:10.799> some<00:01:11.460> kind<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> substantial<00:01:12.270> lag

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
really saw some kind of substantial lag

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.690 
really saw some kind of substantial lag
at<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:13.650> would<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.130> been<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> good<00:01:14.460> move

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
at all that would have been a good move

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.749 
at all that would have been a good move
up<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.960> got<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.259> out<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.640> would<00:01:17.729> have

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
up and we got it out but that would have

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.210 
up and we got it out but that would have
been<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.939> great<00:01:18.210> save<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.810> our<00:01:19.200> part<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:20.159> just

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
than makes up for it in the that would

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.969

wind<00:02:48.739> yeah<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:50.390> actually<00:02:50.810> makes<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.139> a

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
wind yeah so this actually makes it a

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.490 
wind yeah so this actually makes it a
little<00:02:51.290> bit<00:02:51.500> closer<00:02:51.769> of<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.069> game<00:02:52.280> honestly<00:02:53.060> but
