00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
alright as you probably realize just

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.530 
alright as you probably realize just
from<00:00:02.610> what<00:00:02.639> I<00:00:02.760> was<00:00:02.939> discussing<00:00:03.360> the

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
from what I was discussing the

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.050 
from what I was discussing the
similarities<00:00:04.319> between<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.799> sharp<00:00:05.160> 11<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.850> a

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
similarities between a sharp 11 and a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.230 
similarities between a sharp 11 and a
flat<00:00:06.299> 5<00:00:06.569> chord<00:00:06.990> that<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.919> can<00:00:08.189> alter<00:00:08.670> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
flat 5 chord that we can alter the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.879 
flat 5 chord that we can alter the
chords<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:10.370> intervals<00:00:11.370> within<00:00:12.320> one<00:00:13.320> octave

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
chords the intervals within one octave

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.970 
chords the intervals within one octave
so<00:00:14.400> let's<00:00:14.880> look<00:00:15.059> at<00:00:15.269> flat<00:00:16.109> five<00:00:16.320> chords<00:00:16.800> and

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
so let's look at flat five chords and

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.890 
so let's look at flat five chords and
we've<00:00:17.130> already<00:00:17.250> seen<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.240> half<00:00:18.420> diminished

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
we've already seen the half diminished

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.570 
we've already seen the half diminished
remember<00:00:19.230> how<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.350> said<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
remember how I said that this is the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.390 
remember how I said that this is the
same<00:00:20.730> thing<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:21.029> half<00:00:21.210> diminish<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.130> minor<00:00:23.130> flat

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
same thing as half diminish a minor flat

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.430 
same thing as half diminish a minor flat
five<00:00:23.640> chord<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> half<00:00:24.480> diminished<00:00:24.900> chord

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440

with<00:01:11.260> a<00:01:11.290> in<00:01:11.710> our<00:01:11.860> base<00:01:12.510> let's<00:01:13.510> look<00:01:13.630> at<00:01:13.840> with<00:01:14.650> ye

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
with a in our base let's look at with ye

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.120 
with a in our base let's look at with ye
so<00:01:15.550> we<00:01:15.640> know<00:01:15.760> we<00:01:15.910> want<00:01:18.240> ideally<00:01:19.240> we<00:01:19.540> want<00:01:19.690> our

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so we know we want ideally we want our

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.580 
so we know we want ideally we want our
CD<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.820> B<00:01:22.540> flat<00:01:22.840> as<00:01:23.140> our<00:01:24.840> 135<00:01:25.840> is<00:01:26.050> good<00:01:26.259> but

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
CD and B flat as our 135 is good but

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.310 
CD and B flat as our 135 is good but
it's<00:01:27.210> optional<00:01:28.210> when<00:01:28.750> we're<00:01:28.900> thinking<00:01:29.050> about

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
it's optional when we're thinking about

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:39.060 
it's optional when we're thinking about
the<00:01:29.770> fact<00:01:30.759> we<00:01:31.000> want<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.240> flat<00:01:31.450> five<00:01:32.430> okay<00:01:38.070> here

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
the fact we want to flat five okay here

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.010 
the fact we want to flat five okay here
we<00:01:39.100> go<00:01:39.190> this<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.520> kind<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:40.000> this<00:01:40.600> will<00:01:40.780> get<00:01:40.930> it

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
we go this is kind of a this will get it

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.590 
we go this is kind of a this will get it
done<00:01:41.050> for<00:01:41.649> us<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:42.490> now<00:01:42.640> we<00:01:42.700> have<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:43.090> third<00:01:43.390> on

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
done for us so now we have the third on

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.540 
done for us so now we have the third on
top<00:01:43.899> here<00:01:44.229> so<00:01:44.740> we<00:01:44.860> have<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.040> 1<00:01:45.720> flat<00:01:46.720> 5<00:01:47.080> flat<00:01:47.550> 7

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
top here so we have a 1 flat 5 flat 7

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.600 
top here so we have a 1 flat 5 flat 7
and<00:01:49.119> then<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.200> regular<00:01:50.530> third<00:01:50.830> an<00:01:51.069> octave<00:01:51.429> up

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
and then a regular third an octave up

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.760 
and then a regular third an octave up
the<00:01:51.970> third<00:01:52.240> is<00:01:52.360> ok<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.660> be<00:01:52.899> in<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.289> octave<00:01:53.649> it

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
the third is ok to be in the octave it

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.149 
the third is ok to be in the octave it
won't

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.030 

that's<00:02:00.159> how<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.370> looks<00:02:00.550> over<00:02:00.700> here<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.830> I<00:02:02.860> get

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
that's how it looks over here so I get

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.830 
that's how it looks over here so I get
used<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.310> playing<00:02:03.430> dominant<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.420> ever<00:02:10.539> see

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
used to playing dominant if you ever see

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.170 
used to playing dominant if you ever see
something<00:02:11.500> written<00:02:11.680> as<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:11.920> dominant<00:02:12.430> just

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
something written as a dominant just

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.930 
something written as a dominant just
basically<00:02:13.540> saying<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.700> e7<00:02:15.700> flat<00:02:15.940> 5<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.540> example

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
basically saying I e7 flat 5 for example

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.150 
basically saying I e7 flat 5 for example
finding<00:02:18.940> your<00:02:19.090> e<00:02:19.240> base<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:22.360> creating<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
finding your e base and creating the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.090 
finding your e base and creating the
movable<00:02:24.670> shape<00:02:25.000> for<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.050> dominant<00:02:26.819> flat<00:02:27.819> 5
