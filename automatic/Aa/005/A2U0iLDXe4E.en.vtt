00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:13.700
 hi i'm max temple and i'm a pianist 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.680
 I'm a musician working mainly in 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.199
 a television orchestra in a big one 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.350
 orchestra in a big band and mine 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.189
 work as a musician and also as 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.260
 composer and arranger and how 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.640
 instrumentalist himself so I am 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.250
 the shift worker records the disks with i 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.489
 in short, Italians like groups very much 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.879
 the because they managed to give 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.320
 this great this great reality of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.300
 sound and feeling with the performer on 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.649
 problem of good digital photos is always 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.230
 was to fail to 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.730
 convey what the pianist is 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.820
 thinking at that moment of the way 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.160
 playing with the new ceriano is your own 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.299
 the feeling of thinking about a passage 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.920
 musical and able to transfer it to the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.670
 fingers and listen to what I thought 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:20.240
 the most special feature 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:26.100
 the most innovative is the dynamic 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.799
 I can play piano, I can 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.380
 move from pianissimo to fortissimo with 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.539
 an increase in constant dynamics 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.049
 as if I had an acoustic piano 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.049
 for example playing in pianissimo 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:54.590
 and I can give you all the nuances and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.590
 when I have to do the crescendo 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.710
 I have a curve a line and linear the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.899
 growing and this is a characteristic 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.870
 very important that allows the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.290
 pianist to use the instrument in the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.240
 full of all the sound coloring is 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.060
 very fun and very funny 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.030
 just thanks to this 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.959
 proximity with the acoustic instrument il 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.600
 pianist needs to feel the air 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.489
 around him he needs to hear the 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:42.040
 sound that those who wrap it in during 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:44.890
 the execution and how I can explain the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.080
 the pianist imagines himself imagines in 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.310
 in the head the melody to these 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.590
 such very very personal and 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.620
 very acoustic there is the viano a 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:02.010
 give this feature in an example 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.010
 if I play 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.950
 I can transfer them I go out to be wrapped 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.060
 from this sonority and above all I have the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.629
 ability to play piano speaking in 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.569
 this way is like the acoustic piano if 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.170
 I want to play more than just increase 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.170
 the dynamics 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.370
 you can I can lower myself to talk again 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.770
 as if it were an acoustic instrument in the 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.850
 there is a new viano this one 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.040
 feature that brings it even closer than 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.040
 more to the acoustic instrument there is the 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.420
 possibility to open the mouse will open the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.780
 lead like this as if it were the 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:57.190
 acoustic piano cover 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.190
 if we play with the top closed 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.230
 to the exact size of what 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.170
 it happens by opening the top of the grand piano 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.159
 I also have all the openings on the floor 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.130
 from the opening the half opening 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:20.650
 the complete opening and the absence of the top 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.900
 in the concerts it is often used to remove 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.310
 the cover 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.130
 this feature is associated with the ai 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.240
 mechanics noises for example in the 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:37.449
 southern stein pedal with dampers 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:43.270
 that rise rather than noise 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:46.479
 of the hammers rather than we say the 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.610
 scaling of the dampers as 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:53.880
 on the acoustic level therefore here 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.669
 the damper and here there is no longer the small 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.210
 sector then free sound like 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:03.900
 on the acoustic instrument and perhaps the 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:08.520
 feature that makes it more alive 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.570
 instrument the resonance of the strings e 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.940
 like the resonance of the harmonic case 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:17.170
 of the piano and what makes it live 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.600
 tool we are usually used to 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.240
 digital pianos to have these 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.980
 features 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.650
 cut because it is really a limit of the 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.820
 sampling here being all these 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.660
 features 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.730
 with the physical model or the exact size 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.400
 of what happens in the instrument 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.920
 acoustic and now I'm going to explain how 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.460
 in the piano 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.910
 when I have sympathetic vibrations 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:49.120
 of the strings according to how sound and i 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.780
 which keys or crushed in that 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.810
 moment 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:06:01.390
 for example if we press with the 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:04.450
 velocity to 0 these notes I hear 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.510
 harmonics of those notes if the notes 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:14.500
 pressed instead they are higher as in 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:18.190
 this case and I hear which notes ea 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:22.440
 second if I press two or more I will have more 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.440
 sound for example if I press 5 notes 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:38.990
 or so the and celio and in the I feel in the 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.960
 the exact stereo panorama of those notes 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:47.960
 this causes the sound to not have 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:51.890
 only a sampling with all the 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:55.310
 other connected sounds attached here 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.920
 sound is only one and this still makes 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.440
 the instrument is more alive and succeeds in 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.370
 break down what was the limit of 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.370
 digital piano
