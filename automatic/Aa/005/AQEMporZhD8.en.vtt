oh<00:00:18.300> they're<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.740> CBF<00:00:20.130> -<00:00:20.310> well<00:00:20.430> algorithms

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
oh they're so the CBF - well algorithms

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.550 
oh they're so the CBF - well algorithms
are<00:00:21.560> algorithms<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.950> insert<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.330> last<00:00:24.689> f2l

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
are algorithms that insert this last f2l

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.519 
are algorithms that insert this last f2l
pair<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.270> orient<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.509> cross<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.110> last

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
pair and orient the cross on the last

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.780 
pair and orient the cross on the last
layer<00:00:28.740> at<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:29.189> same<00:00:29.400> time<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.320> there<00:00:31.320> are

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
layer at the same time and there are

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.299 
layer at the same time and there are
several<00:00:32.790> hundred<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> these<00:00:33.600> algorithms<00:00:34.309> but

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
several hundred of these algorithms but

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.720 
several hundred of these algorithms but
that<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> lot<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.660> memorize<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.280> kind

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that is a lot to memorize and it's kind

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.009 
that is a lot to memorize and it's kind
of<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.879> practical<00:00:39.180> because<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.420> doesn't<00:00:39.750> speed

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
of a practical because it doesn't speed

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.500 
of a practical because it doesn't speed
up<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.260> time<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.890> much<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> I'm<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.449> to

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
up your time that much so I'm going to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.270 
up your time that much so I'm going to
teach<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.660> eight<00:00:43.019> of<00:00:43.350> them<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:44.360> work<00:00:45.360> after

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
teach you eight of them that work after

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.450 
teach you eight of them that work after
we<00:00:47.280> have<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:48.120> last<00:00:48.570> edge<00:00:48.870> pair<00:00:49.460> already

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
we have the last edge pair already

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.490 
we have the last edge pair already
paired<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.120> shown

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.439 

okay<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.589> this<00:00:55.769> is<00:00:55.920> what<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.640> case<00:00:57.150> looks

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
okay so this is what this case looks

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.759 
okay so this is what this case looks
like<00:00:59.000> the<00:01:00.000> color<00:01:00.360> that<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.659> started<00:01:01.080> from<00:01:01.350> in

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
like the color that you started from in

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.609 
like the color that you started from in
my<00:01:01.920> case<00:01:01.979> it's<00:01:02.309> white<00:01:02.780> it's<00:01:03.780> facing<00:01:04.260> toward

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
my case it's white it's facing toward

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.830 
my case it's white it's facing toward
the<00:01:04.860> right<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.799> we<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.510> shaped<00:01:09.510> thing

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the right and we have this shaped thing

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.140 
the right and we have this shaped thing
where<00:01:10.320> three<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.770> them<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:11.400> oriented<00:01:11.939> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
where three of them are oriented and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.130 
where three of them are oriented and
it's<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.200> top<00:01:13.470> thirty<00:01:13.950> right<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
it's the top thirty right there and the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.469 
it's the top thirty right there and the
algorithm<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.880> very<00:01:18.060> simple

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
algorithm for this one is very simple

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.569 
algorithm for this one is very simple
you<00:01:18.860> prime<00:01:19.860> F<00:01:20.490> prime<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.570> F<00:01:22.429> and<00:01:23.429> that

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
you prime F prime you F and that

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.700 
you prime F prime you F and that
Orient's<00:01:24.179> the<00:01:24.570> cross<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.380> happens<00:01:25.679> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
Orient's the cross it just happens to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.300 
Orient's the cross it just happens to
one<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> corners<00:01:26.429> too<00:01:26.579> but<00:01:26.789> usually<00:01:27.149> won't

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.639 

the<00:01:32.310> second<00:01:32.640> case<00:01:33.229> we<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:35.689> the<00:01:36.689> pair<00:01:36.929> facing

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
the second case we have the pair facing

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.459 
the second case we have the pair facing
the<00:01:37.740> same<00:01:37.920> way<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.579> other<00:01:38.789> and<00:01:39.469> but

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
the same way as the other and but

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.359 
the same way as the other and but
instead<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.799> l-shaped<00:01:43.799> thing<00:01:44.159> in

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
instead we have this l-shaped thing in

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.270 
instead we have this l-shaped thing in
the<00:01:44.609> top<00:01:44.820> left-hand<00:01:45.270> corner<00:01:45.859> the<00:01:46.859> algorithm

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the top left-hand corner the algorithm

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:58.140 
the top left-hand corner the algorithm
for<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.759> f<00:01:49.159> R<00:01:50.159> prime<00:01:50.520> F<00:01:51.420> prime<00:01:51.749> R

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.540 

the<00:01:59.150> next<00:01:59.360> one<00:01:59.540> we<00:01:59.960> have<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.410> f2l<00:02:00.860> pair<00:02:00.890> facing

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
the next one we have the f2l pair facing

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.940 
the next one we have the f2l pair facing
the<00:02:01.640> same<00:02:01.790> way<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.270> then<00:02:02.750> we<00:02:02.870> have<00:02:03.050> these<00:02:03.380> two

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
the same way and then we have these two

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.700 
the same way and then we have these two
blocks<00:02:04.940> here<00:02:05.120> and<00:02:05.450> they're<00:02:05.960> pointing<00:02:06.380> towards

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
blocks here and they're pointing towards

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.820 
blocks here and they're pointing towards
the<00:02:06.890> right<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.940> algorithm<00:02:08.330> for<00:02:08.510> that<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:08.899> you

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
the right the algorithm for that is you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.150 
to f prime u prime u L F the next case
is<00:02:20.450> very<00:02:20.750> similar<00:02:21.190> we<00:02:22.190> have<00:02:22.300> these<00:02:23.300> two<00:02:24.290> blocks

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
is very similar we have these two blocks

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.090 
is very similar we have these two blocks
and<00:02:25.580> they're<00:02:25.790> facing<00:02:26.110> forwards<00:02:27.110> or<00:02:27.380> up<00:02:27.740> one

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
and they're facing forwards or up one

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.520 
and they're facing forwards or up one
however<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.460> want<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.730> look<00:02:29.000> at<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.530> then

however you want to look at it and then

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.890 
however you want to look at it and then
