that<00:01:38.509> very<00:01:38.750> clear<00:01:38.869> at<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.470> start<00:01:39.740> of<00:01:39.799> this

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
that very clear at the start of this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.429 
that very clear at the start of this
campaign<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.880> fact<00:01:41.299> that<00:01:41.420> these<00:01:41.840> three<00:01:42.110> games

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
campaign the fact that these three games

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.499 
campaign the fact that these three games
I<00:01:42.649> think<00:01:42.829> each<00:01:42.979> one's<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.369> mill<00:01:43.759> milestone<00:01:44.270> and
