stuff<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.170> is<00:03:50.320> eight<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:51.190> is<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.489> 301<00:03:52.150> it's<00:03:53.049> a<00:03:53.110> 301

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
stuff it is eight it is a 301 it's a 301

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.940 
stuff it is eight it is a 301 it's a 301
tips<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.150> eight<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.989> privilege<00:03:56.680> to

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
tips and it is eight it's a privilege to

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.940 
tips and it is eight it's a privilege to
the<00:03:57.190> size<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.790> tip<00:03:58.000> 3<00:03:58.330> but<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.320> is<00:03:59.500> if<00:03:59.799> you

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
the size of a tip 3 but it is if you

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.440 
the size of a tip 3 but it is if you
look<00:04:00.070> at<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.220> end<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.760> is<00:04:00.820> pinched<00:04:01.299> together

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
look at the end it is pinched together

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.199 
look at the end it is pinched together
so<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.410> pinched<00:04:02.739> end<00:04:02.980> will<00:04:03.430> make<00:04:03.610> it<00:04:03.790> for<00:04:04.030> the

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
so the pinched end will make it for the

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.479 
so the pinched end will make it for the
tip<00:04:04.930> when<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.230> goes<00:04:05.440> out<00:04:05.650> instead<00:04:05.980> of<00:04:06.040> having<00:04:06.310> a

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
tip when it goes out instead of having a

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.300 
tip when it goes out instead of having a
nice<00:04:06.700> round<00:04:07.209> bead<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.989> icing<00:04:08.410> like<00:04:08.980> you<00:04:09.130> would

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310
