as fast as I'm gonna pedal and as Devin
walks<00:01:27.750> around<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.320> side<00:01:28.560> again<00:01:28.890> you'll

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
walks around the back side again you'll

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.870

see how the paddle wheel the wheel
itself<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.540> moving<00:01:34.079> from<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.530> minimal<00:01:34.979> input

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
itself is moving from just minimal input

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.990 
itself is moving from just minimal input
from<00:01:36.150> me<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:37.650> know<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.829> far<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.009> being<00:01:38.790> green

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
from me you know as far as being green

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.160 
from me you know as far as being green
goes<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.390> doesn't<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> whole<00:01:39.780> lot<00:01:39.900> more

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
goes it doesn't get a whole lot more

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.980 
goes it doesn't get a whole lot more
green<00:01:40.350> than<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:41.610> actually<00:01:42.540> quite<00:01:42.750> easy

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
green than this it's actually quite easy
