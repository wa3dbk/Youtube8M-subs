00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
probably perhaps the most fun that we've

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.049 
probably perhaps the most fun that we've
had<00:00:14.859> because<00:00:15.129> nobody<00:00:15.430> was<00:00:15.549> expecting

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
had because nobody was expecting

most<00:01:02.859> games<00:01:03.100> were<00:01:03.249> done<00:01:03.459> with<00:01:03.639> sprites<00:01:04.059> and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
most games were done with sprites and

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.090 
most games were done with sprites and
looked<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:04.930> little<00:01:05.049> bit<00:01:05.199> more<00:01:05.320> cartoony<00:01:05.920> this

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
looked a little bit more cartoony this

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.500 
looked a little bit more cartoony this
was<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.340> first<00:01:06.549> time<00:01:06.700> that<00:01:06.760> you<00:01:07.330> know<00:01:07.450> you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
was the first time that you know you

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.910 
was the first time that you know you
would<00:01:07.750> see<00:01:07.990> images<00:01:08.380> on<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.620> screen<00:01:08.740> that

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
would see images on the screen that

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.890 
would see images on the screen that
looked<00:01:09.220> like<00:01:09.310> real<00:01:09.730> people<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.360> that<00:01:10.540> I<00:01:10.570> think

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
looked like real people and that I think

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.690 
looked like real people and that I think
attracted<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.440> lot<00:01:11.620> of<00:01:11.650> people<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.370> on<00:01:12.520> that

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
attracted a lot of people to it on that

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.190 
attracted a lot of people to it on that
first<00:01:12.880> one<00:01:13.060> we're<00:01:13.240> also<00:01:13.420> working<00:01:13.720> with<00:01:13.930> the

first one we're also working with the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.390 
first one we're also working with the
old<00:01:15.720> pinball<00:01:16.720> and<00:01:17.170> video<00:01:17.290> game<00:01:17.680> audio

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.890 
old pinball and video game audio
hardware<00:01:18.640> which<00:01:19.090> was<00:01:19.210> basically<00:01:19.390> an<00:01:19.720> eight

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
hardware which was basically an eight

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.280 
hardware which was basically an eight
voice<00:01:20.220> FM<00:01:21.220> chip<00:01:21.580> and<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:22.000> drum<00:01:22.270> track<00:01:22.300> so<00:01:22.870> very

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
voice FM chip and a drum track so very

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.740 
voice FM chip and a drum track so very
limited<00:01:23.890> resources<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:25.210> great<00:01:25.450> challenge

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
limited resources and a great challenge

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.210 
limited resources and a great challenge
to<00:01:26.080> see<00:01:26.230> you<00:01:26.320> know<00:01:26.410> what<00:01:26.560> can<00:01:26.680> I<00:01:26.740> get<00:01:26.980> out<00:01:27.100> of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
to see you know what can I get out of

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.660 
to see you know what can I get out of
this<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.550> going<00:01:27.730> to<00:01:27.790> be<00:01:28.510> effective<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.670> sort

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
this is going to be effective and sort

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.310 
this is going to be effective and sort
of<00:01:30.730> give<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.880> pulse<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.690> action<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
of give the pulse to the action the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.750 
of give the pulse to the action the
first<00:01:32.530> character<00:01:32.710> we<00:01:33.070> had<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.280> think<00:01:33.430> was

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
first character we had I think was

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.550 
first character we had I think was
Johnny<00:01:34.030> Cage<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:34.660> it<00:01:34.990> was<00:01:35.080> like<00:01:35.200> we<00:01:35.350> really

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
Johnny Cage and it was like we really

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.040 
Johnny Cage and it was like we really
wanted<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:36.010> have<00:01:36.130> him<00:01:36.370> be<00:01:37.000> big<00:01:37.330> on<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.720> screen

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
wanted to have him be big on the screen

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.530 
wanted to have him be big on the screen
so<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.350> was<00:01:38.650> like<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:39.670> demo<00:01:40.060> you<00:01:40.420> know

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
so that was like the demo you know

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.750 
so that was like the demo you know
Johnny<00:01:40.870> Cage<00:01:41.200> versus<00:01:41.620> johnny<00:01:41.830> cage<00:01:42.100> there

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
Johnny Cage versus johnny cage there

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.650 
Johnny Cage versus johnny cage there
used<00:01:42.940> to<00:01:43.000> be<00:01:43.090> an<00:01:43.630> area<00:01:44.080> downstairs<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:46.600> the

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
used to be an area downstairs in the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.080 
used to be an area downstairs in the
division<00:01:47.260> between<00:01:47.470> video<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:48.400> convolving

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
division between video and convolving

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.820 
division between video and convolving
right<00:01:49.450> there<00:01:49.780> there<00:01:50.050> was<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.230> bunch<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:50.650> games

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
right there there was a bunch of games

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.680 
right there there was a bunch of games
and<00:01:51.130> we<00:01:51.220> would<00:01:51.370> put<00:01:51.550> him<00:01:51.670> on<00:01:51.820> test<00:01:52.120> there<00:01:52.450> and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
and we would put him on test there and

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.810 
and we would put him on test there and
the<00:01:53.110> game<00:01:53.260> was<00:01:53.409> getting<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.800> lot<00:01:53.980> of<00:01:54.040> play<00:01:54.490> and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
the game was getting a lot of play and
