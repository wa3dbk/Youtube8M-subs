00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.540
 Y 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.540
 Y 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:35.199
 and well I'll talk about this class 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.120
 I'm going to talk about the index technique 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:41.120
 and thumb 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.039
 There is an exercise with this technique 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.730
 I'm telling you that in flamenco 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.730
 is very 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:57.909
 usual is not about touching 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:01.899
 a cord and then a 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:04.820
 small delay with a small 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.070
 forgive the tuning 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:13.400
 I already said it before the light of these 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:16.330
 the exercise is much less good 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.330
 we take for example 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.520
 and of course the hand 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.909
 instead of being extended with new 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.270
 techniques 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:44.619
 since the thumb is looking a lot more 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:47.590
 to the box and the index is always the 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.450
 index is always below the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.850
 rope that wants to attack vale and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.570
 It's a technique that, as I say, is used 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.929
 a lot and that we should practice it 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.649
 that on a chromatic scale and this is 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.030
 the position 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.030
 I do not have to help 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.460
 the movement of d 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.510
 hand in hand 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.510
 on the wrist 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.490
 so that it's much more residual 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.829
 i 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.010
 and well I say the technique is 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:54.489
 press 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:56.530
 a refrain look the continuation but 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.329
 help yourself with a slight movement of 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.329
 doll then this 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.670
 there is a wrist movement for the 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.450
 mutation be strong be clear and be 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.319
 quick voucher 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.319
 how much 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.700
 Y 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.470
 but I will not say much more about this 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.370
 technique they looked for exercises on 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.989
 chromatic scale on 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.930
 any other scale and practice of 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:49.140
 the measure that I have told you and we will see 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:52.819
 later as we apply it this 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.480
 class is short but we leave it there 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.480
 until now
