I definitely feel more confident I think
going<00:01:34.950> into<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.700> Olympics<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> World

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
going into this Olympics and the World

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.120 
going into this Olympics and the World
Cup<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.960> think<00:01:37.140> we're<00:01:37.290> way<00:01:37.470> sharper

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.620 
Cup I think we're way sharper
I<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.909> we're<00:01:39.030> peaking<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.420> right

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I think we're peaking at the right

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.749 
I think we're peaking at the right
moments<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.470> 18<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.070> us<00:01:41.220> are<00:01:41.369> really<00:01:41.640> doing

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
moments all 18 of us are really doing

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.690 
moments all 18 of us are really doing
well<00:01:42.470> anybody<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.649> step<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.220> make<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
well anybody can step up and make the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.950 
well anybody can step up and make the
difference<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.600> key<00:01:45.810> it's

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
difference and I think that's key it's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.990 
difference and I think that's key it's
gonna<00:01:46.049> take<00:01:46.290> all<00:01:46.439> 18<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.770> us<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.250> done<00:01:47.460> as

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
to get their thoughts on the scrimmage

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.719

and<00:02:06.899> heading<00:02:07.259> north<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.890> Glasgow

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
and heading north to Glasgow

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:20.100

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
I think it's always good to get a game

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.740 
I think it's always good to get a game
once<00:02:20.500> we're<00:02:20.739> here<00:02:20.980> acclimated<00:02:21.849> before<00:02:22.629> we

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
once we're here acclimated before we

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.539 
once we're here acclimated before we
actually<00:02:22.900> go<00:02:23.170> into<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.560> tournament<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.220> know

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
actually go into the tournament so know

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.949 
actually go into the tournament so know
always<00:02:24.670> always<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.090> tough<00:02:25.360> opponent<00:02:25.480> they

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
always always a tough opponent they

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.930 
always always a tough opponent they
always<00:02:26.230> play<00:02:26.440> us<00:02:26.560> hard<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.459> think<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.790> was<00:02:27.849> a
