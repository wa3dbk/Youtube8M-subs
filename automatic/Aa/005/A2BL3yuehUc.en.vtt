hey<00:00:01.589> guys<00:00:01.800> so<00:00:02.580> I<00:00:02.610> thought<00:00:03.090> I'd<00:00:03.210> do<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.330> quick

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hey guys so I thought I'd do a quick

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.320 
hey guys so I thought I'd do a quick
review<00:00:04.790> of<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.330> new<00:00:06.660> passport<00:00:07.379> max<00:00:08.330> versus

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
review of the new passport max versus

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.450 
review of the new passport max versus
the<00:00:09.660> older<00:00:10.550> passport<00:00:11.550> redline<00:00:12.650> I<00:00:13.650> looked<00:00:14.340> a

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
the older passport redline I looked a

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.960 
the older passport redline I looked a
lot<00:00:14.610> into<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.690> max<00:00:15.929> before<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.500> bought<00:00:16.710> it

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
lot into the max before I bought it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.970 
lot into the max before I bought it
because<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.119> didn't<00:00:18.690> want<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.859> know<00:00:19.920> I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
because I didn't want to you know I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.560 
because I didn't want to you know I
didn't<00:00:20.220> want<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.400> sacrifice<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.180> any<00:00:21.300> kind<00:00:21.539> of

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
didn't want to sacrifice on any kind of

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.050 
didn't want to sacrifice on any kind of
sensitivity<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.949> max<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
sensitivity going to the max just to

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.259 
sensitivity going to the max just to
have<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> GPS<00:00:24.689> lockout<00:00:25.410> capability<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.970> I've

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
have the GPS lockout capability so I've

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.370 
have the GPS lockout capability so I've
been<00:00:27.390> running<00:00:27.510> both<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.019> them<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.349> my

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
been running both of them on my

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.769 
been running both of them on my
windshield<00:00:28.769> now<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.369> probably<00:00:30.359> four<00:00:30.599> or<00:00:30.630> five

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
windshield now for probably four or five

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.180 
windshield now for probably four or five
days<00:00:32.930> having<00:00:33.930> prompt<00:00:34.260> job<00:00:34.410> about<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> same

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
days having prompt job about it the same

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.119 
days having prompt job about it the same
leather<00:00:35.460> bull<00:00:35.760> about<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.270> same<00:00:36.680> I<00:00:37.680> tried

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
leather bull about it the same I tried

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.540 
leather bull about it the same I tried
the<00:00:38.219> same<00:00:38.370> angle<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:40.559> I've<00:00:41.129> switched<00:00:41.340> him

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the same angle and I've switched him

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.930 
the same angle and I've switched him
around<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.879> lot<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.510> try<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:43.730> to<00:00:44.730> try<00:00:44.879> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
around a lot to to try to get to try to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.680 
around a lot to to try to get to try to
get<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> variety<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:46.170> performance<00:00:47.039> tests<00:00:47.280> going

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
get a variety of performance tests going

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.779 
get a variety of performance tests going
and<00:00:48.690> basically<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.710> found<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.250> far<00:00:50.520> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and basically what I found so far is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.040 
and basically what I found so far is
that<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> max<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:53.219> picking<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.940> ka<00:00:54.239> bands

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
that the max is picking up ka bands

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.750 
that the max is picking up ka bands
maybe<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.129> second<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.920> max<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.309> 3<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.670> 4

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
maybe a second to max like 3 or 4

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.700 
maybe a second to max like 3 or 4
seconds<00:01:00.359> earlier<00:01:01.520> then<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.699> red<00:01:02.879> line<00:01:03.710> which

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
seconds earlier then the red line which

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.280 
seconds earlier then the red line which
obviously<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.610> nice<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.299> mean<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.659> ka<00:01:06.869> bands

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
obviously is nice I mean with ka bands

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.820 
obviously is nice I mean with ka bands
that<00:01:07.680> extra<00:01:08.040> second<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.700> 4<00:01:08.909> seconds<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:10.080> lot

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
that extra second to 4 seconds is a lot

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.789 
that extra second to 4 seconds is a lot
of<00:01:10.920> times<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.310> difference<00:01:11.670> between

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
of times the difference between

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.209 
of times the difference between
can<00:01:13.039> he<00:01:13.159> ticket<00:01:14.810> what<00:01:15.350> alarmed<00:01:15.710> me<00:01:15.799> at<00:01:15.950> first

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
can he ticket what alarmed me at first

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:17.859 
can he ticket what alarmed me at first
though<00:01:16.490> is<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.969> red<00:01:17.179> line<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.689> actually

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
though is that the red line is actually

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.520 
though is that the red line is actually
picking<00:01:18.289> up<00:01:18.590> X<00:01:19.460> bands<00:01:20.299> k<00:01:20.509> bands<00:01:20.899> and<00:01:21.439> other

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
picking up X bands k bands and other

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.770 
picking up X bands k bands and other
other<00:01:22.490> types<00:01:22.789> of<00:01:22.939> bands<00:01:23.149> that<00:01:23.299> generally

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
other types of bands that generally

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.929 
other types of bands that generally
aren't<00:01:23.929> generally<00:01:24.439> aren't<00:01:24.740> used<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.369> my<00:01:25.520> area

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
aren't generally aren't used in my area

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.199 
aren't generally aren't used in my area
and<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:29.920> initially<00:01:30.920> what<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.939> that<00:01:32.090> was

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
and so initially what and that was

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.809 
and so initially what and that was
before<00:01:32.360> any<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.840> them<00:01:33.020> were<00:01:33.170> locked<00:01:33.469> out<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.579> on

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
before any of them were locked out so on

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.330 
before any of them were locked out so on
you<00:01:35.030> know<00:01:35.119> I'm<00:01:35.209> talking<00:01:35.360> about<00:01:36.340> convenience

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
you know I'm talking about convenience

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.380 
you know I'm talking about convenience
stores<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.119> stuff<00:01:38.270> like<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:40.390> metal

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
stores and stuff like that metal

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.359 
stores and stuff like that metal
detectors<00:01:42.939> so<00:01:43.939> I<00:01:44.450> guess<00:01:45.380> what<00:01:45.709> that<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:45.950> guess

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
detectors so I guess what that I guess

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.679 
detectors so I guess what that I guess
that's<00:01:46.610> probably<00:01:46.819> due<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.390> new

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
that's probably due to the new

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.300 
that's probably due to the new
technology<00:01:48.439> or<00:01:48.530> whatever<00:01:48.709> that's<00:01:49.009> in<00:01:49.189> this

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
technology or whatever that's in this

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.359 
technology or whatever that's in this
thing<00:01:49.610> that<00:01:50.590> supposedly<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.069> know<00:01:52.159> the

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
thing that supposedly is you know the

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.479 
thing that supposedly is you know the
smart<00:01:52.789> filter<00:01:53.270> where<00:01:53.899> it<00:01:54.079> only<00:01:54.890> alarms<00:01:55.340> you

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:55.489 
smart filter where it only alarms you

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:56.830 
smart filter where it only alarms you
about<00:01:55.729> things<00:01:55.970> that<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.299> thinks<00:01:56.689> are

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
about things that it thinks are

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.199 
about things that it thinks are
important<00:01:57.349> at<00:01:58.039> least<00:01:58.099> that's<00:01:58.399> what<00:01:58.759> I

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
important at least that's what I

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.210 
important at least that's what I
understand<00:01:59.750> that's<00:01:59.869> what<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:00.140> does<00:02:00.349> so<00:02:01.189> I

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
understand that's what it does so I

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.949 
understand that's what it does so I
guess<00:02:01.459> it<00:02:01.640> works<00:02:01.819> because<00:02:02.390> I'm<00:02:02.630> not<00:02:02.750> really

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
guess it works because I'm not really

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.419 
guess it works because I'm not really
getting<00:02:03.200> hit<00:02:03.829> with<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.640> K<00:02:04.880> bands<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.390> X<00:02:05.539> bands

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
getting hit with the K bands and X bands

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.490 
getting hit with the K bands and X bands
right<00:02:07.429> away<00:02:07.729> usually<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:08.750> about<00:02:08.899> three<00:02:09.349> or

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
right away usually it's about three or

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.420 
right away usually it's about three or
four<00:02:09.709> seconds<00:02:10.099> after<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.549> redline<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:12.430> of

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
four seconds after the redline and of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.009 
four seconds after the redline and of
course<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.819> lot<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.060> them<00:02:14.180> are<00:02:14.299> locked<00:02:14.510> out<00:02:14.780> now

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
course a lot of them are locked out now

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.160 
course a lot of them are locked out now
anyways<00:02:15.379> in<00:02:15.590> my<00:02:15.680> area<00:02:16.060> but<00:02:17.060> as<00:02:17.480> for<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.930> KA

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170

bands

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
bands

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.949 
bands
and<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:21.130> haven't<00:02:22.090> gotten<00:02:22.240> any<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.569> got<00:02:22.690> haven't

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
and I haven't gotten any I got haven't

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.800 
and I haven't gotten any I got haven't
gotten<00:02:23.080> hit<00:02:23.290> with<00:02:23.380> any<00:02:23.500> lasers<00:02:23.980> yet<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.750> I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
gotten hit with any lasers yet so I

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.400 
gotten hit with any lasers yet so I
can't<00:02:26.020> say<00:02:26.140> anything<00:02:26.170> about<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.770> but<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.490> mean

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
can't say anything about that but I mean

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.050 
can't say anything about that but I mean
lasers<00:02:29.410> are<00:02:29.560> losers<00:02:30.400> anyway<00:02:30.610> this<00:02:30.819> doesn't

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
lasers are losers anyway this doesn't

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.949 
lasers are losers anyway this doesn't
really<00:02:31.150> matter<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.380> as<00:02:32.590> for<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.890> KA<00:02:33.310> bans<00:02:33.819> I<00:02:34.390> do

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
really matter so as for the KA bans I do

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.199 
really matter so as for the KA bans I do
confirm<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.010> at<00:02:36.160> least<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.760> tests<00:02:37.090> I

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
confirm that at least in the tests I

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.740 
confirm that at least in the tests I
have<00:02:37.390> run<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:39.010> passport<00:02:39.610> max<00:02:40.090> does

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
have run the passport max does

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.040 
have run the passport max does
outperform<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.590> passport<00:02:42.100> redline<00:02:42.870> I'd<00:02:43.870> say

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
outperform the passport redline I'd say

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.160 
outperform the passport redline I'd say
about<00:02:44.170> 80%<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.220> time

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
about 80% of the time

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.309 
about 80% of the time
the<00:02:47.560> passport<00:02:48.459> max<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:49.000> picking<00:02:49.540> up<00:02:49.690> ka<00:02:49.900> bands

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
the passport max is picking up ka bands

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.390 
the passport max is picking up ka bands
faster<00:02:51.180> from<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.630> a<00:02:52.750> 1<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.230> 4<00:02:53.590> seconds<00:02:54.010> faster

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.020 
faster from in a 1 to 4 seconds faster
than<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.640> redline<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.830> few<00:02:57.130> cases<00:02:57.370> I

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
than the redline and in a few cases I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.360 
than the redline and in a few cases I
think<00:02:58.209> maybe<00:02:58.600> 4<00:02:58.989> or<00:02:59.019> 5<00:02:59.140> times<00:02:59.260> now<00:02:59.860> in<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.160> past

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
think maybe 4 or 5 times now in the past

think maybe 4 or 5 times now in the past
4<00:03:00.670> or<00:03:00.700> 5<00:03:00.910> days

4 or 5 days
the<00:03:03.730> max<00:03:04.090> has<00:03:04.390> picked<00:03:04.660> up<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.019> KA<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:07.209> the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
the max has picked up a KA that the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.080 
the max has picked up a KA that the
redline<00:03:07.690> can<00:03:07.959> even<00:03:08.140> pick<00:03:08.319> up<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.819> would<00:03:09.940> pick

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
redline can even pick up and would pick

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.610 
redline can even pick up and would pick
it<00:03:10.209> up<00:03:10.330> but<00:03:10.480> it<00:03:10.630> would<00:03:10.690> only<00:03:10.870> be<00:03:11.050> like<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:11.530> know

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
it up but it would only be like you know

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.500 
it up but it would only be like you know
1<00:03:11.890> bar<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.310> sensitivity<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.239> it<00:03:13.330> would<00:03:13.420> only

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
1 bar of sensitivity and it would only

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.020 
1 bar of sensitivity and it would only
be<00:03:13.840> there<00:03:14.019> for<00:03:14.230> about<00:03:14.319> 5<00:03:15.190> seconds<00:03:15.670> and<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:15.850> it

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
be there for about 5 seconds and then it

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.580 
be there for about 5 seconds and then it
would<00:03:16.120> go<00:03:16.269> away

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
would go away

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.570 
would go away
but<00:03:17.850> yeah<00:03:19.260> my<00:03:20.260> final<00:03:20.650> decision<00:03:20.800> is<00:03:21.310> probably

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
but yeah my final decision is probably

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.810 
but yeah my final decision is probably
going<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:21.760> be<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:21.970> keep<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.300> passport<00:03:22.720> max

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
going to be to keep the passport max

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.430 
going to be to keep the passport max
because<00:03:24.820> I<00:03:24.910> really<00:03:25.150> don't<00:03:25.269> care<00:03:25.480> about<00:03:25.750> X<00:03:26.110> fans

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
because I really don't care about X fans

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.310 
because I really don't care about X fans
and<00:03:26.620> King<00:03:26.799> bans<00:03:27.690> yep<00:03:28.720> so<00:03:28.989> there<00:03:29.110> you<00:03:29.230> go

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
and King bans yep so there you go

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.840 
and King bans yep so there you go
there's<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.709> quick<00:03:29.890> little<00:03:30.160> review<00:03:30.220> for<00:03:30.640> any<00:03:30.760> of

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
there's a quick little review for any of

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.460 
there's a quick little review for any of
you<00:03:31.000> wondering<00:03:31.450> if<00:03:31.810> there's<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.079> big

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
you wondering if there's a big

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.020 
you wondering if there's a big
difference<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:32.950> sensitivity<00:03:33.640> between<00:03:33.790> the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
difference in sensitivity between the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.209 
difference in sensitivity between the
two
