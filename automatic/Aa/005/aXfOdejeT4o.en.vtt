I'll go over them all right now the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.610 
I'll go over them all right now the
first<00:00:38.219> one<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.460> Berlin<00:00:39.090> Wall<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.320> says

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
first one is Berlin Wall and it says

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.190 
first one is Berlin Wall and it says
that<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.010> set<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.309> Berlin<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.660> Germany

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that it's set in Berlin and the Germany

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
that it's set in Berlin and the Germany
at<00:00:43.410> Checkpoint<00:00:44.160> Charlie<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
at Checkpoint Charlie one of the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.299 
at Checkpoint Charlie one of the
best-known<00:00:45.719> crossing<00:00:46.410> points<00:00:46.710> between<00:00:46.860> East

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309

best-known crossing points between East
and<00:00:47.430> West<00:00:47.520> Berlin<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> first<00:00:48.840> map

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and West Berlin so that's the first map

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.959 
and West Berlin so that's the first map
for<00:00:49.379> multiplayer<00:00:49.800> then<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> next<00:00:50.730> one's

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
for multiplayer then the next one's

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.540 
for multiplayer then the next one's
discovery<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.770> takes<00:00:53.010> place<00:00:53.309> in

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
discovery and this one takes place in

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.060 
discovery and this one takes place in
the<00:00:53.579> Antarctic<00:00:54.360> German<00:00:54.780> Research<00:00:55.230> Station<00:00:55.890> so

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the Antarctic German Research Station so

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.310 
the Antarctic German Research Station so
that's<00:00:56.190> probably<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.270> more<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
that's probably going to be a more of a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.529 
that's probably going to be a more of a
snowy<00:00:58.620> type<00:00:58.949> map<00:00:59.219> maybe<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> Arctic<00:01:00.000> type<00:01:00.270> map

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
snowy type map maybe the Arctic type map

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.180 
snowy type map maybe the Arctic type map
and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.320> there's<00:01:01.469> another<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.949> called

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and then there's another one called

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.149 
and then there's another one called
Kowloon<00:01:03.030> which<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.690> set<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.170> Kowloon<00:01:04.830> city

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
Kowloon which is set in Kowloon city

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.969 
Kowloon which is set in Kowloon city
Hong<00:01:05.670> Kong<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.350> one's<00:01:07.560> going<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> be<00:01:07.890> in

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
Hong Kong so this one's going to be in

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
Hong Kong so this one's going to be in
Hong<00:01:08.310> Kong<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.439> it's<00:01:10.439> supposed<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.920> be<00:01:11.070> near

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
Hong Kong and it's supposed to be near

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.510 
Hong Kong and it's supposed to be near
rooftop<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.360> across<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> rooftops<00:01:13.520> then

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
rooftop so it's across the rooftops then

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.850 
rooftop so it's across the rooftops then
the<00:01:14.640> last<00:01:15.150> multiplayer<00:01:15.720> map<00:01:16.229> will<00:01:16.439> be<00:01:16.560> called

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the last multiplayer map will be called

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.149 
the last multiplayer map will be called
Stadium<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> hockey<00:01:18.720> stadium

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
Stadium and this is a hockey stadium

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.560 
Stadium and this is a hockey stadium
inside<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> northeastern<00:01:21.030> part<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
inside the northeastern part of the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
inside the northeastern part of the
United<00:01:21.659> States<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.159> one's<00:01:23.340> probably

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
United States so this one's probably

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.249
