00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:15.009
 as we all know in windows 7 8 and 8.1 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:17.199
 accessing the desktop icons was 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.480
 fast we would click right and on 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.390
 customize and quickly we had them 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.430
 very handy though on windows 10 the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.119
 customize menu has undergone a change 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.119
 important 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.890
 ah 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.810
 but in the same way we can put the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.560
 icons on the desktop and also in the 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.560
 start menu 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.290
 in windows 10 we can enter the same 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.360
 form by right clicking and on 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.140
 customize or from the menu 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.140
 configuration 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.590
 we enter where he says themes 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.810
 desktop icon settings 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.160
 now we select the icons that are 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.160
 will show on the desk 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.119
 once we have them on your desktop the 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.200
 we will put in the start menu to 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.539
 leave the desk clean 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.500
 in each icon we click right and 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.500
 anchor at the beginning 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.610
 once in the start menu we put them 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.270
 where we like the most 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.270
 Y 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.310
 Y 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.720
 i 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.170
 in the same way we can put the accesses 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.630
 direct from the programs that most 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.630
 we use it just by dragging them to the menu 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.130
 to remove icons from the desktop 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.640
 we simply repeat the steps and the 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.640
 we unmarked 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.540
 good friends this was all for this 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.540
 video says goodbye to his friend martin thomas
