00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello friends welcome to this 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.589
 a very, very important video 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.760
 important videos really important 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.000
 again and I would be very happy 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.320
 listen carefully to us and you too the video 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.059
 completely look 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.949
 march not as long as we make must 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.180
 just make it important 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.769
 friends back then took us until we 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.170
 have a server to start 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.529
 there are people who do something over and over again 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.570
 for me this time it was the umg or the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.570
 omg the community around amer 3 and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.910
 other games and they have us 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.649
 highest our server so right 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.219
 fat mercy and this is correct 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.340
 from normal and really cool action not 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.739
 only team not only speak everything 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.910
 coughed but also teamspeak so we 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.949
 in the future the possibility of each other 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.640
 to talk and the whole thing will be like us 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.120
 said on the spot provided 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.920
 What's important is not just this 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.110
 Factor that matters is there are so many 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.460
 Factors that are important and current 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.710
 they would let the citizens participate 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.750
 to say that words too long for each word 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.670
 do it with you in this video 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.869
 description leave a link the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.119
 leads to a google-blog moment where 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.580
 be contained on the left that is the whole 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.150
 Scolds instruction of a 15 server 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.619
 the quasi the possibility that short 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.119
 to read through as you have yourself 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.430
 what is the password of the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.600
 dice lotz teamspeak server teamspeak 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.880
 to download and more links and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.810
 all the left to the murder that is whole 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.970
 important and fix and the way to omg 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.259
 that guys from server 5 and 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.780
 reinhards in the round for example 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.439
 once 3 regularly gamble on one 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.810
 own server 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.299
 and what is very important and all of me 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.950
 important point is here but unfortunately 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.040
 God's current problem 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.530
 the computer is please no idea of 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.240
 Feels comfortable, at least the cpu feels 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.700
 not well that means okay what can 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.079
 the cdu can do about it on course 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.149
 at the earliest problem is the motherboard 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.090
 fitting that means you have to now 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.540
 invest at least 450 500 euros 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.400
 upgrade for only the computer what 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.000
 unfortunately god now my problem is with 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.730
 calculator 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.989
 Unfortunately, I always share it 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.910
 have combined the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.860
 perhaps not so wise 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.420
 to combine defense technology that is 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.910
 it is not coordinated and 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.560
 The markets are currently extremely streaming 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.250
 noticed that unfortunately God's streaming 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.250
 extremely and that is a pity 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.560
 many know and know that you are 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.330
 to provide the best possible gaming experience 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.280
 It would be my job and record 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.500
 job it is my vocation almost always 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.720
 A hobby The goal of the beta is going on 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.720
 best possible there are now 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.200
 Six people actively involved me 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.860

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:03.480

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.610

 It must have come together 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.900
 abnormal so i do not know what you mean 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.569
 I never expect myself to find it 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.310
 only others do why they are easy 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.840
 only the mobs you net me the coal 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.750
 hashtag and beautiful in the book holidays 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.470
 I made 100 percent of you 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:06.120
 the benefit again now so first 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.660
 that we really have free streaming 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.099
 can 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:14.130
 and in the future we should donate 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.959
 definitely in winning games but the navi 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.120
 the win player like winning games yet 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.640
 otherwise you do not have to donate 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.770
 but donations will not come with me 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.510
 somewhere a private bank definitely 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.980
 Not 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:33.260
 and I am me so abnormal men 40 20 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.120
 what you motto for what so for 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.530
 each donation do what going on 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.870
 Surprise chance in the stream over 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.820
 does it support me so abnormal in 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.160
 This time was as nice as that again 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.740
 make up for it so we will endeavor friends 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.750
 will definitely try 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.460
 which is definitely the one for so long 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.690
 computers behead new ones 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.980
 Simply network cornet record and 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.720
 at the same time that's where it's streaming 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.210
 she in the future streamer will read 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.060
 always on youtube to see it works 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.280
 not so with cpu totally packs that 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.960
 Unfortunately does not work 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.330
 and, unfortunately, so must it be like weeks 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.910
 is you really like me now? 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.840
 what we definitely have was this we 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.190
 would be almost straps 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.410
 So now teamspeak is really on 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.480
 begin 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:24.250
 hop was behaving very important to say 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:28.520
 no matter where you are on the server or chat 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.170
 behaving in teamspeak as well as being like 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.720
 she already does that to others 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.720
 also behave so normal 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.720
 fair and therefore the circumstances 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.910
 Accordingly, I am sure I am 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.770
 one of the otherwise hard times 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.440
 because I just can not do it 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.940
 but I still believe that we do 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.300
 all have no problem with each other 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.700
 become 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.470
 currently there are twelve slots again 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.750
 will be distributed in the stream always 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.550
 Again, it stays that way 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.230
 anyway, this is where most people are watching 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.630
 there are friends that's no joke too 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.060
 every youtube but i am definitely 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.340
 one of them proves again and again 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.860
 that her important is important that hope 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.690
 but very much and is required for 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.640
 this sentence to six minutes Euros 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.720
 precious time now steal worry 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.210
 thank you for watching 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.980
 Please read this manual carefully 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.930
 the very important thing is really there 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.340
 austrian what you need is something missing 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.100
 or where and for what suggestions 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.600
 Something is written about complaints 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.640
 Please in the comments I thank you 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.980

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.890
 for me and I hope to see you soon 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.880
 again on the server see the stream or 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.980
 but only 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.850
