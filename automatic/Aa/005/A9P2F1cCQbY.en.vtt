00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
there it makes it illuminate so the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:29.450 
there it makes it illuminate so the
focus<00:03:19.870> had<00:03:20.230> some<00:03:20.470> focus

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.740 

just<00:03:30.060> get<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.300> pan<00:03:31.730> around<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.880> finger<00:03:35.600> this<00:03:36.600> is

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
just get a pan around the finger this is

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.170 
just get a pan around the finger this is
very<00:03:36.990> cool<00:03:37.230> right<00:03:37.470> here<00:03:37.790> although<00:03:38.790> if<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.000> will

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
very cool right here although if I will

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.770 
very cool right here although if I will
show<00:03:39.390> this<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.720> there's<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.200> little<00:03:41.780> computer

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
show this but there's a little computer

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.220 
show this but there's a little computer
display<00:03:43.170> holographic<00:03:43.920> display<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.490> there

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
display holographic display in there

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.610 
display holographic display in there
there<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.260> stuff<00:03:47.070> etched<00:03:47.520> into<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.620> little

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
there is stuff etched into it a little

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.770 
there is stuff etched into it a little
the<00:03:50.430> alien<00:03:50.880> writings<00:03:51.360> or<00:03:51.510> they<00:03:51.600> have

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
the alien writings or they have

the alien writings or they have
throughout<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.170> game<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:53.690> because<00:03:55.100> the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
throughout the game and because the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.190 
throughout the game and because the
lighting<00:03:56.370> fig<00:03:56.670> feature<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.570> this<00:03:57.720> helmet<00:03:57.960> it

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
lighting fig feature in this helmet it

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.880 
lighting fig feature in this helmet it
kind<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.560> eliminates<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.370> in<00:03:59.550> there<00:04:00.740> if<00:04:01.740> you

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
kind of eliminates it in there if you

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.470 
kind of eliminates it in there if you
like<00:04:02.010> angle<00:04:02.460> it<00:04:02.580> up<00:04:02.760> then<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.120> light<00:04:03.330> from

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
like angle it up then the light from

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.240 
like angle it up then the light from
underneath<00:04:03.840> goes<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:04.500> there<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:04.770> illuminates

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
underneath goes in there and illuminates

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.830 
underneath goes in there and illuminates
the<00:04:05.340> screen<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:05.940> this<00:04:06.060> looks<00:04:06.330> pretty<00:04:06.840> cool

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
the screen and this looks pretty cool

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.570 
the screen and this looks pretty cool
it's<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.930> nice<00:04:10.140> detail<00:04:10.680> even<00:04:11.130> though<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.340> can't

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
it's a nice detail even though I can't

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.920 
it's a nice detail even though I can't
really<00:04:11.670> see<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:11.910> don't<00:04:12.060> know<00:04:12.150> how<00:04:12.330> he's<00:04:12.540> able<00:04:12.720> to

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
really see I don't know how he's able to

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.200 
really see I don't know how he's able to
see<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.230> with<00:04:13.380> his<00:04:13.530> helmet<00:04:13.770> in<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.190> way<00:04:14.310> well
