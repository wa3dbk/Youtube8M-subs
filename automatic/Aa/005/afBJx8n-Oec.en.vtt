00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.600
 I am as they are z and well they are 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.610
 welcome to a very quick reply 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.650
 of cedrÃ³n account is added items but 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.469
 after version 16 ok obviously these 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.940
 programs in crafting 0.9 point 5 this 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.010
 you come in scale very well with the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.300
 launcher by 1.7 point 8 that is here 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.849
 down in the description and if you still 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.050
 you do not have it and well let's do the 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.759
 rhythm and fast you know they have to 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.769
 download is a carnal application of yourself 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.849
 installed as any application which 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.589
 they have to be active and they 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.029
 I always remember these three options 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.290
 once we have them active 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.840
 then we will be able to appear 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.220
 the souvenir in not be the cne and look 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.850
 that is not the only thing that was added 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.770
 two things 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.540
 this menu located above that is how 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.100
 the computer as I started that what 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.170
 The only thing it does is divide into sections 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.460
 the different items if we leave you here 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.200
 in the first one that is a book because they are 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.820
 we do not all know them four pages 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.739
 If we here in the chest they 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.780
 suppose it should appear with frequent 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.340
 things more is burdened this part but 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.720
 it does not affect much anymore, not because here 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.250
 you have them in the first part then 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.989
 for this nothing simply to decorate 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.370
 a little more a section of the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.840
 blocks well obviously obviously here they are 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.130
 if we go to the nine appointments then they are going to 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.600
 be the flowers we go to the one of the 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.160
 girl that are tools there are going to 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.690
 be we go to the apple that is 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.000
 food there is going to be or 500 good already 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.890
 divided into sections this more like 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.570
 to pc and that is the other thing that you think that 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.400
 I think that 's the interesting thing we're going to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.170
 go here the three little dots already know and you 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.740
 we will give in the internet in settings 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.770
 is going to put the button 88 slots or 8 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.119
 compartments 8 of that 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.590
 what I mean obviously are the 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.270
 slots that we have with inventory 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.410
 Main liberty will see before 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.580
 activate it obviously to activate it 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.920
 possibly in a touch for 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.060
 deactivate it equal then well these 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.580
 they are the normal ones that we have 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.340
 are one two three four five or six 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.909
 ok channels then we put that 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.270
 option will be eight and the 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.000
 eight this thing as if it hinders and does not 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.640
 It will depend a lot on how you use it 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.720
 but it really does not get in the way too much 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.220
 that you give a touch a little more to 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.320
 here is still you back and everything 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 perfect or good you already know that if you do not 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.890
 they were upset they got a little bit 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.049
 complicated this because they just go 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.479
 to options and in the part of this the 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.790
 control it looks like there's the button on the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.489
 option not being the iPad 6 or of 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.019
 Do a little more by giving more 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.030
 tie this one of the buttons and so good 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.370
 so that it does not bother you so much anymore 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.440
 it will depend a lot on you I say to me 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.910
 it does not bother me and then it will depend on 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.260
 everyone likes everyone's tastes very 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.390
 respectable then well those are the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.580
 only things that you add in version 16 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.500
 the souvenir is very very good the truth 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.770
 the update seems perfect to me 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.750
 he is not following 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.490
 without giving continuity to the mold that 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.290
 it's very has a lot of potential 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.270
 so if you are interested in checking some 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.800
 last toribio are you because obviously 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.660
 maybe you do not understand it because it's in 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.330
 English or I know here below I leave you the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.220
 first version we're going to something like that 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.210
 where I made complete noise everything already in 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.220
 the next versions that go 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.620
 taking only tasks to review what 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.850
 again obviously then later they go to 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.290
 meats you know here below is the link 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.120
 download from the forum the only thing that 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.710
 It has to be a touch and you're going to 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.390
 give a touch where he says chau no longer 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.640
 I put a red route out there and good 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.580
 you already know that the true creator is the my 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.290

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.270
 a blue hairline so no because no 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.710
 confuse not that maybe we confuse 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.900
 of creator because he had them in different 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.190
 footprints then nothing channel no 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.600
