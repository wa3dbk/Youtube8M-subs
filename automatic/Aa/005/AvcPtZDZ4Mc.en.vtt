 the masterpiece of media molecule had the courage to show the beauty of 

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:32.410
 craftsmanship is the poetry of the independent production system 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.260
 all based on the exaltation of creativity and an artistic sector 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.399

 big planet penny 2 fear plot aspects of a single player mode 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.010
 the story that the cocks tell us about trony negatives is a being

 encounter the use of the story a little stereotyped significant levels la 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.260
 struggle of good against evil and also that of creativity against

 approval 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.299
 even without looking for hidden meanings 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.020
 the charming little big planet 2 plot is one of those that can do it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.810
 wait for a genuine dose of irony for an unexpected defeated mobility 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.530
 as a result of the first chapter, the sequence of expenses for the levels 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.259
 it composes micro-stories that embrace and alternate with the main one 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.009
 while surreal protagonists alternately taken the scene showing us the 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.130
 their personality and superattico 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.370
 in short, progress is pleasant 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.650
 and it does not exclude but the sense of discovery the continuous marvel of finding them 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.650
 of the artists 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.420
 idem 3d lite big planet and is not that of a classic medium title platformer 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.370
 molecule lacks the impeccable precision of don t kong country returns 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.150
 but also a true and proper one is missing for the cult of the millimeter leap 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.639
 basic difficulties 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.049
 the progress never colored thanks to the environmental interaction in the presence 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.399
 cumbersome of a realistic physics and in fact forces the user to measure himself 

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:29.059
 with the calculated reactions of the game world 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.359
 in short, the system of movement a little awkward and once again 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.040
 one of the distinctive traits of advancement 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.479
 pace of those who did not like the first time 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:42.299
 but to assure even the most skeptical we also say that this time he does not lack 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.359
 certainly the variety 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.260
 littel big planet 2 the usual ability to completely transform itself into steven 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.860
 spielberg 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.390
 and this continuous development of the development team's creativity 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.109
 the true added value compared to the first chapter is on balance 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.659
 and it is true that even when things start to get serious about the pitfalls 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.449
 mortals increase with respawn system identical to that of the first chapter 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.779
 simplify things even in the sphere 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:10.430
 but not for this littel big planet 2 is a simplistic title there are always 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:14.189
 the special bubbles to recover the prizes related to obtaining the medal 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:14.760
 now 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.060
 and the secret sections to be dealt with in 2 or 4 players who push to recruit 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.020
 some friends to earn distinct materials of the objects to be exploited 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.729
 the editor 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:29.199
 the presence of the desktop allows the more creative to indulge in the 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:32.919
 production of its own beautiful pushes production now 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.019
 facilitated by some particularly useful measures 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.860
 that allow to blend together various elements with great simplicity of 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.830
 modify structures according to plan and insert circuit boards that in fact 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.169
 automatically manage the behavior of structure objects 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:51.809
 nevertheless it is useless to turn around the core of the question la 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:55.979
 creating a level is a slow and tortuous operation and the best results 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.149
 they are obtained by expertly exploring all the system options 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.759
 confronting the creations of other users. and losing long 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.759
 afternoons with careful and meticulous construction 

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:10.680
 in describing a product as littel big planet 2 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.560
 it is impossible to clearly separate the artistic component from the technical one 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.639
 a perfectly aseptic eye pleases the room easy to denounce more 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:19.729
 of a lightness 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.830
 after all the graphics engine didn't shine too much at the time of the first episode e 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.939
 now, despite having been updated and finished, it certainly does not show the nails 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.080
 as regards polygonal complexity and management of the sources of 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.039
 special effects light 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:37.289
 the quality of the features instead is always excellent for number and detail and 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.550
 it is precisely the unicode character that actually composes a scene 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.800
 once again unique is recognizable 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.289
 the medium ndidi molecule roots are clearly seen this terrestrial obsession 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.180
 the fantasy visits this continuous swings the chromatic batter matches 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.979
 hysterics is a son of me who was stylistic that only one can be born 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.979
 environment really free from the main street constraints 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.800
 speech not different with regard to the sound sector perhaps the 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.030
 selection of songs perturbing than that of the first episode 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.229
 but it still seems wildly upbeat 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.409
 now caricatured, now dedicated to unbridled quotationism, it is intertwined with directing in 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:16.680
 course of the cocks to characterize it with sagacious mastery 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:22.259
 the Italian dubbing gentle renewal deep that perfectly adequate 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:23.949
 guitars

 his 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:32.539
 media molecule repeats littel big planet 2 is the natural evolution of 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:36.379
 first chapter and from the point of view of the contents it certainly appears more 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:37.779
 complete richer 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:42.189
 the pediatrician for then passed fish turn with simplicity sometimes 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.960
 disarmingly 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.780
 exploring different genres and solutions, however, to enhance once again a stroke 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.370
 an eye on the unpredictable sequence of levels that the surprise continues
