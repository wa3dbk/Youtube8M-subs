00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
oxygen and what's happening down to the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.250 
oxygen and what's happening down to the
Chesapeake<00:01:35.610> Bay<00:01:36.800> is<00:01:37.800> that<00:01:38.810> because<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.140> all

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
Chesapeake Bay is that because of all

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.870 
Chesapeake Bay is that because of all
the<00:01:40.380> pollution<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.010> runoffs<00:01:41.460> from<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
the pollution in the runoffs from the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.310 
the pollution in the runoffs from the
Pennsylvania<00:01:42.090> farms<00:01:42.960> cars<00:01:43.620> homes<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:45.320> oxygen

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
Pennsylvania farms cars homes the oxygen

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.250 
Pennsylvania farms cars homes the oxygen
supply<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:46.920> running<00:01:47.370> low<00:01:47.870> I'm<00:01:48.870> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.080> put

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
supply is running low I'm going to put

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.660 
supply is running low I'm going to put
