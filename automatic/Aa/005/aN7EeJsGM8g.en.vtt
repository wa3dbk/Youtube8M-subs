00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.050
 The phenomenon of "flotillas" began to appear in Mexico 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.650
 starting from the 1991 eclipse. 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.210
 He grew up and soon became the cradle 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.990
 of this phenomenon, that is tens, hundreds and thousands 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.210
 of spheres that create formations in the sky. 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.200
 However, this has also been recorded in other countries: recently 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.090
 in Italy, in Milan, Antonio Urzi 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.030
 in the center he took these exceptional images 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.830
 which I will show you now. 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.370
 A few days later, again in September, 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.260
 Arturo Robles Gil has filmed one of these "flotillas" 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.360
 at great height above Mexico City 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.010
 but filmed very well, they are very good images. 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.100
 You will see it! The phenomenon of "flotillas" continues! 0: 00: 55.100,0: 00: 54.720 Yohanan Díaz talks about it. 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.300
 As part of the study on unidentified flying objects, 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.000
 there is a theme, that of the "flotillas" of UFO, to which 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.380
 in 2009 it was not possible to give a satisfactory answer. 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.080
 However in Milan and on Mexico City, DF 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.560
 this type of phenomenon is appearing. 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.730
 Stay with us in the following service. 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.720
 Along the history of the UFO phenomenon there is a topic that has captured 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.840
 the attention of researchers and scholars of this phenomenon: 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.800
 we refer to the UFO "flotillas", which we define as the whole 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.570
 of apparently metallic spheres that fly over the cities and that 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.480
 they move together in the sky sometimes at great speed 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.660
 or on the contrary remain still to start moving 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.640
 after a few minutes, as happened on 4 September 2009 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.860
 above via Alessandro Manzini [sic!] in Milan, Italy. 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.520
 On that occasion the "accalappiaufo" Antonio Urzi, considered 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.530
 one of the most important in the world for quantity and quality 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.730
 films taken in various parts of the world, 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.760
 he had the fate of immortalizing such a manifestation. 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.420
 Urzi declared to the portal "From heaven to earth" 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.060
 to have bought his first video camera in 2003, 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.120
 and since then he has managed to capture mysterious objects of all kinds 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.048
 that flew over the place where he lives, and that the objects filmed 

00:02:18.048 --> 00:02:19.780
 in early September they were no exception. 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.780
 That day, finding himself in Milan, he noticed their presence in the sky 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.030
 and began filming them by pointing up at his video camera. 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.560
 Even a troupe of TG3 Lombardia that was on the street 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.700
 they saw Urzi and began to film them too. 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.000
 All this happened around 18.00. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.050
 Watch the movie yourself. 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.360
 You can see the buildings of the city, Urzi can't keep still 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.630
 the frame at first, and when he succeeds he films some 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.450
 white objects above the headquarters of the Banca Commerciale Italiana. 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.960
 These are white spheres that at some point seem to reflect 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.370
 the sunlight. We must remember that it is evening 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.980
 in that part of the world, and also 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.620
 you can hear the background noise of the city. 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.180
 These objects move very slowly, zooming 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.900
 no thread or logo can be seen on the objects 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.920
 that may make you think they are balloons. 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.270
 But we note that they have an unpredictable behavior. 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.520
 Some stay together for several minutes, but we realize that it is 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.460
 several dozens of spheres flying over the center of Milan 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.320
 creating different formations in the sky. 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.710
 As reference points we see the electrical cables and the cornices of buildings. 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:49.120
 And at minute 4:56 of the movie, Antonio films the RAI television crew 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.080
 who in turn film the objects with their professional camera. 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.000
 In all, the video lasts 6 minutes and 8 seconds, but the objects 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.260
 they remained in the same position for much longer. 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.890
 But Italy is not the only place where in recent weeks 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.200
 flotillas of UFOs have been seen: also in Mexico City 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.690
 and the "accalappiaufo" that filmed them is Arturo Robles Gil 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.830
 in the Colonia del Valle. Last September 29th 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.580
 at a quarter past ten in the morning, Gil was scanning the sky 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.680
 when he first noticed an object at great height, it seemed 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.750
 taller than the clouds and had an unusual luster. 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.320
 Robles Gil took the video camera and tried to locate it in the viewfinder 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.810
 moving it systematically, and when he managed to frame it 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.540
 he began to film it and realized that it was a "flotilla" of spheres 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.060
 the majority of which were hidden in the clouds. 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.440
 The gray tone of the image is due to the intense cloudiness of that day. 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.350
 As a reference we have the antenna shaft with its cable. 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.500
 Robles succeeded in filming only 5 white spheres noting their intelligent movement; 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.600
 at certain moments they seem to reflect the light of the sun. 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.180
 Later in the video, you see it as one of them 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.080
 hides behind a cloud. 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.580
 With sightings in Milan and Mexico City 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.050
 we realize that it would seem to be the same objects: 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.660
 same shape, same color, same movements. 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.550
 With the sighting of the "flotillas" in Milan and here over the capital 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.380
 we realize that the phenomenon is constantly evolving and that 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.020
 in 2009 we cannot give a satisfactory explanation. 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.000
 My name is Yohanan Díaz Vargas, you are seeing "Tercer Milenio". 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
