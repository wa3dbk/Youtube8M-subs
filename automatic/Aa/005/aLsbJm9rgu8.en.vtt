you reduce congestion by just 10% you

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.980 
you reduce congestion by just 10% you
cause<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> growth<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.979> GDP<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.759> city<00:01:30.210> by

cause a growth of the GDP of the city by

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.289 
cause a growth of the GDP of the city by
two<00:01:31.439> percent<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.790> city<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.119> Los

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
two percent so in a city like Los

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.240 
two percent so in a city like Los
Angeles<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.960> two<00:01:34.200> percent<00:01:34.530> growth<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> GDP

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
Angeles a two percent growth in the GDP

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.240 
Angeles a two percent growth in the GDP
would<00:01:35.970> translate<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.740> twenty<00:01:37.740> two<00:01:37.890> billion

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
would translate to twenty two billion

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.310 
would translate to twenty two billion

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
dollars of additional revenue in that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.219

smart parking implemented around the
world

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
world

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.040 
world
it's<00:03:04.650> estimated<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.370> we<00:03:05.970> could<00:03:06.150> save<00:03:06.420> 1

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
it's estimated that we could save 1

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.210 
it's estimated that we could save 1
million<00:03:08.010> barrels<00:03:08.490> of<00:03:08.910> oil<00:03:09.180> per<00:03:09.540> day<00:03:10.320> the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
million barrels of oil per day the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.820 
million barrels of oil per day the
reality<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.810> car<00:03:13.380> emits

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
reality of this is that a car emits

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.510 
reality of this is that a car emits
about<00:03:14.100> 10<00:03:14.489> percent<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.300> its<00:03:15.690> total<00:03:15.870> co2<00:03:16.520> while

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
about 10 percent of its total co2 while

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.390 
about 10 percent of its total co2 while
parking<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.209> if<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.959> reduce<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.890> parking

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
parking so if we can reduce the parking

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400 
parking so if we can reduce the parking
time<00:03:20.670> we<00:03:21.300> can<00:03:21.480> reduce<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:22.020> carbon<00:03:22.230> emissions

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
time we can reduce the carbon emissions

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.620 
time we can reduce the carbon emissions
by<00:03:22.920> simply<00:03:23.310> shutting<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.970> engine<00:03:24.510> off

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
by simply shutting the engine off

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.160 
by simply shutting the engine off
quicker<00:03:25.050> so<00:03:25.590> smart<00:03:26.310> parking<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:27.170> certainly

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
quicker so smart parking is certainly

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.220 
quicker so smart parking is certainly
something<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.190> impacts<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.970> economy<00:03:30.360> of<00:03:31.110> a

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
something that impacts the economy of a

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.979 
something that impacts the economy of a
city<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.430> ecology<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.180> city<00:03:33.390> but<00:03:33.870> it

also<00:03:34.140> impacts<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:35.130> merchant<00:03:35.730> who<00:03:36.090> says<00:03:36.300> I

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
also impacts that merchant who says I

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.240 
also impacts that merchant who says I
want<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:36.959> more<00:03:37.170> accessible<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.980> my
