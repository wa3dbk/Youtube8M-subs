00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849

setup<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.270> rivet<00:00:30.510> individual<00:00:31.170> pieces<00:00:31.410> they

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
setup and rivet individual pieces they

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.520 
setup and rivet individual pieces they
basically<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.239> convert<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.720> into<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.199> player

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530

model file so it's basically like

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.760 
model file so it's basically like

does break the whole Skyrim but it's

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.340 
does break the whole Skyrim but it's
always<00:02:51.430> honestly<00:02:52.090> just<00:02:52.270> for<00:02:52.420> fun<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.810> think<00:02:53.290> it

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
always honestly just for fun I think it

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.580 
always honestly just for fun I think it
looks<00:02:53.470> really<00:02:53.770> cool<00:02:54.960> this<00:02:55.960> comes<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.410> a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
looks really cool this comes with a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.950 
looks really cool this comes with a
visor<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:58.560> one<00:02:59.560> with<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.710> eye<00:02:59.830> patch<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:01.810> you

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
visor and one with the eye patch as you

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:12.030 
visor and one with the eye patch as you
can<00:03:02.080> see<00:03:02.200> here<00:03:10.080> now<00:03:11.080> there<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.380> one<00:03:11.650> more<00:03:11.680> in

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
can see here now there is one more in

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.440 
can see here now there is one more in
this<00:03:12.190> pack<00:03:12.400> but<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.670> think<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.030> one's<00:03:13.240> based

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
this pack but I think this one's based

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.570 
this pack but I think this one's based
on<00:03:13.570> what<00:03:13.690> race<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.020> are<00:03:14.260> because<00:03:15.220> every<00:03:15.430> time

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
on what race you are because every time

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.850 
on what race you are because every time
I<00:03:15.610> try<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:15.880> equip<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.450> disappears<00:03:16.990> so

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
I try to equip that it disappears so

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.890 
I try to equip that it disappears so
just<00:03:18.160> be<00:03:18.280> aware<00:03:18.490> of<00:03:18.550> that<00:03:18.640> in<00:03:19.150> order<00:03:19.780> to

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
just be aware of that in order to

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.180 
just be aware of that in order to
acquire<00:03:20.110> this<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.560> need<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.770> go<00:03:20.860> into<00:03:21.010> the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
acquire this you need to go into the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.090 
acquire this you need to go into the
console<00:03:21.580> command<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.060> type<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.330> help<00:03:23.100> ridin

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
console command and type in help ridin

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.780 
console command and type in help ridin
and<00:03:25.590> I'll<00:03:26.590> move<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.040> camera<00:03:27.340> so<00:03:27.460> you<00:03:27.490> can<00:03:27.580> see

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
and I'll move the camera so you can see

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.720 
and I'll move the camera so you can see
a<00:03:27.820> little<00:03:28.000> better

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
a little better

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.060 
a little better
so<00:03:30.730> as<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.030> see<00:03:31.150> get<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:31.420> bottom<00:03:31.750> left<00:03:32.070> there

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
so as you see get the bottom left there

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.060 
so as you see get the bottom left there
are<00:03:33.280> three<00:03:33.610> categories<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:34.330> which<00:03:34.360> you<00:03:34.630> can

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
are three categories to which you can

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.160 
are three categories to which you can
use<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.340> content<00:03:37.210> the<00:03:37.480> Content<00:03:37.780> ID<00:03:37.870> but<00:03:38.140> the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
use the content the Content ID but the

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.670 
use the content the Content ID but the
the<00:03:39.160> IDS<00:03:39.520> of<00:03:39.550> these<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:41.170> get<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.380> armor

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
the IDS of these and get the armor

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.080 
the IDS of these and get the armor
pieces<00:03:41.890> or<00:03:42.280> another<00:03:42.580> arm<00:03:42.700> piece<00:03:42.850> with<00:03:43.030> the

pretty much scared me the first time I

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.270 
pretty much scared me the first time I
did<00:04:28.790> this<00:04:29.080> so<00:04:30.080> that's<00:04:30.500> something<00:04:30.860> to<00:04:30.980> be<00:04:31.160> aware

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
did this so that's something to be aware

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.500 
did this so that's something to be aware
of<00:04:31.430> if<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:31.700> love<00:04:31.850> playing<00:04:32.120> in<00:04:32.210> first-person

see<00:04:37.820> does<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.930> same<00:04:39.140> thing<00:04:39.850> so<00:04:40.850> just<00:04:41.030> be<00:04:41.150> aware

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
see does the same thing so just be aware

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.400 
see does the same thing so just be aware
of<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.600> if<00:04:41.720> you<00:04:41.780> ever<00:04:41.900> go<00:04:42.050> in<00:04:42.140> the<00:04:42.170> first

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
of that if you ever go in the first

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.380 
of that if you ever go in the first
person

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
person

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.870 
person
this<00:04:44.390> player<00:04:44.690> muscle<00:04:45.050> also<00:04:45.230> comes<00:04:45.560> with<00:04:45.620> this

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
this player muscle also comes with this

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.430 
this player muscle also comes with this
signature<00:04:46.880> katana<00:04:47.270> which<00:04:47.690> is<00:04:47.900> pretty

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
signature katana which is pretty

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.060 
signature katana which is pretty
powerful<00:04:48.800> for<00:04:49.280> a<00:04:49.340> katana<00:04:49.640> so<00:04:50.480> if<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:51.230> probably

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
powerful for a katana so if I probably

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.290 
powerful for a katana so if I probably
should<00:04:52.250> equip<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.670> crossbow<00:04:54.910> so<00:04:55.910> if<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.180> do

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
should equip the crossbow so if you do

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.890 
should equip the crossbow so if you do
plan<00:04:56.510> on<00:04:56.570> using<00:04:56.870> this<00:04:57.140> I<00:04:58.510> highly<00:04:59.510> recommend

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
plan on using this I highly recommend

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.990 
plan on using this I highly recommend
you<00:04:59.990> up<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.230> difficulty<00:05:01.570> wrong<00:05:02.570> item<00:05:04.000> sum

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
you up the difficulty wrong item sum

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000 
you up the difficulty wrong item sum
because<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.420> sword<00:05:05.630> does<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.810> lot<00:05:06.110> of<00:05:06.170> damage

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
because the sword does a lot of damage

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.000 
because the sword does a lot of damage
I<00:05:08.590> think<00:05:09.590> it's<00:05:09.710> base<00:05:09.980> damage<00:05:10.370> is<00:05:10.490> 150<00:05:12.010> so

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
I think it's base damage is 150 so

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.390 
I think it's base damage is 150 so
that's<00:05:13.190> pretty<00:05:13.850> it's<00:05:14.450> pretty<00:05:14.480> damaging

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
that's pretty it's pretty damaging

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.290 
that's pretty it's pretty damaging
especially<00:05:16.400> on<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.580> lower<00:05:16.760> levels<00:05:17.150> you're

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
especially on the lower levels you're
