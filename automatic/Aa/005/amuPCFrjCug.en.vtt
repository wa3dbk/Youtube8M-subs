00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
which is just probably thinking almost 2

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
notice it when you pick it up not so

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.759 
notice it when you pick it up not so
much<00:02:52.730> in<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:52.940> pocket<00:02:53.390> it's<00:02:54.230> just<00:02:54.470> something

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
much in the pocket it's just something

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
you have to get used to and it's a fair

pop this phone out of my pocket I
started<00:04:34.580> taking<00:04:34.700> pictures<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.680> believe<00:04:36.680> in

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
started taking pictures I believe in

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.270 
started taking pictures I believe in
automatic<00:04:37.850> mode<00:04:37.990> these<00:04:38.990> are<00:04:39.320> 5<00:04:39.620> megapixel

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
automatic mode these are 5 megapixel

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.530 
automatic mode these are 5 megapixel
pictures<00:04:40.460> you're<00:04:40.790> looking<00:04:41.060> at<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:43.390> what<00:04:44.390> they

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
pictures you're looking at and what they

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.230 
pictures you're looking at and what they
are<00:04:44.690> there<00:04:44.960> would<00:04:45.650> refer<00:04:46.250> to<00:04:46.280> as<00:04:46.520> super<00:04:46.940> mega

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
are there would refer to as super mega

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.900 
are there would refer to as super mega
pixels<00:04:50.410> what<00:04:51.410> this<00:04:51.590> means<00:04:51.920> is<00:04:52.160> it<00:04:52.370> does<00:04:52.580> take

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
pixels what this means is it does take

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.180 
pixels what this means is it does take
the<00:04:53.150> full<00:04:54.100> 41<00:04:55.100> megapixel<00:04:55.900> camera<00:04:56.900> shot<00:04:57.890> and

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
the full 41 megapixel camera shot and

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.260 
the full 41 megapixel camera shot and
then<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.330> convinces<00:04:59.990> say<00:05:00.260> 5<00:05:00.560> megapixels<00:05:01.270> into

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
then it convinces say 5 megapixels into

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.140 
then it convinces say 5 megapixels into
one<00:05:02.540> super<00:05:02.900> mega<00:05:03.080> pixel<00:05:03.530> that<00:05:04.190> way<00:05:04.490> when<00:05:05.030> you

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
one super mega pixel that way when you

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.270 
one super mega pixel that way when you
zoom<00:05:05.390> in<00:05:05.660> it's<00:05:06.260> what<00:05:06.500> they<00:05:06.620> call<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:06.830> lossless

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
zoom in it's what they call a lossless

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.320 
zoom in it's what they call a lossless
zoom<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:09.500> quality<00:05:10.400> stays<00:05:10.700> the<00:05:11.000> same<00:05:11.210> and

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
zoom the quality stays the same and

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.460
