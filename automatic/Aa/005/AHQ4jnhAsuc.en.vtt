this is a nice change I think it dried
like<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.470> because<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.790> hair<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.030> getting

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
like this because my hair is getting

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.960 
like this because my hair is getting
really<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.990> long<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.520> longer<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
really really long and the longer it

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.320 
really really long and the longer it
gets<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.390> heavier<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.960> gets<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:17.240> kind<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
gets the heavier it gets and kind of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.929 
gets the heavier it gets and kind of
it's<00:01:19.020> heavy<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.710> dries<00:01:20.280> straight<00:01:20.610> I<00:01:20.640> guys

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
