00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.210
 hello and again with you i was given strong 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.369
 and transmit the perfect sound at home 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 conditions 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.630
 today we'll talk on the guitar in recording 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.289
 home rather about music 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.170
 cords more precisely which layer to choose to 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.120
 the sound was perfect you probably noticed 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.550
 what whatever expensive cable you don't 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.530
 bought the sound of your guitar 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.809
 when recording at home is still much worse 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.120
 than for example in the records 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.480
 metallica groups when played in cells 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.829
 actually tell you the secret in the world 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.570
 professional present 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.190
 professional music there is 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.410
 concept as sound effect sound from everywhere in 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.620
 the original sounds like sound iran and 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.299
 Today I will tell you how to achieve this. 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.939
 effect at home and so why 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.310
 we can't get these to sound 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.250
 from everywhere at home exist 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.799
 the two main reasons the first is the cord itself 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.320
 more precisely his jack will consider the design 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.780
 consists of two main parts this 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.380
 trunk and head divided between 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.560
 by myself 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.900
 black cross it just the same 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.180
 root of all troubles 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.979
 hour manufacturers on saving 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.280
 material of the cross itself and it is very 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.130
 badly 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.610
 the second combo himself what he is cool you 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.890
 wasn't you anyway has a directional 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.370
 this sound will never allow us 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.030
 achieve effect sound from everywhere you are 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.460
 ask 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.850
 Bogdan what then to do and I will say 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.160
 there is one way out of my record I always 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.590
 I use vacuum cleaner from my 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.620
 I tested the most new vacuum cleaner 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.860
 clear and warm sound has a firm vacuum cleaner 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.860
 electrolux 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.440
 actually how to use it 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.009
 the device is enough for us 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:16.360
 just easy to disconnect the noise from the vacuum cleaner 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:19.870
 and we have a great great plug and 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:27.860
 so test we take the usual 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:30.190
 records standard set listen 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.190
 it is better 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.010
 noticed a lot of noise extra sound and just 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.849
 bad sound 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.049
 Now let's look at the cord from the vacuum cleaner 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.290
 electrolux 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:55.870
 as we see the construction there is no trunk 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:03:05.349
 no heads to cross and so 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:10.810
 we reach the absolute my channel always 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:13.840
 perfect always perfect 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:19.169
 fits always perfect to 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:22.500
 your guitar and now the main secret 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:25.780
 stick this back side of the 2 cord 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.329
 me in the cube you real home 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.400
 electrical network 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.569
 this way all your walls will sound and 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.949
 we will achieve 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.949
 effect sound from everywhere listen 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.989
 bogdan was strong with you and the next 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.940
 the program, we will learn how to 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.090
 use the rest of the vacuum cleaner 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.950
 for recording flute the perfect sound in 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.950
 at home stay with us
