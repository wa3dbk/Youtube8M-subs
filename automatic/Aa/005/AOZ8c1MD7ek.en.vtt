stuff<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:15.990> right<00:00:16.199> now<00:00:16.320> um<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.720> sparkler

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
stuff we have right now um a sparkler

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.150 
stuff we have right now um a sparkler
probably<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.920> big<00:00:20.160> long<00:00:20.460> ones<00:00:20.730> um<00:00:21.800> some<00:00:22.800> wire

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
probably the big long ones um some wire

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.750 
probably the big long ones um some wire
cutters<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.560> tape<00:00:25.789> alright<00:00:27.619> so<00:00:28.619> first<00:00:29.429> off

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
cutters and tape alright so first off

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.380 
cutters and tape alright so first off
you<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.840> take<00:00:31.199> your<00:00:31.679> piece<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.130> paper<00:00:32.390> here

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you just take your piece of paper here

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.670 
you just take your piece of paper here
and<00:00:33.570> then<00:00:34.579> just<00:00:35.579> bend<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.329> wire<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:37.440> that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and then just bend the wire like that

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.160 
and then just bend the wire like that
and<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.579> try<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.180> scrape<00:00:39.600> off<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.940> like

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
and then try and scrape off all the like

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.490 
and then try and scrape off all the like
sparkler<00:00:43.170> stuff<00:00:43.770> off<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.370> okay

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.880 

so<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.739> could<00:00:50.010> take<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> while<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:51.289> hard<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.110 

but<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.160> got<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.460> remember<00:00:56.910> while

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
but you just got to remember while

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.740 
but you just got to remember while
you're<00:00:57.149> doing<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.559> leave<00:00:58.800> about<00:00:59.660> well<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you're doing this to leave about well it

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.410 
you're doing this to leave about well it
depends<00:01:01.230> because<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
depends because it it's all up to you of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.859 
depends because it it's all up to you of
how<00:01:03.600> much<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.760> runtime<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.750> it

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
how much you want of a runtime for it

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.880 
how much you want of a runtime for it
the<00:01:07.590> bigger<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.520> cut<00:01:08.760> off<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.869> longer<00:01:10.710> time

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the bigger you cut off the longer time

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.770 
the bigger you cut off the longer time
you'll<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.090> you're<00:01:12.299> gonna<00:01:12.420> want<00:01:12.720> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you'll have so you're gonna want to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.899 
you'll have so you're gonna want to
leave<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.290> no<00:01:13.890> inch<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> half<00:01:14.430> if<00:01:14.880> you

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
leave like no inch and a half if you

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.539 
leave like no inch and a half if you
want<00:01:15.030> that's<00:01:15.990> what<00:01:16.140> we're<00:01:16.320> gonna<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.740> inch<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
want that's what we're gonna do inch and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.330 
want that's what we're gonna do inch and
a<00:01:17.580> half<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.680> cut<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.770> off<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> wire

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
a half here and cut it off with the wire

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.450 
a half here and cut it off with the wire
cutters<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.350> that'll<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> wick

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
cutters so that that'll be like the wick

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.780 
cutters so that that'll be like the wick
unless<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.509> guys<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> wick<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.790> actually

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
unless you guys have a wick but actually

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.210 
unless you guys have a wick but actually
spark<00:01:27.630> using<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.229> part<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> sparklers

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
spark using the part of the sparklers

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.660 
spark using the part of the sparklers
way<00:01:29.520> easier<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.930> wick<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.710> recommend

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
way easier and a wick so I recommend

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.090 
way easier and a wick so I recommend
that<00:01:33.110> instead<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:35.630> quick<00:01:36.630> so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
that instead of quick so

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:56.910 
that instead of quick so
end<00:01:40.100> it<00:01:41.020> get<00:01:42.020> all<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.380> sparklers<00:01:43.040> stuff<00:01:43.340> off

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.010 

all<00:01:57.920> right<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.030> got<00:01:59.180> your<00:01:59.450> inch<00:01:59.780> and<00:01:59.990> a

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
all right so you got your inch and a

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.040 
all right so you got your inch and a
half<00:02:00.050> here<00:02:00.230> whatever<00:02:01.540> just<00:02:02.540> take<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.870> wire

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
half here whatever just take the wire

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.190 
half here whatever just take the wire

how big it depends if you're using the
bigger<00:02:47.060> small<00:02:47.510> sparklers<00:02:48.170> for<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.530> bigger

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
bigger small sparklers for this bigger

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.710 
bigger small sparklers for this bigger
ones<00:02:49.760> you'll<00:02:50.000> need<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.180> bigger<00:02:50.420> square

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
ones you'll need a bigger square

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.130 
ones you'll need a bigger square
obviously<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:52.160> just<00:02:52.730> like<00:02:53.000> put<00:02:53.540> your<00:02:53.690> thumb<00:02:53.990> in

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
obviously so just like put your thumb in

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.490 
obviously so just like put your thumb in
it<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.980> then<00:02:55.340> take<00:02:56.180> like<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.810> hole<00:02:57.170> like<00:02:57.470> that

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
it and then take like a hole like that

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.740 
it and then take like a hole like that
kind<00:02:58.070> of<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.730> put<00:02:58.880> it<00:02:58.970> like<00:02:59.120> this<00:02:59.300> so<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.570> got

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
kind of and put it like this so you got

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.050 
kind of and put it like this so you got
a<00:02:59.780> hole<00:03:00.020> underneath<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.860> then<00:03:04.220> just<00:03:04.850> push

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
a hole underneath and then just push

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.840 
a hole underneath and then just push
your<00:03:05.180> thumb<00:03:05.450> inside<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:05.990> hole<00:03:06.730> squeeze<00:03:07.730> it

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
your thumb inside of the hole squeeze it

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.740 
your thumb inside of the hole squeeze it
a<00:03:07.910> bit<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.209> then<00:03:08.270> you<00:03:08.570> have<00:03:08.750> like<00:03:09.040> pretty<00:03:10.040> much

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
a bit and then you have like pretty much

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.120 
a bit and then you have like pretty much
you<00:03:11.750> know<00:03:11.810> if<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.230> guys<00:03:12.350> can<00:03:12.560> see<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.890> there

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
you know if you guys can see that there

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.199 
you know if you guys can see that there
but<00:03:14.440> yeah<00:03:15.440> so<00:03:15.800> you<00:03:16.220> just<00:03:16.370> have<00:03:16.580> kind<00:03:16.850> of<00:03:16.970> like<00:03:17.180> a

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
but yeah so you just have kind of like a

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.290 
but yeah so you just have kind of like a
full<00:03:17.630> kind<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.680> put<00:03:18.860> all<00:03:19.010> this<00:03:19.250> stuff<00:03:19.370> in<00:03:19.700> so

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
full kind of to put all this stuff in so

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.910 
full kind of to put all this stuff in so
you<00:03:20.360> put<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.840> down<00:03:21.020> for<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> second<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.800> just

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
you put that down for a second and just

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.820 
you put that down for a second and just
make<00:03:22.250> sure<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.060> folded<00:03:23.660> make<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.650> lot

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
make sure this is folded make it a lot

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.060 
make sure this is folded make it a lot
easier<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:25.280> pour<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:26.110> then<00:03:28.150> like<00:03:29.739> drop<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:30.770> in

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
easier to pour and then like drop it in

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.700 
easier to pour and then like drop it in
there

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.710 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.710 

all<00:03:37.710> right<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.790> got<00:03:38.910> all<00:03:39.060> your<00:03:39.180> sparklers

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
all right so you got all your sparklers

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.650 
all right so you got all your sparklers
stuff<00:03:40.050> in<00:03:40.230> there<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.890> then<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:42.120> want<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.420> just

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
stuff in there and then you want to just

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.100 
stuff in there and then you want to just
make<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.440> like<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.610> circle<00:03:45.180> um<00:03:45.300> oh<00:03:45.450> well<00:03:45.930> not<00:03:46.050> a

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
make it like a circle um oh well not a

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.730 
make it like a circle um oh well not a
circle<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:47.040> like<00:03:47.160> fold<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.120> up<00:03:48.240> so<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.740> it's

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
circle just like fold it up so that it's

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.450 
circle just like fold it up so that it's
like<00:03:50.040> even<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.610> smaller<00:03:51.000> bolt<00:03:51.860> like<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:53.070> and

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
like even a smaller bolt like that and

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:01.400 
like even a smaller bolt like that and
then<00:03:53.850> take<00:03:54.540> some<00:03:54.600> tape<00:03:59.810> tape<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.930> up<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.320> don't

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
then take some tape tape it up you don't

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.770 
then take some tape tape it up you don't
want<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.680> use<00:04:01.770> too<00:04:01.800> much<00:04:02.190> tape<00:04:02.550> or<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:02.880> will<00:04:03.120> be

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
want to use too much tape or it will be

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.380 
want to use too much tape or it will be
a<00:04:04.250> good<00:04:05.250> enough<00:04:05.430> effect<00:04:05.880> on<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:07.850> yes<00:04:08.850> not

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
a good enough effect on that so yes not

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.170 
a good enough effect on that so yes not
too<00:04:09.660> much<00:04:09.840> tape<00:04:10.170> on<00:04:10.350> here<00:04:10.590> tape<00:04:11.550> it<00:04:11.700> up<00:04:11.820> so<00:04:12.030> that

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
too much tape on here tape it up so that

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.320 
too much tape on here tape it up so that
it<00:04:12.300> doesn't<00:04:12.330> move<00:04:12.930> like<00:04:13.320> doesn't<00:04:14.220> open<00:04:14.520> up<00:04:14.700> all

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
it doesn't move like doesn't open up all

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.180 
it doesn't move like doesn't open up all
right<00:04:15.450> so<00:04:15.930> now<00:04:16.080> you<00:04:16.109> just<00:04:16.500> put<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.830> wick<00:04:16.980> in

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
right so now you just put the wick in

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.789 
right so now you just put the wick in
make<00:04:17.580> sure<00:04:17.790> right<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:18.480> you<00:04:19.320> left<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.680> little

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
make sure right here you left a little

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.090 
make sure right here you left a little
bit<00:04:20.070> in<00:04:20.220> make<00:04:20.489> sure<00:04:20.519> that<00:04:21.410> goes<00:04:22.410> all<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.800> way

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
bit in make sure that goes all the way

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.640 
bit in make sure that goes all the way
to<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.370> bottom<00:04:23.550> so<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.330> have<00:04:24.540> like<00:04:24.840> it

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
to the bottom so that you have like it

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.680 
to the bottom so that you have like it
up-to-there<00:04:26.130> so<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.760> some<00:04:27.000> of<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.180> sparkler

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
up-to-there so that some of the sparkler

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.840 
up-to-there so that some of the sparkler
is<00:04:27.840> in<00:04:28.140> all<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.620> crushed<00:04:28.890> up<00:04:29.070> sparkly<00:04:29.610> stuff

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
is in all the crushed up sparkly stuff

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.790 
is in all the crushed up sparkly stuff
so<00:04:30.600> dig<00:04:31.170> it<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.380> there

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
so dig it in there

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.320 
so dig it in there
and<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.760> can<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:33.030> fold<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.540> out<00:04:33.690> like<00:04:34.080> that

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
and you can just fold it out like that

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.570 
and you can just fold it out like that
fold<00:04:36.330> so<00:04:36.720> that<00:04:36.900> got<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.590> sparkler<00:04:38.100> pointing

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
fold so that got the sparkler pointing

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:49.040 
fold so that got the sparkler pointing
up<00:04:38.730> it's<00:04:39.180> down<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:39.510> bit<00:04:46.610> yes<00:04:47.610> you<00:04:47.880> just<00:04:47.940> put<00:04:48.930> it

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
up it's down a bit yes you just put it

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.590 
up it's down a bit yes you just put it
on<00:04:49.140> there<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:50.060> that's<00:04:51.060> your<00:04:51.300> little

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
on there and that's your little

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.100 
on there and that's your little
flashbang<00:04:52.320> kind<00:04:52.650> of<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:52.950> not<00:04:53.100> as<00:04:53.930> great<00:04:54.930> as

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
flashbang kind of it's not as great as

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.620 
flashbang kind of it's not as great as
we<00:04:55.290> thought<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.560> might<00:04:55.770> look<00:04:55.950> but<00:04:56.250> alright<00:04:56.820> so

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
we thought it might look but alright so

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.620 
we thought it might look but alright so
that's<00:04:58.590> your<00:04:58.770> finished<00:04:59.070> product<00:04:59.540> we<00:05:00.540> have
