but<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.130> straps<00:02:15.700> are<00:02:15.850> pretty<00:02:16.060> thin<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:17.740> would

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
but the straps are pretty thin you would

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.750 
but the straps are pretty thin you would
think<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.310> wouldn't<00:02:18.550> be<00:02:18.610> too

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
think that it wouldn't be too

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.190 
think that it wouldn't be too
comfortable<00:02:18.970> because<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.570> straps<00:02:19.840> are<00:02:20.020> so

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
comfortable because the straps are so

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.230 
comfortable because the straps are so
thin<00:02:20.470> but<00:02:20.740> it's<00:02:20.970> actually<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.000> really

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
thin but it's actually a really

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.430 
thin but it's actually a really
comfortable<00:02:22.630> bag<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.640> inside<00:02:25.210> of<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:26.260> can

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440
