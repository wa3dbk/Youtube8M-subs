00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 I tested it on gh 4 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:19.840
 tl 1 is I want 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:25.130
 This time it is gh 4 The question which had been received in the comment column after raising the video 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:30.380
 Because there were about two, I was testing it there this time, so I hope you can see it 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:34.220
 Why is the first question, but when the autofocus moves during movie shooting 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:39.980
 The question is the size of the mens motor 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:43.390
 I tested it with two salt vinegars I have, so if you can see it 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.390
 I think so please 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:47.020
 How was it ? During Ted, I also use this headphone 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:52.810
 I was doing a test while I was listening to headphones but quite 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:56.270
 It was a feeling that I could understand the sound well, but the surrounding sound is the situation in which I take 8 videos 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:00.770
 There are a lot of situations of great loud sounds, I am already 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.799
 I have not always thought about it, but actually it is quite big when I listen in this way 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:09.170
 Ringing was the feeling that Do is only Etto 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.530
 Writer is the Well is the date of the image when I was taking at 7 d until Well now 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.420
 Ne 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.260
 I think that I wonder anxious what the Well great people of the time that is winning hand shake taste 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:23.069
 Outside of the match is no longer 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.090
 While I was operating like this, I heard that it was a squeak so I was quite worried about this time 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.879
 Oh 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.840
 I thought it would not bother me that much because only when autofocus works 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:37.790
 Since Well not so much made between such a long 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:42.349
 I feel like saying I do not Kira Speaking do not mind though anxious Speaking of anxious 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:46.760
 That it does not is or not'm in I'm a second question but of face recognition auto 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:49.629
 I also tested the focus speed, so please see 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.629
 So what 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:23.360
 Yes this is how north 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:27.590
 This is the net so do not have a thing called digital camera, which is followed by a turnip recognition 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.910
 I didn't know whether it was early or late, but how is it? 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.440
 like this 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:37.620
 I'm wondering if the Zest I'm doing right now will be correct or new 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.980
 Face recognition i's when you transfer the person who properly 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.670
 I wonder if it works or solo speed 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.670
 By the way also Well 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.700
 Boo Boo good or view like 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.660
 First place 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.660
 I think once, but it is true that the broadcast color is too fast 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.660
 Well I'm carrying an iphone or something, but so much 4 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.539
 Boo Boo 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:53.529
 Do you say booboo and say a little to the mountain park 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:11.650
 W I'd not know Buba stomach Once Ah alternating current function is actually using Attte is 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:16.840
 I think that it will be my reference, so there are a lot of meeting pucker and 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:21.430
 If it is possible to write in the comment column, it may take time 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:27.460
 By all means in're thought that want to do a little Yareru range 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:29.700
 I think it would be like a dark dark if there is something so then this video is political in that area 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.700
 was 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.920
 Hmm 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.770
 tee
