bag<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:21.110> think<00:01:21.380> it's<00:01:21.530> absolutely<00:01:21.920> amazing<00:01:22.640> it's

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
bag I think it's absolutely amazing it's

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.880 
bag I think it's absolutely amazing it's
very<00:01:23.330> durable<00:01:23.659> it<00:01:24.140> is<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.290> little<00:01:24.530> bit<00:01:24.680> pricey

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
very durable it is a little bit pricey

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.980 
very durable it is a little bit pricey
but<00:01:25.369> um<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:25.790> also<00:01:25.939> waterproof<00:01:26.390> which<00:01:26.810> I

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.390 
but um it's also waterproof which I
think<00:01:27.260> it<00:01:27.350> makes<00:01:27.500> it<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.920> hundred<00:01:28.250> percent

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400
