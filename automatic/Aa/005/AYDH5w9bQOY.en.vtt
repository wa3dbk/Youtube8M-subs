running boards that I bought the car
with<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.489> what<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.520> noticed<00:00:32.850> was<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.000> mean<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
with and what I noticed was I mean the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.090 
with and what I noticed was I mean the
running<00:00:33.570> boards<00:00:33.780> themselves<00:00:34.320> were<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.890> little

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
running boards themselves were a little

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.580 
running boards themselves were a little
rusty<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.239> top<00:00:36.480> when<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> took<00:00:37.140> off<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.320> old

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
rusty on the top when I took off the old

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.200 
rusty on the top when I took off the old
mat<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> old<00:00:38.190> matting<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.610> was<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:38.969> top

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
mat and the old matting that was on top

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.600 
mat and the old matting that was on top
of<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.450> was<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.960> raggy<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> tore

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
of it was really raggy and so I tore

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.819 
of it was really raggy and so I tore
that<00:00:41.760> off<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.809> saw<00:00:43.020> underneath<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.500> really

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that off and I saw underneath was really

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.560 
that off and I saw underneath was really
rusted<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.700> did<00:00:44.789> with<00:00:45.030> no<00:00:45.210> holes<00:00:45.450> or

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
rusted so what I did with no holes or

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
rusted so what I did with no holes or
anything<00:00:45.840> no<00:00:46.020> rot<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.160> coated<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.579> with

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
anything no rot so I just coated it with

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.369 
anything no rot so I just coated it with
por-15<00:00:48.270> again<00:00:48.750> which<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.110> rust

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
por-15 again which is that rust

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
por-15 again which is that rust
preventative<00:00:49.739> paint<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:51.239> will<00:00:51.360> stop<00:00:51.600> rust

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
preventative paint that will stop rust

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.130 
preventative paint that will stop rust
forever<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:53.219> they<00:00:53.340> say<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.690> far<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:54.960> worked

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
forever so they say so far it's worked

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.709 
forever so they say so far it's worked
for<00:00:55.230> me<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.890> decided<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.879> opt<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.300> go<00:00:57.329> with

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
for me but I decided to opt to go with

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.150 
for me but I decided to opt to go with
the<00:00:57.840> original<00:00:57.960> running<00:00:58.469> boards<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.800> keep

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the original running boards and keep

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
the original running boards and keep
that<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.640> what<00:00:59.820> they<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> market<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that so what they have on the market is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.280 
that so what they have on the market is
they<00:01:01.980> sell<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> actual<00:01:02.609> matting<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
they sell the actual matting that you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.380 
they sell the actual matting that you
can<00:01:04.470> use<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.220> actually<00:01:05.460> remap

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
can use to actually remap

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.320 
can use to actually remap
your<00:01:06.960> original<00:01:07.170> running<00:01:07.680> board<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.700> mean<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
your original running board I mean the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.910 
your original running board I mean the
matting<00:01:09.659> themselves<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.350> probably<00:01:10.650> about<00:01:10.770> I

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
matting themselves are probably about I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.280 
matting themselves are probably about I
don't<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.280> 20<00:01:12.000> bucks<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.689> maybe<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.080> little

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
don't know 20 bucks or so maybe a little

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.550 
don't know 20 bucks or so maybe a little
less<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> little<00:01:13.830> more<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.869> funny<00:01:16.080> thing<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
less a little more the funny thing is is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.499 
less a little more the funny thing is is
you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.680> pretty<00:01:16.920> much<00:01:17.070> find<00:01:17.460> running<00:01:18.180> boards

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
you can pretty much find running boards

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.440 
you can pretty much find running boards
around<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.290> price<00:01:19.530> range<00:01:19.830> -<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:21.180> they're

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
around that price range - I know they're

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.120 
around that price range - I know they're
not<00:01:21.479> original<00:01:22.080> German<00:01:22.470> running<00:01:22.740> boards<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
not original German running boards and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.410 
not original German running boards and
they<00:01:23.189> might<00:01:23.340> not<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.729> strong<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
they might not be as strong as the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.230 
they might not be as strong as the
German<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.040> again<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.369> get<00:01:26.520> those<00:01:26.700> new

German but again you can get those new

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.030 
German but again you can get those new

before you do this like I said I coated

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.450 
before you do this like I said I coated
my<00:01:57.570> running<00:01:57.869> boards<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.140> por-15<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.219> rust

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
my running boards a por-15 to rust

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.300 
my running boards a por-15 to rust
prevent<00:01:59.790> them<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.060> they<00:02:00.180> won't<00:02:00.450> rust<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.310> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
prevent them so they won't rust and I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.100 
prevent them so they won't rust and I
get<00:02:02.520> my<00:02:02.610> matting<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.869> said<00:02:04.020> you're

gonna<00:02:04.170> want<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.500> open<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.920> lip<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.430> all<00:02:06.060> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
gonna want to open this lip up all the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.600 
gonna want to open this lip up all the
way<00:02:06.420> down<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.899> running<00:02:07.200> board<00:02:07.459> because<00:02:08.459> this

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
way down the running board because this

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.300 
way down the running board because this
lip<00:02:08.940> has<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.450> be<00:02:09.569> open<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.440> rubber<00:02:10.679> mat<00:02:10.979> to

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
lip has to be open for the rubber mat to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.089 
lip has to be open for the rubber mat to
get<00:02:11.459> into<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:13.200> get<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.440> rubber

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:24.719 
before you clamp it down let me show you

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.589 
before you clamp it down let me show you
over<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:24.989> on<00:02:25.049> this<00:02:25.230> running<00:02:25.530> board<00:02:26.450> as<00:02:27.450> you

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
over here on this running board as you

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.780 
over here on this running board as you
can<00:02:27.750> see<00:02:27.900> here<00:02:28.140> these<00:02:28.500> running<00:02:28.890> boards<00:02:29.040> they

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
can see here these running boards they

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.809 
can see here these running boards they
have<00:02:29.939> cutouts<00:02:30.359> in<00:02:30.540> them<00:02:30.689> for<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> bolts<00:02:32.099> to

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
have cutouts in them for the bolts to

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.059 
have cutouts in them for the bolts to
pass<00:02:33.060> through<00:02:33.450> with<00:02:34.139> a<00:02:34.170> washer<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.769> the<00:02:34.889> other

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
pass through with a washer on the other

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.860 
pass through with a washer on the other
end<00:02:35.219> it's<00:02:35.340> going<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.549> hold<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:35.939> to<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.209> car

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
end it's going to hold this to the car

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.309 
end it's going to hold this to the car
now<00:02:37.739> these<00:02:38.099> rub<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.670> rubber<00:02:38.849> matting<00:02:39.319> also

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
now these rub the rubber matting also

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.170 
now these rub the rubber matting also
has<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.650> cutouts<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.250> you're<00:02:41.849> going<00:02:41.969> to<00:02:42.000> want

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
has the cutouts so you're going to want

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.399 
has the cutouts so you're going to want
to<00:02:42.239> line<00:02:42.480> those<00:02:42.689> up<00:02:42.750> first<00:02:43.579> before<00:02:45.109> you<00:02:46.109> clamp

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
to line those up first before you clamp

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.399 
to line those up first before you clamp
it<00:02:46.560> down<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> lip<00:02:49.049> here

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
it down and the lip here

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.890 
it down and the lip here
so<00:02:50.370> first<00:02:50.930> tuck<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.079> in<00:02:52.849> find<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.030> slit<00:02:54.329> which

so first tuck it in find the slit which
is<00:02:55.079> right<00:02:55.260> here

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
is right here

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.190 
is right here
on<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:56.010> other<00:02:56.099> side<00:02:56.189> and<00:02:56.639> line<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.720> up<00:02:57.780> with

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
on the other side and line that up with

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.039 
on the other side and line that up with
the<00:02:58.799> cutout<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.569> the<00:03:00.569> other<00:03:00.719> side<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
the cutout on the other side of the

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.780 
the cutout on the other side of the
running<00:03:01.290> board<00:03:01.469> once<00:03:01.980> that's<00:03:02.219> centered<00:03:02.579> and

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
running board once that's centered and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.199 
running board once that's centered and
nice<00:03:02.939> I'm<00:03:03.599> at<00:03:04.049> least<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.379> one<00:03:04.650> end<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.280> should

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
nice I'm at least on one end you should

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.940 
nice I'm at least on one end you should
be<00:03:06.299> good<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.599> go<00:03:06.629> you<00:03:07.319> might<00:03:07.500> have<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> little

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
be good to go you might have a little

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.890 
be good to go you might have a little
bit<00:03:08.129> of<00:03:08.219> an<00:03:08.310> overlap<00:03:08.549> here<00:03:08.969> mine<00:03:09.269> over<00:03:09.540> left<00:03:09.750> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
bit of an overlap here mine over left a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.449 
bit of an overlap here mine over left a
little<00:03:10.049> bit<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:10.469> the<00:03:10.919> end<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.189> running

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
little bit on the end of the running

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.179 
little bit on the end of the running
board<00:03:11.669> that's<00:03:12.599> okay<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.560> can<00:03:13.769> see<00:03:13.799> here

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
board that's okay so you can see here

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.250 
board that's okay so you can see here
it's<00:03:14.700> kind<00:03:14.939> of<00:03:15.000> overlapped<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.480> bit<00:03:15.659> but

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
it's kind of overlapped a bit but

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.409 
it's kind of overlapped a bit but
they're<00:03:16.439> all<00:03:16.620> lined<00:03:17.069> up<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.549> you're<00:03:18.299> gonna

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
they're all lined up and you're gonna

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.170 
they're all lined up and you're gonna
want<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.810> all<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.349> way<00:03:19.470> down<00:03:19.790> because<00:03:20.790> it's

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
want that all the way down because it's

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.460 
want that all the way down because it's
gonna<00:03:21.329> be<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.540> little<00:03:21.750> problematic<00:03:22.139> if<00:03:22.379> you're

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
gonna be a little problematic if you're

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.869 
gonna be a little problematic if you're
gonna<00:03:22.560> try<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.829> pass<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.190> bolts<00:03:23.430> through<00:03:23.579> and

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
gonna try to pass the bolts through and

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.839 
gonna try to pass the bolts through and
then<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.120> rubbers<00:03:24.389> covering<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.840> hole<00:03:25.019> so

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
then the rubbers covering the hole so

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.710 
then the rubbers covering the hole so
you<00:03:26.849> don't<00:03:27.000> want<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.239> trouble<00:03:27.540> at<00:03:27.629> all

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
you don't want that trouble at all

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.199 
you don't want that trouble at all
anyway<00:03:28.079> but<00:03:28.319> so<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.370> that's<00:03:29.549> basically<00:03:29.970> it

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
anyway but so and that's basically it
