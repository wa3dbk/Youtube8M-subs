China and some guys on the forums have
been<00:00:20.279> doing<00:00:20.519> some<00:00:20.699> runs<00:00:20.909> of<00:00:21.089> them<00:00:21.589> about<00:00:22.589> 50

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
been doing some runs of them about 50

bucks<00:00:23.099> with<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.669> sensor<00:00:24.800> so<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.429> the<00:00:26.729> eye

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
bucks with the sensor so here is the eye

hundred eight hundred frame cameras come

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.040 
hundred eight hundred frame cameras come
to<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> NEX<00:00:36.899> six<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.620> seven<00:00:38.339> size<00:00:38.579> range

to the NEX six and seven size range

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.900 
to the NEX six and seven size range
it'll<00:00:40.050> certainly<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.910> smaller<00:00:41.960> stuff<00:00:42.960> though

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
it'll certainly do smaller stuff though

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
it'll certainly do smaller stuff though
and<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:44.999> can<00:00:45.179> see<00:00:45.420> as<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.660> bring<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.230> sensor

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and you can see as I bring the sensor

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.299 
and you can see as I bring the sensor
into<00:00:46.949> frame<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.730> tilt<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:50.039> manipulate

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
into frame and tilt it we can manipulate

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.779 
into frame and tilt it we can manipulate
how<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.149> motor<00:00:52.050> turns<00:00:52.499> so<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.609> will

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
how the motor turns so this will

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.889 
how the motor turns so this will
eventually<00:00:53.999> actually<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> axes<00:00:55.800> on

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
eventually actually one of the axes on

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.439 
eventually actually one of the axes on
our<00:00:57.899> brush<00:00:58.109> gimbal<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:02.999> see<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
our brush gimbal you can see that the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.649 
our brush gimbal you can see that the
motor<00:01:03.659> is<00:01:03.749> pretty<00:01:03.989> smooth<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:05.430> was<00:01:05.909> not<00:01:06.540> really

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
motor is pretty smooth I was not really

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.609 
motor is pretty smooth I was not really
sure<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.049> expect<00:01:08.780> but<00:01:09.780> I'm<00:01:10.200> pretty

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
sure what to expect but I'm pretty

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.910 
sure what to expect but I'm pretty
satisfied<00:01:11.540> with<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.350> motion<00:01:13.829> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
satisfied with the kind of motion that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.429 
satisfied with the kind of motion that
we're<00:01:14.070> getting<00:01:14.310> from<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.299> course<00:01:15.750> you

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
we're getting from this of course you

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.709 
we're getting from this of course you
know<00:01:16.880> we'll<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.210> hooked<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
know we'll get this hooked up to a

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.310 
know we'll get this hooked up to a
gimbal<00:01:19.079> and<00:01:19.320> report<00:01:19.920> back<00:01:20.689> just<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.930> little<00:01:22.049> bit

help you guys out because it's a it's
pretty<00:01:48.329> easy<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.049> look<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.320> it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
pretty easy but if you just look at it

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.330 
pretty easy but if you just look at it
for<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.590> second<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.100> don't<00:01:50.759> really<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.359> any

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
for a second and don't really have any

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.139 
for a second and don't really have any
electronics<00:01:53.340> skills<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.909> be<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> little

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
electronics skills it can be a little

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.230 
electronics skills it can be a little
intimidating<00:01:56.390> then<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:59.240> motor

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
intimidating then I have the motor

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.139 
intimidating then I have the motor
output<00:02:00.560> hooked<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.740> right<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.520> my<00:02:02.909> motor

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
output hooked up right here to my motor

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.020 
output hooked up right here to my motor
and<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.920> guy<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.820> power<00:02:06.679> outlet

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
and then this guy is the power outlet

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.360 
and then this guy is the power outlet
and<00:02:09.350> that's<00:02:10.350> just<00:02:10.560> going<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
and that's just going to the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.270 
and that's just going to the
to<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.000> 3-cell<00:02:13.659> battery<00:02:13.769> I<00:02:14.769> just<00:02:15.040> haven't

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
to a 3-cell battery I just haven't

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.430 
to a 3-cell battery I just haven't
played<00:02:15.430> into<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.510> balanced<00:02:16.930> apps<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.319> has

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
played into the the balanced apps it has

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.050 
played into the the balanced apps it has
soldered<00:02:18.159> some<00:02:18.480> wires<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> male<00:02:19.959> header<00:02:20.200> and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
soldered some wires to a male header and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.570 
soldered some wires to a male header and
put<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.330> balanced<00:02:22.690> app<00:02:22.870> and<00:02:23.580> you

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
put that in the balanced app and you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.309 
put that in the balanced app and you
know<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.819> seems<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.180> be<00:02:25.209> working<00:02:25.690> okay<00:02:26.140> for

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
know that seems to be working okay for

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.920 
know that seems to be working okay for
the<00:02:26.379> testing<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:27.129> when<00:02:27.879> I<00:02:27.909> go<00:02:28.510> over<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.750> the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
the testing but when I go over to the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.970 
the testing but when I go over to the
gimbal<00:02:29.170> setup<00:02:29.730> I'm<00:02:30.730> gonna<00:02:31.680> refrain<00:02:32.680> from

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
gimbal setup I'm gonna refrain from

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.830 
gimbal setup I'm gonna refrain from
using<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.610> just<00:02:33.849> because<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.269> think<00:02:34.420> that

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
using that just because I think that

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.170 
using that just because I think that
we're<00:02:34.959> gonna<00:02:35.079> have<00:02:35.319> well<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.549> want<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.060> give

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
we're gonna have well I want to give

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.550 
we're gonna have well I want to give
these<00:02:37.269> motors<00:02:37.629> as<00:02:37.720> much<00:02:37.900> power<00:02:38.170> as<00:02:38.260> they<00:02:38.379> can

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
these motors as much power as they can

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.869 
these motors as much power as they can
get<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.840> it'd<00:02:40.959> probably<00:02:41.140> be<00:02:41.349> better<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.760> go

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
get and so it'd probably be better to go

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.199 
get and so it'd probably be better to go
through<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:44.370> flight<00:02:45.370> connector<00:02:45.879> in<00:02:46.060> this

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
through the flight connector in this

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:54.720 
through the flight connector in this
case<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.040> xt60<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:52.299> motors<00:02:52.629> that<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:53.730> are

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
case and xt60 so the motors that I are

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.640 
case and xt60 so the motors that I are
testing<00:02:55.359> are<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:56.349> flight<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.310> power<00:02:58.650> 4008

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
testing are the I flight I power 4008

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.229 
testing are the I flight I power 4008
and<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:03.180> 22:12<00:03:04.859> those<00:03:05.859> are<00:03:06.010> also

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
and the 22:12 those are also

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.240
