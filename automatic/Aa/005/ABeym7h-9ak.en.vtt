00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
just like the legends the first thing I

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
just like the legends the first thing I
noticed<00:00:50.700> was<00:00:50.789> an<00:00:50.969> overall<00:00:51.239> comfortable<00:00:51.899> fit

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
noticed was an overall comfortable fit

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.290 
noticed was an overall comfortable fit
but<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:52.829> did<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.760> flexi<00:00:54.120> grip

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
but I actually did like the flexi grip

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.080 
but I actually did like the flexi grip
as<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> fit<00:00:54.930> much<00:00:55.230> better<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.190> fit<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.910> these

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
as a fit much better the fit for these

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.819 
as a fit much better the fit for these
gloves<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.989> true<00:00:58.230> negative<00:00:58.440> fit

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.480 
gloves
the<00:01:15.689> latex<00:01:16.049> definitely<00:01:16.710> held<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.220> snuff

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490

about<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> gloves<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> wristbands

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
about the gloves is that the wristbands

about the gloves is that the wristbands
are<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> little<00:01:34.439> too<00:01:34.770> thin<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.340> liking<00:01:35.549> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
your wrist but other than that the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.069 
your wrist but other than that the
gloves<00:01:43.110> themselves<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.220> great<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.899> all

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
gloves themselves are great so of all

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.929 
gloves themselves are great so of all
three<00:01:46.350> pairs<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.710> these<00:01:46.890> gloves<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.700> main

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
three pairs of these gloves the main

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.280 
three pairs of these gloves the main
thing<00:01:48.149> that's<00:01:48.270> stepping<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.020> me<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
thing that's stepping out to me is that

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.679 
thing that's stepping out to me is that
they<00:01:49.530> don't<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.979> very<00:01:50.250> well<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.640> astroturf<00:01:51.479> if

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
they don't do very well on astroturf if

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
they don't do very well on astroturf if
you're<00:01:52.079> palming<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.619> ground<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.159> lot<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.610> your

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
you're palming the ground a lot in your

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.209 
you're palming the ground a lot in your
plane<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.240> astroturf<00:01:54.869> you're<00:01:55.290> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.009> rip

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
plane on astroturf you're going to rip

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.499 
plane on astroturf you're going to rip
the<00:01:56.430> gloves<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.850> you're<00:01:56.939> gonna<00:01:57.090> rip<00:01:57.329> them

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the gloves and you're gonna rip them

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.450 
the gloves and you're gonna rip them
quickly<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.170> astroturf<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.189> way<00:01:59.399> too

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
quickly the astroturf is just way too

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.520 
quickly the astroturf is just way too
rough<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.299> palming<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.899> ground<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.290> any

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
rough to be palming the ground with any

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
rough to be palming the ground with any
gloves<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.310> definitely<00:02:02.850> not<00:02:03.030> these<00:02:03.299> gloves

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
gloves but definitely not these gloves

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.139 
gloves but definitely not these gloves
if<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:04.200> do<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> good<00:02:05.189> diving<00:02:05.520> technique

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
if you do have a good diving technique

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.730 
if you do have a good diving technique
and<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.420> don't<00:02:06.600> palm<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.960> ground<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.320> often

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and you don't palm the ground that often

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.440 
and you don't palm the ground that often
you<00:02:08.069> can<00:02:08.220> make<00:02:08.399> these<00:02:08.550> gloves<00:02:08.729> last<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.420> a
