this cool window on the top this is a
affordable<00:00:36.720> tube<00:00:37.720> amplifier<00:00:38.260> from<00:00:38.559> the<00:00:38.620> hi-fi

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
affordable tube amplifier from the hi-fi

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.520 
affordable tube amplifier from the hi-fi
man<00:00:39.190> and<00:00:39.489> it<00:00:39.970> does<00:00:40.089> also<00:00:40.269> have<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.540> USB<00:00:40.870> DAC<00:00:41.290> in

man and it does also have a USB DAC in

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.759 
man and it does also have a USB DAC in
it<00:00:41.650> so<00:00:42.339> kind<00:00:42.820> of<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:43.079> full-featured<00:00:44.079> little

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
it so kind of a full-featured little

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.410 
it so kind of a full-featured little
unit<00:00:45.100> four<00:00:45.309> hundred<00:00:45.579> two<00:00:45.640> hundred<00:00:45.670> bucks<00:00:46.089> I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
unit four hundred two hundred bucks I

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.450 
unit four hundred two hundred bucks I
didn't<00:00:47.320> get<00:00:47.379> a<00:00:47.470> chance<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:47.860> spend<00:00:48.070> some<00:00:48.129> time

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
didn't get a chance to spend some time

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.170 
didn't get a chance to spend some time
listening<00:00:48.909> to<00:00:49.120> it<00:00:49.239> and<00:00:49.650> I<00:00:50.650> think<00:00:50.710> that<00:00:51.220> it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
listening to it and I think that it

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.329 
listening to it and I think that it
sounds<00:00:52.720> pretty<00:00:52.930> good<00:00:53.350> for<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.619> price<00:00:53.650> point<00:00:54.100> I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
sounds pretty good for the price point I

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.060 
sounds pretty good for the price point I
did<00:00:54.580> compare<00:00:54.909> it<00:00:55.000> against<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.299> couple<00:00:55.600> other

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
did compare it against a couple other

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.009 
did compare it against a couple other
solid-state<00:00:57.070> amps<00:00:57.400> and<00:00:57.640> it<00:00:58.059> seems<00:00:58.269> to<00:00:58.449> hang

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
solid-state amps and it seems to hang

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.600 
solid-state amps and it seems to hang
right<00:00:59.229> in<00:00:59.290> there<00:00:59.559> was<00:00:59.739> stuff<00:00:59.920> like<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.250> micro

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
right in there was stuff like the micro

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.210 
right in there was stuff like the micro
amp<00:01:00.790> sound<00:01:01.600> stage<00:01:01.960> maybe<00:01:02.320> is<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.559> little<00:01:02.650> narrow

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
amp sound stage maybe is a little narrow

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.789 
amp sound stage maybe is a little narrow
on<00:01:03.580> the<00:01:04.059> high<00:01:04.180> five<00:01:04.420> man<00:01:04.600> but<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.409> has<00:01:05.530> plenty

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
on the high five man but it has plenty

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.640 
on the high five man but it has plenty
of<00:01:05.950> power<00:01:06.479> drives<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.630> wide<00:01:07.840> variety<00:01:08.290> of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
of power drives a wide variety of

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.210 
of power drives a wide variety of
impedances<00:01:09.780> through<00:01:10.780> some<00:01:11.530> gear<00:01:11.710> canals<00:01:12.009> on

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
impedances through some gear canals on

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.700 
impedances through some gear canals on
there<00:01:12.460> which<00:01:12.700> maybe<00:01:13.150> aren't<00:01:13.420> super<00:01:13.869> geared

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
there which maybe aren't super geared

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.469 
there which maybe aren't super geared
for<00:01:14.920> this<00:01:15.040> amp<00:01:15.250> but<00:01:15.520> it<00:01:15.610> also<00:01:15.729> does<00:01:16.060> well<00:01:16.270> with

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
for this amp but it also does well with

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.780 
for this amp but it also does well with
high<00:01:16.840> impedance<00:01:17.170> stuff<00:01:17.560> as<00:01:17.770> well<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.610> on<00:01:18.729> the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
high impedance stuff as well so on the

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.249 
high impedance stuff as well so on the
front<00:01:19.000> panel<00:01:19.150> here<00:01:19.420> we've<00:01:19.630> got<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.960> input

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
front panel here we've got the input

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.950 
front panel here we've got the input
selector<00:01:20.710> it's<00:01:21.189> just<00:01:21.369> picks<00:01:21.610> between<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.450> RCA

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
selector it's just picks between the RCA

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.010 
selector it's just picks between the RCA
inputs<00:01:23.469> and<00:01:23.770> USB<00:01:24.460> input<00:01:24.909> so<00:01:25.299> they've<00:01:25.450> got<00:01:25.659> two

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
inputs and USB input so they've got two

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.319 
inputs and USB input so they've got two
different<00:01:26.170> choices<00:01:26.499> there<00:01:27.179> quarter<00:01:28.179> and

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
different choices there quarter and

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.179 
different choices there quarter and
headphone<00:01:28.659> output<00:01:29.049> and<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.799> little<00:01:30.039> power

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
headphone output and a little power

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.940 
headphone output and a little power

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
of blue board inside was also blue when

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.459 
of blue board inside was also blue when
you<00:01:37.299> get<00:01:37.450> this<00:01:37.630> out<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.869> box<00:01:38.109> you<00:01:38.319> just

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
you get this out of the box you just

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.349 
you get this out of the box you just
have<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.710> install<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.159> tubes<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.789> plug<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.240> in

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
have to install the tubes and plug it in

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.219 
have to install the tubes and plug it in
pretty<00:01:41.200> much<00:01:41.350> ready<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.679> go<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:43.210> DAC<00:01:43.659> does

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
pretty much ready to go this DAC does

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.690 
pretty much ready to go this DAC does
only<00:01:44.740> accept<00:01:45.189> CD<00:01:45.700> quality<00:01:45.880> or<00:01:46.299> DVD<00:01:46.749> quality<00:01:46.960> so

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
only accept CD quality or DVD quality so

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.059 
only accept CD quality or DVD quality so
1644<00:01:48.700> or<00:01:48.999> 1648<00:01:49.749> so<00:01:50.350> not<00:01:50.649> a<00:01:50.679> high<00:01:50.799> resolution

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
1644 or 1648 so not a high resolution

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.220 
1644 or 1648 so not a high resolution
USB<00:01:51.759> DAC<00:01:51.969> but<00:01:52.329> that's<00:01:52.899> okay

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
USB DAC but that's okay

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.590 
USB DAC but that's okay
argue<00:01:54.560> at<00:01:55.160> this<00:01:55.400> price<00:01:55.610> point<00:01:55.670> comes<00:01:56.420> as<00:01:56.570> a

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
argue at this price point comes as a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.920 
argue at this price point comes as a
little<00:01:56.840> 16<00:01:57.320> volt<00:01:57.680> power<00:01:58.100> supply<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.930> then

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
little 16 volt power supply and then

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.450 
little 16 volt power supply and then
you're<00:02:00.050> ready<00:02:00.230> to<00:02:00.320> go<00:02:00.530> so<00:02:00.920> I<00:02:00.950> think<00:02:01.070> this<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:01.430> a

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
you're ready to go so I think this is a

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.640 
you're ready to go so I think this is a
great<00:02:01.640> unit<00:02:02.060> for<00:02:02.360> people<00:02:03.140> who<00:02:03.230> may<00:02:03.410> be<00:02:03.470> looking

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
great unit for people who may be looking

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.460 
great unit for people who may be looking
to<00:02:03.920> get<00:02:04.010> into<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.310> tube<00:02:04.580> amp<00:02:04.760> without<00:02:05.570> spending

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
to get into a tube amp without spending
