00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.990
 I called this assembly hand rocket hayushki 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.890
 to all of you point this school driptypa 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.900
 dejar 12 and today we will collect 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.940
 a car that I wanted to grow 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.000
 I had to do a very long time 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.120
 torment with this prep setting but 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.250
 no less today we are collecting toyota mr2 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.550
 and let me show you now 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.160
 need to do before so we go in 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.769
 the garage immediately tell you again the car 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.800
 it turned out a freaky mad grid again 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.150
 I can't do anything 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.550
 car for slow drift all 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.150
 time as it turns out for super fast 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.909
 So first we go and cry 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.310
 4 engine 5 liters v8 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.159
 after this as we did we go to 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.860
 air supply and set consistent 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.830
 thin turbocharger is how you see 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.580
 two tubes of such butterflies 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.250
 is after this you can go to 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.420
 example tuning and hang skirts by 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.350
 to your taste 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.680
 and if you want answers like mine, then this 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:37.310
 kaminari front bumper rear spoiler 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.299
 bamix not adjustable rear bumper 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.469
 we, too, bamix and threshold we have them 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.719
 Kaminari there respectively figured out 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.619
 go further wheels rubber remains but 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.799
 soon 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.799
 so that the car was unmanaged width 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.500
 Wheels everywhere, too, as the front stock 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.020
 so and back if you want the same drives 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.979
 as I have it in the second category 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.770
 go and called super whey zero 3 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.209
 for jack 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.709
 song well and the radius of the wheels if you like 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.800
 also important interests 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:20.890
 here he is like us and in the back too 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.440
 radius when it becomes and so on we go to 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.170
 engine immediately go to the engine 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.870
 air filter we put on maximum 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.690
 it is necessary then the fuel system 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.660
 we also put on the maximum we all 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.310
 skipping go exhaust system here 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.120
 we also put everything on 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.130
 the maximum we go further parallel 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.220
 we put this turbocharger too 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.799
 the last to the maximum further to the cartoon 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.709
 intercooler talked friends forgive and 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.980
 we put the racing intercooler this too 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.930
 sure without this anywhere all with 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.760
 the engine is over 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.769
 annual management and here we put 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.230
 absolutely everything to the maximum even you 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.720
 I will not show everything absolutely 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.430
 maximum all that you see here is all 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.019
 maximum only watch careful eats 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.530
 you bought dlc 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.810
 that island don't necessarily put 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.170
 put put usually 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.440
 racing do not have to clean dey you blame 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.139
 storm island so well we are all here 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.410
 on maxim we pump the running control 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.299
 next we go to the drive in the drive we need 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.100
 bringing we need i'm honestly even for 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.730
 what set the drive we need 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.599
 racing gearbox driveshaft 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.260
 we don't touch 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:41.049
 and differential all racing differential 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.480
 the most recent we buy in general 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:48.060
 nature we only transmission and 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.310
 the differential is all on that 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.080
 tuning we have nothing more to do 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.210
 we 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.840
 in tuning is a completely different more 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.920
 detailed and so binding we raise 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.140
 pressure 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.660
 front and rear tires on the front i 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.670
 put 2 and 7 on the back I put two 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.960
 and five 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.730
 touch a little main gear 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.270
 we put it on 349 we change quite a bit 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.470
 the main thing to remember sex fu 300 rubles 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.060
 wheel alignment 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.170
 like in all cars i make myself 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.730
 negative camber 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:27.030
 it's -2.5 degrees what's the front 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.570
 back and apron apron raise to 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.650
 five and a half degrees transverse 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:38.000
 front stabilizers I put on 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:42.660
 3022 rear 3411 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.860
 front springs I made hard on 146 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:52.100
 and 4 back to 160 and one naturally 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.300
 clearance minus the maximum so 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.100
 shock absorbers do a little harder 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.490
 front 10 back 10 and 1 compression 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.620
 In my opinion 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.830
 3 places you will not have such flowers 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.539
 be sure to do like me 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.759
 aerodynamics we are not touched and therefore 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.169
 that i won't put wards it can 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.169
 arrange aerodynamics 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.990
 so braking force I set the balance 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.009
 on the back 26 percent i think of this 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.550
 enough 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:23.979
 You can certainly put Polish but it 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.750
 Already again taste before time 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.479
 naturally I need to do more 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.050
 supply 7 6 percent broom absolutely 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.930
 a photo 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.949
 well, dolphin seal acceleration is not set 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.139
 on the table and a 75 percent slowdown this 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.970
 need for what is it necessary in order to 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.569
 go out of the longest 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.880
 such straight here as you see next straight 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.919
 in long with long turns it 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.069
 it will be very cool to eat complex 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.479
 there will be such a turn will bring it down 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:56.319
 sure and get out of it is good too 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.720
 In general, on this all and further we go 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.319
 test on our test 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.319
 tracks 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.060
 so we teleported to our 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.760
 test track and now we will start driving 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.830
 car i lock well do you hear 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.630
 then already imposed comments on top 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.760
 about how I drove the track 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.090
 believe me, I still need 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.030
 get together to get better not 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.930
 since it was not very previous video 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.930
 so they drove 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:38.360
 and so I wanted to tell the car 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.070
 the car came out powerful if I couldn't 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:43.490
 the engine is she would have been so 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.290
 slow turn volitional sideways 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.930
 I decided to hunt all the same 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.870
 engine windows and to make it more powerful 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.090
 In general, ideally, if you do not want to 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.520
 you have a car at such a fast speed 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.550
 somehow for worn you don't need it 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.500
 you can just not touch the swap engine 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.660
 do all the same thing just do not devour 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.910
 him and therefore not put on him 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.919
 turbines can put any 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.410
 the little turbine just that was a gain 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:11.150
 power swayed moment like you 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.490
 see the car 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.919
 It includes drift pretty simple to me 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.990
 you just have to press the gas and and it already 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:21.010
 starts to be entered are traversed 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.720
 almost everything in third gear 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:26.510
 there are no difficulties sometimes 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.100
 have to catch a car can 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.940
 deploy it again again if you will 

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:35.120
 gently interact with the gas then 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:38.780
 everything will be fine with you and how you see 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:42.650
 the machine is even suitable for very 3 long 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:45.080
 drifts and it can not but rejoice in 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.419
 mutual friends thank you for your attention thank you 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.849
 that watched this video it was a school 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:53.780
 Drift and today we collected ourselves toyota 

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:55.669
 mr2 with you was van point don't forget 

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:59.479
 subscribe to channel comment and 

00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:02.199
 be sure to play only good games 

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.199
 friends
