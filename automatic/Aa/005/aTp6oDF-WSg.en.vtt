our lovely assistant seems to have a
drawer<00:00:46.590> full<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.890> these<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.610> cut<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.879> little

drawer full of these just cut the little
ear<00:00:48.270> off<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.860> phone<00:00:50.100> sets<00:00:50.550> into<00:00:50.850> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
ear off here so this phone sets into it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.200 
ear off here so this phone sets into it
and<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.199> could<00:00:52.350> hold<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.710> places<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.280> all<00:00:54.120> right

and I could hold it places but all right
now<00:00:54.329> we're<00:00:54.480> handheld<00:00:54.899> even<00:00:55.199> lower<00:00:55.379> tech<00:00:55.879> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
now we're handheld even lower tech so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:57.500 
now we're handheld even lower tech so

which is mounted on this end it is
plunger<00:01:19.470> inside<00:01:20.130> off<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.720> spinning<00:01:21.720> flywheel

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
plunger inside off the spinning flywheel

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.670 
plunger inside off the spinning flywheel
and<00:01:22.770> clutch<00:01:22.920> assembly<00:01:23.659> so<00:01:24.659> even<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
and clutch assembly so even with the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.469 
and clutch assembly so even with the
spring<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.790> grab<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
spring on here you can just grab it and

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
spring on here you can just grab it and
you<00:01:27.689> can<00:01:27.840> see<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.680> move<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.979> out<00:01:29.100> about

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you can see that I can move it out about

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.030 
you can see that I can move it out about
that<00:01:29.549> much<00:01:29.960> just<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.140> hand<00:01:31.439> pressure<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that much just with hand pressure and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.510 
that much just with hand pressure and
you<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> distance<00:01:32.790> there<00:01:33.979> just<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.100> little

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you see the distance there just a little

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.429 
you see the distance there just a little
bit<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.909> keep<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.270> throwout<00:01:36.600> bearing<00:01:36.720> from

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
bit to keep that throwout bearing from

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.410 
bit to keep that throwout bearing from
spinning<00:01:37.950> with<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.280> flywheel<00:01:38.670> at<00:01:38.939> all<00:01:39.090> times

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
spinning with the flywheel at all times

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.929 
spinning with the flywheel at all times
and<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:40.530> set<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.890> distance<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.549> here

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
and you can set that distance right here

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
and you can set that distance right here
so<00:01:42.180> essentially<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:42.960> pull<00:01:43.350> against<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
so essentially you just pull against it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.010 
so essentially you just pull against it
find<00:01:44.850> where<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> touches<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.600> throw<00:01:45.899> out

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
find where it touches the throw out

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.530 
find where it touches the throw out
bearing<00:01:46.259> when<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> pivots<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.549> give<00:01:48.210> yourself

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
bearing when it pivots and give yourself

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.480 
bearing when it pivots and give yourself
15<00:01:48.930> or<00:01:49.079> 20<00:01:49.350> thousands<00:01:49.829> right<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:53.340> you

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
15 or 20 thousands right here and you

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.100 
15 or 20 thousands right here and you
can<00:01:53.640> see<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.880> my<00:01:54.030> case<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.450> forgot<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.869> put<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
can see in my case I forgot to put the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770 
can see in my case I forgot to put the
little<00:01:55.290> eyelet<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.329> it's<00:01:57.329> hard<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> see

that<00:02:04.619> well<00:02:04.740> alright<00:02:05.040> I'll<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.280> kind<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.729> line

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
that well alright I'll just kind of line

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.240 
that well alright I'll just kind of line
it<00:02:06.060> up<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.570> went<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:07.020> my<00:02:07.140> stabilizer<00:02:07.979> bar

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it up and it went to my stabilizer bar

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.669 
it up and it went to my stabilizer bar
I've<00:02:08.369> got<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.670> adjustable<00:02:09.330> bar<00:02:09.679> although

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
I've got this adjustable bar although

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.320 
I've got this adjustable bar although
really<00:02:10.860> most<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.430> these<00:02:11.520> end<00:02:11.760> up<00:02:11.910> being<00:02:12.150> all

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
really most of these end up being all

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.970 
really most of these end up being all
the<00:02:12.599> way

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the way

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.670 
the way
to<00:02:13.980> be<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.250> standard<00:02:14.730> length<00:02:15.319> so<00:02:16.319> don't<00:02:16.500> think

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
to be the standard length so don't think

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.899 
to be the standard length so don't think
that<00:02:16.799> you'll<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.129> able<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.459> move<00:02:17.579> the<00:02:17.760> engine

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
that you'll be able to move the engine

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.550 
that you'll be able to move the engine
around<00:02:18.299> much<00:02:18.540> it'll<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.049> be<00:02:19.140> all<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.469> way

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
around much it'll have to be all the way

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.649 
around much it'll have to be all the way
in<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.920> keep<00:02:20.069> stuff<00:02:20.400> from<00:02:20.579> hitting<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.420> grill

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
in to keep stuff from hitting the grill

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.190 
in to keep stuff from hitting the grill
up<00:02:21.840> here<00:02:22.219> and<00:02:23.219> I<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.450> this<00:02:24.629> also<00:02:24.900> this

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
up here and I do have this also this

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.940 
up here and I do have this also this
adjustable<00:02:25.790> slave<00:02:26.790> push<00:02:27.359> rod<00:02:27.629> which<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.739> nice

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
adjustable slave push rod which is nice

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.379 
adjustable slave push rod which is nice
because<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.250> lot<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.459> times<00:02:29.760> as<00:02:30.000> these<00:02:30.180> will

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:30.389 
because a lot of times as these will

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.440 
because a lot of times as these will
parts<00:02:30.989> down<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:31.590> where<00:02:32.060> sometimes<00:02:33.060> this

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
parts down in here where sometimes this

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.770 
parts down in here where sometimes this
clevis<00:02:33.870> gets<00:02:34.109> a<00:02:34.230> bit<00:02:34.379> worn<00:02:34.560> out<00:02:35.659> it's<00:02:36.659> just

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
clevis gets a bit worn out it's just

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.569 
clevis gets a bit worn out it's just
nice<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.139> be<00:02:37.439> able<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.650> lengthen<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.310> because

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
nice to be able to lengthen that because

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.679 
nice to be able to lengthen that because
that's<00:02:38.730> one<00:02:38.909> of<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> easiest<00:02:39.389> ways<00:02:39.659> to

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
that's one of the easiest ways to

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.509 
that's one of the easiest ways to
establish<00:02:40.109> this<00:02:40.620> distance<00:02:41.069> if<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.280> don't

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
establish this distance if you don't

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.369 
establish this distance if you don't
have<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.819> range<00:02:41.969> for<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.359> a<00:02:42.540> lot<00:02:43.079> of<00:02:43.170> people

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
have the range for it a lot of people

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.619 
have the range for it a lot of people
say<00:02:43.500> well<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.709> can't<00:02:44.250> get<00:02:44.430> 15,000<00:02:45.239> s<00:02:45.299> here<00:02:45.450> it's

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
say well I can't get 15,000 s here it's

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.449 
say well I can't get 15,000 s here it's
either<00:02:45.780> there's<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.530> too<00:02:46.739> much<00:02:46.889> slop<00:02:47.189> I'm

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
either there's a too much slop I'm

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.119 
either there's a too much slop I'm
wasting<00:02:47.849> too<00:02:48.000> much<00:02:48.030> pedal<00:02:48.510> travel<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.950> there's

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
wasting too much pedal travel so there's

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.319 
wasting too much pedal travel so there's
usually<00:02:50.250> something<00:02:50.609> else<00:02:50.849> going<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.269> with

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
usually something else going on with

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.319 
usually something else going on with
where<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:53.129> adjustable<00:02:53.579> piece<00:02:53.879> here<00:02:54.120> can

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
where and the adjustable piece here can

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.000 
where and the adjustable piece here can
kind<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.569> give<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.260> little<00:02:55.799> bit<00:02:55.919> of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
kind of give you that a little bit of

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.640 
kind of give you that a little bit of
leeway<00:02:56.189> that<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.329> fine<00:02:57.569> tune<00:02:57.599> but<00:02:58.560> you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
leeway that you can fine tune but you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.199 
leeway that you can fine tune but you
can<00:02:58.799> also<00:02:58.950> lengthen<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.669> stock<00:02:59.879> piece<00:03:00.180> a

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
can also lengthen the stock piece a

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.759 
can also lengthen the stock piece a
number<00:03:00.629> of<00:03:00.750> ways<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.109> can<00:03:01.200> stick<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.560> nut

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
number of ways you can stick a nut

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.349 
number of ways you can stick a nut
behind<00:03:02.099> it<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.519> can<00:03:02.669> just<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.180> do<00:03:03.269> all

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
behind it you can just you can do all

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:04.940 
behind it you can just you can do all
sorts<00:03:03.389> of<00:03:03.750> things<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.109> experiment<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.829> see

there's<00:03:43.620> my<00:03:43.799> FreePlay<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.780> now<00:03:46.019> it's<00:03:46.199> doing

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
there's my FreePlay and now it's doing

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.710 
there's my FreePlay and now it's doing
its<00:03:46.620> work<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.129> really<00:03:47.669> by<00:03:47.849> here<00:03:48.449> it's

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
its work and really by here it's

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.229 
its work and really by here it's
released<00:03:49.379> and<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:50.370> still<00:03:50.609> have<00:03:50.759> room<00:03:50.939> to<00:03:51.000> go

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
released and you still have room to go

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:58.189 
released and you still have room to go
to<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.449> carpet<00:03:56.419> that<00:03:57.419> pedals<00:03:57.780> quite<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.019> bit

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199 
to the carpet that pedals quite a bit

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.990 
to the carpet that pedals quite a bit
lower<00:03:58.349> I<00:03:58.500> think<00:03:58.620> they<00:03:58.949> would<00:03:59.400> like<00:03:59.609> this<00:03:59.819> on

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
lower I think they would like this on

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.689 
lower I think they would like this on
purpose<00:04:00.739> some<00:04:01.739> people<00:04:02.009> say<00:04:02.159> well<00:04:02.310> no<00:04:02.459> you've

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
purpose some people say well no you've

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.339 
purpose some people say well no you've
been<00:04:02.879> it's<00:04:03.060> been<00:04:03.269> tuned<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.780> been<00:04:03.959> pummeled

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
been it's been tuned it's been pummeled

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.679 
been it's been tuned it's been pummeled
too<00:04:04.500> hard<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.159> that's<00:04:05.699> one<00:04:05.939> fix<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:06.449> if<00:04:06.599> you

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
too hard and that's one fix is if you

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.210 
too hard and that's one fix is if you
just<00:04:06.840> don't<00:04:06.989> have<00:04:07.169> enough<00:04:07.259> travel<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:07.919> to<00:04:08.069> take

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
just don't have enough travel is to take

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.219 
just don't have enough travel is to take
the<00:04:08.370> pedal<00:04:08.669> up<00:04:08.790> here<00:04:09.060> heat<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.959> up<00:04:10.049> with<00:04:10.169> a

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:10.229 
the pedal up here heat it up with a

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:11.539 
the pedal up here heat it up with a
torch<00:04:10.530> or<00:04:10.650> something<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.189> apply<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> little

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
torch or something and apply a little

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.240 
torch or something and apply a little
bit<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.939> twist<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:12.959> good<00:04:13.680> idea<00:04:13.979> to<00:04:14.069> take<00:04:14.189> it

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
bit of twist to it good idea to take it

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.520 
bit of twist to it good idea to take it
out<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.579> car<00:04:14.759> to<00:04:14.909> do<00:04:15.030> that<00:04:15.209> but<00:04:16.199> that'll

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
out of the car to do that but that'll

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.229 
out of the car to do that but that'll
gain<00:04:16.769> some<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:17.220> back<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:17.909> you<00:04:17.970> have<00:04:18.060> a

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
gain some of that back so you have a

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.330 
gain some of that back so you have a
greater<00:04:18.539> distance<00:04:19.049> to<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.320> floor<00:04:19.560> some

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
greater distance to the floor some

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.909 
greater distance to the floor some
people<00:04:20.609> prefer<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:20.940> lot<00:04:21.209> more<00:04:21.469> replay<00:04:22.469> up<00:04:22.650> here

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
people prefer a lot more replay up here

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.550 
people prefer a lot more replay up here
so<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.279> doesn't<00:04:23.310> engage<00:04:24.080> quite<00:04:25.080> so<00:04:25.260> high<00:04:25.409> up

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
so it doesn't engage quite so high up

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.610 
so it doesn't engage quite so high up
but<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:25.830> like<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.190> feel<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.400> this

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
but I like the feel of this

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.230 
but I like the feel of this
we<00:04:28.620> talk<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.830> lot<00:04:28.980> about<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.460> short<00:04:29.700> shift<00:04:30.000> or

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
we talk a lot about the short shift or

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.420 
we talk a lot about the short shift or
whatever<00:04:30.540> else<00:04:30.750> this<00:04:31.650> one<00:04:31.890> has<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.220> short

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
whatever else this one has the short

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.330 
whatever else this one has the short
shift<00:04:32.730> which<00:04:33.000> all<00:04:33.480> it<00:04:33.660> does<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:34.770> just<00:04:35.010> jocks

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
shift which all it does is it just jocks

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.180 
shift which all it does is it just jocks
this<00:04:35.610> pivot<00:04:36.600> point<00:04:36.630> up<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.040> have<00:04:38.160> a

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
this pivot point up so that you have a

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.030 
this pivot point up so that you have a
longer<00:04:38.520> throw<00:04:38.970> underneath<00:04:39.650> which<00:04:40.650> basically

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
longer throw underneath which basically

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.350 
longer throw underneath which basically
makes<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:42.210> have<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.660> move<00:04:42.840> this<00:04:43.440> less<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:44.430> know

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
makes that have to move this less I know

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.940 
makes that have to move this less I know
if<00:04:45.780> I'll<00:04:45.900> be<00:04:46.020> able<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.200> shift<00:04:46.410> it<00:04:46.590> with<00:04:46.710> a<00:04:46.770> car

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
if I'll be able to shift it with a car

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.850 
if I'll be able to shift it with a car
sitting<00:04:47.280> still<00:04:47.490> but<00:04:47.700> there's<00:04:48.450> neutral<00:04:49.020> see

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
sitting still but there's neutral see

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.000 
sitting still but there's neutral see
this<00:04:50.010> is<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.190> very<00:04:50.310> very<00:04:50.910> tight<00:04:51.180> setup<00:04:51.860> and<00:04:52.860> it

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
this is a very very tight setup and it

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.620 
this is a very very tight setup and it
does<00:04:53.220> work<00:04:53.430> nicely<00:04:53.940> if<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.210> get<00:04:54.360> it<00:04:54.480> all

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
does work nicely if you get it all

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.540 
does work nicely if you get it all
hooked<00:04:54.780> up<00:04:54.960> right<00:04:56.000> first<00:04:57.650> second<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.830> mean<00:04:59.370> it

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
hooked up right first second I mean it

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.240 
hooked up right first second I mean it
is<00:05:00.080> that's<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:02.270> neutral<00:05:03.500> very<00:05:04.500> sure<00:05:04.830> where<00:05:05.100> it

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
is that's it neutral very sure where it

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.640 
is that's it neutral very sure where it
is<00:05:05.400> now<00:05:06.030> there's<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.660> lot<00:05:06.810> of<00:05:06.930> wear<00:05:07.140> and<00:05:07.170> junk

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
is now there's a lot of wear and junk

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.890 
is now there's a lot of wear and junk
down<00:05:07.830> below<00:05:08.160> there's<00:05:09.030> not<00:05:09.210> enough<00:05:09.480> travel

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
down below there's not enough travel

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.170 
down below there's not enough travel
with<00:05:10.170> that<00:05:10.350> longer<00:05:10.740> rod<00:05:10.920> to<00:05:11.400> engage<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:11.970> gates

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
with that longer rod to engage the gates

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.570 
with that longer rod to engage the gates
and<00:05:12.450> reverse<00:05:12.750> cleanly<00:05:13.230> so<00:05:13.890> people<00:05:14.190> give<00:05:14.400> these

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
and reverse cleanly so people give these

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.090 
and reverse cleanly so people give these
things<00:05:14.820> about<00:05:15.030> name<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.540> they'll<00:05:15.630> say<00:05:15.810> well

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
things about name and they'll say well

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.580 
things about name and they'll say well
the<00:05:17.100> short<00:05:17.340> shift<00:05:17.610> kit<00:05:17.790> doesn't<00:05:18.120> work<00:05:18.420> it<00:05:19.350> does

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
the short shift kit doesn't work it does

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.920 
the short shift kit doesn't work it does
work<00:05:19.830> if<00:05:20.280> you<00:05:20.760> pay<00:05:20.910> attention<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.420> understand

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
work if you pay attention and understand

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.820 
work if you pay attention and understand
what<00:05:22.110> it's<00:05:22.200> trying<00:05:22.350> to<00:05:22.470> do<00:05:22.650> and<00:05:22.920> work<00:05:23.490> with<00:05:23.700> it
