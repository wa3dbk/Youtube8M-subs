00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.650 
but if you take a look this piece here
goes<00:04:52.560> kind<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.100> something<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.640> nothing<00:04:54.000> so

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
goes kind of something to nothing so

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.240 
goes kind of something to nothing so
what<00:04:54.840> we<00:04:54.930> did<00:04:55.080> was<00:04:55.140> we<00:04:55.290> put<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.710> philippe's

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
what we did was we put the philippe's

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.180 
what we did was we put the philippe's
and<00:04:56.970> ripped<00:04:57.210> it<00:04:57.330> something<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:57.840> nothing<00:04:58.200> as

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
and ripped it something to nothing as

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.610 
and ripped it something to nothing as
you<00:04:59.340> can<00:04:59.490> see<00:04:59.640> this<00:04:59.790> one<00:04:59.970> here<00:05:00.620> again

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
you can see this one here again

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.030 
you can see this one here again
something<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.580> nothing<00:05:02.910> a<00:05:03.740> little<00:05:04.740> piece<00:05:05.010> here

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
something to nothing a little piece here

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.340 
something to nothing a little piece here
and<00:05:07.310> basically<00:05:08.310> we<00:05:09.000> just<00:05:09.030> hit<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.050> underneath

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
and basically we just hit it underneath

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.930 
and basically we just hit it underneath
the<00:05:10.470> rail<00:05:12.260> right<00:05:13.260> so<00:05:13.740> so<00:05:14.580> this<00:05:14.700> could<00:05:14.820> have

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
the rail right so so this could have

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.250 
the rail right so so this could have
been<00:05:14.970> done<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.180> couple<00:05:15.360> of<00:05:15.570> ways<00:05:15.720> we<00:05:15.750> could<00:05:16.080> have

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
been done a couple of ways we could have

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.520 
been done a couple of ways we could have
just<00:05:16.860> continued<00:05:17.720> extending<00:05:18.720> this<00:05:19.110> would<00:05:19.380> all

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
just continued extending this would all

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.870 
just continued extending this would all
the<00:05:19.620> way<00:05:19.710> out<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.070> then<00:05:20.160> cut<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:20.520> outside

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
the way out and then cut the outside

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.970 
the way out and then cut the outside
edge<00:05:21.140> or<00:05:22.250> take<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.370> outside<00:05:23.760> edge<00:05:23.940> and<00:05:24.830> cut<00:05:25.830> up
