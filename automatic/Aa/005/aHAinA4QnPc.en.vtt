00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
know how to bar spin to obviously um you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.380 
know how to bar spin to obviously um you
just<00:00:58.980> way<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.910> spin<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> bars

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
just way to do it is to spin the bars

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.939 
just way to do it is to spin the bars
the<00:01:00.539> opposite<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.260> spin<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:01.859> you

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
the opposite way that you spin so if you

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.650 
the opposite way that you spin so if you
spend<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> left<00:01:02.550> spin<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.329> bars<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
spend to the left spin the bars to the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.840 
spend to the left spin the bars to the
right<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:04.229> possibly<00:01:04.739> both<00:01:04.979> ways<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:05.760> I'm

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
right it's possibly both ways but I'm

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.359 
right it's possibly both ways but I'm
telling<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:06.180> now<00:01:06.360> if<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.409> throw<00:01:08.250> your

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
telling you right now if you throw your

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.260 
telling you right now if you throw your
by<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> same<00:01:08.700> where<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.880> spend<00:01:09.090> you're<00:01:09.180> gonna

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
by the same where you spend you're gonna

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
by the same where you spend you're gonna
have<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> harder<00:01:09.720> time<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.770> biggest<00:01:10.920> key<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
have a harder time so the biggest key to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.539 
have a harder time so the biggest key to
this<00:01:11.430> trick<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.180> spin<00:01:12.860> don't<00:01:13.860> try<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> spin

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
this trick is to spin don't try to spin

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.240 
this trick is to spin don't try to spin
180<00:01:14.810> spin<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> ninety<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.100> when

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
180 spin the ninety like just when

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.620 
180 spin the ninety like just when
you're<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> ball<00:01:17.909> try<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> spin<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you're going on the ball try to spin a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.020 
you're going on the ball try to spin a
ninety<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> throw<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> bars<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.400> don't<00:01:20.939> know

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
ninety and throw the bars I don't know

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.570 
ninety and throw the bars I don't know
why<00:01:21.210> don't<00:01:21.659> ask<00:01:21.900> me<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> extra<00:01:23.220> ninety

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
why don't ask me but the extra ninety

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.969 
why don't ask me but the extra ninety
will<00:01:23.729> come<00:01:23.970> if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.600> try<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> 180<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
will come if you try to do a 180 and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.109 
will come if you try to do a 180 and
throw<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> bars<00:01:26.460> you're<00:01:26.700> gonna<00:01:26.820> hit<00:01:27.000> your

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
throw the bars you're gonna hit your
