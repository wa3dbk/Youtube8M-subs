00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.690 
way with it now seems to me Nick Young
is<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.319> perfect<00:02:32.829> guy<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:32.920> have<00:02:33.159> coming<00:02:33.549> off

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
is the perfect guy to have coming off

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.339 
is the perfect guy to have coming off
the<00:02:33.909> bench<00:02:34.120> because<00:02:34.599> he's<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.780> volume<00:02:35.319> shooter

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
the bench because he's a volume shooter

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.580 
the bench because he's a volume shooter
in<00:02:35.920> school<00:02:36.250> who<00:02:36.909> can<00:02:37.120> get<00:02:37.299> hot<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.930> hurry<00:02:37.959> I

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
in school who can get hot in a hurry I

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.500 
in school who can get hot in a hurry I
think<00:02:39.189> his<00:02:39.340> best<00:02:39.549> role<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.090> play<00:02:40.450> in

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
think his best role is to play in

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.949 
think his best role is to play in

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
defensive play in that pass gets through

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.240 
defensive play in that pass gets through
it's<00:02:46.480> probably<00:02:46.810> two<00:02:46.989> points<00:02:47.409> and<00:02:47.560> he<00:02:48.040> knew

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
it's probably two points and he knew
