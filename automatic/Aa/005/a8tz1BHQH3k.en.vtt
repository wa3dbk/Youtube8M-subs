there<00:00:51.179> are<00:00:51.420> three<00:00:52.050> flat<00:00:52.649> wells<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.659> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
there are three flat wells you kind of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.430 
there are three flat wells you kind of
seen<00:00:54.929> here<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.679> two<00:00:56.069> and<00:00:56.370> three<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.350> you

off<00:01:01.829> away<00:01:02.039> from<00:01:02.159> these<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.729> can<00:01:02.879> separate

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
off away from these so you can separate

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.400 
off away from these so you can separate
this<00:01:03.960> bezel<00:01:04.290> way<00:01:04.980> away<00:01:05.280> from<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:06.570> -<00:01:06.810> vents<00:01:07.320> and

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
this bezel way away from the - vents and

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.430 
this bezel way away from the - vents and
the<00:01:07.500> regular<00:01:07.800> console<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.990> I'll<00:01:10.140> show<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.350> how

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
the regular console so I'll show you how

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.960 
the regular console so I'll show you how
to<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.680> that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.950 

first<00:01:15.970> thing<00:01:16.149> we'll<00:01:16.299> do<00:01:16.450> is<00:01:16.479> we'll<00:01:16.720> take<00:01:16.899> the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
first thing we'll do is we'll take the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.389 
first thing we'll do is we'll take the
drill<00:01:17.439> with<00:01:18.189> 1/8<00:01:18.610> bit

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
drill with 1/8 bit

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.200 
drill with 1/8 bit
stick<00:01:21.399> it<00:01:21.520> right<00:01:21.549> here<00:01:21.939> in<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.090> center<00:01:24.210> all

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
stick it right here in the center all

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.810 
stick it right here in the center all
we're<00:01:25.420> going<00:01:25.509> to<00:01:25.570> do<00:01:25.720> is<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:25.960> do<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> pilot<00:01:26.649> hole

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.330 

that's<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:31.229> I'm<00:01:32.229> gonna<00:01:32.350> do<00:01:32.470> this<00:01:32.590> all<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.189> way

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
that's it I'm gonna do this all the way

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:43.560 
that's it I'm gonna do this all the way
around<00:01:40.679> if<00:01:41.679> you<00:01:41.829> go<00:01:42.009> too<00:01:42.070> far<00:01:42.549> you<00:01:42.610> will<00:01:43.090> drill

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
around if you go too far you will drill

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.609 
around if you go too far you will drill
through<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.110> bezels<00:01:48.959> although<00:01:49.959> that<00:01:50.170> can<00:01:50.380> be

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
through the bezels although that can be

00:01:50.619 --> 00:02:15.449 
through the bezels although that can be
fixed<00:01:51.569> is<00:01:52.569> more<00:01:52.929> work<00:02:13.799> all<00:02:14.799> right<00:02:14.860> that's<00:02:15.280> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
fixed is more work all right that's the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.370 
fixed is more work all right that's the
11<00:02:16.470> here's<00:02:17.470> we'll<00:02:17.680> go<00:02:17.769> ahead<00:02:17.829> King<00:02:18.250> gets<00:02:19.380> 3/8

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
11 here's we'll go ahead King gets 3/8

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.440 
11 here's we'll go ahead King gets 3/8
bit<00:02:23.340> now<00:02:24.340> we're<00:02:24.489> going<00:02:24.579> to<00:02:24.640> remove<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.239> rest

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
bit now we're going to remove the rest

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.710 
bit now we're going to remove the rest
of<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.720> plastic<00:02:26.459> just<00:02:27.459> little<00:02:28.120> just<00:02:28.329> the<00:02:28.480> top

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
of the plastic just little just the top

00:02:28.720 --> 00:03:19.690 
of the plastic just little just the top
of<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.930> will

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.039 

you<00:03:20.700> can<00:03:20.849> take<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.150> 1/8<00:03:21.569> bit<00:03:21.930> again<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.930> you

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
you can take that 1/8 bit again and you

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.720 
you can take that 1/8 bit again and you
can<00:03:25.230> carefully<00:03:26.599> drill<00:03:27.599> out<00:03:27.780> these<00:03:28.319> three<00:03:28.829> flat

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
can carefully drill out these three flat

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.410 
can carefully drill out these three flat
welds<00:03:31.400> or<00:03:32.400> I'm<00:03:32.819> going<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:32.970> show<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.120> two<00:03:33.390> other

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
welds or I'm going to show you two other

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.949 
welds or I'm going to show you two other
ways<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.900> can<00:03:34.049> do<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:35.420> first<00:03:36.420> thing<00:03:36.659> you<00:03:36.750> do<00:03:36.870> is

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
ways you can do it first thing you do is

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:55.900 
ways you can do it first thing you do is
get<00:03:37.079> your<00:03:37.260> Dremel

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.300 

I<00:03:56.910> did<00:03:57.180> two<00:03:57.390> out<00:03:57.570> of<00:03:57.600> three<00:03:57.960> on<00:03:58.110> that<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:59.040> last

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
I did two out of three on that the last

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.200 
I did two out of three on that the last
one<00:04:03.740> take<00:04:04.740> soldering<00:04:05.250> irons<00:04:05.610> already<00:04:05.910> heat<00:04:06.090> it

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
one take soldering irons already heat it

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.750 
one take soldering irons already heat it
up<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.410> can<00:04:07.680> literally<00:04:07.950> just<00:04:08.130> melt<00:04:08.580> this

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
up and you can literally just melt this

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:17.509 
up and you can literally just melt this
away<00:04:09.830> melt<00:04:10.830> it<00:04:11.010> where<00:04:11.190> it's<00:04:11.280> soft<00:04:11.520> enough

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:50.620 

just<00:04:18.239> like<00:04:18.629> that<00:04:28.159> one

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.820 

one<00:04:51.630> of<00:04:51.690> these<00:04:51.750> plastic<00:04:52.050> whales<00:04:52.440> getting

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
one of these plastic whales getting

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.600 
one of these plastic whales getting
