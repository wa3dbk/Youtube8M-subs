00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
got a training pour it on its or

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.330 
got a training pour it on its or
chargeable<00:01:31.020> you've<00:01:31.770> got<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.039> put<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.280> own

chargeable you've got to put your own

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.249 
chargeable you've got to put your own
double-a<00:01:32.999> batteries<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.840> guess<00:01:34.079> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
double-a batteries in it but I guess it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.959 
double-a batteries in it but I guess it
is<00:01:34.499> capable<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.070> taking<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.490> chargeable

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
is capable of taking a chargeable

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.709 
is capable of taking a chargeable
battery<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.780> has<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> charge<00:01:38.189> port<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
battery and has a charge port on it it

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.080 
battery and has a charge port on it it
also<00:01:39.869> has<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.409> really<00:01:40.649> interesting<00:01:41.100> switch

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
also has this really interesting switch

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.169 
also has this really interesting switch
where<00:01:42.359> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.659> change<00:01:43.530> from<00:01:43.829> mode<00:01:44.130> 1<00:01:44.460> mode<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
where you can change from mode 1 mode to

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.139 
where you can change from mode 1 mode to
just<00:01:45.569> by<00:01:45.749> flipping<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.350> switch<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:47.969> found

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
just by flipping the switch so I found

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.010 
just by flipping the switch so I found
that<00:01:48.329> really<00:01:48.390> interesting<00:01:50.479> it<00:01:51.479> has<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.630> nice

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that really interesting it has a nice

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.620 
that really interesting it has a nice
backlit<00:01:52.859> display<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.270> yeah<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> guess

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
backlit display and so yeah I guess

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.950 
backlit display and so yeah I guess
that's<00:01:57.899> about<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.619> transmitter<00:01:59.960> this

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
that's about it for the transmitter this

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.760 
that's about it for the transmitter this
is<00:02:01.319> a<00:02:01.799> little<00:02:02.549> bit<00:02:02.819> too<00:02:03.299> big<00:02:03.719> for<00:02:04.200> me<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.590> fly

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
is a little bit too big for me to fly

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.350 
is a little bit too big for me to fly
indoors<00:02:06.049> my<00:02:07.049> tried<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.920> fly<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.789> kitchen

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
indoors my tried to fly it in my kitchen

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.670 
indoors my tried to fly it in my kitchen
and<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.229> already<00:02:10.530> managed<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.370> break<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.680> tail

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and I already managed to break the tail

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.860 
and I already managed to break the tail
boom<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.180> kind<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.420> got<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.690> taped

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
boom and so I just kind of got it taped

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.090 
boom and so I just kind of got it taped
together<00:02:16.050> for<00:02:16.440> now<00:02:16.560> I'm<00:02:16.710> going<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.950> have<00:02:17.040> to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
together for now I'm going to have to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.520 
together for now I'm going to have to
replace<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.990> i<00:02:19.260> also<00:02:19.440> broke<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
replace that and i also broke the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.590 
replace that and i also broke the
landing<00:02:20.890> gear<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.160> little<00:02:21.250> bit<00:02:21.610> but<00:02:21.880> just<00:02:22.270> super

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
landing gear a little bit but just super

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.710 
landing gear a little bit but just super
glue<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.930> back<00:02:23.230> together<00:02:23.560> no<00:02:23.800> big<00:02:23.980> deal<00:02:24.720> easy

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
glue that back together no big deal easy

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.809 
glue that back together no big deal easy
fix<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.560> landing<00:02:26.890> gear<00:02:27.100> I'm<00:02:27.340> not<00:02:27.550> sure

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
fix on the landing gear I'm not sure

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.330 
fix on the landing gear I'm not sure
about<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.270> tail<00:02:28.510> so<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:28.990> have<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.319> look<00:02:30.160> into

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
about the tail so I have to look into

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.430 
about the tail so I have to look into
that<00:02:30.459> maybe<00:02:30.880> i'll<00:02:31.090> make<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.330> video<00:02:31.569> about<00:02:31.900> how<00:02:32.410> i

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
that maybe i'll make a video about how i

from<00:03:19.810> heli-max<00:03:20.880> outside<00:03:22.230> got<00:03:23.230> about<00:03:24.239> three<00:03:25.239> or

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
from heli-max outside got about three or

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.210 
from heli-max outside got about three or
four<00:03:25.420> mile<00:03:25.750> an<00:03:25.900> hour<00:03:25.989> winds<00:03:26.350> they<00:03:26.590> say<00:03:26.860> today

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
four mile an hour winds they say today

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.910 
four mile an hour winds they say today
so<00:03:27.610> we'll<00:03:28.360> see<00:03:28.540> if<00:03:28.570> I<00:03:28.780> can<00:03:28.989> hover<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.620> here

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
so we'll see if I can hover it here

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.030 
so we'll see if I can hover it here
outdoors<00:03:30.400> at<00:03:30.700> all<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:31.230> got<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.380> broken<00:03:32.769> tail

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
outdoors at all I got the broken tail

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.130 
outdoors at all I got the broken tail

boom on it still and the chipped blade

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.860 
boom on it still and the chipped blade
so<00:03:35.860> I'm<00:03:36.400> not<00:03:36.579> really<00:03:36.760> sure<00:03:36.940> how<00:03:37.450> much<00:03:37.600> that's

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
so I'm not really sure how much that's

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.210 
so I'm not really sure how much that's
going<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.140> affect<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.500> flight<00:03:38.769> but<00:03:39.239> we'll<00:03:40.239> see

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
going to affect the flight but we'll see

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.560 
going to affect the flight but we'll see

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
looks like I got a pretty decent breeze

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.420 
looks like I got a pretty decent breeze
it's<00:03:43.900> blowing<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.440> propeller<00:03:44.829> on<00:03:45.070> its<00:03:45.250> own

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
it's blowing the propeller on its own

00:03:45.430 --> 00:04:09.720 
it's blowing the propeller on its own
we'll<00:03:46.329> see<00:03:46.540> what<00:03:46.720> happens

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.449 

click<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.569> tails<00:04:11.050> hold<00:04:11.500> indecent<00:04:12.159> with<00:04:12.310> the

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.170

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
a little touchy with the throttle got to

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.689 
a little touchy with the throttle got to
get<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.270> feel<00:04:29.600> for<00:04:29.840> that<00:04:30.970> pretty<00:04:31.970> nice<00:04:33.699> handle

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699
