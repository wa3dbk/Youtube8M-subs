what<00:00:20.340> worries<00:00:20.550> me<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> type<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.300> motor

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
what worries me it's the type of motor

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.939 
what worries me it's the type of motor
it<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.990> how<00:00:22.080> low<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.320> isn't<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.680> ground

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
it is and how low it isn't the ground

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.859 
it is and how low it isn't the ground
because<00:00:23.369> they<00:00:23.609> seem<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.910> suck<00:00:24.300> up<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.600> lot<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
because they seem to suck up a lot of

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.290 
because they seem to suck up a lot of
water<00:00:25.099> with<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> power<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.820> even<00:00:27.210> just

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
water with the power and even just

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.120 
water with the power and even just
moisture<00:00:27.750> off<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.050> grass<00:00:28.289> it'll<00:00:28.680> suck<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> up

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
moisture off the grass it'll suck it up

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.609 
moisture off the grass it'll suck it up
and<00:00:29.390> ruin<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.570> I'm<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> little<00:00:31.170> bit<00:00:31.320> worried

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
let's get to the inflating process but I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.490 
let's get to the inflating process but I
already<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.040> tip<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.489> series<00:00:41.820> motor

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
already have this tip a series motor

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.729 
already have this tip a series motor
through<00:00:43.500> there<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.010> bin<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.940> parts<00:00:45.739> so

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739

through there and that bin of parts so
I'm<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:46.920> afraid<00:00:47.039> if<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> blows<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.120> just

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
than my old one it's the fact that the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.770 
than my old one it's the fact that the
arms<00:01:39.429> can<00:01:39.640> move<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:40.149> it<00:01:40.330> doesn't<00:01:40.690> really

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
arms can move and it doesn't really

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.440 
arms can move and it doesn't really
affect<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.470> whole<00:01:41.679> Nativity<00:01:42.280> like<00:01:43.179> I<00:01:43.300> can

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
affect the whole Nativity like I can

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.020 
affect the whole Nativity like I can
position<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.990> arch<00:01:44.140> wherever<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:44.679> want<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:45.940> it

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
position the arch wherever I want and it

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.760

doesn't bother the whole Nativity and
that's<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.700> fact<00:01:48.940> of<00:01:49.119> that<00:01:49.360> these<00:01:49.750> aren't

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
that's the fact of that these aren't

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.889 
that's the fact of that these aren't
actually<00:01:50.440> stitch<00:01:50.740> down<00:01:51.069> like<00:01:51.750> animals<00:01:52.750> or

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
would be attached on his side and he can

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.070 
would be attached on his side and he can
like<00:01:57.460> stay<00:01:57.729> it<00:01:58.000> could<00:01:58.179> fall<00:01:58.390> off<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.810> actual

old one but this one they fixed that

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.530 
old one but this one they fixed that
problem<00:02:04.899> by<00:02:05.350> putting<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.310> feet<00:02:06.579> of<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.210> just

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540

problem by putting the feet of the just
making<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.019> holes<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.739> actual<00:02:09.040> inflation

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
making the holes the actual inflation

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.690 
making the holes the actual inflation
ports<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.410> or<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.799> can't<00:02:12.340> go<00:02:12.489> anywhere

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
ports and or and it can't go anywhere

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.060 
ports and or and it can't go anywhere
just<00:02:13.030> solemnly<00:02:13.780> attached<00:02:14.079> to<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.410> this

others than the other one but like I
said<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.410> arch<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.860> better<00:02:23.100> mean<00:02:23.400> even<00:02:24.300> though

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
said the arch is better mean even though

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.210 
said the arch is better mean even though
it's<00:02:24.420> smaller<00:02:25.070> like<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:26.100> all<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.820> arch<00:02:26.970> was

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
it's smaller like this all the arch was

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.430 
it's smaller like this all the arch was
so<00:02:29.220> yeah<00:02:29.370> great<00:02:30.000> item<00:02:30.390> all<00:02:30.570> along<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.200> there's

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
the inflation video and we'll show you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.700 
the inflation video and we'll show you
how<00:02:33.150> quickly<00:02:33.450> deeply<00:02:33.990> or<00:02:34.230> quick<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.620> then

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
three two one that goes inflates really

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.480 
three two one that goes inflates really
quick<00:02:48.390> or<00:02:48.630> deeply<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.320> really<00:02:49.830> quick<00:02:51.380> yeah

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.800 
quick or deeply and really quick yeah
that<00:02:53.490> was<00:02:53.610> pretty<00:02:53.820> fast<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.360> pretty<00:02:54.570> much

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
that was pretty fast and pretty much

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.750 
that was pretty fast and pretty much
that's<00:02:55.020> how<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.170> found<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.709> when<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:55.950> started<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
that's how I found it when I started the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.880 
that's how I found it when I started the
video<00:02:56.900> it'll<00:02:57.900> deflate<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.380> little<00:02:58.590> bit<00:02:58.709> more

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
video it'll deflate a little bit more

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.670 
video it'll deflate a little bit more
maybe<00:02:59.220> more<00:02:59.340> at<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.000> night<00:03:00.180> but<00:03:00.510> in<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.500> night

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
maybe more at the night but in the night

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.800 
maybe more at the night but in the night
but<00:03:01.950> other<00:03:02.760> than<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:02.940> that's<00:03:03.209> about<00:03:03.450> as<00:03:03.660> good

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
but other than that that's about as good

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.360 
but other than that that's about as good
as<00:03:03.959> it's<00:03:04.080> gonna<00:03:04.140> get<00:03:04.380> for<00:03:04.440> deflation<00:03:05.190> and

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
as it's gonna get for deflation and

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.310 
as it's gonna get for deflation and
inflation<00:03:05.970> oh<00:03:06.180> yeah

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
inflation oh yeah

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.140 
inflation oh yeah
motor<00:03:07.890> temperature<00:03:08.459> for<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> brand<00:03:08.940> new<00:03:09.120> I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
motor temperature for a brand new I

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.730 
motor temperature for a brand new I
don't<00:03:09.300> really<00:03:09.510> like<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.959> don't<00:03:10.350> really<00:03:10.500> like

don't really like I don't really like
that<00:03:10.770> one<00:03:10.920> these<00:03:11.130> matters<00:03:11.490> too<00:03:11.610> hard<00:03:11.820> when<00:03:11.940> I

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
that one these matters too hard when I

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.640 
that one these matters too hard when I
first<00:03:12.240> get<00:03:12.450> them<00:03:13.070> motor<00:03:14.070> temperature<00:03:14.580> warm

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
first get them motor temperature warm

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.840 
first get them motor temperature warm
let's<00:03:16.650> meet<00:03:16.800> another<00:03:16.890> brushes<00:03:17.520> or<00:03:17.670> just

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.240 

hear<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.790> sound<00:03:38.790> again<00:03:39.950> like<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> jingle

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
hear that sound again like a jingle

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.340 
hear that sound again like a jingle
that's<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.910> brushes<00:03:42.390> and<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.630> motor<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.260> I'm

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
that's the brushes and the motor so I'm

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.660 
that's the brushes and the motor so I'm
hoping<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.710> it's<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.160> other<00:03:44.340> sound<00:03:44.520> that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
hoping that it's the other sound that

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.190 
hoping that it's the other sound that
worries<00:03:44.910> me<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.090> hopefully<00:03:45.870> nothing<00:03:46.020> goes

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
worries me that hopefully nothing goes

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.470 
worries me that hopefully nothing goes
wrong<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.770> it's<00:03:47.100> all<00:03:47.190> Enoch<00:03:47.520> but<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:48.330> know
