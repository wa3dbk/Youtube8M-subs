anything and this one does quite a bit
and<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:31.530> matches<00:01:31.799> me<00:01:32.130> perfectly<00:01:32.579> when<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> put

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it on and then not even an hour later

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.679 
it on and then not even an hour later
it's<00:01:35.189> very<00:01:36.259> dark<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:38.130> gets<00:01:38.310> some<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:39.060> little

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it's very dark and it gets some a little

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.050 
it's very dark and it gets some a little
bit<00:01:39.780> more<00:01:39.869> yellowy<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.439> my<00:01:40.590> skin<00:01:40.860> too<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.340> I'm

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
bit more yellowy on my skin too so I'm

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.810 
bit more yellowy on my skin too so I'm
just<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.659> really<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.530> fan<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.310> one<00:01:44.490> at<00:01:44.790> all

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
just not really a fan of this one at all

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.490 
just not really a fan of this one at all
and<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.270> believe<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.049> either<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and I believe this is either the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.620 
and I believe this is either the
lightest<00:01:47.040> shade<00:01:47.130> or<00:01:47.430> these<00:01:47.670> second<00:01:48.299> lightest

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
lightest shade or these second lightest

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.050 
lightest shade or these second lightest
or<00:01:48.780> something<00:01:49.110> means<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.860> light<00:01:50.850> in

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
or something means I get pretty light in

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.340 
or something means I get pretty light in

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
really conceal those under eye circles

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.370 
really conceal those under eye circles
and<00:02:49.170> these<00:02:49.740> do<00:02:50.130> not<00:02:50.160> do<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.640> for<00:02:50.880> me<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.180> as<00:02:52.110> I

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
and these do not do it for me I as I

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.260 
and these do not do it for me I as I
said<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.620> originally<00:02:52.890> started<00:02:53.250> off<00:02:53.820> using<00:02:53.850> the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
said I originally started off using the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.960 
said I originally started off using the
lightest<00:02:54.660> one<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.680> really<00:02:56.250> does<00:02:56.520> brighten

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
lightest one and it really does brighten

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.570 
lightest one and it really does brighten
but<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.780> does<00:02:58.020> not<00:02:58.230> cover<00:02:58.650> up<00:02:58.830> any<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> dark

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
but it does not cover up any of the dark

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.450 
but it does not cover up any of the dark
circles<00:02:59.820> so<00:03:00.360> then<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.380> started<00:03:01.440> mixing<00:03:02.100> in<00:03:02.370> a

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
circles so then I started mixing in a

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.400 
circles so then I started mixing in a
little<00:03:02.760> bit<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.270> darker<00:03:03.720> one<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.110> kind<00:03:04.320> of

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
little bit of the darker one and kind of

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.290 
little bit of the darker one and kind of
putting<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.800> where<00:03:05.190> exactly<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.910> outline<00:03:06.270> of

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
putting it where exactly the outline of

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.620 
putting it where exactly the outline of
the<00:03:06.780> under<00:03:07.080> eye<00:03:07.110> bag<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.740> and<00:03:08.330> then<00:03:09.330> putting

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
the under eye bag is and then putting

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.370 
the under eye bag is and then putting
this<00:03:09.900> one<00:03:10.140> more<00:03:10.590> towards<00:03:10.950> my<00:03:11.070> actual<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.730> but

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
this one more towards my actual I but

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.020

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
either way even doing that it just did

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.000 
either way even doing that it just did
not<00:03:15.060> cover<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.570> my<00:03:15.810> under<00:03:16.080> eye<00:03:16.110> or<00:03:16.470> along<00:03:16.860> with
