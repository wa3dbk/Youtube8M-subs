screwdriver to be able to make that
change<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.760> course<00:00:53.820> our<00:00:54.410> helicopter<00:00:55.410> here

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
change and of course our helicopter here

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.840 
change and of course our helicopter here
is<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> closer<00:00:56.039> look<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.390> so32<00:00:58.430> and<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.699> does

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
is a closer look at the so32 and it does

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.920 
is a closer look at the so32 and it does
come<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> antenna<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.719> wrapped

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
come with the antenna kind of wrapped

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.900 
come with the antenna kind of wrapped
around<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.379> bottom<00:01:01.680> there<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.730> Anna

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
around the bottom there I think Anna

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.789 
around the bottom there I think Anna
just<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:04.260> got<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.710> off

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
just to get out it's got the on and off

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.100 
just to get out it's got the on and off
switch<00:01:04.860> right<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.990> but

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
switch right and you can see it but

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
switch right and you can see it but
there<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.369> build<00:01:08.610> quality<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:09.119> this

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
there it is the build quality on this

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.390 
there it is the build quality on this
looks<00:01:09.570> pretty<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.400> substantially

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
looks pretty good and substantially

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.600 
looks pretty good and substantially
bigger<00:01:11.700> than<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.920> s107<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.070> was<00:01:14.280> flying

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
bigger than the s107 that I was flying

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.289 
bigger than the s107 that I was flying
before<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:16.640> let's<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.850> kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
before this one let's just kind of do it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.200 
before this one let's just kind of do it
360<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:20.420> we<00:01:21.420> will<00:01:21.630> do<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> quick<00:01:21.810> zoom<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
360 here we will do a quick zoom so that

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.980 
360 here we will do a quick zoom so that
is<00:01:24.479> everything<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.439> comes<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> box

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
is everything that comes in the box

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.140 
is everything that comes in the box
there's<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.080> helicopter<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:30.000> my

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
there's a helicopter and I do have my

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.560 
there's a helicopter and I do have my
previous<00:01:30.740> s107<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.880> comparison

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
previous s107 here just for comparison

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.679 
previous s107 here just for comparison
and<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.259> seems<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.829> about<00:01:35.310> twice<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> size

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and it seems to be about twice the size

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.580 
and it seems to be about twice the size
as<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:37.970> so<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:40.049> know<00:01:40.140> quite<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
as you can see so it is you know quite a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.889 
as you can see so it is you know quite a
bit<00:01:40.710> bigger<00:01:41.100> even<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.630> how<00:01:42.720> much

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
bit bigger even you can see how much

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.889 
bit bigger even you can see how much
longer<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.560> how<00:01:43.649> much<00:01:43.770> taller<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> it's

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
longer and how much taller it is so it's

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.260 
longer and how much taller it is so it's
it's<00:01:46.170> quite<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> bit<00:01:46.860> bigger<00:01:47.040> helicopter<00:01:47.729> so

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it's quite a bit bigger helicopter so

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.780 
it's quite a bit bigger helicopter so
again<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.880> so32<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.689> 107<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:53.670> it's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
again the so32 and then the 107 so it's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
again the so32 and then the 107 so it's
quite<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.970> bit<00:01:54.119> bigger<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.540> will<00:01:54.930> post<00:01:55.140> another

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
quite a bit bigger I will post another

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.069 
quite a bit bigger I will post another
video<00:01:55.649> once<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.219> get<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.759> charged<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.630> start

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
video once I get it charged up and start

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.649 
video once I get it charged up and start
