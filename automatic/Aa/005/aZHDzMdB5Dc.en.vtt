what's<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:01.010> craziest<00:02:01.550> way<00:02:01.910> you've<00:02:02.510> seen<00:02:02.750> a

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
what's the craziest way you've seen a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.870 
what's the craziest way you've seen a
team<00:02:03.110> defend<00:02:03.680> you<00:02:03.800> this<00:02:04.010> season<00:02:04.220> considering

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
team defend you this season considering

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.030 
team defend you this season considering
they<00:02:04.970> know<00:02:05.150> what<00:02:05.690> you<00:02:05.840> can<00:02:06.020> do<00:02:06.200> scoring

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
they know what you can do scoring

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.970 
they know what you can do scoring
passing<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.119> rebounding<00:02:11.829> sometimes<00:02:12.829> they

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
passing and rebounding sometimes they

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.770 
passing and rebounding sometimes they
try<00:02:13.040> putting<00:02:13.519> like<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> bigger<00:02:14.030> gar

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
try putting like a bigger gar

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.070 
try putting like a bigger gar
guard<00:02:15.020> on<00:02:15.170> me<00:02:15.380> someone<00:02:16.100> even<00:02:16.370> bigger<00:02:16.580> than<00:02:16.850> me

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
guard on me someone even bigger than me

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.970 
guard on me someone even bigger than me
so<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.110> think<00:02:18.230> that's<00:02:18.530> kind<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.770> been<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
so I think that's kind of been the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.860 
so I think that's kind of been the
craziest<00:02:19.220> thing<00:02:19.610> they<00:02:19.790> put<00:02:19.940> like<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.209> six<00:02:20.569> seven

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
craziest thing they put like a six seven

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.220 
craziest thing they put like a six seven
guy<00:02:21.020> on<00:02:21.200> me<00:02:22.120> st.<00:02:23.120> Mary's<00:02:23.420> try<00:02:23.630> doing<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.020> last

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
guy on me st. Mary's try doing that last

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.780 
guy on me st. Mary's try doing that last
game<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.800> I'd<00:02:24.950> say<00:02:25.160> that's<00:02:25.340> probably<00:02:25.490> the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
game so I'd say that's probably the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.820 
game so I'd say that's probably the
craziest<00:02:26.060> defense<00:02:26.690> I've<00:02:26.959> seen<00:02:27.319> so<00:02:27.500> far<00:02:27.530> this

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
craziest defense I've seen so far this

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.920 
craziest defense I've seen so far this
year<00:02:28.180> teams<00:02:29.180> need<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.360> get<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> little<00:02:29.720> more

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
year teams need to get a little more

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.690 
year teams need to get a little more
crazy<00:02:30.170> because<00:02:30.410> that's<00:02:30.620> obviously<00:02:30.770> not

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
crazy because that's obviously not

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.660 
crazy because that's obviously not
