00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
building and you know that's that's melt

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.990 
building and you know that's that's melt
down<00:02:30.019> to<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.230> really<00:02:30.560> unique<00:02:30.800> mat<00:02:31.340> because<00:02:31.610> it's

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
down to a really unique mat because it's

down to a really unique mat because it's
very<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:32.810> pretty<00:02:32.870> symmetrical<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.680> know<00:02:33.769> on

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
very it's pretty symmetrical you know on

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.009 
very it's pretty symmetrical you know on
both<00:02:34.130> sides<00:02:34.459> there's<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.120> building<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.900> then

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
both sides there's a building and then

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.839 
both sides there's a building and then
they<00:02:36.200> goes<00:02:36.530> further<00:02:36.980> back<00:02:37.310> into<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.640> spawn

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
they goes further back into the spawn

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.520 
they goes further back into the spawn
past<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.239> building<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:39.140> can<00:02:39.260> go<00:02:39.349> right

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
past that building and you can go right

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.630 
past that building and you can go right
through<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.830> bills<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.250> guys<00:02:40.370> know<00:02:40.519> how

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
through the bills and you guys know how

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.000 
through the bills and you guys know how
it<00:02:40.730> works<00:02:40.970> um<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.470> know<00:02:42.530> on<00:02:42.650> both<00:02:42.769> sides

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
it works um and you know on both sides

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.380 
it works um and you know on both sides
you<00:02:43.099> can<00:02:43.160> hold<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.400> building<00:02:43.849> down<00:02:43.879> and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
you can hold that building down and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.570 
you can hold that building down and
really<00:02:45.380> know<00:02:45.590> they're<00:02:45.769> building<00:02:46.220> there's<00:02:46.400> a

score<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:11.150> think<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.510> like<00:04:11.630> two<00:04:11.840> deaths<00:04:12.049> or

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
score I think it like two deaths or

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.270 
score I think it like two deaths or
three<00:04:12.410> deaths<00:04:12.590> or<00:04:12.709> something<00:04:12.919> like<00:04:12.980> that<00:04:13.040> on

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
three deaths or something like that on

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.379 
three deaths or something like that on
meltdown<00:04:13.730> um<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:16.250> didn't<00:04:16.639> save<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:17.060> didn't

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
meltdown um and it didn't save it didn't

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.150 
meltdown um and it didn't save it didn't
fully<00:04:17.599> save<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.260> this<00:04:18.560> is<00:04:18.709> what<00:04:18.829> happened

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
fully save and this is what happened

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.810 
fully save and this is what happened
it's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
it's

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.460 
it's
I<00:04:20.120> think<00:04:20.420> I<00:04:20.570> think<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:20.840> was<00:04:20.930> like<00:04:21.050> seven

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
I think I think it was like seven

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.890 
I think I think it was like seven
minutes<00:04:21.740> and<00:04:21.890> seven<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.820> half<00:04:22.850> minutes<00:04:23.360> even

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
minutes and seven a half minutes even

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.520 
minutes and seven a half minutes even
it's<00:04:24.050> something<00:04:24.260> like<00:04:24.290> that<00:04:24.530> um<00:04:25.340> and<00:04:25.580> he<00:04:25.820> was

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
it's something like that um and he was

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.960 
it's something like that um and he was
179<00:04:27.530> or<00:04:28.540> 177<00:04:29.540> to<00:04:30.170> one<00:04:30.470> I<00:04:30.500> believe<00:04:30.830> with<00:04:31.670> three

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
179 or 177 to one I believe with three

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.240 
179 or 177 to one I believe with three
minutes<00:04:32.120> left<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:32.900> was<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.110> fool<00:04:33.590> party<00:04:34.070> um

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
minutes left and it was a fool party um

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.020 
minutes left and it was a fool party um
so<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.600> think<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.960> tags<00:04:36.200> were<00:04:36.410> at<00:04:36.530> like<00:04:36.790> 65<00:04:37.790> or

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
so I think the tags were at like 65 or

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.330 
so I think the tags were at like 65 or
something<00:04:38.420> so<00:04:39.020> you<00:04:39.080> know<00:04:39.410> it's<00:04:39.710> it's<00:04:39.980> pretty

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
something so you know it's it's pretty

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.220 
something so you know it's it's pretty
obvious<00:04:40.850> that<00:04:40.880> he<00:04:41.210> could<00:04:41.360> easily<00:04:41.840> have<00:04:41.960> gotten

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
obvious that he could easily have gotten

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.460 
obvious that he could easily have gotten
the<00:04:42.320> 250<00:04:42.920> um<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.900> know<00:04:44.990> with<00:04:45.140> the<00:04:45.170> time

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
the 250 um you know with the time

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.350 
the 250 um you know with the time
remaining<00:04:45.770> especially<00:04:46.460> with<00:04:46.610> a<00:04:46.640> full<00:04:47.000> party

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
remaining especially with a full party

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.460 
remaining especially with a full party
you<00:04:47.510> know<00:04:47.630> you<00:04:47.720> could<00:04:47.870> just<00:04:47.930> tell<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.200> party

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
you know you could just tell the party

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.960 
you know you could just tell the party
not<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.650> pick<00:04:48.860> up<00:04:48.980> tags<00:04:49.220> obviously<00:04:49.760> if<00:04:49.820> he's

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
not to pick up tags obviously if he's

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.940 
not to pick up tags obviously if he's
running<00:04:50.240> spawns<00:04:50.510> he<00:04:51.200> wouldn't<00:04:51.440> pick<00:04:51.590> up<00:04:51.620> tag

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
running spawns he wouldn't pick up tag

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.470 
running spawns he wouldn't pick up tag
so<00:04:52.160> he<00:04:52.250> could<00:04:52.370> easily<00:04:52.580> be<00:04:52.910> able<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.150> pick<00:04:53.300> off

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
so he could easily be able to pick off

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.090 
so he could easily be able to pick off
that<00:04:53.630> 250<00:04:54.260> plus<00:04:54.440> with<00:04:54.590> three<00:04:54.920> minutes

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
that 250 plus with three minutes

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.580 
that 250 plus with three minutes
remaining<00:04:55.550> at<00:04:55.880> a<00:04:55.940> hundred<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:56.900> seventy<00:04:57.320> kills

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
remaining at a hundred and seventy kills

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.280 
remaining at a hundred and seventy kills
um<00:04:58.430> but<00:04:58.640> unfortunately<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.450> didn't<00:04:59.720> save<00:04:59.990> so

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
um but unfortunately it didn't save so

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.110
