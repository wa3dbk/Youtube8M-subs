00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.470
 blocked game invitations in 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.360
 facebook in this guide we can see how 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.180
 block requests to games of 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.160
 facebook in it we see the different 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.019
 windows that are normally shown to us 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.659
 when blocking invitations to 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.520
 games while we watch the steps and 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.409
 different screens that we must pass 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.380
 by blocking these annoying requests 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.720
 I want to make some notes we should 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.670
 bear in mind that in some cases the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.710
 invitations to games are generated 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.160
 automatically by these same for 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.930
 attract more participants now well 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.460
 a friend sends you an invitation to a 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.289
 game is likely another friend in 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.810
 Common send you another invitation again 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.580
 of the same game for all this is useless 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 put messages so they do not send us 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.020
 you are annoying requests 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.490
 these same blocking steps will serve 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.470
 with games and any other 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.020

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.610
