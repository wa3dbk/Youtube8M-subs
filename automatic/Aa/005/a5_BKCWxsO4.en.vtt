especially<00:02:51.020> if<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.470> Falcons<00:02:51.980> do<00:02:52.280> play<00:02:52.700> their

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
especially if the Falcons do play their

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.360 
especially if the Falcons do play their
starters<00:02:53.530> really<00:02:54.530> leaning<00:02:54.740> if<00:02:54.920> anything

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370

towards going to the Falcons and the
over<00:02:57.320> early<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.950> don't<00:02:58.280> think<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.520> Falcons

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
over early I don't think the Falcons

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.460 
over early I don't think the Falcons
will<00:02:59.030> play<00:02:59.150> their<00:02:59.300> starters<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.870> entire<00:03:00.170> game

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
will play their starters the entire game

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.230 
will play their starters the entire game
but<00:03:00.530> remember<00:03:01.130> there<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.790> something

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
confidence at all and keep in mind that

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.590 
confidence at all and keep in mind that
when<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.340> Falcons<00:03:43.790> even<00:03:43.970> if<00:03:44.030> they<00:03:44.150> do<00:03:44.209> go<00:03:44.540> to

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
when the Falcons even if they do go to

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.830 
when the Falcons even if they do go to
their<00:03:44.780> backups<00:03:45.290> a<00:03:45.500> motion<00:03:46.459> short<00:03:47.180> term<00:03:47.450> short

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
their backups a motion short term short

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.229 
their backups a motion short term short
term<00:03:47.959> emotion<00:03:48.890> can<00:03:49.040> override<00:03:49.610> talent<00:03:50.120> so

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
term emotion can override talent so

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.610 
term emotion can override talent so
their<00:03:50.390> backups<00:03:50.840> know<00:03:50.989> this<00:03:51.260> is<00:03:51.410> their<00:03:51.590> chance

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
their backups know this is their chance

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.580 
their backups know this is their chance
to<00:03:52.400> prove<00:03:52.670> themselves<00:03:52.700> maybe<00:03:53.510> get<00:03:53.930> some<00:03:54.200> some

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
to prove themselves maybe get some some

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.190 
to prove themselves maybe get some some
time<00:03:55.100> in<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.370> playoffs<00:03:55.489> oh<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.120> can<00:03:56.720> see<00:03:56.989> we're

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
time in the playoffs oh I can see we're

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.630 
time in the playoffs oh I can see we're
even<00:03:57.440> when<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.680> Falcons<00:03:58.100> do<00:03:58.280> go<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.489> their

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
even when the Falcons do go to their

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.100 
even when the Falcons do go to their
backup<00:03:59.000> so<00:03:59.150> probably<00:03:59.510> treat<00:03:59.720> it<00:03:59.810> more<00:03:59.840> like<00:04:00.080> a

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
backup so probably treat it more like a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.870 
backup so probably treat it more like a
preseason<00:04:00.650> game<00:04:00.860> with<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.340> starters<00:04:01.700> might

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
preseason game with the starters might

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.940 
preseason game with the starters might
play<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.390> quarter<00:04:03.080> and<00:04:03.200> then<00:04:03.290> another<00:04:03.500> snap

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
play a quarter and then another snap

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.220 
play a quarter and then another snap
maybe<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.400> half<00:04:04.790> at<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:04.970> absolute<00:04:05.480> most<00:04:05.690> but

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
maybe a half at the absolute most but

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.050 
maybe a half at the absolute most but
when<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.410> backups<00:04:06.920> come<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.489> they<00:04:07.640> know<00:04:07.850> this

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
when the backups come and they know this

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.690 
when the backups come and they know this
is<00:04:08.209> going<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.540> be<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.840> big<00:04:09.019> chance<00:04:09.350> oh<00:04:09.620> I<00:04:09.920> like

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
is going to be the big chance oh I like

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.060 
is going to be the big chance oh I like
the<00:04:10.850> idea<00:04:11.000> fading<00:04:11.870> Tampa<00:04:12.320> Bay<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:12.860> more

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
the idea fading Tampa Bay this is more

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.620 
the idea fading Tampa Bay this is more

tampa bay so i would go against tampa
bay<00:05:23.720> probably<00:05:24.590> in<00:05:24.890> just<00:05:25.310> about<00:05:25.520> any<00:05:25.820> situation

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
you might be able to get a very

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.280 
you might be able to get a very
beneficial<00:05:37.880> line<00:05:38.390> and<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.750> half<00:05:38.900> time<00:05:39.110> line

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
beneficial line and a half time line

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.990 
beneficial line and a half time line
that's<00:05:39.500> what<00:05:39.620> I<00:05:39.680> mean<00:05:39.800> or<00:05:40.010> take<00:05:40.220> Atlanta<00:05:40.910> in

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
that's what I mean or take Atlanta in

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.160 
that's what I mean or take Atlanta in
the<00:05:41.090> first<00:05:41.300> half<00:05:41.450> maybe<00:05:41.690> better<00:05:41.900> in<00:05:42.020> both

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
the first half maybe better in both

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.370 
the first half maybe better in both
halves<00:05:42.440> great<00:05:43.010> preview
