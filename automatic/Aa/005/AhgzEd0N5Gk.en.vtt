00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.430
 I grew up in Poland and mine 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.170
 Parents have a big one early on 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.130
 value on the foreign languages ​​already laid 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.680
 at seven I have German 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.210
 started intervening later that was 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.099
 always self-evident that two 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.810
 speak foreign languages ​​and for that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.810
 I am very grateful to my parents today 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.510
 i have bwl at a very good uni in 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.190
 studied bayreuth and afterwards as well 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.020
 many of my fellow students I am in 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.700
 I ended up with a business consultancy 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.710
 I quickly realized that is not mine 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.510
 world 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.640
 I can not just be official everyone 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.460
 day at the customer for weeks 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.210
 push powerpoint 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.170
 I did not want to move on 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.540
 restrict 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.739
 I wanted to discover the world therefore 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.739
 I traveled around the world for a year 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.000
 I do not need the challenge 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.290
 myself always at different new ones 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.290
 to adapt to situations 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.900
 I'm not a vain and still two 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.530
 years I did not know drum 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.530
 Master is 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.870
 I still have the job as a trust 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.500
 get me and then the necessary skills 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.910
 self-appropriated 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.470
 scrum is a software development 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.500
 method from the criticism 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.910
 project management has grown 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.950
 In this method, it is assumed 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.830
 that you do not plan everything in advance 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.730
 That's why you give that 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.160
 decision- making authority to the experts 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.410
 It is a development method that the 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.730
 teams outraged and those who give power 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.730
 make your own decisions 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.490
 the teams have a scrum master the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.780
 Just me one person against all 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.780
 clearing up problems away 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.549
 I look after an internal team in place 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.979
 berlin and three external teams in breslau 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.569
 I speak Polish German English 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.750
 and I am still Russian 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.750
 to learn 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.990
 my teams in the main reason why i 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.580
 really like going to work 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.140
 there are so many cool people that 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.370
 one likes to stay at work after work 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.370
 bringing churches together 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.020
 i like two things after work 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.910
 to come home and say human today 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.650
 I did something and I like it 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.370
 if we give my team a real job 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.370
 on the way there 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.290
 I stand up to great challenges 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.190
 It can be a long time 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.540
 but I want that 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.640
 It's like marathon running 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.500
 you bet they move and whether he 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.010
 achieved or not is all in one 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.470
 head thing 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.299
 It's not a fight with yourself 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.299
 give up but to go forward 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.060
 i am petra kupczyk and i am scrum 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.060
