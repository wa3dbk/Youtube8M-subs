or<00:00:20.910> assault<00:00:21.240> rifles<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:22.020> game<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.500> use<00:00:22.800> it

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
or assault rifles in this game I use it

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.849 
or assault rifles in this game I use it
all<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.130> time<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.330> find<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:25.140> extremely

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
all the time and I find it's extremely

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.519 
all the time and I find it's extremely
effective<00:00:26.430> at<00:00:27.119> medium<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.779> long<00:00:27.960> range<00:00:28.260> if

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
effective at medium and long range if

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.679 
effective at medium and long range if
you're<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> good<00:00:28.949> shot<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.490> superb<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.420> it's

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
you're a good shot it's superb it's it's

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.220 
you're a good shot it's superb it's it's
arguably<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.289> best<00:00:31.439> assault<00:00:31.830> rifle<00:00:32.250> /<00:00:32.489> range

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
arguably the best assault rifle / range

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
arguably the best assault rifle / range
it's<00:00:34.230> only<00:00:34.469> detriment<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.880> short<00:00:36.149> range

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
it's only detriment is in short range

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.030 
it's only detriment is in short range
encounters<00:00:37.020> where<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.649> hipfire

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
encounters where you get in hipfire

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.350 
encounters where you get in hipfire
encounters<00:00:38.399> because<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> slow<00:00:39.059> fire<00:00:39.329> rate

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
encounters because of the slow fire rate

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.209 
encounters because of the slow fire rate
but<00:00:39.629> I'll<00:00:39.780> break<00:00:39.930> down<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.230> sim<00:00:40.440> fixed<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
but I'll break down the sim fixed at and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.920 
but I'll break down the sim fixed at and
everything<00:00:42.030> about<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> before<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> actually

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
everything about it before I actually

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.830 
everything about it before I actually
break<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> down<00:00:43.620> further<00:00:44.570> sim<00:00:45.570> think<00:00:45.750> of

break it down further sim think of
course<00:00:46.050> gives<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.350> these<00:00:46.500> stats<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.969> max

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.799 
course gives you these stats the max
damage<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> scar<00:00:49.590> age<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.920> 34

damage for this for the scar age is 34
which<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.930> by<00:00:52.110> far<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> highest<00:00:52.710> assault

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219

you're<00:01:05.670> still<00:01:05.939> out<00:01:06.060> putting<00:01:06.270> 25<00:01:06.780> damage

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
you're still out putting 25 damage

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.320 
you're still out putting 25 damage
around<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:07.860> four<00:01:08.189> shots<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.820> kill<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.060> guy

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
around that's four shots to kill a guy

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.410 
around that's four shots to kill a guy
that's<00:01:10.200> incredible<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.060> again<00:01:12.390> it's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
that's incredible and it's again it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.450 
that's incredible and it's again it's
three<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.960> four<00:01:13.110> shots<00:01:13.350> inside<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.950> close

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
three to four shots inside of close

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.280 
three to four shots inside of close

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
range to take a guy out as well so the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
range to take a guy out as well so the
damage<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.860> thing<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.189> by<00:01:17.549> far<00:01:17.820> its

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
damage on this thing is by far its

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.170 
damage on this thing is by far its
biggest<00:01:18.210> plus<00:01:19.040> its<00:01:20.040> detriment<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.729> course<00:01:21.000> is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
biggest plus its detriment of course is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.630 
biggest plus its detriment of course is
its<00:01:21.360> slow<00:01:21.630> fire<00:01:21.960> rate<00:01:22.009> 620<00:01:23.009> rounds<00:01:23.340> per<00:01:23.520> minute

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
its slow fire rate 620 rounds per minute

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.760 
its slow fire rate 620 rounds per minute
that's<00:01:24.060> puts<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> disadvantage<00:01:25.110> when<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that's puts it at a disadvantage when it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.260 
that's puts it at a disadvantage when it
comes<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.400> closer<00:01:27.240> range<00:01:27.630> encounters<00:01:28.110> we're

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
comes to closer range encounters we're

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.670 
comes to closer range encounters we're
facing<00:01:30.270> something<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> AEK<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
facing something like the AEK or the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.760 
facing something like the AEK or the
famas<00:01:32.009> which<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.579> at<00:01:32.970> or<00:01:33.420> pushing<00:01:33.990> 1,000

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
famas which are at or pushing 1,000

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.289 
famas which are at or pushing 1,000
rounds<00:01:34.860> per<00:01:35.159> minute<00:01:35.280> will<00:01:35.640> put<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.180> an

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
rounds per minute will put you at an

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.289 
rounds per minute will put you at an
extreme<00:01:36.659> disadvantage<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.150> most

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
extreme disadvantage but for the most

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.200 
extreme disadvantage but for the most
part<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:40.079> gun<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:41.250> that's<00:01:41.759> basically

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
part this gun is and as that's basically

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.030 
part this gun is and as that's basically
the<00:01:42.329> strength<00:01:42.659> I'm<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.290> medium

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the strength I'm going with this medium

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.319 
the strength I'm going with this medium
and<00:01:44.100> long-range<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.729> gun<00:01:44.909> will<00:01:45.090> outperform

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and long-range this gun will outperform

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.330 
and long-range this gun will outperform
just<00:01:45.750> about<00:01:45.899> any<00:01:46.170> other<00:01:46.290> assault<00:01:46.799> rifle<00:01:47.130> quite

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
just about any other assault rifle quite

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.910 
just about any other assault rifle quite
easily<00:01:47.780> but<00:01:48.780> at<00:01:48.930> short<00:01:49.170> range<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.560> are<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.860> a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
easily but at short range you are in a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.410 
easily but at short range you are in a
detriment<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:51.000> yourself<00:01:51.090> on

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
detriment so you want to put yourself on

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.319 
detriment so you want to put yourself on
the<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:51.720> ranges<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.770> success<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:54.210> other

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the right ranges for success the other

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.190 
the right ranges for success the other
detriment<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.229> well<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:56.180> it<00:01:57.180> fires<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.810> only

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
detriment to as well is it fires it only

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.950 
detriment to as well is it fires it only
has<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> 21<00:01:59.100> magazine<00:01:59.640> size<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.299> make<00:02:00.780> you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
has a 21 magazine size so you make you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.260 
has a 21 magazine size so you make you
but<00:02:01.380> again<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.040> makes<00:02:02.159> up<00:02:02.340> written<00:02:02.610> its<00:02:02.729> recoil

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
but again it makes up written its recoil

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.889 
but again it makes up written its recoil
or<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.200> reload<00:02:04.890> time<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:06.390> when<00:02:06.780> it's

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
or if it's reload time because when it's

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.109 
or if it's reload time because when it's
completely<00:02:07.350> empty<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.740> takes<00:02:07.950> 2.4<00:02:08.580> seconds<00:02:09.000> to

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
completely empty it takes 2.4 seconds to

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.999 
completely empty it takes 2.4 seconds to
reload<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:10.170> when<00:02:10.259> there's<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.500> round<00:02:10.709> left<00:02:10.860> in

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
reload but when there's a round left in

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.130 
reload but when there's a round left in
the<00:02:11.099> chamber<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.520> only<00:02:11.640> 1.9<00:02:12.209> seconds

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the chamber it's only 1.9 seconds

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.140 
the chamber it's only 1.9 seconds
so<00:02:13.290> as<00:02:13.410> much<00:02:13.560> as<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.830> magazine<00:02:14.250> size<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.790> small

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
so as much as the magazine size is small

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.059 
so as much as the magazine size is small
it<00:02:15.360> doesn't<00:02:15.390> take<00:02:15.960> long<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.290> reload<00:02:16.830> so

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
it doesn't take long to reload so

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.710 
it doesn't take long to reload so
there's<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.700> benefit<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.300> sort<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
there's the benefit and sort of the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.080 
there's the benefit and sort of the
makeup<00:02:19.050> point<00:02:19.319> for<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.730> just<00:02:20.910> for

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
makeup point for it and just for

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.350 
makeup point for it and just for
interest<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.480> does<00:02:21.630> fire<00:02:21.950> 7.62<00:02:22.950> x<00:02:23.940> 51

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
interest it does fire 7.62 x 51

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.880 
interest it does fire 7.62 x 51
millimeter<00:02:24.840> nato<00:02:25.110> round<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:25.770> that

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
millimeter nato round so it's that

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.030 
millimeter nato round so it's that
that's<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.130> large<00:02:26.310> round<00:02:26.840> if<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:28.440> notice<00:02:28.770> if

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
that's a large round if you notice if

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.190 
that's a large round if you notice if
you<00:02:29.310> notice<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.880> stat<00:02:30.240> here<00:02:30.630> though<00:02:30.840> that's

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
you notice the stat here though that's

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.530 
you notice the stat here though that's

equivalent of it in battlefield 4 at

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.650 
equivalent of it in battlefield 4 at
least<00:02:44.010> now<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.370> might<00:02:44.520> come<00:02:44.760> back<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> DLCs

least now it might come back to the DLCs
in<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> future<00:02:46.230> but<00:02:46.950> for<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.190> most<00:02:47.310> part<00:02:47.430> of

you if you enjoyed the g3a3 there is a
bit<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.850> difference<00:02:51.239> in<00:02:51.360> how<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.690> handles

that's<00:05:10.700> why<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.000> prefer<00:05:11.270> it<00:05:11.510> so<00:05:11.690> much<00:05:11.840> this<00:05:12.110> is

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
that's why I prefer it so much this is

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.250 
that's why I prefer it so much this is
why<00:05:12.440> this<00:05:12.500> gun<00:05:13.040> to<00:05:13.190> me<00:05:13.310> is<00:05:13.930> absolutely<00:05:14.930> one<00:05:15.230> of

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
why this gun to me is absolutely one of

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.260 
why this gun to me is absolutely one of
the<00:05:15.350> top<00:05:15.620> guns<00:05:15.890> in<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.370> game<00:05:16.580> especially<00:05:16.880> as

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
the top guns in the game especially as

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.200 
the top guns in the game especially as
an<00:05:17.360> assault<00:05:17.690> rifle<00:05:18.130> and<00:05:19.130> I<00:05:19.430> absolutely<00:05:20.000> plan

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
an assault rifle and I absolutely plan

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.720 
an assault rifle and I absolutely plan
on<00:05:20.390> using<00:05:20.630> it<00:05:20.840> in<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.080> future<00:05:21.410> and<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:22.370> think

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
on using it in the future and I think

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.220 
on using it in the future and I think
you<00:05:22.850> should<00:05:23.060> too<00:05:23.180> especially<00:05:23.210> if<00:05:23.750> you<00:05:23.870> if<00:05:24.140> you

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
you should too especially if you if you

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.290 
you should too especially if you if you
like<00:05:24.410> high<00:05:24.590> damage<00:05:24.860> outputs<00:05:25.400> with<00:05:25.820> a<00:05:25.850> straight

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
like high damage outputs with a straight

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.640 
like high damage outputs with a straight
vertical<00:05:26.540> recoil<00:05:26.990> with<00:05:27.440> the<00:05:27.530> right

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
vertical recoil with the right

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.190 
vertical recoil with the right
attachments<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:29.240> basically<00:05:29.690> just<00:05:29.930> staying

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
attachments and basically just staying

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.570 
attachments and basically just staying
in<00:05:30.380> medium<00:05:30.680> range<00:05:30.890> encounters<00:05:31.370> because

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
in medium range encounters because

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.860 
in medium range encounters because
you'll<00:05:31.730> notice<00:05:32.000> in<00:05:32.150> the<00:05:32.240> video<00:05:32.450> for<00:05:32.660> the<00:05:32.720> most

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
you'll notice in the video for the most

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.350 
you'll notice in the video for the most
part<00:05:33.110> I<00:05:33.350> choose<00:05:34.280> to<00:05:34.460> stay<00:05:34.669> in<00:05:34.820> medium<00:05:35.150> range

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
part I choose to stay in medium range

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.970 
part I choose to stay in medium range
encounters<00:05:35.840> cuz<00:05:36.020> that's<00:05:36.200> ripped<00:05:36.440> strength<00:05:36.770> is

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
encounters cuz that's ripped strength is

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.540 
encounters cuz that's ripped strength is
hope<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.120> enjoyed<00:05:38.360> the<00:05:38.390> review
