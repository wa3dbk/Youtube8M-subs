00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.060
 In addition, it is concerned about the environment and has worked 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.539
 costs for breads 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.319
 developed the burner to palette 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:19.749
 which is transforming electric and gas ovens and biomass ovens 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.809
 producing breads with excellent quality text 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.489
 the oven that is being shown in the video presents already installed burner 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.199
 on your right beam 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.280
 temperatures below the oven temperatures at 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.150
 gas 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.630
 with the production of bread loaves around 15 minutes far from the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.630
 opening of the door for supply until its withdrawal 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.380
 The heaters and burners equipment are new concept equipment but very 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.020
 simple in your publication 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.270
 are manufactured to use skins produced from vegetable biomass 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.150
 such as sawdust of sugar cane and other 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.290
 without addition of chemicals to the great advantage is the control that has 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.520
 on the burning that the consumption of the same 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.110
 replacing with 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.640
 and this is yummy additional fossil fuels 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.900
 reducing cost and making it more difficult for me 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.930
 the wooden pallet produced from eucalyptus or pinus is a source of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.580
 renewable energy easily found on the market at a competitive price in 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.580
 other fuels 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.160
 does not contribute to deforestation is politically correct 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.960
 does not generate smoke and presents low ash in the environment and thanks for 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.760
 a heater like this are good too
