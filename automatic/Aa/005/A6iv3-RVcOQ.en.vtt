00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.810 
but it's not attending that at all um
the<00:01:28.290> purpose<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.890> red<00:01:29.040> light<00:01:29.220> bed<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
sole purpose of its creation was so that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920 
sole purpose of its creation was so that
the<00:01:32.070> astronauts<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.670> NASA<00:01:32.850> could<00:01:33.570> absorb

the astronauts of NASA could absorb
vitamin<00:01:34.470> D<00:01:34.619> when<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.220> were<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.430> space<00:01:35.729> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
vitamin D when they were in space so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.580 
vitamin D when they were in space so
that<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.420> could<00:01:36.570> reduce<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.930> serotonin<00:01:37.500> the

that they could reduce the serotonin the
fading<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:37.979> their<00:01:38.100> brains<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.610> not<00:01:38.790> go

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
fading in their brains to not go

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.149 
fading in their brains to not go
completely<00:01:39.479> space<00:01:39.930> crazy<00:01:40.229> while<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.040> were
