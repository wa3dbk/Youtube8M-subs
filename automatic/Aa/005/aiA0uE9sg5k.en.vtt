00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.910 
of me and I jumped up in the air over
that<00:01:35.770> I<00:01:36.040> went<00:01:36.610> up<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.850> about<00:01:37.150> 5<00:01:37.479> feet<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.050> hung

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
that I went up to about 5 feet and hung

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.640 
that I went up to about 5 feet and hung
there<00:01:39.130> for<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.340> second<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:39.910> then<00:01:40.060> just<00:01:40.990> got<00:01:41.140> you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
there for a second and then just got you

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.990 
there for a second and then just got you
know<00:01:41.680> picked<00:01:42.340> up<00:01:42.550> off<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.740> beach<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:45.340> buzz<00:01:45.820> in

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
know picked up off the beach a buzz in

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.190 
know picked up off the beach a buzz in
the<00:01:46.090> pocket<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:46.690> that's<00:01:46.750> probably<00:01:47.050> where<00:01:47.170> I

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
the pocket and that's probably where I

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.440 
the pocket and that's probably where I
was<00:01:47.350> flying<00:01:47.590> by<00:01:47.890> top<00:01:48.340> hat<00:01:48.580> when<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.180> look<00:01:49.330> at

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
was flying by top hat when you look at

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.999 
was flying by top hat when you look at
the<00:01:49.540> clouds<00:01:49.810> behind<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.530> they<00:01:50.710> just<00:01:50.890> look

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
the clouds behind you they just look

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.620 
the clouds behind you they just look
crazy<00:01:51.250> like<00:01:51.460> something's<00:01:51.940> going<00:01:52.119> on<00:01:52.270> up<00:01:52.330> there

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
crazy like something's going on up there

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.570 
crazy like something's going on up there
yeah<00:01:53.170> there's<00:01:53.350> definitely<00:01:53.410> a<00:01:53.950> black<00:01:54.310> cloud

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
yeah there's definitely a black cloud

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.540 
yeah there's definitely a black cloud
kind<00:01:55.119> of<00:01:55.270> above<00:01:55.960> us<00:01:56.140> there<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.619> I've<00:01:57.369> talked

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
kind of above us there and I've talked

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.040 
kind of above us there and I've talked
to<00:01:57.700> some<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.030> paragliders<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.780> I<00:01:58.810> think

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
to some of the paragliders and I think

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.840 
to some of the paragliders and I think
that<00:01:59.200> was<00:01:59.289> probably<00:01:59.470> causing<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.250> updraft

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
that was probably causing that updraft

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.809 
that was probably causing that updraft
up<00:02:01.119> over<00:02:01.630> eight<00:02:01.840> yeah<00:02:02.110> right<00:02:02.890> I<00:02:03.039> don't<00:02:03.460> took<00:02:03.640> I

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819

pretty hard I I tried to turn it back
into<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:34.040> wind<00:03:34.250> yeah<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:35.030> like<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.630> stop<00:03:36.170> in

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
into the wind yeah I like to stop in

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.319 
into the wind yeah I like to stop in
Atlanta<00:03:36.709> but<00:03:36.890> I<00:03:36.950> think<00:03:37.130> at<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.310> same<00:03:37.340> time<00:03:37.819> has

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
Atlanta but I think at the same time has

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.850 
Atlanta but I think at the same time has
a<00:03:38.360> hundred<00:03:38.810> foot<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.049> line<00:03:39.170> and<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.560> still

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
a hundred foot of line and I still

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.920 
a hundred foot of line and I still
swinging<00:03:40.340> underneath<00:03:40.849> the<00:03:41.000> kite<00:03:41.239> yeah<00:03:41.750> I

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
swinging underneath the kite yeah I

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.479 
swinging underneath the kite yeah I

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
think that's when I hit the ground

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.670 
think that's when I hit the ground
yeah<00:03:43.730> hit<00:03:43.970> pretty<00:03:44.180> hard<00:03:44.269> hit<00:03:45.019> on<00:03:45.049> my<00:03:45.230> like

she's definitely looks like when I got
up<00:03:59.209> there<00:03:59.420> I<00:03:59.959> got<00:04:00.889> it<00:04:00.920> that's<00:04:01.340> pretty<00:04:01.700> much

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
up there I got it that's pretty much

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.620 
up there I got it that's pretty much
like<00:04:01.850> I'm<00:04:02.450> probably<00:04:02.660> gonna<00:04:02.840> die<00:04:03.730> video<00:04:04.730> has

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
like I'm probably gonna die video has

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.270 
like I'm probably gonna die video has
seen<00:04:05.930> anything<00:04:06.230> like<00:04:06.350> this<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:06.709> we'll<00:04:07.010> see<00:04:07.040> if

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
seen anything like this and we'll see if

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.640 
seen anything like this and we'll see if
it's<00:04:07.730> ever<00:04:08.090> again<00:04:08.389> I<00:04:08.660> think<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.470> was<00:04:09.560> the

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
it's ever again I think that was the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.020 
it's ever again I think that was the
thing<00:04:09.859> too<00:04:10.069> because<00:04:10.280> nobody<00:04:10.579> ever<00:04:10.670> thought<00:04:10.880> it

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
thing too because nobody ever thought it

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.640 
thing too because nobody ever thought it
could<00:04:11.150> happen<00:04:11.329> like<00:04:11.690> in<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:11.900> beginning<00:04:12.319> so

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
could happen like in the beginning so

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.379 
could happen like in the beginning so
are<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.160> closer<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.579> God<00:04:13.609> no<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:17.209> definitely

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
are you closer to God no it definitely

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.810 
are you closer to God no it definitely
