and<00:00:08.120> he<00:00:09.120> ordered<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.750> new<00:00:09.900> dehumidifier<00:00:10.110> to

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
and he ordered a new dehumidifier to

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.280 
and he ordered a new dehumidifier to
replace<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.570> one<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.599> had<00:00:12.809> given<00:00:12.929> up<00:00:13.170> the

an alarm

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.719 
an alarm
and<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:05.790> notice<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.360> too<00:01:06.570> has<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.700> has<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and you notice it it too has a has a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.750 
and you notice it it too has a has a
handle<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.750> very<00:01:10.020> nice<00:01:10.260> feature<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:11.070> when<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
handle one very nice feature is when you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.219 
handle one very nice feature is when you
remove<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.240> bucket<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
remove the bucket all you have to do is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.850 
remove the bucket all you have to do is
reach<00:01:13.439> down<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> remove<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.030> filter<00:01:15.650> which<00:01:16.650> can

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
reach down and remove a filter which can

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.899 
reach down and remove a filter which can
then<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.390> washed<00:01:18.390> by<00:01:18.689> hand<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.890> very<00:01:20.490> simple

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
then be washed by hand and a very simple

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
then be washed by hand and a very simple
process<00:01:21.560> what<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.970> previous<00:01:25.009> model

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
process what I have the previous model

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.800 
process what I have the previous model
that<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.280> had<00:01:26.520> which<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> Frigidaire<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that I had which was not a Frigidaire I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.960 
that I had which was not a Frigidaire I
had<00:01:28.470> no<00:01:28.619> idea<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.100> even<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.369> filter<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
had no idea that was even a filter in it

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.710 
had no idea that was even a filter in it
and<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.829> guess<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.579> probably<00:01:32.759> contributed<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
and I guess that probably contributed to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.469 
and I guess that probably contributed to
the<00:01:33.840> fact<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.520> after<00:01:35.520> five<00:01:35.700> years<00:01:35.729> enough<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the fact that after five years enough of

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.660 
the fact that after five years enough of
benign<00:01:36.810> neglect<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:38.100> gave<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> ghost<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
benign neglect it gave up the ghost the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.539 
benign neglect it gave up the ghost the
one<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> nice<00:01:42.979> features<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.399> is

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
one of the nice features about this is

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.980 
one of the nice features about this is
it<00:01:44.700> does<00:01:44.850> what<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.149> supposed<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.750> which

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
it does what it's supposed to do which

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.520 
it does what it's supposed to do which
is<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.200> say<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.790> will<00:01:48.540> fill<00:01:48.810> up<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.110> 70

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
is to say that it will fill up that 70

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.679 
is to say that it will fill up that 70
pint<00:01:49.770> container<00:01:50.159> very<00:01:50.610> quickly

one thing I did notice however is that

one thing I did notice however is that
of<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.650> reviews<00:02:22.450> frequently<00:02:23.450> point<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.930> a
