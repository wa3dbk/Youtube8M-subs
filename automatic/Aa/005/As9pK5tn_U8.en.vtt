saltiness of the Dales there's also a

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.550 
saltiness of the Dales there's also a
water<00:04:04.620> pin<00:04:04.950> in<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.840> Brigman<00:04:06.840> electric<00:04:07.230> smoker

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.470 
water pin in the Brigman electric smoker
but<00:04:07.799> I<00:04:07.890> like<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.130> good<00:04:08.250> base<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.880> water<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.330> the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
but I like a good base of water on the

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.530 
but I like a good base of water on the
bottom<00:04:10.280> because<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.640> kind<00:04:11.849> of<00:04:11.910> steams<00:04:12.269> and

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
bottom because it kind of steams and

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.600 
bottom because it kind of steams and
helps<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:13.110> further<00:04:13.590> enhance<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.250> tenderness

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
helps to further enhance the tenderness

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.469
