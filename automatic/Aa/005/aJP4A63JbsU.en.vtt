00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
evening you can see it takes off track

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.580 
evening you can see it takes off track
almost<00:03:19.579> right<00:03:19.700> over<00:03:19.959> eastern<00:03:20.959> Pennsylvania

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
almost right over eastern Pennsylvania

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.740

here and you're going to have

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.210 
here and you're going to have
temperatures<00:03:24.140> well<00:03:24.350> below<00:03:24.380> freezing<00:03:24.620> across

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
temperatures well below freezing across

the<00:03:25.430> entire<00:03:25.640> area<00:03:25.670> very<00:03:26.329> high<00:03:26.600> ratio<00:03:27.200> snow<00:03:27.590> is

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
the entire area very high ratio snow is

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.160 
the entire area very high ratio snow is
here<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.040> be<00:03:28.130> talking<00:03:28.459> about<00:03:28.700> here<00:03:28.910> on

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
here to be talking about here on

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.420 
here to be talking about here on
Saturday<00:03:30.170> night<00:03:30.350> we're<00:03:31.040> talking<00:03:31.220> about<00:03:31.340> the

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
Saturday night we're talking about the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.340 
Saturday night we're talking about the
upper<00:03:31.549> levels<00:03:31.970> being<00:03:32.120> anywhere<00:03:32.420> between<00:03:32.690> 15

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
upper levels being anywhere between 15

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.940 
upper levels being anywhere between 15
and<00:03:33.380> 18<00:03:33.799> degrees<00:03:34.579> below<00:03:34.850> zero<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:36.530> it's<00:03:36.680> very

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
and 18 degrees below zero so it's very

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.319 
and 18 degrees below zero so it's very
cold<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.430> upper<00:03:37.610> levels<00:03:37.910> in<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.120> middle

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
cold in the upper levels in the middle

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.509 
cold in the upper levels in the middle
actually<00:03:38.660> in<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.900> mid<00:03:39.049> levels<00:03:39.380> where<00:03:40.370> the

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
actually in the mid levels where the

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.400 
actually in the mid levels where the
snow<00:03:40.700> is<00:03:40.730> generated<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.630> then<00:03:42.170> all<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.380> way

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
snow is generated and then all the way

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.900 
snow is generated and then all the way
down<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.680> surface<00:03:43.010> of<00:03:43.100> course<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.400> very<00:03:43.459> cold

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
down the surface of course is very cold

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.030 
down the surface of course is very cold
not<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.540> lot<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.840> precipitation<00:03:45.590> shown<00:03:45.799> here

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
not a lot of precipitation shown here

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.580 
not a lot of precipitation shown here
with<00:03:46.160> this<00:03:46.340> not<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.730> lot<00:03:46.970> at<00:03:47.000> all<00:03:47.350> but<00:03:48.350> it's<00:03:48.470> one

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
with this not a lot at all but it's one

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.630 
with this not a lot at all but it's one
of<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.709> situations<00:03:49.250> where<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:49.430> could

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
of the situations where you could

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.220 
of the situations where you could
squeeze<00:03:49.820> out<00:03:50.090> just<00:03:50.299> maybe<00:03:50.510> two<00:03:50.720> tenths<00:03:50.989> of<00:03:51.110> an

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
squeeze out just maybe two tenths of an

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.890 
squeeze out just maybe two tenths of an
inch<00:03:51.290> of<00:03:51.560> snow<00:03:52.000> our<00:03:53.000> two<00:03:53.180> testaments<00:03:53.750> of

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
inch of snow our two testaments of

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.350 
inch of snow our two testaments of
liquid<00:03:54.829> equivalent<00:03:55.190> which<00:03:56.090> would<00:03:56.239> normally

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
liquid equivalent which would normally

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.270 
liquid equivalent which would normally
be<00:03:56.690> two<00:03:56.900> inches<00:03:57.079> of<00:03:57.230> snow<00:03:57.530> would<00:03:57.769> actually<00:03:58.160> be

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
be two inches of snow would actually be

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.009 
be two inches of snow would actually be
four<00:03:58.670> inches<00:03:58.970> of<00:03:59.030> snow<00:03:59.269> in<00:03:59.299> this<00:03:59.540> case<00:03:59.750> because

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
four inches of snow in this case because

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.410 
four inches of snow in this case because
it's<00:04:00.140> such<00:04:00.230> a<00:04:00.260> dry<00:04:00.590> fluffy<00:04:01.280> powdery<00:04:01.970> snow<00:04:02.060> and

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
it's such a dry fluffy powdery snow and

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.840 
it's such a dry fluffy powdery snow and
those<00:04:02.510> ratios<00:04:02.780> are<00:04:03.110> so<00:04:03.260> high<00:04:03.579> but<00:04:04.579> we<00:04:04.700> think

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
those ratios are so high but we think

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.039 
those ratios are so high but we think
there's<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.090> chance<00:04:05.269> that<00:04:05.420> this<00:04:05.660> could<00:04:05.720> get<00:04:05.989> a

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
there's a chance that this could get a

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.210 
there's a chance that this could get a
little<00:04:06.110> bit<00:04:06.380> more<00:04:06.530> here<00:04:06.829> and<00:04:06.980> we're<00:04:07.070> going<00:04:07.190> to

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
little bit more here and we're going to

i'll show you the previous run here what
it<00:04:43.190> did<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.640> look<00:04:44.270> where<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:44.510> low<00:04:44.660> was<00:04:44.900> in

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
it did and look where the low was in

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.040 
it did and look where the low was in
this<00:04:45.140> previous<00:04:45.350> run<00:04:46.090> way<00:04:47.090> east<00:04:47.420> here<00:04:47.750> so<00:04:47.930> it

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
this previous run way east here so it

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.800 
this previous run way east here so it
definitely<00:04:48.290> moved<00:04:48.680> considerably<00:04:49.490> west<00:04:49.880> to

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
definitely moved considerably west to

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.640 
definitely moved considerably west to
its<00:04:50.990> new<00:04:51.170> run<00:04:51.440> here<00:04:52.330> see<00:04:53.330> where<00:04:53.480> it<00:04:53.570> is<00:04:53.660> now<00:04:53.840> was

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
its new run here see where it is now was

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.070 
its new run here see where it is now was
here<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:55.130> now<00:04:55.190> came<00:04:56.150> back<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.540> the<00:04:56.570> west<00:04:56.810> here

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
here and now came back to the west here

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.080 
here and now came back to the west here
I<00:04:57.230> didn't<00:04:57.800> change<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.130> timestamp<00:04:58.610> timestamp

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
I didn't change the timestamp timestamp

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.720 
I didn't change the timestamp timestamp
is<00:04:59.180> exactly<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.690> same<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.560> the<00:05:00.590> GFS<00:05:01.070> s<00:05:01.250> trended

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
is exactly the same so the GFS s trended

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.120 
is exactly the same so the GFS s trended
west<00:05:02.480> with<00:05:02.870> this<00:05:03.080> system<00:05:03.290> if<00:05:03.590> you<00:05:03.650> want<00:05:03.950> this

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
west with this system if you want this

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.450 
west with this system if you want this
to<00:05:05.380> produce<00:05:06.380> some<00:05:06.680> snow<00:05:06.920> across<00:05:07.160> our<00:05:07.400> area

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
to produce some snow across our area

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.830 
to produce some snow across our area
here<00:05:07.880> eastern<00:05:08.240> Pennsylvania<00:05:08.720> New<00:05:08.810> Jersey

here eastern Pennsylvania New Jersey
you're<00:05:09.290> going<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.470> need<00:05:09.680> this<00:05:09.860> to<00:05:10.220> face

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
you're going to need this to face

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.590 
you're going to need this to face
quicker<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.890> you're<00:05:12.890> needed<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:13.610> explode<00:05:14.270> a

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
quicker and you're needed to explode a

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.940 
quicker and you're needed to explode a
little<00:05:14.900> bit<00:05:14.990> closer<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.380> coastline<00:05:15.830> which

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
little bit closer the coastline which

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.580 
little bit closer the coastline which
will<00:05:16.070> throw<00:05:16.280> back<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.520> snow<00:05:16.880> back<00:05:17.120> into<00:05:17.590> much

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
will throw back the snow back into much

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.530 
will throw back the snow back into much

if you translate that the snow when

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.790 
if you translate that the snow when
these<00:06:25.490> high<00:06:25.640> ratios<00:06:26.120> they<00:06:26.930> would<00:06:27.110> be<00:06:27.290> you<00:06:27.710> know

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
these high ratios they would be you know

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.200 
these high ratios they would be you know
something<00:06:28.190> more<00:06:28.340> like<00:06:28.520> six<00:06:28.850> or<00:06:28.940> eight<00:06:29.060> inches

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
something more like six or eight inches

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.600 
something more like six or eight inches
of<00:06:29.480> snow<00:06:29.690> so<00:06:30.020> this<00:06:30.590> can<00:06:30.770> sneak<00:06:30.980> up<00:06:31.100> on<00:06:31.310> you<00:06:31.460> get

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
of snow so this can sneak up on you get

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.250 
of snow so this can sneak up on you get
used<00:06:31.820> to<00:06:31.850> get<00:06:32.030> you<00:06:32.540> know<00:06:32.630> getting<00:06:32.870> more<00:06:33.170> snow

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 
used to get you know getting more snow

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.980 
used to get you know getting more snow
than<00:06:33.410> you<00:06:33.620> expected<00:06:34.070> but<00:06:34.970> well<00:06:35.480> will<00:06:35.810> like

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
than you expected but well will like

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.780 
than you expected but well will like
just<00:06:36.680> go<00:06:36.770> with<00:06:36.800> the<00:06:36.950> lighter<00:06:37.130> amounts<00:06:37.340> for<00:06:37.640> now

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
just go with the lighter amounts for now

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:39.220 
just go with the lighter amounts for now
on<00:06:37.970> us<00:06:38.090> to<00:06:38.180> think<00:06:38.330> change<00:06:38.540> it<00:06:38.690> will<00:06:38.900> adjust

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
on us to think change it will adjust

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.780 
on us to think change it will adjust
fire<00:06:39.710> as<00:06:39.950> we<00:06:40.100> go

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
fire as we go

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.610 
fire as we go
go<00:06:41.790> into<00:06:42.060> the<00:06:42.150> weekend<00:06:42.540> a<00:06:42.720> lot<00:06:42.960> is<00:06:43.320> predicated

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.880 
go into the weekend a lot is predicated
on<00:06:43.890> what<00:06:44.010> happens<00:06:44.370> with<00:06:44.430> this<00:06:44.790> system<00:06:45.000> here<00:06:45.540> on

on what happens with this system here on

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.340 
on what happens with this system here on
Thursday<00:06:46.890> and<00:06:46.920> what<00:06:47.280> it<00:06:47.400> does<00:06:47.610> and<00:06:47.930> how<00:06:48.930> strong

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
Thursday and what it does and how strong

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.470 
Thursday and what it does and how strong
it<00:06:49.560> gets<00:06:49.770> will<00:06:50.460> determine<00:06:50.940> exactly<00:06:51.300> what

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
it gets will determine exactly what

happens with the system on Saturday
night<00:06:53.550> okay<00:06:54.450> so<00:06:54.510> we're<00:06:54.750> going<00:06:54.870> to<00:06:54.960> go<00:06:54.990> past

Wednesday timeframe of next week a lot

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.120 
Wednesday timeframe of next week a lot
of<00:07:06.540> different<00:07:06.780> solutions<00:07:07.170> with<00:07:07.320> this<00:07:07.470> one<00:07:08.010> the

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
of different solutions with this one the

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.620 
of different solutions with this one the
latest<00:07:08.250> gfs<00:07:08.760> and<00:07:08.940> I'll<00:07:09.000> trying<00:07:09.210> to<00:07:09.270> cut<00:07:09.420> it<00:07:09.540> in

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
latest gfs and I'll trying to cut it in

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.960 
latest gfs and I'll trying to cut it in
a<00:07:09.720> little<00:07:09.930> bit<00:07:10.020> further<00:07:10.170> than<00:07:10.410> west<00:07:10.880> but<00:07:11.880> it

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
a little bit further than west but it

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.000 
a little bit further than west but it
does<00:07:12.120> give<00:07:12.300> a<00:07:12.330> nice<00:07:12.660> over<00:07:13.140> running<00:07:13.470> event<00:07:13.770> here

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010 
does give a nice over running event here

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.190 
does give a nice over running event here
in<00:07:14.040> with<00:07:14.940> light<00:07:15.180> snow<00:07:15.330> or<00:07:15.660> light<00:07:15.810> to<00:07:15.930> moderate

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:16.200 
in with light snow or light to moderate

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.410 
in with light snow or light to moderate
snow<00:07:16.290> before<00:07:16.620> any<00:07:17.040> kind<00:07:17.280> of<00:07:17.310> change<00:07:17.490> over<00:07:17.880> to

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:18.420 
snow before any kind of change over to

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.000 
snow before any kind of change over to
ice<00:07:18.600> here<00:07:18.960> but<00:07:19.140> then<00:07:19.260> it<00:07:19.350> goes<00:07:19.470> back<00:07:19.500> to<00:07:19.680> snow

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010 
ice here but then it goes back to snow

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.410 
ice here but then it goes back to snow
is<00:07:20.160> this<00:07:20.280> pulls<00:07:20.520> away<00:07:20.670> so<00:07:20.820> a<00:07:21.030> lot<00:07:21.330> of<00:07:21.360> different

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420 
is this pulls away so a lot of different

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.660 
is this pulls away so a lot of different
solutions<00:07:22.020> with<00:07:22.200> this<00:07:22.410> European<00:07:23.310> model<00:07:23.550> had

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:23.670 
solutions with this European model had

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.400 
solutions with this European model had
mostly<00:07:24.000> snow<00:07:24.150> in<00:07:24.570> a<00:07:24.660> little<00:07:24.930> further<00:07:25.140> south

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.410 
mostly snow in a little further south

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.160 
mostly snow in a little further south
east<00:07:25.770> gfs<00:07:26.610> keeps<00:07:26.880> bouncing<00:07:27.300> around<00:07:27.390> the<00:07:27.780> K<00:07:27.960> and

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.170 
east gfs keeps bouncing around the K and

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:29.660 
east gfs keeps bouncing around the K and
keeps<00:07:28.350> bouncing<00:07:28.740> around<00:07:28.830> so<00:07:29.220> there's<00:07:29.370> another

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:29.670 
keeps bouncing around so there's another

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.270 
keeps bouncing around so there's another
big<00:07:29.940> chance<00:07:30.510> of<00:07:30.750> a<00:07:30.780> bigger<00:07:31.080> storm<00:07:31.440> Tuesday

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 
big chance of a bigger storm Tuesday

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.470 
big chance of a bigger storm Tuesday
Wednesday<00:07:32.520> next<00:07:32.820> week<00:07:32.970> that<00:07:33.240> will<00:07:33.330> be

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.480 
Wednesday next week that will be

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.570 
Wednesday next week that will be
following<00:07:33.810> as<00:07:33.930> well<00:07:34.140> so<00:07:34.860> for<00:07:35.160> now<00:07:35.280> we're<00:07:35.490> going

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 
following as well so for now we're going

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.790 
following as well so for now we're going
to<00:07:35.640> focus<00:07:35.820> on<00:07:36.120> first<00:07:36.720> on<00:07:36.930> this<00:07:37.380> Thursday

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 
to focus on first on this Thursday

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.320 
to focus on first on this Thursday
system<00:07:37.860> which<00:07:38.310> again<00:07:38.580> looks<00:07:38.820> looks<00:07:39.030> to<00:07:39.150> be<00:07:39.270> a

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 
system which again looks looks to be a

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.780 
system which again looks looks to be a
very<00:07:39.480> relatively<00:07:40.110> weak<00:07:40.410> system<00:07:40.800> according<00:07:41.610> to

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:41.790 
very relatively weak system according to

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.190 
very relatively weak system according to
winched<00:07:42.090> from<00:07:42.300> that<00:07:42.450> and<00:07:42.630> we're<00:07:42.750> looking<00:07:42.900> for

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.200 
winched from that and we're looking for

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.290 
winched from that and we're looking for
a<00:07:43.230> bigger<00:07:43.500> potential<00:07:43.920> from<00:07:44.640> the<00:07:44.760> second<00:07:45.150> one

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 
a bigger potential from the second one

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.730 
a bigger potential from the second one
could<00:07:45.570> be<00:07:45.720> a<00:07:45.750> little<00:07:45.960> bit<00:07:46.080> more<00:07:46.260> than<00:07:46.500> just<00:07:46.680> a

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 
could be a little bit more than just a

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.310

nuisance wealth wait and see and then
this<00:07:49.440> third<00:07:49.650> system<00:07:50.040> which<00:07:50.250> is<00:07:50.490> the<00:07:50.970> third<00:07:51.270> in
