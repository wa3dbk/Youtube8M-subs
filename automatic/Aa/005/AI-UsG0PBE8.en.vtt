00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
over the corner there so it doesn't

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.860 
over the corner there so it doesn't
float<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.309> over<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> tank<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.180> I'm<00:00:42.690> gonna

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and let it sit for fifteen minutes and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.680 
and let it sit for fifteen minutes and
then<00:00:57.690> I'll<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.200> again<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.760> another<00:01:00.239> 15

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
getting him used to breathing the air or

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.789

large sections of the tank and that can
be<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> problem<00:03:53.250> as<00:03:53.489> well<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.940> did<00:03:54.600> have<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.079> move

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
be a problem as well I did have to move

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.770 
be a problem as well I did have to move
a<00:03:55.350> bully<00:03:55.620> into<00:03:56.190> my<00:03:56.430> american<00:03:57.120> or<00:03:57.239> african

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780

dwarf<00:03:57.930> frog<00:03:58.350> tank<00:03:58.620> where<00:03:58.890> he's<00:03:59.040> quite<00:03:59.579> happy

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.900 
dwarf frog tank where he's quite happy
so<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.350> think<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.280> really<00:04:02.549> have<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.790> make

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
so I think that you really have to make

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.310 
so I think that you really have to make
sure<00:04:02.970> that<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.329> pay<00:04:03.510> attention<00:04:03.540> when<00:04:04.200> you're

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
sure that you pay attention when you're

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.130 
sure that you pay attention when you're
adding<00:04:04.470> anything<00:04:04.920> new<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.609> your<00:04:05.730> tank

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
adding anything new to your tank

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.660 
adding anything new to your tank
regardless<00:04:07.140> of<00:04:07.410> if<00:04:07.799> anyone<00:04:08.160> says<00:04:08.430> they're

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
regardless of if anyone says they're

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.900 
regardless of if anyone says they're
gentle<00:04:09.180> they<00:04:09.510> don't<00:04:09.690> hurt<00:04:09.959> anything<00:04:10.910> my

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
gentle they don't hurt anything my

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.390 
gentle they don't hurt anything my
experience<00:04:12.480> has<00:04:12.720> been<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.920> really<00:04:14.250> have

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
experience has been that you really have

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.520 
experience has been that you really have
to<00:04:14.549> pay<00:04:14.700> attention<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:15.510> really<00:04:15.780> have<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.410> make

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
to pay attention you really have to make

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.210 
to pay attention you really have to make
