00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
right-handed batters and my favorite

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.040 
right-handed batters and my favorite
pitch<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.280> curveball<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:42.450> left-handed

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.440 
pitch the curveball for left-handed
batters<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.300> pretty

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
batters because I think it's a pretty

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.139 
batters because I think it's a pretty
nasty<00:00:45.750> pitch<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.559> especially<00:00:47.190> when<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.940> get

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
nasty pitch and especially when you get

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.310 
nasty pitch and especially when you get
it<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:50.719> 80<00:00:51.719> miles<00:00:52.079> an

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it up to like I think like 80 miles an

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080 
it up to like I think like 80 miles an
hour<00:00:52.410> i<00:00:52.590> think<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> maximum<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.879> not<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
hour i think is a maximum it's not a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.670 
hour i think is a maximum it's not a
very<00:00:54.329> fast<00:00:54.600> pitch<00:00:57.649> but<00:00:58.649> i<00:00:59.449> can't<00:01:00.449> wait<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
very fast pitch but i can't wait to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.830 
very fast pitch but i can't wait to
start<00:01:02.399> making<00:01:02.579> videos<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.270> already<00:01:03.449> played<00:01:03.690> the
