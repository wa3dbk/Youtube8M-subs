00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:08.550
 I would have touched your aura for role 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.520
 to introduce you to my latest 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.870
 shopping on free lead is what 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.700
 many think right away we 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.849
 ask for a book that told me 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.339
 been offered by my brother wherever he is 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.619
 robert galbraith's silkworm so 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.380
 jk rowling I already told you that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.849
 I was going to have this novel I like in 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.230
 this saga anyway he loves 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.960
 all the writings of jk rowling but hey 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.120
 this one makes me very very happy 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.650
 I had seen in English he inherits years that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.840
 I also do it in French at 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.880
 contrary the great novels here is the top 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.770
 5 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.090
 integral of the iron throne so I know 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.400
 bruce sewell hatay 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.190
 I think I had already returned 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.200
 a version of my top 3 here for my 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.450
 in my case it would not happen that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.220
 I talked about telling him the biggest 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.720
 that I had never read I think it's 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.450
 pts and the volume 3 of windows phone 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.980
 you saw that I had some in the 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.970
 editions I read this time I 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.630
 bought men in editions 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.730
 pygmalion 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.679
 I already talked to you about how 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.539
 went the covers the editions and 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:08.310
 your I do not care a bit actually 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.390
 but concretely finally I like 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.060
 this one because there I read and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.000
 practical because it is lighter 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.060
 but this one is 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.290
 she writes bigger so it's more 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.430
 nice I think it would stay 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.200
 will not miss snowed what could 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.460
 to be page with about 1000 8 of 1200 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.880
 yellow pages I think it will be him the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.510
 next bigger book him so that's it 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.210
 I look forward 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.950
 I even agree if I had already read it myself 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.619
 seems the first two volumes that 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.750
 integrate this book here it's me that it me 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.160
 lets have them at home afterwards 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.140
 go a little bit more particular since 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.650
 is a book of photographs so 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.540
 these are the kinds photo of a path 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.140
 javelin with for the freedom of the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.140
 press 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.580
 so who shows pictures of animals 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.720
 I love animal photography as well 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.300
 I bought this device it's for 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.830
 able to have new goals 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.509
 why but they will get to do the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.950
 animal photo even though I'm not at all 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.570
 and professionals to others me that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.210
 I like to say that what I share 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.009
 on youtube on my blog it's certain 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.300
 things but there are other things that I 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.340
 keep of course for me is the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.750
 animal photography is one of them and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.400
 I would love to do that kind of 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.489
 pictures I love I am passionate 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.470
 by animals from the far north from where the 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.440
 fact that I wish soon soon to 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.970
 leave here so that to show you 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.739
 what can I do you 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:33.470
 show 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:34.489
 wait I do not really know what is 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.799
 a little annoying is that 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.760
 some photos are beautiful and at 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.920
 middle but the garment is the ca 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.019
 still very pleasant it's 10 euros so 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.340
 honestly it's if you want in 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.769
 to make a gift rod would make someone 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.530
 who loves photography who love them 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.120
 animals was really not and 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.650
 finally it is a gift of our 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.690
 love my knees my work because 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.020
 I think it could interest 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.260
 it's about free books like anne 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.330
 of Auray bibard I confess not know 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.650
 not really this book I knew she 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.630
 had already published to go one is for 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.170
 I'm never really interested in 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.880
 what she was doing 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.950
 I do not have a big big fan 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.460
 others and pulvar but especially in 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.560
 his period 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.420
 it must recreate the udc is where I 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.400
 but concretely discovered since 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.780
 louis caron and arrived I would find 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.840
 most very friendly 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.960
 strange is it not no actually no 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.540
 no longer do not bother me but here is the 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.760
 theme of the book is that's all 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.880
 what I like about it 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.220
 portraits of women who who showed 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.440
 their independence their choice in 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.540
 different aspects of the society of the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.380
 life that this policy whatsoever 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.420
 artistic 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.940
 you see there is camille claudel so 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.260
 it's them it's a tariffs that I 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.660
 have I have not yet when I have 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.600
 started only the preface actually 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.340
 I just had to preface this 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.680
 see a bit of what those he was 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.850
 question and I can not wait to discover the art 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.110
 is a site I bought myself a 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.360
 rendezvous that bonn the site of his 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.730
 machine it seems to me 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.870
 it's a fantastic novel that we 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.520
 do not associate harry potter badly but 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.600
 good you know it 's your card all 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.140
 the world associates a whole book that 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.790
 market 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.459
 a priori history may please me 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.600
 I wanted to test the cij must 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.169
 avoid reading too many books in English 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.700
 this year 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.190
 here I think I can still 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.870
 tried his room not bad and finally 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.270
 I also bought two Romandes 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.970
 father jean to the wolf the first is 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.300
 orlando and the second is a room to 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.000
 self 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.460
 so I must admit that I know 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.510
 very badly this height and I really 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.960
 really want to discover because 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:48.110
 I feel it I clearly see that there is 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.940
 a real potential at home and I 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.880
 sense I feel frustrated a little stupid 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.380
 not to have discovered it yet 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.550
 have not yet explored and I think 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.560
 it's time to do it so I 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.910
 honestly taken if the ferments a 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.860
 little bit at random I took what there 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.150
 had I do not know if these are these 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.460
 media so do not hesitate to me 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.510
 advise in the comments me me 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.980
 offer novels of 2.9 to prefer 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.170
 those with whom you think he 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.880
 have to start I would really 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.860
 interested know it so these are these 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.760
 little ones will think to finish them I'm 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.230
 but there are not many books 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.210
 but good in a sense it's a little bit 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.590
 more for my wallet and maybe 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.690
 that you will be rising is also 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.480
 I hope we have more 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.030
 not to share your opinion on the books 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.260
 or novel that I proposed and in 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.590
 waiting i wish you a good ending 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.950
 of day 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.750
 so happy who suffers I know the 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.800
 disease this will I arrived there 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.560
 fifteen minutes 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.330
 so I found the path of the 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.130
 center I am the sailboats the sons of 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.230
 debut his buddies and then a 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.060
 proofreading I intend to reread the 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.890
 benevolent of matane minitel who 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.720
 is a book that I really liked 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.320
 but that I had read a lot younger 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.650
 for there to well in to its output I 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.650
 think
