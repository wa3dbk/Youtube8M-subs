the<00:01:50.780> strategy<00:01:51.109> it's<00:01:51.200> gonna<00:01:51.289> play<00:01:51.499> out<00:01:51.560> but<00:01:51.920> uh

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
the strategy it's gonna play out but uh

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.609 
the strategy it's gonna play out but uh
I<00:01:52.340> think<00:01:52.880> with<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.539> Red<00:01:53.719> Bull<00:01:53.869> Team<00:01:54.109> Red<00:01:54.499> Bull

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619

I think with the Red Bull Team Red Bull
Cheever<00:01:54.889> team<00:01:55.069> and<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:55.369> think<00:01:55.399> with<00:01:55.789> a<00:01:55.819> Chevy

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209

Bob<00:02:55.610> when<00:02:55.850> he<00:02:55.910> went<00:02:56.060> through<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.240> turn<00:02:56.390> you

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
so the most impressive thing is is that

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.120 
so the most impressive thing is is that
he<00:03:02.720> knew<00:03:02.870> he<00:03:03.020> was<00:03:03.140> going<00:03:03.350> backwards<00:03:03.560> he<00:03:03.890> kept
