00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
assured their meaning is getting up and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.330 
assured their meaning is getting up and
go<00:00:31.140> finding<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.500> dictionary<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.009> looking<00:00:32.250> it

up would have to be extremely curious to
put<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> energy<00:00:35.430> into<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.329> easier<00:00:36.570> to
