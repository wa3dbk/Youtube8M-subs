00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.400
 everything that controls 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400
 emma noted that not in the usa 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.630
 for being a king editor-in-chief who traffics 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.630
 the military police captain cap 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.640
 but chose to play 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.330
 in your resume who installed it now from there comparsa realize that a year ago 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.219
 ae 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:14.389
 the flock 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.719
 no tie 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:21.109
 I believe this because the camera did not even because I did not understand so far by 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.509
 what 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.089

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:29.649

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.169
 precision colin poole want me to stay in the forum think it gives right to 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.889
 vote is promised from the rich port she can of this size interpret jack 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.019
 superposition because I always chose to respect the normal 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.629
 how many times does the program open 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.629
 for example a little 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.779
 best 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:00.749
 When 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:04.540
 example of what there is in the mild discourse 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:07.209
 90 min 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.170
 8 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.449
 without partners 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.449
 Why did you fall for a program? 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:20.349
 Whatever you want and to enjoy I hope I can have something against him. 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.519
 there are few kilos she 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.519
 this is better was it is what it is because the distant cold 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.979
 imitating 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:36.830
 sipat is currently risked the american band goretti against built 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.759
 stable 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.759
 naturally invent breast cancer 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.899
 walking down the sidewalk so far 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.799
 than to the warehouse 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.799
 detail even got several shots 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.619
 one of these attacks has required 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:57.289
 3 and I think the saints 

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:59.849
 it is assumed that 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.500
 also the bank 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.549
 another image 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.549
 I think this team is a bit more withdrawn 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.339
 but by the state 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:16.729
 the editorial a sec as they want me to go there to know tv the letter and do not rush 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.029
 they did not have so many requests to Bernstein and I 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:24.689
 here I another key point to explain better 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.150

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.010
