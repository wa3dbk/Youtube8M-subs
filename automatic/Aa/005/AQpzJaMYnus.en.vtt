00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.310 
telling for me it's just about
contouring<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.500> land<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:22.810> make<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.079> shape

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
contouring the land to make it the shape

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.569 
contouring the land to make it the shape
you<00:02:24.530> need<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:25.040> control<00:02:25.910> erosion<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:27.579> keep

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
you need to control erosion and keep

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:41.070 
you need to control erosion and keep
your<00:02:28.760> tops<00:02:29.269> off<00:02:29.480> from<00:02:29.660> running<00:02:29.810> away

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.530 

and<00:02:42.080> got<00:02:43.010> another<00:02:43.250> little<00:02:43.370> water<00:02:43.850> stop<00:02:44.210> here

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
and got another little water stop here

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.060 
and got another little water stop here
and<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.250> see<00:02:46.460> that<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:46.880> working<00:02:48.070> the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
and you can see that it's working the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.610 
and you can see that it's working the
soil<00:02:49.850> has<00:02:50.150> moved<00:02:50.450> in<00:02:50.690> high<00:02:50.900> up<00:02:51.110> against<00:02:51.470> these

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
soil has moved in high up against these

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.130 
soil has moved in high up against these
walls<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.220> if<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.520> wasn't<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.870> would

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
walls and if it wasn't there it would

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.410 
walls and if it wasn't there it would
have<00:02:54.260> just<00:02:54.290> run<00:02:54.650> right<00:02:54.890> down<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.370> slope<00:02:58.420> I've

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
have just run right down this slope I've

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.270 
have just run right down this slope I've
had<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.840> come<00:02:59.990> out<00:03:00.020> here<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.530> stand<00:03:00.770> up<00:03:01.070> this

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
had to come out here and stand up this

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.400 
had to come out here and stand up this
corn<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.730> few<00:03:01.940> times<00:03:02.180> because<00:03:02.510> this<00:03:02.960> soil<00:03:03.260> is

to have fungus in them and i lost all my
grapes<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.850> fungus<00:04:04.850> that<00:04:04.880> come<00:04:05.180> out<00:04:05.360> of<00:04:05.390> the

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
wood chips so i had to make a decision

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.990 
wood chips so i had to make a decision
about<00:04:08.450> covering<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.500> ground<00:04:09.590> or<00:04:10.040> watching
