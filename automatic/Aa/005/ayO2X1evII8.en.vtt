00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.010
 we come with a super game for android 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.200
 is a game that has just been released to 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.759
 plays bull very very recently and that 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.990
 I've been playing it in the last days 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.630
 and I liked it very much and I want 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.550
 share it with all of you the game 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.279
 it's called phone rails picks and it's a game 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.840
 designed by mulvey games the game is 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.880
 find focused on a roller coaster 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.470
 which presents the damaged rails and 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.110
 You must avoid all obstacles 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.579
 that arise along the way you'll go 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.200
 collecting balloons that can be 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.630
 exchanged for new objects from 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.610
 the game strip also has a 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.340
 global scoreboard to compete against your 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.840
 friends and see who gets this far 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.470
 game has some features that 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.290
 they make it unique 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.950
 for example retro graphics pixel art 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.230
 music style 16 8 bits and effects of 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.570
 original sound realistic animations 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.360
 8-bit style day scenarios and 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.610
 night 2.5 of with textures pixel 2 of 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.350
 something that I always look for in games are 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.180
 three things that I have a mechanical 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.520
 simple that is entertaining 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.710
 and have a good graphic and peak level 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.270
 they are kings completely fulfills these 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.070
 three requirements 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.840
 the developers have reported that 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.729
 they will be adding functions in future 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.109
 updates personally I can 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.149
 say what game I loved I've 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.369
 been playing for several days and although 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.409
 it may seem like an easy game it is not 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.299
 there are many ways to die and up 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.250
 a certain point is addictive and a little 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.200
 stressful despite that the game is 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.490
 keeps very entertaining so much so 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.350
 today I have it installed on 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.000
 all my phones now maybe it's something 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.770
 different for this video and not 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.850
 only show the captures and tomÃ¡s 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.709
 of the game but also show them 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.380
 you how is it that I play then 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:46.520
 let's see the gaming part of this 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.020
 visually crisis because we are here 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.000
 because we are going to count war picks font 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.450
 rails then we are already entering the 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.840
 game here we are in the interface then 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.819
 let's give him play do not get the plan 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.319
 gameplay everything I'm doing and 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.230
 the reactions live also because 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.120
 this game stresses me in several measures 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.830
 to be able is a game like I said with a 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.819
 thematic we just have to go 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.200
 jumping constant good music 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.989
 and as I said though it may seem 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.989
 simple is quite complex 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.170
 as now they say changing the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.170
 scenarios 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.550
 I previously told you about ways to die 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.640
 in this game there are many I go to konko 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.950
 to search if you die if you die 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.480
 chocas stuck if you die and you die 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.760
 I'm even going to give you a little trick 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.020
 If you want to die quickly because 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.290
 just start the game collide 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.620
 against the chapel and dies I do not know why 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.030
 but well the wta is pretty good 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.270
 let's put other items more for 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.050
 that you see 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.630
 fucking mother 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.610
 I was distracted I recommend 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.610
 what is wet 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.610
 nail 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.319
 and if no mother can not be 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.629
 nothing 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.430
 I can not you can see that we're going to 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.489
 make another 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.920
 I 'll play another three goes and I think she 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.620
 because good depends if I do not get angry anymore 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.900
 I could play more but if I stress 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.360
 up and fucking mother 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.360
 and now if serious concentration a day 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.400
 one 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.050
 4 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.410
 why 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:14.060
 two plus two more seriously 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.780
 then less much and that's bad in 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.780
 Madrid 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.520
 what I told you this game is 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:26.720
 relatively stressful since they're 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.060
 playing all these two weeks 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.380
 I liked it but do not die do not you 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.380
 die why 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.150
 I believe that that is an injustice not 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.080
 matter of death 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.080
 of this alone 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.639
 now if it is the vigil 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.820
 and let's go 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.590
 by not mames 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.820
 You have told me that I am not very 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.560
 very gamer player and the truth that yes 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.000
 I'm a little bit stupid for the 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.280
 games but I liked this game 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.890
 a lot and you can see here my 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.800
 record here are 96 meters and 540 balloons 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.480
 but this game I do not have downloaded in 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.190
 all my phones and my score 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.249
 maximum I think it's 250 meters then 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.969
 that is my point without maximum 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:20.969
 I am a 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.840
 and then with this concludes this part 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.030
 in the gaming sense so that you 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.770
 see how I play and how he reacted to a 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.570
 game but it's a game that like I said 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.370
 has kept quite entertaining and as 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.740
 I mentioned has the three things that I 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.020
 I look for no game is entertaining has a 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.520
 simple theme and has a very good 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.500
 graphic level are things that have 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.240
 liked quite from this color well 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.280
 that here we close this section of the 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.770
 gaming and we go back with the rest of the video 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.210

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.440

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.090

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.950
 a very good graphic level is entertaining 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.600
 has a simple mechanics I think they are 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.730
 things that everyone is looking for in a game and 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.920
 as I said pixon rails meets them 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.330
 completely to perfection so 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.860
