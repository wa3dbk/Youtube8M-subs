those games how do you balance even even

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.170 
those games how do you balance even even
with<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.219> defense<00:00:53.489> playing<00:00:53.640> well<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:53.969> year

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
when you don't have that offensive

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.920 
when you don't have that offensive
consistency<00:00:56.460> how<00:00:56.910> do<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.090> get<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.420> back<00:00:57.629> and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
consistency how do you get that back and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.840 
consistency how do you get that back and
you<00:00:58.710> know<00:00:58.800> defense<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.460> sparks<00:00:59.640> the

you know defense if it sparks the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.220 
you know defense if it sparks the
offense<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.539> seems<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> last

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
offense it just seems like the last

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.750

especially<00:01:01.680> last<00:01:01.829> two<00:01:01.949> losses<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.460> wasn't

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
especially last two losses that wasn't

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.329 
especially last two losses that wasn't
there<00:01:02.850> consistently<00:01:03.210> enough<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.780> offense

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
there consistently enough on offense

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.480 
there consistently enough on offense
Malcolm<00:01:05.339> um<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:06.119> think<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.110> about<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:08.010> Coach

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
Malcolm um I think it's about what Coach

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.679 
Malcolm um I think it's about what Coach

Bennett said earlier getting off to a
good<00:01:09.840> start<00:01:10.549> whether<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.700> being<00:01:11.909> share

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
good start whether it's being share

into breakdowns our defense does lead to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.190 
into breakdowns our defense does lead to
our<00:01:17.520> offense<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.090> when<00:01:18.210> you're<00:01:18.330> having<00:01:18.600> deep

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
into breakdowns you can't get stops and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.149 
into breakdowns you can't get stops and
you're<00:01:22.170> having<00:01:22.530> trouble<00:01:22.799> seeing<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.040> ball

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
you're having trouble seeing the ball

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
you're having trouble seeing the ball
because<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:23.549> through<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.119> net<00:01:24.299> then

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
because it then through the net then

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.649 
because it then through the net then
you're<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.470> you're<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> struggle<00:01:26.040> so

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
you're not you're going to struggle so

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.399 
you're not you're going to struggle so
offensively<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.750> think<00:01:27.930> that's<00:01:28.080> why<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.290> should

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
offensively I think that's why we should

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.890 
offensively I think that's why we should
have<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> little<00:01:28.799> bit<00:01:29.900> too<00:01:30.900> right<00:01:32.900> 5th

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
have it a little bit too right 5th

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
maybe I just knew that we collectively

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.810 
maybe I just knew that we collectively
we<00:03:10.350> had<00:03:10.500> our<00:03:10.620> heads<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.190> we<00:03:11.250> knew<00:03:11.400> we<00:03:11.640> had

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
to do to try to fight back and it hurts

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.180 
to do to try to fight back and it hurts
when<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.760> when<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.090> pull<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:15.750> close<00:03:16.080> in<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
second half and and maybe they get a big

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.150 
second half and and maybe they get a big
shot<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> big<00:03:21.360> bucket<00:03:21.600> or<00:03:21.959> whatever<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.010> case

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
may be it really hurts because we know

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.560 
may be it really hurts because we know
how<00:03:25.410> hard<00:03:25.620> we<00:03:25.770> have<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:26.190> fight<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:27.209> get<00:03:27.360> back
