fine<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.600> con<00:01:58.020> does<00:01:58.229> feel<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.649> has

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
fine but this con does feel like it has

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.810 
fine but this con does feel like it has
a<00:01:58.829> bit<00:01:59.250> more<00:01:59.610> space<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.509> me<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.659> lose<00:02:01.649> peace<00:02:01.920> to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.510 
I almost missed a last bit there's a bit
of<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:05.669> open<00:05:05.880> on<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.030> back<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:07.250> these<00:05:08.250> two

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
of you open on the back and these two

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.159 
of you open on the back and these two
flat<00:05:08.849> pieces<00:05:09.060> are<00:05:09.389> just<00:05:09.510> attached<00:05:09.840> to<00:05:09.990> one

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
flat pieces are just attached to one

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.930 
flat pieces are just attached to one
stud<00:05:10.590> so<00:05:10.830> I'm<00:05:10.919> thinking<00:05:11.280> probably<00:05:11.520> fall<00:05:11.699> very

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
stud so I'm thinking probably fall very

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.540 
stud so I'm thinking probably fall very
easily<00:05:12.120> but<00:05:12.960> one<00:05:13.199> guy<00:05:13.440> can<00:05:13.650> sit<00:05:13.830> in<00:05:13.979> there<00:05:16.550> but

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
easily but one guy can sit in there but

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.860 
easily but one guy can sit in there but
I<00:05:17.580> mean<00:05:17.760> I'll<00:05:17.970> think<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:18.270> doesn't<00:05:18.419> really<00:05:18.570> fall

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
I mean I'll think it doesn't really fall

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.540 
I mean I'll think it doesn't really fall
apart<00:05:18.930> unless<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:19.830> put<00:05:19.979> a<00:05:20.010> lot<00:05:20.340> of<00:05:20.430> pressure

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
apart unless you put a lot of pressure

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.580 
apart unless you put a lot of pressure
on<00:05:20.760> it<00:05:21.289> so<00:05:22.289> I<00:05:22.620> feel<00:05:23.990> excused<00:05:24.990> on<00:05:25.199> one<00:05:25.380> piece

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590
