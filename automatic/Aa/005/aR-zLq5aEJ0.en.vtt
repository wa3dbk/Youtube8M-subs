down to 30 or 36 inches if you want but
since<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> mentioned<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.270> want<00:01:00.480> to

later<00:01:00.989> expand<00:01:01.500> possibly<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.340> wouldn't

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
later expand possibly I wouldn't

recommend<00:01:03.090> cutting<00:01:03.570> anything<00:01:03.780> off<00:01:04.080> because

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
recommend cutting anything off because

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.370 
recommend cutting anything off because
down<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> line<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.600> may<00:01:06.720> end<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:07.080> meeting

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
down the line you may end up meeting

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.539 
down the line you may end up meeting
that<00:01:07.619> extra<00:01:07.920> four<00:01:08.159> six<00:01:08.549> inches<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:10.430> what<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that extra four six inches and what you

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.940 
that extra four six inches and what you
can<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.240> since<00:01:12.900> both<00:01:13.080> curved<00:01:13.320> bars<00:01:13.530> connect

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
can do is since both curved bars connect

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.190 
can do is since both curved bars connect
to<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.520> center<00:01:14.880> leg<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.930> just

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to the center leg you can just

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.230 
to the center leg you can just
disconnect<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.890> from<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.159> clamp<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.670> it'll

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
disconnect it from the clamp and it'll

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.320 
disconnect it from the clamp and it'll
split<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.780> half

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
split right in half

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.510 
split right in half
question<00:01:21.330> number<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:21.720> I'm<00:01:22.110> looking<00:01:23.070> into

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
question number two I'm looking into

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.609 
question number two I'm looking into
putting<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.880> 24-inch<00:01:24.390> wing<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:25.020> each<00:01:25.290> half

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
putting a 24-inch wing on each half

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.609 
putting a 24-inch wing on each half
however<00:01:26.310> I'd<00:01:26.580> likely<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:27.119> mounting<00:01:27.509> three<00:01:28.500> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
however I'd likely be mounting three to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
however I'd likely be mounting three to
four<00:01:28.860> large<00:01:29.250> cymbals<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> maybe<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.570> floor<00:01:30.810> tom

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
four large cymbals and maybe a floor tom

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.410 
four large cymbals and maybe a floor tom
on<00:01:31.229> each<00:01:31.409> side<00:01:31.680> well<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> need<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.700> use<00:01:33.000> tee

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
on each side well I need to use tee

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.090 
on each side well I need to use tee
legged<00:01:33.720> side<00:01:33.960> extensions<00:01:34.470> instead<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.920> just

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
legged side extensions instead of just

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.999 
legged side extensions instead of just
wings<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.670> support<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.650> for<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.770> type<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
wings to support that for this type of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.760 
wings to support that for this type of
application<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.790> definitely<00:01:39.180> would<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:39.329> use

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
application I definitely would not use

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.679 
application I definitely would not use
24<00:01:40.770> inch<00:01:40.920> side<00:01:41.189> wings<00:01:41.430> they're<00:01:42.030> not<00:01:42.270> designed

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
24 inch side wings they're not designed

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.380 
24 inch side wings they're not designed
to<00:01:42.840> hold<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.040> weight<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.970> since<00:01:45.240> you're

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to hold a lot of weight so since you're

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.090 
to hold a lot of weight so since you're
going<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.600> mounting<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.229> floor<00:01:46.530> tom<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
going to be mounting a floor tom and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.160 
going to be mounting a floor tom and
some<00:01:47.369> large<00:01:47.640> symbols<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.149> them<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.509> would<00:01:49.049> go

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
some large symbols on them I would go

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.429 
some large symbols on them I would go
