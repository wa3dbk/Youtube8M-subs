00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Tell you guys, as I said from 21 to 25 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.600
 April will roll the international academy 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.429
 fish not there in turkey 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.380
 seven teams compete for the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.320
 champion of the tournament between them is 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.750
 good hardware coming straight from russia 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.640
 Good. Let's slow it down. It comes from a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.600
 growing in recent years. 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.359
 months 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.039
 they left a medium season in 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.619
 that they finished with seven victories and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.170
 seven straight losses with a playoff where 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.269
 they lost only one of nine 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.219
 matches in which they played and with 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.450
 this they managed to run over for 3 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.149
 games to 1 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.760
 the big favorite for the team title 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.820
 who finished the regular season with 13 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.550
 victories and only one defeat to moscow five 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.280
 and for them to achieve this the rule does not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.980
 showed a control of neutral objectives 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.920
 very interesting in the three matches of the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.070
 final were made 12 dragons and three 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.870
 balloons and everything that rolled them alone 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.300
 lost 4 dragons 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.760
 the highlight of this series was 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.129
 miller kira's account at last match 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.770
 of the series in which he played diverted him 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.110
 simply dismantled the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.170
 moscow five and also managed to do 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.610
 extremely several moves ways 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.610
 You here how to show it to you. 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.250
 not so interesting was that the only 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.920
 game that the rule did not lose was in the game 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.780
 in which the zee of kira was practically 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.440
 removed from game 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.490
 he did absolutely nothing in the game 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.170
 and his score perfectly reflects the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.180
 what happened 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.760
 another player who called me a lot 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.060
 attention was from angler symphony 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.970
 he adapted very well to the new goal and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.119
 Your Greek left me completely 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.700
 gaping 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.940
 the precision he used the latter was 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.860
 surreal and when he arranged a composition 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.350
 who needed protection proof that 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.090
 years skill with this champion was 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.280
 crucial to victory 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.899
 had many and many places in the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.649
 these two games he played 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.209
 drugs 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.680
 but I make a point of showing by the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.680
 less these two here 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.720
 I'll try to receive soon because 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.700
 He did a lot in this play. 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.620
 come on, the first thing that 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.450
 for no enemy after that the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.190
 Explosive barrel that completely isolates 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.780
 hawai followed by another neighborhood in 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.060
 game not to allow entry 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.980
 she came back the team a little way 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.750
 because your advice in the last year 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.090
 wrong and men who does not allow 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.440
 watching and the Greek joins the fight and 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.570
 There is more this play here that I want. 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.390
 that you keep an eye on symphony 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.250
 notice what he does Korean account 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.900
 while the skills she can 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.900
 use to help the team itself 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.450
 tense, it's good, after that time, that 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.410
 You can not talk about it or buy it. 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.180
 lex 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.240
 although he is not one of those who 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.180
 draws much attention adins that he used 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.580
 in the playoffs was so strong that it was 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.700
 beautiful in the final three games 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.030
 she along with the singer are the 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.270
 two to kells in which the lecs seemed 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.490
 stronger and comfortable then this is it 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.560
 This is a Russian representative in the 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.780
 randon competition 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.720
 their team is composed of three Russians 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.760
 a Moldovan and Ukrainian 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.990
 but that's not a problem because everyone 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.580
 they speak russian 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.830
 so this is it people I hope you 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.570

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.370
