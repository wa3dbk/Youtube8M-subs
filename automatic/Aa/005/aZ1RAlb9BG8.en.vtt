00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
even think they're too small so make

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.910 
even think they're too small so make
sure<00:03:01.630> you're<00:03:01.780> playing<00:03:01.930> before<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.590> pick<00:03:02.830> them

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920

up<00:03:03.100> in<00:03:03.310> fact<00:03:03.580> we've<00:03:03.820> had<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.060> lot<00:03:04.330> of<00:03:04.510> these<00:03:04.630> head

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
up in fact we've had a lot of these head

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.770 
up in fact we've had a lot of these head
like<00:03:05.410> warped<00:03:05.830> neck<00:03:06.280> pockets<00:03:06.880> where<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.360> neck

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
like warped neck pockets where the neck

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.010 
like warped neck pockets where the neck
bolts<00:03:08.020> under<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.530> body<00:03:08.800> it's<00:03:09.070> warped<00:03:09.550> and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
bolts under the body it's warped and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.630 
bolts under the body it's warped and
effectively<00:03:11.020> makes<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.620> action<00:03:12.130> unplayable

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
effectively makes the action unplayable

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.790 
effectively makes the action unplayable
so<00:03:13.180> definitely<00:03:13.840> want<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.110> play<00:03:14.320> one<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.680> these

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
so definitely want to play one of these

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.970 
so definitely want to play one of these

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
bridge you can see it doesn't have

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.130 
bridge you can see it doesn't have
anything<00:03:23.410> bolted<00:03:23.980> into<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.550> and<00:03:27.930> typically<00:03:28.930> go

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
anything bolted into it and typically go

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.229

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
half as much as what the semi hollows go

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.550 
half as much as what the semi hollows go
for<00:03:33.670> there<00:03:33.970> they're<00:03:34.360> really<00:03:34.750> not<00:03:34.959> quite<00:03:35.350> as
