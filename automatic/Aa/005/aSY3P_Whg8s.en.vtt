jack<00:03:49.239> up<00:03:49.390> my<00:03:49.420> hair<00:03:49.720> but<00:03:49.840> my<00:03:49.959> hair<00:03:50.140> felt<00:03:50.410> no

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
jack up my hair but my hair felt no

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.690

greasy whatever okay

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.640 
greasy whatever okay
so<00:03:58.690> look<00:03:59.470> I'm<00:03:59.620> like<00:04:00.360> this<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.900> then<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.470> last

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
so look I'm like this and then the last

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:10.890 
so look I'm like this and then the last
step<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.660> add<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:05.080> little<00:04:05.140> bit<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.790> honey<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:09.900> you

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
step I add a little bit of honey and you

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.180 
step I add a little bit of honey and you
probably<00:04:11.140> should<00:04:11.379> measure<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:11.860> would<00:04:12.010> say<00:04:12.160> a

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
probably should measure it I would say a

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.460 
probably should measure it I would say a
teaspoon<00:04:12.849> I<00:04:13.349> just<00:04:14.349> do<00:04:14.709> some<00:04:15.040> squirts<00:04:16.000> and

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
teaspoon I just do some squirts and

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:25.100 
teaspoon I just do some squirts and
leave<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.590> at<00:04:17.680> that<00:04:22.919> you've<00:04:23.919> got<00:04:24.190> me<00:04:24.460> run

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
leave it at that you've got me run

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.010 
leave it at that you've got me run
you've<00:04:26.110> got<00:04:26.380> me<00:04:26.650> running<00:04:27.250> around<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.990> found

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
you've got me running around and I found

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.719 
you've got me running around and I found
then<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.350> make<00:04:29.590> it<00:04:29.620> like<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.860> thick<00:04:30.190> pudding

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
then you make it like a thick pudding

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.110 
then you make it like a thick pudding
it's<00:04:31.030> less<00:04:31.930> messy<00:04:32.260> and<00:04:32.800> it's<00:04:33.070> not<00:04:33.220> as<00:04:33.370> runny<00:04:33.639> it

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
it's less messy and it's not as runny it

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.570 
it's less messy and it's not as runny it
doesn't<00:04:34.510> get<00:04:34.630> everywhere<00:04:34.780> quite<00:04:35.470> as<00:04:35.650> much

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.250 

okay<00:04:42.580> so<00:04:42.639> this<00:04:42.880> is<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.150> henna<00:04:43.330> mix<00:04:43.600> now<00:04:44.080> if<00:04:44.139> you

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
okay so this is the henna mix now if you

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.900 
okay so this is the henna mix now if you
want<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.530> color<00:04:44.800> he<00:04:45.250> would<00:04:45.370> probably<00:04:45.610> want<00:04:45.790> to

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
want to color he would probably want to

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.610 
want to color he would probably want to
let<00:04:46.060> this<00:04:46.210> sit<00:04:46.270> overnight<00:04:46.479> or<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:50.320> know<00:04:50.440> put

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620

let this sit overnight or you know put
on<00:04:50.710> top<00:04:50.889> of<00:04:51.040> a<00:04:51.130> furnace<00:04:51.550> or<00:04:51.700> something<00:04:52.150> for<00:04:52.419> the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
on top of a furnace or something for the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.840 
on top of a furnace or something for the
heat<00:04:52.690> so<00:04:52.870> you<00:04:52.930> released<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.380> color<00:04:53.680> me<00:04:54.550> I

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850

change<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:57.580> wouldn't<00:04:57.880> get<00:04:58.000> any<00:04:58.270> because<00:04:58.630> my

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
change and I wouldn't get any because my

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.830 
change and I wouldn't get any because my
hair<00:04:59.050> is<00:04:59.080> like<00:04:59.610> it's<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:01.150> know<00:05:01.180> dark<00:05:01.540> brown

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.440 
hair is like it's you know dark brown
black<00:05:02.200> so<00:05:03.130> I<00:05:03.160> just<00:05:03.610> would<00:05:03.820> use<00:05:04.000> it<00:05:04.150> right<00:05:04.300> away

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
black so I just would use it right away

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.629 
black so I just would use it right away
but<00:05:04.570> if<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:04.900> wanted<00:05:05.169> to<00:05:05.260> die<00:05:05.440> to<00:05:05.500> release<00:05:06.070> you

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
but if you wanted to die to release you

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.540 
but if you wanted to die to release you
would<00:05:06.850> let<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:07.060> sit<00:05:07.510> at<00:05:08.080> least<00:05:08.320> overnight<00:05:08.740> like

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
would let it sit at least overnight like

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.200 
would let it sit at least overnight like
the<00:05:09.700> color<00:05:09.940> release<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.740> also<00:05:12.460> to<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.760> way<00:05:13.150> to

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
the color release and also to a way to

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.150 
the color release and also to a way to
get<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.720> color<00:05:13.900> to<00:05:14.050> release<00:05:14.320> faster<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:14.919> diet

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
get the color to release faster the diet

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.360 
get the color to release faster the diet
of<00:05:15.220> at<00:05:15.340> least<00:05:15.460> two<00:05:15.729> is<00:05:15.970> mix<00:05:16.780> it<00:05:16.990> with<00:05:17.370> like

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
of at least two is mix it with like

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.600

green<00:05:18.639> tea<00:05:18.690> hot<00:05:19.690> water<00:05:20.070> instead<00:05:21.070> of<00:05:21.220> a<00:05:21.310> coconut

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610
