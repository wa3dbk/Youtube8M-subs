00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:10.500
 Sakura- chan good evening that I entered 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.410
 Is half about 50 grams of ginger grilled and voice Ne recipe of pig 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.460
 so 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:20.039
 A little voiced seasoning 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:24.300
 This amount that Sakura-chan told me is probably 300g for Nick 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.250
 I don't know how to do it 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.090
 First of all 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.920
 And meat too 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.510
 So it was yellow like a was a mail doing in roses meat you use the rose meat of by 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.160
 I try 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.440
 First take care 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.630
 Maybe it is considered to try Yaro is doing in ih is 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.790
 Also might be the cause of one of firepower is Tteyuu weak 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.490
 after 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.760
 To easy-to-understand today 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:57.039
 I will try to put a brief explanation 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.039
 To at once frying pan Ne Well 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.940
 To and resulting in side-by-side song 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:12.380
 To boiled like a feeling of that song or rather crisp and convulsions 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:13.630
 If there is a possibility that it will become, if you divide the song and try to avoid it there 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.760
 How about 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.550
 Oiled 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.400
 I put oil and this back again later 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.810
 Like say discarding 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.810
 What kind of setup should we do? 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.460
 Oh 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.460
 Now that the frying pan has warmed up well 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:40.329
 If it is so much part in the frying pan, but do not spread one side 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.329
 It feels like 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.280
 If you go home 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.170
 It is easy to understand now 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.020
 Slowly assume 4 spaces 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:02.140
 Let's get it 0 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.140
 Gone out to the outside what was baked Stern 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.950
 It states, such as browning with crisp 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.010
 It is said that it is entangled with the sauce after having only stabbed and was burned 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.850
 I tried in such manner 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.850
 I will do 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.159
 You do not move so much 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.100
 But it might be a child with a word is 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.600
 there 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:35.300
 One side than the while or, occasionally, I was firmly doing one-sided disease name equally 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.770
 I like burning eyes firmly 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.520
 I tried to open the surface firmly and I could try it for a while 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.520
 3 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:48.230
 Express the above etc 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.230
 Until about blood comes blurred 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.739
 eat 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.180
 Once with a woman firmly browning 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.270
 Edition Tiger 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.400
 I do a little 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.720
 Of the magazine 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.490
 In terms of proportion 2 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.280
 If the table is at 7 back side is back 22 and 3 or so 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:22.069
 A little still but a woman 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.620
 I will raise the worries and worry about the lovely partner 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.099
 The good 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.099
 ome 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.710
 Anomalous but next is Perth simply 3 minutes 394 a 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.710
 We harbor 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.900
 In this way 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:54.150
 I'm laying down 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.150
 Since the sauce and put or eight Shimoda table also would lower the temperature of the frying pan the temperature 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:03.690
 In is a fairly high Gugutsu 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:06.060
 And I wonder if not it has to feel like a will to find a song 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.300
 Appeared to stand 7 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.290
 a 6 is to avoid it 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.290
 It is such a person 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.630
 Look at the lecture because there was little 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.790
 I have a lot of oil because it's loose 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.090
 Even if overbaked, more than loin 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.860
 I think people don't care so much 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.540
 Oil 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.729
 After poor fat is 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:44.009
 Is the color of the square was in sophomore improvement 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.569
 Ne we'll look at about this 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.830
 games 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:53.190
 I 'm annoyed I 'm kicked like this This is a little bit 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.129
 Such as speed racing or something like this 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.120
 That I discovered that there is such a feeling 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.600
 Hey Now 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.360
 Hmm 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.360
 2 is taking out and seasoning of the machine 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.740
 I can see it all 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.320
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:17.170
 I'm following the stupid pagoda in this business condition 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.170
 Something which is also in and said, claw to possibly 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.969
 Please to survey the 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.409
 here 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:31.380
 I will continue boiling after boiling and then return to the child 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.320
 Delicious ablam 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.060
 me 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:40.380
 Here over high heat not here over high heat 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.380
 It is available in the root from 4 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.210
 I will do my best with a little fire 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.210
 me 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.000
 Born to come out one Pedy after all 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.680
 Who is simmering 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.420
 Terrier is up to the state 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.800
 I wonder how 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.800
 Hold a breath 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:20.499
 In was attached to the Well color 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.510
 If there is something green 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:34.660
 It was too big- cut it for a moment now 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:37.540
 Even though it lifts this remains 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.110
 In this sauce 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.500
 This area again 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.500
 From above 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:45.569
 It is said that 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:54.460
 I wonder if it is Yagen-chan 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.460
 think 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:03.539
 Shikae yeah life 9 maybe 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:04.889
 I think I've burned it at once, and I think this is 150 grams. 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:08.789
 Sakura's 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:10.830
 The recipe I touched was 300g and it would be medical and 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:16.440
 by Ryoya 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:18.289
 And are open a little at a time and are baked in a frying pan ih Able ivan 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.660
 if 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:27.670
 Until the sun shines so high 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:31.120
 I think when they are burned and and the other party too much time to burn horsetail good column 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:37.420
 Even if one is a little that pork loin west 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:41.639
 In the state reduced to the quantity of about 150g or 200g of meat about 150g 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:46.340
 How would it be if I tried it, as I did now 

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:49.360
 Take out the meat and boil down who 

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.360
 Please finish 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.000
 Pork ginger 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.630
 Let's start with the first step here 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.630
 Thank you
