the first application we'll show you is

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.149 
the first application we'll show you is
just<00:01:36.119> by<00:01:36.270> using<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.750> Flex<00:01:37.020> mount<00:01:37.229> itself<00:01:37.619> so

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
just by using the Flex mount itself so

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.130 
just by using the Flex mount itself so
again<00:01:38.460> we'll<00:01:38.670> use<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> quick<00:01:39.630> snap<00:01:39.930> off

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
again we'll use the quick snap off

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.920 
again we'll use the quick snap off
release<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:41.460> got<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> helmet<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.119> which<00:01:42.420> this

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.690 
view so now we have a mountain bike here
that<00:02:06.840> we're<00:02:07.020> going<00:02:07.200> ahead<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.590> clamp<00:02:08.009> flex

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700

mount directly to the handlebars of our

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.280 
mount directly to the handlebars of our
bike<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.739> we'll<00:02:11.099> be

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
bike and we'll be

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.130 
bike and we'll be
to<00:02:11.439> spin<00:02:12.069> this<00:02:12.219> around<00:02:12.370> get<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:12.909> GoPro<00:02:13.150> facing

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
to spin this around get the GoPro facing

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.990 
to spin this around get the GoPro facing
forward<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.950> then<00:02:15.310> we'll<00:02:15.489> just<00:02:15.700> tighten<00:02:15.879> down

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
forward and then we'll just tighten down

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.599 
forward and then we'll just tighten down
that<00:02:16.120> ratcheting<00:02:16.659> strap<00:02:17.159> and<00:02:18.159> again<00:02:18.430> that's

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:18.609 
that ratcheting strap and again that's

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.339 
that ratcheting strap and again that's
just<00:02:18.790> gonna<00:02:18.879> make<00:02:19.329> sure<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.659> creates<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:20.019> really

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
just gonna make sure it creates a really

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.229 
just gonna make sure it creates a really
really<00:02:20.590> nice<00:02:20.739> hold<00:02:21.040> nice<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.670> snug

really nice hold nice and snug
so<00:02:22.689> then<00:02:22.780> what<00:02:22.900> we<00:02:22.989> can<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.469> this<00:02:23.590> Sena<00:02:23.859> I'll

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
so then what we can do is this Sena I'll

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.190 
so then what we can do is this Sena I'll
adjust<00:02:24.519> this<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:25.150> be<00:02:25.540> able<00:02:25.689> to<00:02:25.780> see<00:02:25.930> pretty

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
adjust this to be able to see pretty

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.610 
adjust this to be able to see pretty
much<00:02:26.319> any<00:02:26.560> view<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.400> we're<00:02:27.549> looking<00:02:27.879> at<00:02:28.620> also

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
much any view and we're looking at also

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.069 
much any view and we're looking at also
to<00:02:29.920> get<00:02:30.159> some<00:02:30.400> reaction<00:02:30.909> shots<00:02:31.209> while<00:02:31.840> you're
