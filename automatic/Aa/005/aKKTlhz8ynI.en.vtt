 small family multicooker with a large 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.040
 volume and steamed

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.140
 steam after cooking choosing this feature you 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.330
 Do not risk getting burned after opening

 programming function you need 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.350
 will only load the cereal and put 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.630
 a timer and in the morning a car make porridge 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.390
 look also at the mode and the miracle 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.300
 pan every decent multicooker

 can cook pilaf buckwheat dairy 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.869
 porridge pastries 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.119
 dish steamed and steamed dishes but 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.860
 uncoated material multicooker on 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.700
 taste and does not reflect 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.060
 as for the internal blast they have 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.750
 all practically goes non-stick 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.320
 non - stick coating 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.720
 rarely where ceramics are found 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.090
 usually attached to the multicooker book 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.729
 with recipes where the number is indicated 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.110
 products as well as time or program 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.250
 you need to set for 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.420
 cooking dishes 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.090
 if the power is allowed to do less 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.530
 then it will be languishing accordingly 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.530
 here you can cook 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.979
 let's say some dish on 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.290
 just crash on function if we 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.220
 we increase the power here already 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.500
 happens 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.890
 seeing something sacrifices fashion why fry 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.900
 complex or soup by the way many ask 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.920
 what is the difference between a double boiler 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.530
 multicooker and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.280
 smoking with the difference between a double boiler and 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.660
 multicooker harder if we take 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.020
 a double boiler and a slow cooker then they are disana 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.910
 differ in that in the multicooker function 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.360
 steamers there is a steamer it is 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.910
 a couple here are some functions you need 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.980
 you can do without any better 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.959
 decide before going to the store 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.000

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.100
 brought you only pleasure and 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.100
