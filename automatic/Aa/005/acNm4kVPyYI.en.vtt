00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
we're starting to work on taking apart

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.789 
we're starting to work on taking apart
your<00:02:03.329> very<00:02:03.600> subframe<00:02:04.110> check<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.619> here

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
your very subframe check it out here

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.260 
your very subframe check it out here
electrical<00:02:05.340> along<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> way<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.149> it's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
electrical along the way and it's

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.160 
electrical along the way and it's
probably<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.930> guy

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
probably the guy

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949 
probably the guy
that<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.099> bike<00:02:08.280> before<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.360> just

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
that on the bike before you but just

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.320 
that on the bike before you but just
want<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> make<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.470> where<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.800> found<00:02:11.069> this

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
want to make you where we found this

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.809 
want to make you where we found this
stray<00:02:12.330> ground<00:02:12.750> wire<00:02:13.080> could<00:02:13.410> just<00:02:13.819> connected

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
stray ground wire could just connected

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.400 
stray ground wire could just connected
it<00:02:14.880> with<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.239> right<00:02:15.510> here<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.870> pushed<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.319> in

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
it with this right here and pushed it in

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.550 
it with this right here and pushed it in
this<00:02:16.530> connector<00:02:17.099> which<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:18.330> know<00:02:18.560> not

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
this connector which is you know not

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.180 
this connector which is you know not
very<00:02:19.590> good<00:02:20.390> because<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.620> bad<00:02:22.830> ground

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
very good because you have a bad ground

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.650 
very good because you have a bad ground
I<00:02:23.430> could<00:02:23.489> throw<00:02:23.790> everything<00:02:24.060> off<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.540> we're

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
I could throw everything off so we're

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.030 
I could throw everything off so we're
going<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.840> fix<00:02:25.020> out<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.560> when<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:25.770> put<00:02:25.800> it

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
going to fix out for you when we put it

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.770 
going to fix out for you when we put it
back<00:02:26.069> together<00:02:26.340> we're<00:02:27.239> going<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.450> do<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> nice

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
back together we're going to do a nice

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.840 
back together we're going to do a nice
solder<00:02:28.140> job<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.770> each<00:02:28.920> shrink<00:02:29.250> tubing<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.819> a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
solder job with each shrink tubing on a

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.670 
solder job with each shrink tubing on a
new<00:02:30.000> connector<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.440> doesn't

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
new connector so that that doesn't

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.590 
new connector so that that doesn't
vibrate<00:02:31.950> off<00:02:32.340> when<00:02:32.580> you're<00:02:32.730> coming<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.420> down

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
just FYI you can kind of see where that

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.660 
just FYI you can kind of see where that
wire<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:55.440> kind<00:02:55.739> of<00:02:55.769> taped<00:02:56.010> into<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.459> and

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
wire is just kind of taped into it and

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.850 
wire is just kind of taped into it and
that's<00:02:57.510> probably<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:57.930> an<00:02:58.140> afterthought<00:02:58.620> you

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
that's probably just an afterthought you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.500 
that's probably just an afterthought you
know<00:02:58.980> try<00:02:59.250> let's<00:02:59.519> try<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.760> out<00:03:00.090> see<00:03:00.330> if<00:03:00.360> it

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
know try let's try this out see if it

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.809 
know try let's try this out see if it
works<00:03:00.660> okay<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.350> thinking<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.190> get<00:03:02.340> back<00:03:02.549> to

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
works okay and thinking that get back to

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.020 
works okay and thinking that get back to
it<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.180> often<00:03:04.080> times<00:03:04.489> doesn't<00:03:05.489> ever<00:03:05.700> get<00:03:05.850> back

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
it but often times doesn't ever get back

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.660 
it but often times doesn't ever get back
to<00:03:06.269> as<00:03:06.360> long<00:03:06.510> as<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.720> keeps<00:03:06.840> working<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.670> we

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
to as long as it keeps working so we

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.979 
to as long as it keeps working so we
know<00:03:08.819> there's<00:03:09.030> two<00:03:09.180> grounds<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:09.840> that

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
know there's two grounds there that

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.220 
know there's two grounds there that
we're<00:03:10.080> going<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.260> fix<00:03:10.440> up<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.950> buddy<00:03:11.220> and
