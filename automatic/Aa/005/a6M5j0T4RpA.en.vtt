00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.359
 hello to all 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.359
 here star in the art that we're going to ask myself too 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.569
 it is a line of art with a marble technique 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.869
 I decided to do it in yellow green 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.640
 thule chante 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.450
 I try and you can use the colors you prefer you can pick with 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.029
 shapes with nuances 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.899
 initial nemo 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.090
 I understood 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090
 this enamel 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.460
 in this morning here 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 acid yellow 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 which then you will see fidal belts 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.670
 if you don't have a tasty one, it can be good 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.830
 netter low enamel 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.830
 and careful 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.970
 dysfunction 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.970
 the shape of the shades I would like to have 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.310
 put bondante enamel because it must remain fresh and must be possible 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.310
 mix 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.990
 so I am very likely to go out 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.150
 nail board stores 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.140
 so be prepared 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.130
 m that creates link after I should you 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.490
 use the nicolini vinegar 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.930
 then we come the other enamel 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.080
 the facility 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 let's continue our team. 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.190
 mix 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.570
 you are not satisfied because maybe 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.800
 and you too in this case ruby â€‹â€‹all-around 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.540
 in time 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.909
 the small call 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.710
 add above 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.710
 booking.com 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.749
 yes to you too and he is immediately cynical but in Christ. it does not mean - 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.789
 side sends 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:30.789
 a little english translation on tv 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.719
 but that fills the eyes. 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.399
 wait for us to shelby and then 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:50.399
 let's put it below 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:55.089
 these nuances I got 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.839
 I hope I liked the onew allergic dog idea 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:09.539
