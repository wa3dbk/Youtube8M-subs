00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:15.600 

I<00:00:12.599> started<00:00:13.599> out<00:00:13.690> with<00:00:13.750> the<00:00:14.139> concept<00:00:14.830> late<00:00:15.160> in

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
I started out with the concept late in

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.420 
I started out with the concept late in
2009<00:00:16.539> where<00:00:16.990> I<00:00:17.019> was<00:00:17.410> working<00:00:17.560> on<00:00:17.770> a<00:00:17.830> capstone

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
2009 where I was working on a capstone

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.700 
2009 where I was working on a capstone
design<00:00:18.550> project<00:00:18.730> and<00:00:19.539> my<00:00:19.720> senior<00:00:20.080> biomedical

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
design project and my senior biomedical

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.189 
design project and my senior biomedical
engineering<00:00:21.100> program<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:22.210> we<00:00:22.630> were<00:00:22.779> assigned

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
engineering program and we were assigned

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.920 
engineering program and we were assigned
the<00:00:23.320> task<00:00:23.380> of<00:00:23.859> designing<00:00:24.010> a<00:00:24.520> mobility<00:00:25.480> device

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
the task of designing a mobility device

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.900 
the task of designing a mobility device
for<00:00:26.320> a<00:00:26.350> small<00:00:26.770> boy<00:00:26.920> in<00:00:27.189> Kenya<00:00:27.519> named<00:00:27.699> Ishmael

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
for a small boy in Kenya named Ishmael

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.910 
for a small boy in Kenya named Ishmael
because<00:00:28.630> he<00:00:28.840> couldn't<00:00:29.140> use<00:00:29.170> his<00:00:29.289> wheelchair

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
because he couldn't use his wheelchair

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.130 
because he couldn't use his wheelchair
on<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.699> rough<00:00:30.910> terrain<00:00:31.090> that<00:00:31.449> was<00:00:31.570> in<00:00:31.720> Africa

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
on the rough terrain that was in Africa

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.989 
on the rough terrain that was in Africa
and<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.859> problem<00:00:33.129> with<00:00:33.250> wheelchairs<00:00:33.729> over

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:33.999 
and the problem with wheelchairs over

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:35.700 
and the problem with wheelchairs over
there<00:00:34.149> is<00:00:34.329> that<00:00:34.539> the<00:00:34.690> terrain<00:00:34.989> does<00:00:35.530> not

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
there is that the terrain does not

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.849 
there is that the terrain does not
support<00:00:36.269> wheelchairs<00:00:37.269> because<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.589> front

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
support wheelchairs because the front

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.069 
support wheelchairs because the front
wheel<00:00:39.039> of<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.370> wheelchair<00:00:40.179> basically<00:00:40.839> gets

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
wheel of the wheelchair basically gets

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.689 
wheel of the wheelchair basically gets
stuck<00:00:41.350> and<00:00:41.530> so<00:00:41.769> we<00:00:41.920> wanted<00:00:42.159> to<00:00:42.309> create<00:00:42.489> an

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
stuck and so we wanted to create an

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.700 
stuck and so we wanted to create an
attachable<00:00:43.120> hand<00:00:43.389> cycle<00:00:43.780> that<00:00:44.260> would<00:00:44.409> be<00:00:44.530> able

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
attachable hand cycle that would be able

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.979 
attachable hand cycle that would be able
to<00:00:45.100> alleviate<00:00:45.819> some<00:00:45.999> of<00:00:46.030> that<00:00:46.149> problem<00:00:46.479> but

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
to alleviate some of that problem but

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.899 
to alleviate some of that problem but
allow<00:00:47.229> him<00:00:47.499> to<00:00:47.769> become<00:00:48.129> independent<00:00:48.879> and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
allow him to become independent and

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.579 
allow him to become independent and
travel<00:00:49.299> to<00:00:49.359> school<00:00:49.600> by<00:00:49.719> himself<00:00:49.780> so<00:00:50.199> we<00:00:50.319> built

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
travel to school by himself so we built

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.500 
travel to school by himself so we built
him<00:00:50.679> an<00:00:50.829> attachable<00:00:51.219> hand<00:00:51.459> cycle<00:00:51.909> that

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
him an attachable hand cycle that

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.569 
him an attachable hand cycle that
basically<00:00:52.899> attaches<00:00:53.469> to<00:00:53.619> his<00:00:53.649> wheelchair<00:00:54.459> and

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
basically attaches to his wheelchair and

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.149 
basically attaches to his wheelchair and
turns<00:00:54.969> it<00:00:55.119> into<00:00:55.179> a<00:00:55.389> hamper<00:00:55.809> pub<00:00:56.019> tricycle<00:00:56.709> he's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
turns it into a hamper pub tricycle he's

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.399 
turns it into a hamper pub tricycle he's
doing<00:00:57.729> very<00:00:57.760> well<00:00:58.089> he's<00:00:58.629> still<00:00:59.109> going<00:00:59.319> to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
doing very well he's still going to

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.829 
doing very well he's still going to
school<00:00:59.679> and<00:00:59.949> he's<00:01:00.940> greatly<00:01:01.239> benefitting<00:01:01.809> from

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
school and he's greatly benefitting from

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.749 
school and he's greatly benefitting from
our<00:01:02.170> hands<00:01:02.589> like<00:01:05.070> we're<00:01:06.070> looking<00:01:06.430> to<00:01:06.549> convert

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
our hands like we're looking to convert

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.480 
our hands like we're looking to convert
the<00:01:07.119> metal<00:01:07.450> pieces<00:01:07.869> that<00:01:08.200> we<00:01:08.320> initially<00:01:09.189> built

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
the metal pieces that we initially built

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.789 
the metal pieces that we initially built
the<00:01:09.700> first<00:01:09.969> prototype<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:11.170> more<00:01:11.590> sustainable

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
the first prototype to more sustainable

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:13.770 
the first prototype to more sustainable
materials<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:12.850> one<00:01:12.939> of<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.119> logical

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
materials and one of the logical

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.469 
materials and one of the logical
materials<00:01:14.590> was<00:01:14.710> bamboo<00:01:15.189> which<00:01:15.939> turns<00:01:16.180> out<00:01:16.329> to

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
materials was bamboo which turns out to

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.749 
materials was bamboo which turns out to
be<00:01:16.509> a<00:01:17.049> very<00:01:17.350> interesting<00:01:17.829> material<00:01:18.219> to<00:01:18.579> use

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
be a very interesting material to use

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.219 
be a very interesting material to use
that<00:01:18.969> grows<00:01:19.179> in<00:01:19.420> many<00:01:19.600> parts<00:01:19.899> of<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.049> world

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
that grows in many parts of the world

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.370 
that grows in many parts of the world
including<00:01:20.409> Africa<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.939> it<00:01:22.359> grows<00:01:22.539> very<00:01:23.020> fast

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
including Africa and it grows very fast

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.679 
including Africa and it grows very fast
about<00:01:23.770> a<00:01:23.920> foot<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.189> day<00:01:24.399> there's<00:01:24.820> about<00:01:25.000> 1,500

about a foot a day there's about 1,500
species<00:01:25.929> we<00:01:26.799> looked<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:27.039> whole<00:01:27.280> bunch<00:01:27.549> of<00:01:27.700> our

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
species we looked a whole bunch of our

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.819 
species we looked a whole bunch of our
bamboo<00:01:28.210> that<00:01:28.390> we<00:01:28.450> never<00:01:28.600> knew<00:01:28.840> before<00:01:28.990> it

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
bamboo that we never knew before it

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.289 
bamboo that we never knew before it
opened<00:01:30.130> up<00:01:30.159> a<00:01:30.280> whole<00:01:30.490> new<00:01:30.520> dimension<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:31.179> our

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
opened up a whole new dimension to our

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.260 
opened up a whole new dimension to our
program<00:01:31.929> and<00:01:32.200> just<00:01:32.740> one<00:01:33.070> example<00:01:33.219> of<00:01:33.789> probably

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
program and just one example of probably

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.060 
program and just one example of probably
fifty<00:01:34.749> or<00:01:34.840> sixty<00:01:35.049> devices<00:01:35.770> that<00:01:35.950> we've

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
fifty or sixty devices that we've

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.919 
fifty or sixty devices that we've
designed<00:01:36.249> and<00:01:36.640> built<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.149> have<00:01:37.329> in<00:01:37.630> different

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
designed and built and have in different

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.050 
designed and built and have in different
countries<00:01:38.590> in<00:01:38.770> Africa<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:42.130> boo<00:01:42.340> good<00:01:42.579> was<00:01:42.909> an

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
countries in Africa but boo good was an

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.599 
countries in Africa but boo good was an
evolution<00:01:43.600> of<00:01:43.749> that<00:01:43.929> design<00:01:44.439> and<00:01:44.829> one<00:01:45.399> of<00:01:45.520> the

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
evolution of that design and one of the

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.219 
evolution of that design and one of the
things<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:46.060> we're<00:01:46.210> hoping<00:01:46.659> to<00:01:46.719> see<00:01:46.990> in<00:01:47.109> our

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
things that we're hoping to see in our

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.080 
things that we're hoping to see in our
program<00:01:47.740> is<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:47.979> our<00:01:48.280> students<00:01:48.700> can<00:01:48.850> take

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
program is that our students can take

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.870 
program is that our students can take
their<00:01:49.539> design<00:01:50.229> projects<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.429> a<00:01:51.460> real-world

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
their design projects that a real-world

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.730 
their design projects that a real-world
projects<00:01:52.450> enabled<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:52.960> move<00:01:53.140> them<00:01:53.350> out<00:01:53.499> into

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
projects enabled to move them out into

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.099 
projects enabled to move them out into
the<00:01:53.950> real<00:01:54.429> world<00:01:54.460> customers<00:01:55.450> they<00:01:55.659> need<00:01:55.869> these

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
the real world customers they need these

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.770 
the real world customers they need these
devices<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.429> we<00:01:57.670> wanted<00:01:57.939> to<00:01:58.119> do<00:01:58.420> something

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
devices and so we wanted to do something

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.539 
devices and so we wanted to do something
that<00:01:59.049> would<00:01:59.170> attract<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.770> lot<00:01:59.979> of<00:02:00.009> people<00:02:00.369> and

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
that would attract a lot of people and

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.830 
that would attract a lot of people and
that's<00:02:00.609> why<00:02:00.789> we<00:02:00.939> chose<00:02:01.149> bamboo<00:02:01.659> bicycle

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
that's why we chose bamboo bicycle

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.410 
that's why we chose bamboo bicycle
because<00:02:02.590> during<00:02:03.249> the<00:02:03.549> process<00:02:03.969> that<00:02:03.999> we<00:02:04.270> were

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
because during the process that we were

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.959 
because during the process that we were
researching<00:02:04.929> bamboo<00:02:05.380> we<00:02:06.039> were<00:02:06.219> looking<00:02:06.729> into

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
researching bamboo we were looking into

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.969 
researching bamboo we were looking into
a<00:02:06.999> lot<00:02:07.240> of<00:02:07.299> how<00:02:07.630> bikes<00:02:08.080> were<00:02:08.289> constructed

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
a lot of how bikes were constructed

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.160 
a lot of how bikes were constructed
from<00:02:09.129> bamboo<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.629> we<00:02:10.840> thought<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:11.080> would

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
from bamboo and so we thought it would

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.800 
from bamboo and so we thought it would
be<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.290> great<00:02:11.530> idea<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:12.340> start<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.420> place<00:02:13.629> like

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
be a great idea to start in a place like

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.240 
be a great idea to start in a place like
the<00:02:13.930> issue<00:02:14.049> where<00:02:14.470> there's<00:02:14.650> great<00:02:14.860> like

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the issue where there's great like

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.710 
the issue where there's great like
community<00:02:15.730> here<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.670> our<00:02:18.879> our<00:02:19.120> whole<00:02:19.330> business

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
community here so our our whole business

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.589

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
plan is we sell you a bike and for each

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.839 
plan is we sell you a bike and for each
bike<00:02:22.840> we<00:02:23.019> sell<00:02:23.260> it'll<00:02:23.680> directly<00:02:24.129> fund<00:02:24.489> the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
donating the hand cycles because that

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.789 
donating the hand cycles because that
doesn't<00:02:31.360> support<00:02:31.480> their<00:02:31.780> local<00:02:31.959> economy<00:02:32.560> over

know about it as much as possible we're
not<00:02:59.590> just<00:02:59.769> a<00:02:59.799> bamf<00:02:59.950> inflexible<00:03:00.549> company<00:03:00.940> but

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
not just a bamf inflexible company but

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
do good out there and so research plays

do good out there and so research plays
a<00:03:05.440> really<00:03:05.829> big<00:03:06.190> role<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:06.700> helping<00:03:07.359> us<00:03:07.660> improve

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
some of ideas that that we have I can

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.520 
some of ideas that that we have I can
think<00:03:12.069> of<00:03:12.190> no<00:03:12.340> better<00:03:12.370> way<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:13.269> train<00:03:13.690> students

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
think of no better way to train students

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.949 
think of no better way to train students
and<00:03:14.919> these<00:03:15.310> kinds<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.790> efforts<00:03:15.970> where<00:03:16.480> they

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
and these kinds of efforts where they

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.500 
and these kinds of efforts where they
understand<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:18.069> importance<00:03:18.609> of<00:03:18.819> their<00:03:19.120> their

understand the importance of their their
training<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:20.230> how<00:03:20.980> they<00:03:21.130> can<00:03:21.190> make<00:03:21.310> a

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
training and how they can make a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.910 
training and how they can make a
difference<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.090> world
