I<00:02:29.010> have<00:02:29.130> gotten<00:02:29.370> one<00:02:29.760> end<00:02:30.000> out<00:02:34.640> there<00:02:35.640> we<00:02:35.730> go

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
I have gotten one end out there we go

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
putting in the new Ram you see that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.040 
putting in the new Ram you see that
there<00:02:43.110> is<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.800> longer<00:02:44.790> side<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.690> shorter

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
backwards camera but you'll know which

way<00:02:53.550> to<00:02:54.110> put<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.260> RAM<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.860> it's<00:02:56.040> just<00:02:56.970> as

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
way to put the RAM in so it's just as

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.920

Ram<00:03:14.940> has<00:03:15.270> just<00:03:15.510> been<00:03:15.660> upgraded<00:03:15.870> from<00:03:16.410> four

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
Ram has just been upgraded from four

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.230 
Ram has just been upgraded from four
gigabytes<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:19.020> eight<00:03:19.260> gigabytes<00:03:19.830> in<00:03:20.160> under<00:03:21.030> a

gigabytes to eight gigabytes in under a

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.240 
gigabytes to eight gigabytes in under a
minute<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.840> would<00:03:21.900> say<00:03:22.170> maybe<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.800> little<00:03:23.040> longer

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
minute I would say maybe a little longer

since<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.940> didn't<00:03:24.270> show<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.660> time<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.080> take

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
since I didn't show you the time to take

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.500 
since I didn't show you the time to take
out<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.590> screws<00:03:25.950> I'd<00:03:26.760> say<00:03:27.000> total<00:03:27.810> time<00:03:29.510> five

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
out the screws I'd say total time five

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.600 
out the screws I'd say total time five
