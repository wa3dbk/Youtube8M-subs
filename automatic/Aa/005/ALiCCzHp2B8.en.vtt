00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.269
 hello to all how to make a 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.120
 hat of painters of the fifteenth 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:13.570
 century I present you 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.919
 nathalie my model who wears this 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.939
 famous painter's hat 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:24.310
 I must say that it suits him rather well 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.109
 in fact I wanted to make him a hat 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.569
 white but he would not have stayed white 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:35.260
 long as you can 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:40.030
 nathalie enjoy painting that 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:43.000
 I say the color let's see now 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.970
 how to make such a hat is 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.210
 easy even for me who does not know 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.550
 nothing in sewing 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.260
 luckily I know how to use a 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.730
 stapler like what sewing here from 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.570
 fast and solid 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.350
 attention to tight the staples side 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.010
 inside and that's it and there is no need 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.010
 to be pro 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.380
 in order to achieve such a hat 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.860
 painter 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.580
 let's see what you need 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.460
 tissue falls that's easy 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:29.720
 a pair of scissors a ribbon master 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.690
 much more practical than a rule of 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:39.670
 pins and of course wire and a 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:42.560
 needle or stapler to start 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:46.510
 you have to cut 12 small ones 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:52.270
 rectangles of 8 cm by sixteen centimeters 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:55.730
 of the color of your choice then 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.680
 cut out these little rectangles in shape 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.680
 peak of flags 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:19.450
 you have to realize now the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:25.990
 seams on the outer sides the edges 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.990
 external and assemble the 12 pieces 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.530
 now I propose you to realize the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.450
 band that lies between the top and the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.200
 hat's bottom cut out a rectangle of 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:58.040
 fabric of the color of your choice of which 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.640
 the height is 5 or 6 centimeters on 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.450
 a length equal to the perimeter of your 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.340
 head + 2 cm for sewing 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:12.709
 I remind you that the perimeter is 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:16.400
 equal to two stones then realize the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.790
 sewing in order to get this ring of 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.790
 fabric 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:28.520
 well after making the 12 pieces 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.700
 assembly and the cloth ring and he 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.090
 you just need to sew these twelve 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.950
 pieces at assemblies on one of 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.950
 ends of this ring 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.510
 let's see how 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:01.660
 make the base of your hat 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:09.510
 cut into aurons whose diameter will be 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:13.810
 equal to the diameter of your head + 6 cm 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:17.769
 redraw a circle at the equal center 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.760
 here at the diameter of your head - 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.760
 2 cm 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.520
 now made small cuts of 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.690
 1 cm 5 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:36.050
 all around the small diameter then 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:40.550
 assemble this little round with the top of the 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:44.390
 hat already made you can 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.810
 improve rigidity with the help of a 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.810
 cardboard 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.630
 here is the result in images and video 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.630
 Thank you for your attention
