00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
in like a helicopter or something like

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.270 
in like a helicopter or something like
that<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.170> we're<00:00:46.410> gonna<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.770> over<00:00:46.800> there<00:00:47.250> right

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
now and hopefully it is everything that

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.020 
now and hopefully it is everything that
I<00:00:51.719> think<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.129> haven't<00:00:53.670> seen<00:00:53.850> any
