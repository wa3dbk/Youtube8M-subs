across<00:05:15.040> the<00:05:15.580> dividing<00:05:16.150> lines<00:05:16.360> between<00:05:16.570> the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
across the dividing lines between the

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.440 
across the dividing lines between the
pink<00:05:17.050> and<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:17.230> blue<00:05:17.290> on<00:05:17.800> all<00:05:18.250> of<00:05:18.430> nails<00:05:18.730> see
