turn<00:04:13.410> off<00:04:13.650> with<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.040> remote<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.900> can<00:04:16.049> see

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
turn off with a remote and you can see

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.849 
turn off with a remote and you can see
that's<00:04:16.669> non-illuminated<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.840> my<00:04:19.470> opinion

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
that's non-illuminated so my opinion

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.620 
that's non-illuminated so my opinion
looks<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.160> lot<00:04:20.280> better<00:04:20.459> with<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.030> illumination

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
looks a lot better with the illumination

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.050 
looks a lot better with the illumination
on<00:04:21.780> it<00:04:21.930> I'm<00:04:22.890> sure<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.220> camera<00:04:23.580> gives<00:04:23.760> it<00:04:23.940> a

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
on it I'm sure the camera gives it a

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
on it I'm sure the camera gives it a
pretty<00:04:24.570> nasty<00:04:24.780> glare<00:04:25.200> but<00:04:25.500> in

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
pretty nasty glare but in

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.010 
pretty nasty glare but in
person<00:04:26.439> actually<00:04:27.129> is<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.580> looks<00:04:28.569> pretty<00:04:28.840> decent

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
person actually is a looks pretty decent

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.709 
person actually is a looks pretty decent
so<00:04:32.759> that's<00:04:33.759> pretty<00:04:34.000> much<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.210> i'll<00:04:34.509> show<00:04:34.659> you

as<00:05:11.379> far<00:05:11.650> as<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.860> paintwork<00:05:12.400> goes<00:05:12.789> in<00:05:13.479> my

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
as far as the paintwork goes in my

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.510 
as far as the paintwork goes in my
opinion<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.169> was<00:05:14.319> a<00:05:14.349> little<00:05:15.099> bit<00:05:15.250> more<00:05:15.460> of

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
opinion that was a little bit more of

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.450 
opinion that was a little bit more of
the<00:05:15.610> tougher<00:05:16.440> time<00:05:17.440> consuming<00:05:17.949> part<00:05:18.190> i

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
the tougher time consuming part i

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.279 
the tougher time consuming part i
enjoyed<00:05:19.210> working<00:05:19.419> on<00:05:19.659> the<00:05:19.719> mechanics<00:05:20.169> the

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
enjoyed working on the mechanics the

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.619 
enjoyed working on the mechanics the
most<00:05:20.529> so<00:05:20.800> this<00:05:21.279> one<00:05:21.460> suited<00:05:21.819> me<00:05:21.969> very<00:05:22.210> well<00:05:22.419> for

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
most so this one suited me very well for

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.429 
most so this one suited me very well for
