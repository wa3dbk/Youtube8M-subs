decided that public workers needed to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
decided that public workers needed to
have<00:00:48.719> their<00:00:48.870> benefits<00:00:49.110> reduced<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.950> their

as<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.860> mentioned<00:00:52.890> they<00:00:53.340> would<00:00:53.489> have<00:00:53.699> most

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
as I mentioned they would have most

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.610 
as I mentioned they would have most
their<00:00:54.300> collective<00:00:54.719> bargaining<00:00:55.140> rights<00:00:55.320> taken

their collective bargaining rights taken
away<00:00:55.860> too<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> would<00:00:56.789> be<00:00:56.879> very<00:00:57.210> difficult

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
away too so it would be very difficult

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270

to<00:00:57.809> ever<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.379> any<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> those<00:00:58.800> concessions

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to ever get any of those concessions

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
to ever get any of those concessions
back<00:00:59.670> even<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.180> economic<00:01:00.719> times<00:01:00.960> got<00:01:01.230> better

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
back even when economic times got better

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500 
back even when economic times got better
can<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.829> imagine<00:01:01.920> how<00:01:02.399> demotivating<00:01:03.390> that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
would be if that was your job the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.440 
would be if that was your job the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
issue when asked about these cuts Walker

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.910 
issue when asked about these cuts Walker
always<00:01:17.369> says<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.850> he<00:01:18.090> had<00:01:18.630> no<00:01:18.990> choice<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
always says that he had no choice so I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.320 
always says that he had no choice so I
guess<00:01:20.040> he<00:01:20.250> had<00:01:20.369> no<00:01:20.520> choice<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> give<00:01:21.090> millions

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
