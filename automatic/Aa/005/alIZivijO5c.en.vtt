these days means manufacturing your own

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.309 
these days means manufacturing your own
movements<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.879> if<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.090> would<00:02:09.300> say<00:02:09.509> simply<00:02:10.050> to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
movements so if you would say simply to

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.030 
movements so if you would say simply to
the<00:02:10.500> consumer<00:02:11.069> what<00:02:11.250> are<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.430> three

significant attributes of a parallel
watch<00:02:15.409> I<00:02:15.739> would<00:02:15.950> say<00:02:16.159> that<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.959> quality<00:02:17.959> of

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
watch I would say that the quality of

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.479 
watch I would say that the quality of
our<00:02:18.319> movements<00:02:18.799> which<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.159> the<00:02:19.310> most

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
our movements which is the most

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.920 
our movements which is the most
important<00:02:19.969> part<00:02:20.269> of<00:02:20.359> the<00:02:20.480> watch<00:02:20.659> the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
important part of the watch the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.660 
important part of the watch the
heartbeat<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.409> the<00:02:21.530> watch<00:02:21.680> all<00:02:22.310> of<00:02:22.340> our

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
heartbeat of the watch all of our

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.729 
heartbeat of the watch all of our
movements<00:02:22.879> are<00:02:23.180> made<00:02:23.450> for<00:02:23.840> parallel<00:02:24.319> watches

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
movements are made for parallel watches

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.599 
movements are made for parallel watches
and<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.459> have<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.730> seamless<00:02:27.609> construction

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
and so you have a seamless construction

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.289 
and so you have a seamless construction
of<00:02:28.790> parts<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:30.140> work<00:02:30.379> better<00:02:30.650> than<00:02:30.980> when<00:02:31.549> some

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299

because so much of our watch is based on
the<00:05:10.880> movement<00:05:11.479> of<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:11.690> turbine<00:05:12.139> dial<00:05:12.410> and

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
the movement of the turbine dial and

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.400 
the movement of the turbine dial and
