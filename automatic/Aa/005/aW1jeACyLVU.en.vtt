00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 it's the ultimate beauty today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.779
 decided to show you how to make a 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.870
 buzz then there will be two methods 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.920
 a first by doing that and so I 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.580
 will show you several ways 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.100
 to use but also simply 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.070
 with small pockets but if you 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.779
 know them like that for the beautiful of 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.630
 bobs feet which small 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.410
 waves of characters too he will have my 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.970
 kind of trip because sometimes we did not 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.800
 not necessarily and then it's good 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.969
 simply by also cutting a 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.420
 sock but I'm not going to get you 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.030
 show 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.770
 there is enough tutorial for us 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.910
 show how you did it all 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.160
 simply start with 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.079
 to tie our hair here we are 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.020
 now the hair attached as 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.840
 plan after you decide if you 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.219
 want to make a little buzz in front of this 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.110
 little manon in front of me I'll stay 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.850
 like that it will be just to show you 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.890
 so here it's sure it's a little strict 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.380
 a little tight a little weird but 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.190
 because after that it's very simple and so 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.820
 now back then go 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.150
 your choice is around your tail of 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.280
 horse 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.440
 you're in two ways at this time 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.240
 there to use the first way that's fine 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.300
 to be taking hair and rolling up 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.070
 gradually to the roof is true that you 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.070
 start turning with the rest 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.830
 here are the sailboats even doming 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.470
 need to install hair eating that 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.540
 hold or that type so it's a method 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.180
 I am rather than a 3 man 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.990
 in fact what is nice with that is 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.640
 that there is movement 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.410
 it 's not just the things that are 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.970
 who will make in cash a species 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.620
 spider on the way we see that it 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.750
 get by in hair to know with 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.330
 the matches why there is movement 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:11.130
 the second is to take all my 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:13.170
 hair she is brought back around your 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.890
 socks where it's also called his 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.890
 skin if a crime 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.590
 the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.480
 you bring them back the mood had to run 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.300
 all 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.890
 that's what's up and you put a 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.890
 elastic at this level 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.370
 here we are 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.580
 last two it's not great and I 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.430
 guaranteed to you tomorrow or more and after 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.400
 you take your hair and he 'll have to 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.150
 actually use this elastic so 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.769
 you take your hair and you 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.890
 want it want you to come from 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.890
 make 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.290
 so we can see that it had to stay 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.090
 'very people there were very dark and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.160
 you see on the side that in relief in 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.770
 would guarantee that it was extensions 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.720
 which are added I will put you 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.610
 a small clip here you see 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.380
 with only one perfectly of course 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.350
 there are small wicks that will need 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:17.860
 lacquered and company but here are the facts 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.860
 the third version 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.770
 you have to remove it and it's yours 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.000
 ponytail 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:33.930
 like here is actually the goal it's going to be 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:38.220
 to roll your hair around like that 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.970
 from the start and then roll your 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.970
 hair back 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.880
 so again the lady at nesv is fine 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.310
 different behind do we have a little 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.410
 the impression that it makes a flower is 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.780
 rather cute it changes we do not see 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.400
 no points holds no tie and 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.640
 no hair always keeps the fun 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.910
 these are the three ways to do it with the 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.100
 crepon now i'm going to show you 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.570
 how can we make sense of it and you 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.640
 asked what is it really 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.260
 what here I guarantee you kobe ​​and 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.989
 I hope that the unofficial result 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.720
 that's what I'm going to lend you 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.330
 see do not use it I put it down and 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.340
 I told you that small tongs 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.080
 level of your hair you had 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.550
 laughed in five matches of course that's the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.070
 keep in hand you're not going to see you 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.820
 but it must be about 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.130
 the same thickness 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.860
 I already have you is pressed by 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.220
 udine 2 and then we can do three sets 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.080
 Okay 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.350
 a two and three so what's needed 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.620
 make 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.510
 we will take the first and you go 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.510
 roll them on itself 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:04.400
 see like that 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.400
 the points are well inside 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.919
 that's the genius thing 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.419
 we adhere a first pass actually 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.929
 where you have to take two to put 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:19.249
 one on each side 

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:22.969
 I can not talk to me then 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:23.509
 that's one of the things I'm attaching to 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.259
 skull 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:31.449
 is this the ponytail or one side 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.449
 and I do the same thing on the other 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.780
 So here you go after 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.449
 shoot me I want you to go see 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:44.340
 to be able to discard them so let's take 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:45.030
 now the second laich and we're going 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.610
 do the same 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.039
 see that we roll up well you take 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.380
 right of you and you roll like that 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.380
 around my hair 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.870
 to send a kind of loop 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:05.050
 in the box well and we left again 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.050
 tie and here you can see there 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:11.419
 that if now I pull them that 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:14.069
 begins to form the boeny did 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.080
 always the same job and so there 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:19.289
 I had three boeny guards almost 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.659
 which are made me two games left to 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.239
 do and you see we're going there a lot 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:27.479
 to arrive and the last one you see after 

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:31.550
 it will be more of the business fit and 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.550
 arms to pliers properly 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.060
 that's what it can give then you 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:45.750
 see that clarens it's almost as 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.910
 bulky than last it gives an effect 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.220
 of movement relative to each other because 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.110
 we see wicks and necessarily to his 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.639
 wrapped differently so it's still going 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.930
 to go do different now here 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:07:00.660
 that you know how to make a good chemistry 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.610
 with a crepe or just with just 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.919
 some parts but not on hand 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.760
 you see it's very simple and it gives 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:08.190
 different aspects 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.380
 so do not hesitate to test and 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.810
 to show me pictures of your 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:18.150
 achievements on the facebook page with 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:19.680
