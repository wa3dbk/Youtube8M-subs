00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.660
 the beauty fees are 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.120
 of the canon of beauty that can be more one-man a similar canons of 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.210
 classic beauty to the canons of Renaissance beauty we can stay here too 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.400
 so long to discuss what classic beauty is 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.609
 slope invitation mind can be divided into three parts 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.589
 it has an upper part my side and a lower part of the part 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.400
 lower we have two thirds 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.380
 occupied by this area is the third from the bottom we have the criteria 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.400
 of the golden rules so on not 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.820
 we will dwell on this 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.079
 but surely on television we have models 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.739
 that in certain cases it may be questionable to try not to 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.590
 to prove one's age despite having so many years 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.020
 wanting to go for extreme surgery and not even have one 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.300
 wrinkle 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.900
 60 70 80 years 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.880
 eh already a wrong assumption 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.990
 an assumption that guides us 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.640
 to ugliness 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.089
 in the same way 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.120
 wanting 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.500
 modify 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.930
 in a clamorous way its appearance maybe even following a model of 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.510
 objective beauty 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.890
 but that is no longer 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.100
 in harmony with what 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.030
 our face so let's look for models to be mi 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.470
 different from what we really are and this can be something 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.590
 debatable 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.520
 for example now in the field of aesthetic surgery we tend 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.229
 more and more we are doing practical examples going towards surgery 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.180
 minimally invasive 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.310
 they are getting less and less face-lift greater than the face 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.220
 it means 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.450
 make a water cut in front and I would like to go back in the hair give a 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.460
 large facial distension 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.590
 but this often happens 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.520
 in many cases we do not always see but often this comes at the expense of 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.360
 normal morphology of the vote we arrive at streming results not wanting either 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.119
 a rugal wanting to be 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:03.730
 pull at maximum 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.500
 which can often be counterproductive and which you do not 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.490
 like hey do a type of surgery that gods assemble 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.080
 incidence so here is the research we have instrument that I patented 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.090
 yamaha there are so many surgical techniques that look for a result 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.380
 more and more naturally we make an example this a patient a beautiful lady 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.640
 that water definitely 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.209
 a big face weight 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.819
 so we're going to negotiate 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:30.910
 problems 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.859
 imperfections 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.059
 at the level of the upper eyelid at the level of the lower eyelid 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:38.059
 surely there is an excess of skin 

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.349
 surely there is an excess of fat 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.950
 surely there is a cough which means a fall of the middle third of the face for 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.390
 to which we move away 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.240
 of the criteria of classical beauty we have a look that older than whacks 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.869
 actually the patient a 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:56.500
 and therefore it can make sense 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.090
 think of surgery in this patient for surgery 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.949
 surgical must be respectful 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:03.730
 of the morphology of the face 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.250
 he doesn't have to go looking for an extreme result but he has to go looking for a 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.309
 natural result therefore today 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:14.559
 we can get these results with surgery that can be minimally 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:18.309
 Minimally invasive invasive means that it can be done in the clinic 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:19.859
 do in d'eser jerry 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.620
 you can go home same day as grandma you go to work 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.530
 soirÃ©e too massive to do what is right to do 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.880
 if the patient looks tired, show her age 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.630
 and you can look more quickly but always looking for a natural result 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:40.799
 for which the evolution also of technology 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.529
 the evolution of surgical techniques allows us to have results 

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:47.039
 always better 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.239
 so that too 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.440
 and they have limits of our techniques as the techniques are rented 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.619
 cost us a lot this 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:58.169
 obviously 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.400
 does not mean that we must never again be the complete griffins of teen complete 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.299
 they make this patient 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.549
 we have very pronounced wrinkles we have a big failure of the whole 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.209
 a powerful face in the meadow but not even sixty years and coppi in a 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.710
 such a situation 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.300
 you can go on a major surgery this case as a hospitalization 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.789
 clinic and so on 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.759
 but the search for yahoo 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.410
 the elder result 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.900
 increasingly natural and always minimally invasive is a technical prerequisite 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.410
 important to our work 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.360
 which then also affects your Mac site 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.720
 definable more beautiful and better
