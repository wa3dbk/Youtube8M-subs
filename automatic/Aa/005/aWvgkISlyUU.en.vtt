or<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.979> know<00:01:54.100> kind<00:01:54.520> of<00:01:54.549> like<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:55.060> like<00:01:55.659> people

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
or you know kind of like and like people

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.499 
or you know kind of like and like people
are<00:01:56.079> exploiting<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.710> game<00:01:56.890> anyway<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.579> think

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
are exploiting the game anyway I think

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.639 
are exploiting the game anyway I think
this<00:01:58.570> is<00:01:58.659> a<00:01:58.689> cool<00:01:58.869> little<00:01:58.929> spot<00:01:59.259> to<00:01:59.499> someone

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
this is a cool little spot to someone

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.219 
this is a cool little spot to someone
found<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.369> now<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:00.939> is<00:02:00.969> being<00:02:01.149> used<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.659> lot<00:02:01.689> in

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
found and now it is being used a lot in

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.020
