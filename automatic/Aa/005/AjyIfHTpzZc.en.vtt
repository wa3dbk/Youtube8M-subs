00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
to do this is to take a cup and actually

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.889

put it in the leg of the stocking that

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.930 
put it in the leg of the stocking that
way<00:00:47.899> makes<00:00:48.109> it<00:00:48.199> easier<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:48.620> sew<00:00:48.829> on<00:00:49.039> cuz<00:00:49.850> the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
way makes it easier to sew on cuz the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.520 
way makes it easier to sew on cuz the
first<00:00:50.120> time<00:00:50.270> I<00:00:50.359> did<00:00:50.480> this<00:00:50.629> I<00:00:50.870> sewed<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.379> two

don't embellish your feet because that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.900 
don't embellish your feet because that
would<00:01:06.710> be<00:01:06.800> really<00:01:06.890> uncomfortable<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:07.520> walk<00:01:07.670> on

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
would be really uncomfortable to walk on

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.100 
would be really uncomfortable to walk on
yeah<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.740> I'm<00:01:10.040> gonna<00:01:10.160> start<00:01:10.490> about<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:11.060> foot<00:01:11.810> in

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
yeah so I'm gonna start about a foot in

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.650 
yeah so I'm gonna start about a foot in
to<00:01:12.830> stockings<00:01:13.790> and<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.030> whole<00:01:14.360> point<00:01:14.600> of

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
to stockings and the whole point of

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.810 
to stockings and the whole point of
using<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.050> lacy<00:01:15.350> pattern<00:01:15.740> stocking<00:01:16.520> it's

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
using the lacy pattern stocking it's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.179 
using the lacy pattern stocking it's
actually<00:01:17.210> embellish<00:01:17.659> over<00:01:18.079> the<00:01:18.229> pattern<00:01:18.500> so

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
actually embellish over the pattern so

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.800 
actually embellish over the pattern so
you'll<00:01:19.340> see<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.610> it's<00:01:19.790> more<00:01:19.939> concentrated

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
you'll see that it's more concentrated

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.170 
you'll see that it's more concentrated
with<00:01:21.380> tight<00:01:21.680> materials<00:01:22.250> in<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.850> pattern

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
with tight materials in the pattern

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.490 
with tight materials in the pattern

then<00:01:39.229> you're<00:01:39.320> gonna<00:01:39.439> seal<00:01:39.710> off<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.100> end<00:01:40.250> the

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
then you're gonna seal off the end the

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.760 
then you're gonna seal off the end the
easiest<00:01:41.299> way<00:01:41.540> to<00:01:41.570> seal<00:01:41.899> off<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.380> needle<00:01:42.649> and

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
easiest way to seal off a needle and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.620 
easiest way to seal off a needle and
thread<00:01:42.829> is<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:43.490> get<00:01:43.700> your<00:01:43.820> finger<00:01:44.119> wet<00:01:44.299> and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
then roll it into a ball at the end

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.050 
then roll it into a ball at the end
several<00:01:47.899> times<00:01:48.170> around<00:01:48.290> your<00:01:48.500> fingertip<00:01:49.060> like

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
and roll it this will create a knot

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.850 
and roll it this will create a knot
between<00:01:56.329> all<00:01:56.450> those<00:01:56.600> threads<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.110> fibers<00:01:57.560> and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
between all those threads and fibers and

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.800 
between all those threads and fibers and
it<00:01:58.399> will<00:01:58.490> seal<00:01:58.789> off<00:01:58.840> our<00:01:59.840> thread

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
it will seal off our thread

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.290 
it will seal off our thread
you<00:02:02.810> see<00:02:02.990> that<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.170> nice<00:02:03.350> little<00:02:03.650> ball<00:02:04.300> the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
first stitch is the hardest because you

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.160 
first stitch is the hardest because you
actually<00:02:07.340> have<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.550> start<00:02:07.850> going<00:02:08.479> in<00:02:08.810> through

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
actually have to start going in through

actually have to start going in through
the<00:02:09.290> tights<00:02:09.560> because<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:10.280> don't<00:02:10.429> want<00:02:10.550> this

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
the tights because you don't want this

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.310 
the tights because you don't want this
ball<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.060> be<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.300> outside<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:11.870> our<00:02:12.050> tights

and then back through the hole would be

00:02:49.700 --> 00:03:29.690 
and then back through the hole would be
to<00:02:49.820> get<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.540> really<00:02:50.720> secures<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.290> in<00:02:51.350> place

so<00:03:30.569> far<00:03:30.870> I've<00:03:31.020> done<00:03:31.230> two<00:03:31.530> clusters<00:03:32.069> but<00:03:32.340> I'm

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
so far I've done two clusters but I'm

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.370 
so far I've done two clusters but I'm
sure<00:03:32.640> you<00:03:32.730> get<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:32.970> idea<00:03:33.300> really<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.170> options

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
sure you get the idea really the options

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.290 
sure you get the idea really the options
are<00:03:34.709> endless<00:03:34.830> you<00:03:35.190> can<00:03:35.340> put<00:03:35.489> on<00:03:35.610> as<00:03:35.790> many<00:03:36.030> beads

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
are endless you can put on as many beads

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.000 
are endless you can put on as many beads
as<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.599> want<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.230> they<00:03:37.380> even<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:37.800> it<00:03:37.980> when

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
as you want and they even like it when

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.949 
as you want and they even like it when
you<00:03:38.340> do<00:03:38.489> some<00:03:38.760> single<00:03:39.180> sequence<00:03:39.660> they<00:03:39.870> have

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
you do some single sequence they have

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.990 
you do some single sequence they have
trickling<00:03:40.290> down<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.590> leg<00:03:40.739> as<00:03:40.890> well<00:03:41.069> this<00:03:41.849> is<00:03:41.970> a

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
trickling down the leg as well this is a

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.580 
trickling down the leg as well this is a
great<00:03:42.209> idea<00:03:42.300> for<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.690> holiday<00:03:43.020> season<00:03:43.080> it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
great idea for the holiday season it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.440 
great idea for the holiday season it
adds<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.830> little<00:03:43.920> sparkle<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.700> your<00:03:45.000> type<00:03:45.209> and
