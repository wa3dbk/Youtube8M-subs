00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.180
 are 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:14.889
 he has in a speech on the Rhine 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.220
 it is completely unclear 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.289
 we have 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.749
 with a new study 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.749
 the former not 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.749
 now 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:29.839
 friendly 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:30.999
 the street 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.399
 Get new rules of the game with a whole new game like it 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.960
 to do in 2on2 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.600
 the successor to the role play Two Worlds, released in 2007, is breaking 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.880
 with numerous rules of his predecessor 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.590
 but through a completely open game world shone but the plot 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.180
 lost somewhere in the vast countryside 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.540
 No matter which of the two possible options, they decide to proceed 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.160
 to have 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.130
 at the beginning of Two Worlds 2 nevertheless always she and her sister sit in the same 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.720
 Dungeon of the tyrant Gandohar 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.790
 until one day they are released from an unexpected side 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.810
 why us a group of the former archenemies from prison? 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.210
 you have to find out yourself 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.770
 Barely escaped from the dungeon for our hero the adventure as 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.510
 Trichet 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.680
 do not worry 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.430
 we are here to free you 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.020
 on a remote island they bring their liberators into the first one 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.149
 up to two hours of play the basics of Two Worlds 2 Bio 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.779
 For example, we get our cars to the enemy to sneak around him 

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:31.260
 to endure from behind 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.850
 If the sneaking is too quiet, it can also be too brute 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.040
 Methods grab 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.210
 For example, we are rummaging through a stranded pirate ship 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.770
 after a lost logbook 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.350
 So the former group has to attack undead skeletons 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.600
 the melee system is easy to use 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.440
 but also allows tactical finesse 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.640
 who, for example, can block with the right mouse button by clever 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.670
 Timing opposing blows from our side confronts the block of enemies 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.110
 breaking through must trigger the right moment a special ability 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.620
 In addition, our opponents react differently to our armaments 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.440
 However, Som have been largely immune to stupid butchery damage 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.489
 more sensitive to tip and sharp blades 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.279
 they must also take this immunity into account 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:15.579
 if they are the ones we played here once 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.379
 Photo Foundation in the fight before 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.060
 and first of all, a few helpful creatures await them 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:23.519
 Apartment under the name of the opponent can recognize 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.850
 RÃ¶thlin hurt these enemy creatures 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.400
 for this one has and with two watts for the frame to about 5 per cent as 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.259
 this time 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.109
 I'm listening 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.029
 whether they want to become melee archer assassins or magicians the 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:41.669
 the free skill system does not give them any instructions about it 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:45.119
 They can disperse their abilities to their hearts content 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.809
 Create a specialist in a field or an all-rounder 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.999
 Make a living by an idiosyncratic crafting system 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.259
 They used arms and armor of the same type on each other to launch them 

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.970
 improve 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.310
 for the successor, the developer has turned the system illogical 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.070
 We can now start found objects in their individual components 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.520
 disassemble and forge other objects by forging in the state 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.210
 assuming we have succeeded the corresponding blacksmiths too 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.219
 allows 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.730
 Two Worlds do not share the whole as with the predecessor from the beginning 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.669
 Game world instead we have to go along the main action 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.769
 Staging branches clear but they are very varied 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.639
 After the state island, she leads the main action first to one 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.879
 Strengthen and sweeten continent whose pulsating center the 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.020
 oriental-looking metropolis you have Doris 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.990
 After that, it's just a joke in tropical regions around the university city 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.970
 Here the architecture ends strongly Far Eastern models and the 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.999
 The surrounding school is teeming with deadly creatures 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:44.189
 in the later game finally succeeded in the really much 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.030
 idyllic villages ideal here 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.040
 but as always in RPGs, the appearance of Mertens deceives the secret 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.919
 This then a little romantic place 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.009
 the quests that we solve in the game are among the most popular ones 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.360
 most varied in role-playing genre 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.650
 Here, for example, in a heavily guarded temple we have to follow the routes of the 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.389
 Dodge Sentry skillfully 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.520
 to go unnoticed four wars 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.469
 greet the FIFA or Splinter Cell titles 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:11.639
 and this task obviously has the nick as it does us 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.980
 War taken as a model 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.320
 We are looking over the roofs of the city on which Balten creeps along 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.109
 an entry hatch to enter the heavily guarded storage room at the bottom right 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.209
 to be able to break 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.720
 and in the Jura Show, finally, we have the honor of being highly respected 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.980
 University to give a guest lecture 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.259
 Let's listen in 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:31.730
 I was asked 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.250
 I will give a lecture about the habits of a certain person 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.279
 Species in the vicinity of 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:39.439
 to keep shot by JoÃ«l 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.699
 Unfortunately, they would have forced me to feel compelled 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:44.400
 these statements 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.440
 this no to eliminate this species 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.590
 but this fact is really only the beginning of one 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.460
 a long flat story if the voice sounds familiar to you then 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.729
 probably as German voice of James Bond Daniel Craig 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.770
 All major roles are through professional voice actors of 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.620
 Prominent actors occupy good sound here so well 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.750
 even if not everyone would win a low price right away 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:11.409
 script 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.710
 that was a predecessor games not even two parts was too thin was the 

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:18.209
 Acting here at that time, the developer Reality Pump has improved properly 

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:21.189
 and so we follow a varied and sometimes 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.330
 exciting story 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.999
 through the complete 30 to 40 hours of play 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:28.499
 The main action on individual quests is loosened up again and again 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:30.469
 through cut scenes in game graphics 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:32.090
 because quality is mixed 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.090
 Here you can see one of the more spectacular 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.530
 and what does a hero do at the end of the day when all the monsters are killed all 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.210
 innocent rescued and oppressed are liberated 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.190
 Embach first time well again in Two Worlds 2, they can be offside 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.320
 all quest also do some recreational pursuit the 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.000
 Instruments play a lucky gamble to play or just play 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.070
 go for a relaxing sailing trip 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.190
 and now I say goodbye I'm looking for a lonely beach now 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.910
 then from all dangers and adventures
