00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.670
 suddenly in the middle of the cars appears one of the hardest 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.670
 I became much more intense 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.829
 are the lighthouses of Rio Xenon 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:18.279
 the light emitted your brothers are synonymous with bluish the difference is 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.240
 in conventional shop glaucous technology 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.240
 the eyelash 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 of the issue of bonuses I believe that the project came from Flemish 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.759
 bush and battered candidates these bitches 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.759
 is more extensive 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.110
 as the price is high there are people adopting 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.440
 the type of lamp to super white 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 in reality they are quite decent 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.570
 but we're going to look like xenon 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.890
 white or yellowish 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.680
 he cites the more neutral white my neutral country he provides a 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.170
 better visualization 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.620
 despite the beam of light emitted 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.620
 I myself was not 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 for two business days I do not believe 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.850
 are three positions hummm equipped with ordinary lamps 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.210
 the other with the so-called superbrancas 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.590
 and a third one stayed watching we'll test what you can see in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 each one of them 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.830
 what we did was checked that each type of headlight that illuminates the stationary car 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830
 on the road 120 meters away 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.560
 the result was not surprising with xenon headlight near by far the most 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.330
 prudent 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
 It is super greek and the traditional one the difference was small 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.740
 if you use xenon bulbs it is very important to keep the clotheslines well 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.110
 regulated 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.420
 as they have up to three times more intensity in regulation 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.600
 disturbing 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.240
 once I was in the opposite direction 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.130
 Besides that 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.990
 when it gets dark 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.180
 like the low headlights 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.460
 Pay attention on the road and have a good trip.
