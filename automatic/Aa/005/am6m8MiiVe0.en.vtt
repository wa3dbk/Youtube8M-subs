00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
and your board actually did the full

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.110 
and your board actually did the full
rotation<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.050> 360<00:03:21.680> flip<00:03:21.709> right<00:03:22.100> there<00:03:22.370> but

rotation of the 360 flip right there but

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.970 
rotation of the 360 flip right there but
like<00:03:23.269> you're<00:03:23.480> saying<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:24.110> just<00:03:24.530> get<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.739> little

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
like you're saying you just get a little

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.580 
like you're saying you just get a little
bit<00:03:25.220> too<00:03:25.459> far<00:03:25.730> ahead<00:03:25.880> of<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:27.200> you're

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
bit too far ahead of it so you're

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.880 
bit too far ahead of it so you're
landing<00:03:27.830> up<00:03:28.160> too<00:03:28.430> high<00:03:28.670> towards<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.209> nose<00:03:29.890> now

underneath<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.799> board<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:22.430> then<00:04:23.180> just<00:04:23.419> swoop

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
underneath the board and then just swoop

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.640 
underneath the board and then just swoop
it<00:04:24.139> out<00:04:24.319> it's<00:04:25.130> all<00:04:25.430> in<00:04:25.789> that<00:04:25.819> back<00:04:26.270> foot<00:04:26.650> now

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
it out it's all in that back foot now

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.770 
it out it's all in that back foot now
the<00:04:27.710> other<00:04:27.979> thing<00:04:28.220> about<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.639> 360<00:04:29.060> flip<00:04:29.270> is

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
the other thing about the 360 flip is

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.529 
the other thing about the 360 flip is
that<00:04:29.889> it's<00:04:30.889> it's<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.580> different<00:04:31.610> feeling<00:04:32.240> than

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
that it's it's a different feeling than

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.450 
that it's it's a different feeling than
the<00:04:32.690> varial<00:04:33.110> flip<00:04:33.319> in<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.560> kickflip<00:04:34.009> because

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
the varial flip in the kickflip because

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.969 
the varial flip in the kickflip because
on<00:04:34.759> the<00:04:35.090> varial<00:04:35.419> flipping<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.840> kickflip<00:04:36.289> you

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
on the varial flipping the kickflip you

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.650 
on the varial flipping the kickflip you
can<00:04:37.160> kind<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.460> be<00:04:37.610> standing<00:04:37.910> in<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.389> front

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
can kind of be standing in the front

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.050 
can kind of be standing in the front
seat<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:38.990> little<00:04:39.349> bit<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.800> by<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.729> I<00:04:40.759> mean

with a majority of your weight kind of

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.300 
with a majority of your weight kind of
like<00:04:43.340> forward<00:04:44.270> on<00:04:44.479> the<00:04:44.630> board<00:04:44.960> but<00:04:45.800> if<00:04:45.949> you<00:04:46.039> try

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
like forward on the board but if you try

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.520 
like forward on the board but if you try
and<00:04:46.460> do<00:04:46.580> that<00:04:46.699> on<00:04:46.759> the<00:04:47.000> 360<00:04:47.599> flip<00:04:47.630> what's<00:04:48.349> gonna

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
and do that on the 360 flip what's gonna

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.939 
and do that on the 360 flip what's gonna
happen<00:04:48.979> is<00:04:49.099> you're<00:04:49.130> gonna<00:04:49.370> land<00:04:49.759> like<00:04:50.539> you<00:04:50.750> are

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
flip you're kind of sitting back in the

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.930 
flip you're kind of sitting back in the
back<00:04:59.270> seat<00:04:59.599> and<00:04:59.810> as<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.590> pop<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:01.099> you<00:05:01.130> throw<00:05:01.759> it

scooping your back foot because the
majority<00:05:11.150> of<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.360> time<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.720> are<00:05:11.900> getting<00:05:12.229> the

majority of the time you are getting the

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.570 
majority of the time you are getting the
rotation<00:05:13.030> but<00:05:14.030> just<00:05:14.330> work<00:05:14.990> on<00:05:15.310> sitting<00:05:16.310> back

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
rotation but just work on sitting back

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.430 
rotation but just work on sitting back
in<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.909> back<00:05:17.120> seat<00:05:17.389> a<00:05:17.419> little<00:05:17.659> bit<00:05:17.930> more<00:05:18.169> so

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
in the back seat a little bit more so

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.100 
in the back seat a little bit more so
leaning<00:05:18.800> back<00:05:19.039> on<00:05:19.069> your<00:05:19.460> takeoff<00:05:19.880> and<00:05:20.270> then

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
leaning back on your takeoff and then

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.249 
leaning back on your takeoff and then
flick<00:05:21.620> the<00:05:21.830> board<00:05:22.099> out<00:05:22.340> in<00:05:22.729> front<00:05:23.539> of<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:23.930> and

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 
flick the board out in front of you and

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.649 
flick the board out in front of you and
then<00:05:25.009> you'll<00:05:25.340> be<00:05:25.490> able<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.820> catch<00:05:26.090> your<00:05:26.389> board

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
then you'll be able to catch your board

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.649 
then you'll be able to catch your board
more<00:05:27.020> with<00:05:27.259> your<00:05:27.500> front<00:05:27.800> foot<00:05:28.240> put<00:05:29.240> your<00:05:29.389> front

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:29.659 
more with your front foot put your front

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.149 
more with your front foot put your front
foot<00:05:29.810> on<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.169> and<00:05:30.320> bring<00:05:30.500> it<00:05:30.560> down<00:05:30.680> and<00:05:30.889> then

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
foot on it and bring it down and then

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.830 
foot on it and bring it down and then
stomp<00:05:31.580> it<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:32.259> think<00:05:33.259> it<00:05:33.409> would<00:05:33.560> help<00:05:33.740> you<00:05:34.070> to

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
stomp it I think it would help you to

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.450 
stomp it I think it would help you to
learn<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:36.080> trick<00:05:36.320> with<00:05:36.500> a<00:05:36.530> little<00:05:37.099> bit<00:05:37.280> of

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
learn the trick with a little bit of

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.779 
learn the trick with a little bit of
speed<00:05:37.789> obviously<00:05:38.180> not<00:05:38.900> going<00:05:39.199> too<00:05:39.409> fast<00:05:39.789> but

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
speed obviously not going too fast but

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.909 
speed obviously not going too fast but
just<00:05:41.000> put<00:05:41.479> a<00:05:41.509> little<00:05:41.719> speed<00:05:42.139> on<00:05:42.320> it<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:42.740> that

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
just put a little speed on it and that

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.189 
just put a little speed on it and that
way<00:05:43.130> you<00:05:43.820> don't<00:05:44.150> even<00:05:44.419> quite<00:05:44.690> have<00:05:44.900> to<00:05:45.020> lean

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
way you don't even quite have to lean

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.740 
way you don't even quite have to lean
back<00:05:45.469> so<00:05:45.830> much<00:05:46.090> because<00:05:47.090> that<00:05:47.120> forward

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
back so much because that forward

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.779 
back so much because that forward
momentum<00:05:47.930> is<00:05:48.500> also<00:05:48.889> going<00:05:49.159> to<00:05:49.219> help<00:05:49.460> throw

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:49.789 
momentum is also going to help throw

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.899 
momentum is also going to help throw
that<00:05:50.030> board<00:05:50.330> out<00:05:50.509> in<00:05:50.539> front<00:05:50.930> of<00:05:51.050> you<00:05:51.669> cool<00:05:52.669> so

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 
that board out in front of you cool so

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:55.149 
that board out in front of you cool so
one<00:05:53.090> thing<00:05:53.300> that<00:05:53.539> I<00:05:53.750> think<00:05:53.990> will<00:05:54.590> really<00:05:54.979> help

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
one thing that I think will really help

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.879 
one thing that I think will really help
you<00:05:55.430> is<00:05:55.669> if<00:05:55.729> you<00:05:56.120> learn<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.750> 360<00:05:57.380> flip<00:05:57.409> with

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
you is if you learn the 360 flip with

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:59.680 
you is if you learn the 360 flip with
stepping<00:05:58.219> off<00:05:58.520> with<00:05:58.699> your<00:05:58.880> back<00:05:59.060> foot<00:05:59.360> and

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
stepping off with your back foot and

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.890 
stepping off with your back foot and
then<00:06:00.259> just<00:06:00.469> putting<00:06:00.680> your<00:06:00.889> front<00:06:01.190> foot<00:06:01.400> down

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
then just putting your front foot down

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.390 
then just putting your front foot down
once<00:06:02.900> you<00:06:02.990> get<00:06:03.139> that<00:06:03.289> control<00:06:03.830> of<00:06:04.039> being<00:06:04.280> able

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
once you get that control of being able

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.980 
once you get that control of being able
to<00:06:04.580> catch<00:06:04.820> it<00:06:05.000> with<00:06:05.060> your<00:06:05.240> front<00:06:05.479> foot

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
to catch it with your front foot

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.959 
to catch it with your front foot
I<00:06:06.020> honestly<00:06:06.469> think<00:06:06.919> you're<00:06:07.370> just<00:06:07.520> gonna<00:06:07.669> get<00:06:07.940> a

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969 
I honestly think you're just gonna get a
