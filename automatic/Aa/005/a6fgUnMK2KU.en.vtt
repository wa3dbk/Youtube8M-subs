00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.360
 batmobile but what is my new one 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.850
 16mm cannon a cannon itself is that of it 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.920

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.610
 guns but it looks like a gun nothing 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.109
 at all 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.230

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.159
 to kill a man if you hit him 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.929
