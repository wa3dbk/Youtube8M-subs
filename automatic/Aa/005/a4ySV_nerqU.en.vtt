00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.939
 friends 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.160
 not the end is what you have written before 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.270
 capital attacks respond 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.920
 struggling 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.480
 let's see if we apply a zone 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.460
 of CÃ¡diz that is soon disappearing and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.180
 they are going to carry a tipismo more of the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.860
 cadiz cemetery city 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.030
 for those who did not ask for it or for 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.520
 who asked me 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.190
 here these villas here is my father and 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.910
 they want to take him to chiclana 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.980
 ciclonita new dad 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.590
 if half does not mean that mom does not want 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.590
 whole bad town halls 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.020
 Oh 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.020
 from here with the dead and here we have 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.850
 own town hall grounds to the 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.030
 speculation I think the dead 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.560
 like the people who come to visit him 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.660
 they deserve in their place 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.020
 a nice space to visit if you 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.390
 required that already noticing 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.700
 I say that I know that my 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.640
 dead they go with their fucking mother 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.670
 make your dead with how many dead 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.690
 they have monkeys 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.580
 for this reason to these new flats 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.400
 here people who are happy and another that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.050
 not because of the clear lifting of all 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.820
 tomorrow, imagine your dead through the window 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.490
 it's not a nice thing either but there 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.259
 is 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.460
 so I wanted to ship it and even though 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.460
 this they have but in the eggs 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.409
 on this long journey there is a light or 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.060
 Grace 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.009
 there are bright girls and others with 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.830
 square squares but good everything is 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.810
 excusable at 8 o'clock in the morning 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.000
 a busy street this looks like 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.000
 people want to die 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.480
 they will be looking for a hole 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.160
 park things that are stolen by a zombie 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.180
 good since it ends what are the 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.180
 cemetery boundaries 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.430
 because the beach that's why he said what 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.220
 dead people deserve a nice place to 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.530
 same as your visitors who arrange 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.140
 this one that is not so big and leave the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.030
 of chiclana that is already good with 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.440
 of those like port aventura stay at 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.150
 your garden and has to be one day you 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.310
 have to carry towards hungry sandwich 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.110
 mixed you have to take there all 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.459
 the dead have to buy the flowers 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.260
 plastic because when will you put the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.360
 you are wilted today those great 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.360
 man are a barbarism 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.770
 and nothing 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.060
 it's so true you make the loss issue 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.910
 has done well because it is not an area that 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.450
 I walk too much since what here 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.530
 we went to the hotel this the partition of a 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.360
 school 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.680
 they are a square that I do not remember how 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.040
 compound earth flame for me as 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.040
 boston 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:52.530
 and nothing here we are finishing and I 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:57.030
 I think the beach the avenue 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.740
 and little else the ambulance in the end this is not 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.170
 you will have pensioners to garitano 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.690
 that you are far 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.630
 here we are going to see gentlemen put and 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.470
 my solar confidence in almost abandoned 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.680
 but this is for speculation 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.150
 urbanistic that I picked up I have raised a 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.800
 block of flats for the homeless 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.560
 and it would go away as soon as it's over 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.480
 solve the problems of solar 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.780
 so much private property what good did it 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.400
 the pepa and good gentlemen I will do my 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.420
 trust the residence of every day that 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.420
 we see it they want
