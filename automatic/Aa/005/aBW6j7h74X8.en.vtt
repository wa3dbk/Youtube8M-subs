00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
in whatever but I thought of before if I

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.910 
in whatever but I thought of before if I
did<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.300> video<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:13.139> just<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.440> lot<00:00:13.559> weirder

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
did the video it's just a lot weirder

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.140 
did the video it's just a lot weirder
because<00:00:14.929> videos<00:00:15.929> are<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.170> lot<00:00:16.410> better<00:00:17.029> to<00:00:18.029> be

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
because videos are a lot better to be

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.170 
because videos are a lot better to be
gone<00:00:18.330> as<00:00:19.199> opposed<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:20.340> writing<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.060> down

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
