00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.839
 Hello everyone guys today we came 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.519
 Here is such a package in essence here 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.610
 there must be an adjustment tool 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:19.690
 valves that let's unpack and 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:21.810
 let's see what we have here is such a 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:28.180
 tool more over lagado 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.960
 there is nothing since I said it before 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.920
 damn many scotch tool 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.450
 this is a valve adjustment tool 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.770
 honestly try to somehow look 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.600
 from this scotch 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.930
 Here is such a tool in fact here 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.400
 like two keys in one one we 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.380
 unscrew the locknut 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.950
 valve adjustment and the second 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:59.560
 tightens screw itself is still what that 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:01:01.600
 inscriptions khroma vanadium 9 millimeters well 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.080
 Well here is such a tool in essence 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.620
 This is the usual head is inserted here 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.720
 here's the key and about the handle is with us then 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.520
 same thing that we recently repaired 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.920
 In general, then I want to try on it 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.659
 this key principle 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.640
 engine in valve adjustment is not 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.900
 we just need me here then it 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.680
 try what we insert our hook 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:32.130
 all throw this thing off on the principle 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:36.299
 not so much was tightened let's say so 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.299
 type times regulated 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.540
 the valve we have has a thin large gap 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.440
 probe on 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:58.570
 005 principle vlazit new felt 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:02:04.390
 which is too so free 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:11.120
 tighten the bolt slightly tighten 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:14.390
 We try again Well we probe so there 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.700
 probably someone already says why 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.880
 for this purpose was to buy this 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.630
 you can take the key because the shoes are not the key 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.670
 over 9 unscrew neatly set 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.890
 clearance and neat here and so 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:35.150
 twist but very often it happens 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.460
 that behind the nut the bolt starts spinning 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.700
 In general, we unscrew the nut 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:45.200
 put the gap you want and try 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.050
 tighten it now and that's what happens 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:53.270
 children pliers me pretty 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.220
 problematic to keep this bolt very 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.640
 often such a misfortune happens 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.420
 I do not know what is the reason or something is not 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.410
 so threaded or just poor quality 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.690
 bolts or nuts but for some reason so 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.060
 sometimes we have to study with them 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.020
 it would be possible to take more pliers 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.150
 well live 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.790
 through this little round 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.190
 hole keep passing the club themselves and 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.010
 twist and in general to put it mildly 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:28.540
 not convenient here and so I ordered myself 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.540
 here is such a key insert slot 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:40.010
 Turn off expose let's say here 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:42.830
 we hold the angle we need and drag in 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.640
 These principle, all the key I ordered 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.120
 moto gc dot com. her in 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.980
 principle 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.350
 A reference to the store and the goods will be in 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.870
 describing what guys I have on this 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.690
 for now I hope this video will be to someone 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.560
 helpful put your fingers good luck to all 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.560
 and all bye
