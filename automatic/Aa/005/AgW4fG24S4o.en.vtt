00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.270 
for three and that's how this one would
end<00:01:51.119> st.<00:01:51.810> Mike's<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.409> guys<00:01:52.649> are<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.009> good<00:01:53.250> at

end st. Mike's you guys are just good at
everything<00:01:53.520> aren't<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:55.110> our<00:01:55.259> first<00:01:55.470> law

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
everything aren't you it's our first law

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.469 
everything aren't you it's our first law
going<00:01:58.430> forward<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:58.820> think<00:01:59.000> we<00:01:59.060> have<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.210> really

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
going forward I think we have a really

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.700 
going forward I think we have a really
good<00:01:59.570> chance<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.960> be<00:02:00.020> competitive<00:02:00.500> in<00:02:00.620> this

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
good chance to be competitive in this

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.870 
good chance to be competitive in this
league<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.310> make<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.580> run<00:02:01.729> at<00:02:01.820> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
league and make it run at the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.500 
league and make it run at the
championship

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
championship

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.760 
championship
I<00:02:02.540> think<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.840> first<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:03.320> were<00:02:03.380> trying<00:02:03.620> to<00:02:03.680> be

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
I think the first we were trying to be

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.680 
I think the first we were trying to be
too<00:02:03.920> fancy<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.910> not<00:02:05.090> working<00:02:05.450> hard<00:02:05.570> enough

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
too fancy and not working hard enough

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.719 
too fancy and not working hard enough
and<00:02:06.050> then<00:02:06.200> we<00:02:06.620> put<00:02:06.800> our<00:02:06.890> work<00:02:07.040> boots<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.490> and

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
and then we put our work boots on and

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.370 
and then we put our work boots on and
work<00:02:07.850> really<00:02:08.030> hard<00:02:08.209> in<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.420> third<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.899> get<00:02:09.259> the

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
work really hard in the third to get the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.009 
work really hard in the third to get the
secure<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.860> win
