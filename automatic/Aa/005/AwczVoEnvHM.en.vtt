00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 well here is the sun life stadium in 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.560
 the city of miami how beautiful 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.679
 installation is really 28,000 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.049
 spectators a very good attendance to 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.660
 half the capacity of the stadium and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.690
 here it's worth I think it's worth it 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.910
 segment perhaps a face comment 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.039
 to the future of the selection in two planes 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.529
 the collective plane what he has done now 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.119
 what he did last Monday and then 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.360
 individual valuations because there are 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.640
 players who do not usually do not see it 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.730
 in the process that interests us, he linked 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.129
 just martínez for example this is good 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.050
 a very dynamic and good first time 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.400
 transfer of ball of things like these 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.559
 technical gestures and actions such as 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.030
 Mario Berrios cable that has been played and 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.670
 has been invalidated in an obvious game 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.559
 the attendees arrived today the truth that 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.600
 they were brilliant without sinning because 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.289
 also generated doubt in which of course 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.800
 later placed perfect and 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.379
 you lose it this player marked that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.240
 thanks to the goal jorge clear this technical 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.710
 also because of course it was the player who 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.090
 and this even though you said it in the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.100
 comment that well what the 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:22.659
 goalkeeper dagoberto 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:25.330
 I think I had to get away from them 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.830
 the arbitration yes in that part of the party 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.619
 disciplinary left much to be desired for 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.950
 of exclusions the serenity of 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.580
 two eggs the savior if I have a 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.080
 opinion on that on that subject of the 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.060
 violence in the matches in which the 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.340
 Salvador unleashing a chrono of El Salvador 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.509
 and good very shameless because it's very 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.729
 evident 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:54.880
 paste clear was the approach I have of 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.429
 this topic but good depth did 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.190
 changes worked I think I always 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.730
 They give freshness they give 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.920
 another option 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.380
 but neither the savior before the savior 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.900
 had had some quite situations 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.690
 clear that beautiful pass when it is that 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.600
 there's football in space there's a 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.550
 clear game concept of attack 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.030
 player who commands and who propitiates 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.030
 and here the auction will come in the in the post 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.890
 by kevin santamaría just from shanghai 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.890
 they surprised you vélez 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.350
 very good auction 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.350
 this was already the 38th minute 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.330
 comes the goal is preceded by a 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.100
 stop martínez where had been a 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.390
 lack on marvin hier I think what 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.450
 that the savior does not do well is to leave 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.910
 with officer with less density life 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.910
 because the last punt 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.400
 of course it's very well worth it 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.290
 mention the appreciation of the assistant 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.769
 what the attendees today was formidable 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.910
 because it was one of each band that did not 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.880
 lift in the case of the banderole and 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.280
 leave it for what the cup serves now 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.800
 is 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.630
 I think we take away the obsession a little 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.450
 that if we have to win it I think that 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.040
 the great laboratory is discovering things 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.010
 in the selection in the collective and 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.010
 discover players who achieve
