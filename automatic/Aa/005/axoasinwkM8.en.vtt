speed<00:00:55.350> type<00:00:55.590> at<00:00:55.949> first<00:00:56.520> when<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> saw<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
speed type at first when I saw the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.279 
speed type at first when I saw the
preview<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> Titus<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.870> thought<00:00:58.020> I'd<00:00:58.140> like

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
preview of the Titus I thought I'd like

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.660 
preview of the Titus I thought I'd like
the<00:00:58.410> Titus<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.770> lot<00:00:58.920> more<00:00:59.070> than<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> sparrow

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
the Titus a lot more than the sparrow

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.549 
the Titus a lot more than the sparrow
seeing<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.420> debut<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> anime<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
seeing a debut in the anime and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.720

everything<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.039> was<00:01:02.370> certainly

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
everything like that was certainly

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.460 
everything like that was certainly
helping<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.239> but<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> think<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.140> gonna<00:01:04.290> add<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
helping it but I think it's gonna add a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.260 
helping it but I think it's gonna add a
very<00:01:04.799> cool<00:01:05.070> dynamic<00:01:05.339> especially<00:01:06.060> when<00:01:06.180> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
very cool dynamic especially when you

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
change the color of the blade from white

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.590 
change the color of the blade from white

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
to this sort of bluey greenish you can

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.090 
to this sort of bluey greenish you can
actually<00:04:21.750> put<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.080> sticker<00:04:22.350> on<00:04:22.440> either<00:04:22.710> side

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
actually put a sticker on either side

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.010 
actually put a sticker on either side
and<00:04:23.280> it's<00:04:23.370> got<00:04:23.520> some<00:04:23.669> indents<00:04:24.120> there<00:04:24.390> I<00:04:24.660> wonder

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
and it's got some indents there I wonder

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.110 
and it's got some indents there I wonder
how<00:04:25.290> this<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.500> going<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.830> work<00:04:26.040> or<00:04:26.310> whether<00:04:26.910> you

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
how this is going to work or whether you

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.440 
how this is going to work or whether you
be

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
be

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.970 
be
I'm<00:04:27.540> sure<00:04:27.810> you'd<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:27.960> better<00:04:28.290> off<00:04:28.380> painting<00:04:28.830> it

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
I'm sure you'd be better off painting it

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.190 
I'm sure you'd be better off painting it
but<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.160> wonder<00:04:29.400> if<00:04:29.490> this<00:04:29.640> will<00:04:29.760> be<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:29.910> decent

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
but I wonder if this will be a decent

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.110 
but I wonder if this will be a decent
substitution<00:04:31.370> to<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.490> manual<00:04:32.820> with<00:04:33.000> that

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
substitution to the manual with that

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.430 
substitution to the manual with that
sharp<00:04:33.420> looking<00:04:33.690> cover<00:04:33.900> art<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.200> then<00:04:34.320> you're

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
sharp looking cover art and then you're

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.170 
sharp looking cover art and then you're
going<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.680> have<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.040> explanation<00:04:35.340> about<00:04:35.790> what

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
going to have the explanation about what

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.790 
going to have the explanation about what
the<00:04:36.330> sparrow<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.690> all<00:04:36.870> about<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.410> how<00:04:37.560> it's

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
the sparrow is all about and how it's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.220 
the sparrow is all about and how it's
the<00:04:37.890> continuation<00:04:38.580> of<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.060> titus<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.630> it

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
the continuation of the titus and it

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.420 
the continuation of the titus and it
doesn't<00:04:40.530> really<00:04:40.650> have<00:04:40.920> a<00:04:40.950> lot<00:04:41.130> of<00:04:41.280> weapons

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
doesn't really have a lot of weapons

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.250 
doesn't really have a lot of weapons
when<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:41.910> stop<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.300> think<00:04:42.480> about<00:04:42.540> it<00:04:42.690> but

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
when you stop and think about it but

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.420 
when you stop and think about it but
hopefully<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.680> blade<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:44.040> going<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.340> be

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
hopefully the blade is going to be

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.840 
hopefully the blade is going to be
enough

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
enough

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.430 
enough

move to bring down the legs and the foot
so<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.250> wonder<00:06:38.550> how<00:06:38.700> that's<00:06:38.820> going<00:06:39.030> to

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
so I wonder how that's going to

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.600 
so I wonder how that's going to
work<00:06:39.340> in<00:06:39.790> practice<00:06:40.770> so<00:06:41.770> that<00:06:41.890> was<00:06:42.010> a<00:06:42.040> fun<00:06:42.220> unbox

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
work in practice so that was a fun unbox

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.340 
work in practice so that was a fun unbox
for<00:06:42.850> me<00:06:42.940> just<00:06:43.240> because<00:06:43.360> again<00:06:43.870> sort<00:06:44.170> of<00:06:44.230> like

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
for me just because again sort of like

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.750 
for me just because again sort of like
the<00:06:44.470> tightness<00:06:44.770> I<00:06:44.860> hadn't<00:06:45.130> really<00:06:45.310> seen<00:06:45.340> as

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:45.760 
the tightness I hadn't really seen as

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.820 
the tightness I hadn't really seen as
many<00:06:46.030> promos<00:06:46.480> as<00:06:46.720> I<00:06:46.870> think<00:06:46.930> about<00:06:47.200> this<00:06:47.500> so<00:06:47.710> I'm

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
many promos as I think about this so I'm

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.290 
many promos as I think about this so I'm
surprised<00:06:48.250> by<00:06:48.430> some<00:06:48.640> of<00:06:48.700> the<00:06:48.760> features<00:06:49.090> I'm

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
surprised by some of the features I'm

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.670 
surprised by some of the features I'm
talking<00:06:49.600> about<00:06:49.660> the<00:06:49.900> needle<00:06:50.170> guns<00:06:50.350> and<00:06:50.620> the

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
talking about the needle guns and the

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.440 
talking about the needle guns and the
knees<00:06:50.860> and<00:06:51.220> the<00:06:51.760> fact<00:06:51.940> that<00:06:52.000> it's<00:06:52.180> got<00:06:52.270> those

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:52.450 
knees and the fact that it's got those

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.270 
knees and the fact that it's got those
thrusters<00:06:52.750> on<00:06:53.080> the<00:06:53.110> back<00:06:53.320> of<00:06:53.500> the<00:06:53.590> arms<00:06:53.830> the<00:06:53.950> AG

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
thrusters on the back of the arms the AG

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.770 
thrusters on the back of the arms the AG
had<00:06:54.460> blue<00:06:54.700> back<00:06:54.880> there<00:06:55.120> and<00:06:55.240> I<00:06:55.300> wondered<00:06:55.600> why

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
had blue back there and I wondered why

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.990 
had blue back there and I wondered why
and<00:06:56.080> now<00:06:56.650> I<00:06:56.680> understand<00:06:57.310> what<00:06:57.460> the<00:06:57.550> high-grade

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
and now I understand what the high-grade

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.370 
and now I understand what the high-grade
so<00:06:58.300> I<00:06:58.330> can't<00:06:58.570> wait<00:06:58.750> to<00:06:58.870> see<00:06:59.020> it<00:06:59.110> all<00:06:59.170> put

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
so I can't wait to see it all put

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.440 
so I can't wait to see it all put
together<00:06:59.470> it<00:06:59.920> will<00:07:00.400> certainly<00:07:00.640> surpass<00:07:01.180> this

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
together it will certainly surpass this

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.880 
together it will certainly surpass this
in<00:07:01.630> quality<00:07:01.930> it's<00:07:02.050> just<00:07:02.230> a<00:07:02.320> question<00:07:02.620> of<00:07:02.710> how

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:02.890 
in quality it's just a question of how

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.100 
in quality it's just a question of how
