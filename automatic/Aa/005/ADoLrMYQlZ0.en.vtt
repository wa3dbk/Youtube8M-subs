00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.000
 hello to all friends of bicing experience 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.019
 companion of ai new v3 for unboxing 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.430
 reasoning and scholarships as it had 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.710
 lent as on the others who are 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.779
 trying in this period I am on probation 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.849
 for a short time then detest them in 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.980
 very little time a day and a half 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.569
 maximum then on the battery I will be lake 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.849
 in the ignition I immediately say that it will be one 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:27.019
 faster than usual but in short I have 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.730
 thought that it is better than nothing that a 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.489
 many of the three suns has funds 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.820
 however he sees a short jeans like g al 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.379
 the phone in general is always convenient 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.210
 obviously the lyngby cinebox in 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.989
 description why he wanted to buy them 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.730
 can easily turn to him and 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.969
 agree to ship is a lot if 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.140
 there are problems I cannot assure 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.920
 vendola package we find one 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:56.780
 film to start a freak 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:00.820
 cover very beautifully magnetic way like 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.090
 very nice goal for istica hand 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.210
 We invented by USB micro USB priest 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.590
 earphones in discrete quality 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.120
 and usb micro usb cable then 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.880
 absolutely average packaging 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.500
 also above average 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.630
 complete the home we see the phone 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.630
 here it is then we remove the film 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.950
 well I'll show before so 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.479
 in its entirety because really 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.090
 very very nice at breakfast in anger 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.979
 there is also a white breakfast 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.810
 I had it turned on his fair button 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.220
 left and is round in aluminum 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.300
 really very well he remembers it a little 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.550
 that of dreams while it lights up 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.490
 let's say kwabena captions headset 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.130
 front camera from should if 2 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.350
 megapixel consob keys are options and 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:02.410
 back they are no less enlightened me 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:04.570
 it looks like the 5 inch hd ips 312 displays 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.330
 pixels per inch 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.280
 weighs only 128 grams 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.830
 as far as the camera is 13 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.959
 megapixel with autofocus and flash led of 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.470
 sony should be very good 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.870
 this system logan we have two 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.170
 let's say we have two movies because the boxes 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.680
 from a microphone from the danone is nothing 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.780
 two screws gave it everything and just 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.910
 in the case the body is removable of the monster 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:37.420
 you can open water behind it, here it is 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.890
 1830 milian battery for maybe this is 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.920
 slightly undertone memory expansions 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.299
 micro excuse me in micro e 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.510
 sim do normal 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.850
 the sim a normal informed in each 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.560
 case in this case now first bile 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.930
 in the technical sheet then video a little 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.930
 particularities and advantages in my opinion 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.769
 then it is a must so already reported 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.900
 because it is seen eating a processor 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.280
 quad core told me the codex trim 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.560
 a Belgian punch gas so nothing new 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.600
 but to the strings who in fact already 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.489
 having 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.130
 internal this a 16 against his di 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.620
 four that we find on others 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.420
 terminals with this processor this 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.950
 the 6c expandable so already with much 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.950
 more memory available so I'm not 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.600
 problems for applications to be installed 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.799
 and then it will have a very nice display above 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.690
 the average because I had it happen 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.549
 he says he has seen me others, however, this one 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.400
 has a great viewing angle I can 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.450
 insuring it is also a definition 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.010
 however it is very good we go 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.010
 walks above average but 13 megapixels 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.489
 in short, we have a notification led here 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.950
 very nice so illuminated keys or 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:53.980
 in short, it acts as a home button and options 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.980
 back and android 4.2 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.440
 then to the other peculiarity we have from 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.170
 nfc which I had hardly ever seen 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.140
 on phones with this processor maybe 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.250
 the first that I see quad core better nfc 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.530
 in conclusion 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.200
 obviously we have everything and the country but 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.060
 usually 190 euros then concede 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.860
 I went to vote from home you had the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.650
 usually low cost processor with 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.739
 good enough performances though with 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.370
 a display a decent camera on the 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.110
 paper and NFC to a good internal memory 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.270
 something to be reckoned with 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.270
 in any case for this unboxing and everything 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.240
 for a review we say fast 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.620
 we will see if we confirm what is the 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.820
 first impact 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.260
 the videos below were crazy 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.380
 lorenzo preference 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.380
 Hello
