00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
routine or good practice day would

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.329 
routine or good practice day would
consist<00:01:01.220> of<00:01:01.339> a<00:01:01.430> warm-up<00:01:01.879> a<00:01:02.440> technique<00:01:03.440> session

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.460 
and then music so warming up on a brass
instrument<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:11.299> I<00:01:12.049> don't<00:01:12.110> know<00:01:12.229> if<00:01:12.290> it's<00:01:12.409> a

constitutes<00:01:19.850> warm-up<00:01:20.659> I<00:01:21.100> studied<00:01:22.100> with

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
constitutes warm-up I studied with

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:23.770 
constitutes warm-up I studied with
Claude<00:01:22.430> Gordon<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:22.970> he<00:01:23.090> didn't<00:01:23.299> even<00:01:23.390> use<00:01:23.630> the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
Claude Gordon and he didn't even use the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.900 
Claude Gordon and he didn't even use the
word<00:01:23.869> warm-up<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:24.619> it's<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:25.010> he<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.820> know

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
word warm-up so it's like he you know

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.730 
word warm-up so it's like he you know
the<00:01:25.940> first<00:01:26.090> thing<00:01:26.480> you<00:01:26.600> play<00:01:26.810> was<00:01:27.170> your<00:01:27.380> warmup

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
the first thing you play was your warmup

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.050 
the first thing you play was your warmup
no<00:01:27.980> matter<00:01:28.190> what<00:01:28.400> it<00:01:28.520> was<00:01:28.550> it<00:01:28.670> could<00:01:28.940> be

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
no matter what it was it could be

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.770 
no matter what it was it could be
anything<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:31.250> know<00:01:31.370> his<00:01:31.580> idea<00:01:32.000> was<00:01:32.510> that

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
anything so you know his idea was that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.320 
anything so you know his idea was that
you<00:01:33.290> didn't<00:01:33.500> need<00:01:33.620> to<00:01:33.680> warmup<00:01:34.160> and<00:01:34.520> if<00:01:35.240> you

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
you didn't need to warmup and if you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.940 
you didn't need to warmup and if you
studied<00:01:35.660> with<00:01:35.750> Claude<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.020> practice<00:01:36.590> you

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
studied with Claude you practice you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.090 
studied with Claude you practice you
know<00:01:37.070> 14<00:01:37.610> hours<00:01:37.910> a<00:01:37.970> day<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:38.860> you've<00:01:39.860> never

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
know 14 hours a day and you've never

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.760 
know 14 hours a day and you've never
cooled<00:01:40.970> off<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.810> never<00:01:42.080> needed<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.500> warm

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
cooled off so you never needed to warm

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.960 
cooled off so you never needed to warm
up<00:01:42.980> but<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:45.560> then<00:01:46.100> there's<00:01:46.310> teachers<00:01:46.550> that

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
up but and then there's teachers that

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.850 
up but and then there's teachers that
have<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.360> very<00:01:47.600> rigid<00:01:48.050> reproach<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:48.440> this

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
have the very rigid reproach that this

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.200 
have the very rigid reproach that this
must<00:01:49.100> be<00:01:49.190> your<00:01:49.400> warmup<00:01:49.730> you're<00:01:49.910> going<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.120> do

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
must be your warmup you're going to do

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.190 
must be your warmup you're going to do
this<00:01:50.330> you're<00:01:50.540> going<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.720> do<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:50.990> you're

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
this you're going to do that you're

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.390 
this you're going to do that you're
going<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.350> do<00:01:51.470> that<00:01:51.620> again<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:51.950> do<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.220> for

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
going to do that again to do that for

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.910 
going to do that again to do that for
the<00:01:52.490> rest<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:52.820> your<00:01:52.940> life<00:01:53.090> so<00:01:53.860> somewhere<00:01:54.860> in

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
the rest of your life so somewhere in

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.540 
the rest of your life so somewhere in
between<00:01:55.040> is<00:01:55.640> where<00:01:55.790> I'm<00:01:55.970> at<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.570> I<00:01:57.530> think<00:01:58.460> a

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
between is where I'm at and I think a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.130 
between is where I'm at and I think a
warm-up<00:01:59.000> should<00:01:59.180> be<00:01:59.360> something<00:01:59.720> that<00:01:59.750> you

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
warm-up should be something that you

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.290 
warm-up should be something that you
know<00:02:00.260> you're<00:02:00.409> familiar<00:02:00.650> with<00:02:00.920> but<00:02:01.370> yeah<00:02:01.970> it

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
know you're familiar with but yeah it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.960 
know you're familiar with but yeah it
shouldn't<00:02:02.659> be<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.860> same<00:02:03.890> thing<00:02:04.870> forever

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
shouldn't be the same thing forever

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.029 
shouldn't be the same thing forever
although<00:02:07.970> I<00:02:08.659> think<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:09.050> should<00:02:09.229> stay<00:02:09.619> on<00:02:09.860> the

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
although I think you should stay on the

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.770 
although I think you should stay on the
same<00:02:10.310> thing<00:02:10.700> for<00:02:10.909> a<00:02:10.970> couple<00:02:11.180> weeks<00:02:11.510> and<00:02:11.720> then

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
same thing for a couple weeks and then

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.990 
same thing for a couple weeks and then
make<00:02:12.200> slight<00:02:12.470> changes<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.370> make<00:02:13.879> it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
make slight changes to it make it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.589 
make slight changes to it make it
progressively<00:02:14.540> more<00:02:14.810> difficult<00:02:15.349> and

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
progressively more difficult and

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.910 
progressively more difficult and
that's<00:02:16.900> exactly<00:02:17.319> what<00:02:17.499> we're<00:02:17.650> doing<00:02:17.680> here

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
that's exactly what we're doing here

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.089 
that's exactly what we're doing here
with<00:02:18.609> the<00:02:18.670> progressive<00:02:19.239> format

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
with the progressive format

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.379 
with the progressive format
another<00:02:21.730> thing<00:02:21.969> is<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:23.040> warm-up<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.249> not<00:02:24.430> does

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:25.389 
another thing is a warm-up is not does

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.379 
another thing is a warm-up is not does
not<00:02:25.569> need<00:02:25.749> to<00:02:25.900> consist<00:02:26.349> of<00:02:26.650> every<00:02:27.400> single<00:02:27.939> type

lesson plan and see how thorough things

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.649 
lesson plan and see how thorough things
are<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.409> whole<00:03:02.590> course<00:03:02.859> takes<00:03:03.129> 36<00:03:03.609> weeks<00:03:03.969> and

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
are this whole course takes 36 weeks and

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.390 
are this whole course takes 36 weeks and
gradually<00:03:05.169> evolves<00:03:05.590> over<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.980> period<00:03:06.189> of

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
gradually evolves over that period of

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.819 
gradually evolves over that period of
time<00:03:07.379> all<00:03:08.379> right<00:03:08.590> so<00:03:08.859> I'm<00:03:09.310> gonna<00:03:09.519> demonstrate

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
time all right so I'm gonna demonstrate

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.099 
time all right so I'm gonna demonstrate
some<00:03:11.829> of<00:03:12.189> the<00:03:12.310> exercises<00:03:13.030> here<00:03:13.569> very<00:03:13.780> quickly

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
some of the exercises here very quickly

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.659 
some of the exercises here very quickly
this<00:03:14.889> is<00:03:14.949> not<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.579> long<00:03:15.849> video<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:17.310> here<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.340> am

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:18.669 
this is not a long video so here I am

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.080 
this is not a long video so here I am
playing<00:03:19.209> some<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.290> exercises<00:03:21.040> from<00:03:21.909> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
playing some of the exercises from the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:04:50.610 
playing some of the exercises from the
progressive<00:03:22.239> format

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.810 

so<00:04:51.620> those<00:04:51.800> are<00:04:51.949> the<00:04:52.040> three<00:04:52.250> groups<00:04:52.580> of

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
so those are the three groups of

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.969 
so those are the three groups of
exercises<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.630> flow<00:04:53.810> studies<00:04:54.259> the<00:04:54.560> tonguing

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
exercises the flow studies the tonguing

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.999 
exercises the flow studies the tonguing
and<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.699> slurs<00:04:55.940> each<00:04:56.690> week<00:04:57.110> you'd<00:04:57.530> be<00:04:57.650> adding

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
and the slurs each week you'd be adding

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.670 
and the slurs each week you'd be adding
extensions<00:04:58.759> to<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.990> exercise<00:05:00.440> which

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
extensions to the exercise which

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.620 
extensions to the exercise which
increases<00:05:01.130> the<00:05:01.220> range<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.729> the<00:05:02.030> difficulty

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
increases the range and the difficulty

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.409 
increases the range and the difficulty
and<00:05:02.810> the<00:05:02.990> length<00:05:03.229> of<00:05:03.580> your<00:05:04.580> warmup

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
and the length of your warmup

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.070 
and the length of your warmup
so<00:05:06.340> check<00:05:07.340> out<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.699> lesson<00:05:08.030> plan<00:05:08.240> and<00:05:08.630> you'll
