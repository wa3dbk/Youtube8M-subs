00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:14.510 
we wanted to show off one of our little

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.990 
we wanted to show off one of our little
contraptions<00:00:15.260> here<00:00:15.650> we<00:00:16.370> saw<00:00:16.520> several<00:00:16.789> of

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
contraptions here we saw several of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.760 
contraptions here we saw several of
these<00:00:17.090> on<00:00:17.270> YouTube<00:00:17.690> and<00:00:18.020> decided<00:00:18.470> we<00:00:18.530> go<00:00:18.619> ahead

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
these on YouTube and decided we go ahead

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.290 
these on YouTube and decided we go ahead
and<00:00:18.860> create<00:00:18.980> one<00:00:19.160> for<00:00:19.310> ourselves<00:00:19.400> it<00:00:19.789> is<00:00:19.970> an

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
and create one for ourselves it is an

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.530 
and create one for ourselves it is an
automatic<00:00:21.020> melon<00:00:21.500> farm<00:00:22.540> automatic

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540 
automatic melon farm automatic

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.450 
automatic melon farm automatic
semi-automatic<00:00:23.990> you<00:00:24.650> do<00:00:24.770> have<00:00:24.920> to<00:00:25.070> go<00:00:25.190> in<00:00:25.340> and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
semi-automatic you do have to go in and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.480 
semi-automatic you do have to go in and
plow<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:26.470> plow<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:27.530> spots<00:00:28.040> in<00:00:28.160> between<00:00:28.400> the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
plow and plow the spots in between the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.890 
plow and plow the spots in between the
seeds<00:00:28.700> but<00:00:28.910> once<00:00:29.150> you<00:00:29.270> plant<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.570> melons<00:00:29.840> you

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
seeds but once you plant the melons you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.630 
seeds but once you plant the melons you
don't<00:00:30.050> have<00:00:30.170> to<00:00:30.230> replant<00:00:30.560> them<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:30.980> it's<00:00:31.580> a

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
don't have to replant them so it's a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.830 
don't have to replant them so it's a
little<00:00:31.760> bit<00:00:31.880> better<00:00:32.090> than<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.270> wheat<00:00:32.509> because

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
little bit better than the wheat because

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.000 
little bit better than the wheat because
the<00:00:33.550> the<00:00:34.550> melon<00:00:34.820> seeds<00:00:35.030> will<00:00:35.239> produce<00:00:36.010> melons

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
the the melon seeds will produce melons

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.260 
the the melon seeds will produce melons
off<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:37.370> side<00:00:37.610> and<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.060> you<00:00:38.120> don't

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
off to the side and so you don't

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.790 
off to the side and so you don't
actually<00:00:38.480> have<00:00:38.630> to<00:00:38.720> replant<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.260> vines<00:00:39.500> and

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
actually have to replant the vines and

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.260 
actually have to replant the vines and
they<00:00:39.829> just<00:00:40.370> keep<00:00:40.490> growing<00:00:40.670> back<00:00:40.970> and<00:00:41.150> back<00:00:41.240> and

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
they just keep growing back and back and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.350 
they just keep growing back and back and
back<00:00:41.829> so<00:00:42.829> I'm<00:00:43.130> going<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.280> go<00:00:43.489> up<00:00:43.730> here<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:44.270> you

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
back so I'm going to go up here so you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.010 
back so I'm going to go up here so you
can<00:00:44.480> get<00:00:44.810> a<00:00:44.870> better<00:00:45.110> view<00:00:45.500> of<00:00:45.650> it<00:00:46.720> so<00:00:47.720> basically

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
can get a better view of it so basically

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.889 
can get a better view of it so basically
there's<00:00:48.380> a<00:00:48.440> frame<00:00:48.829> with<00:00:49.300> pistons<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.450> those

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
there's a frame with pistons and those

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.180 
there's a frame with pistons and those
are<00:00:51.020> not<00:00:51.170> sticky<00:00:51.440> pistons<00:00:51.739> their<00:00:51.860> regular

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
are not sticky pistons their regular

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.340 
are not sticky pistons their regular
pistons<00:00:52.610> then<00:00:52.850> go<00:00:52.940> all<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.270> way<00:00:53.300> down<00:00:53.570> we've

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
pistons then go all the way down we've

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.160 
pistons then go all the way down we've
got<00:00:54.500> one<00:00:54.800> step<00:00:55.220> up<00:00:55.430> on<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.000> second<00:00:56.329> half<00:00:56.570> so

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
got one step up on the second half so

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.170 
got one step up on the second half so
the<00:00:57.410> water<00:00:57.649> can<00:00:57.770> go<00:00:58.010> down<00:00:58.280> he'll<00:00:58.730> because

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
the water can go down he'll because

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.750 
the water can go down he'll because
we're<00:00:59.300> using<00:00:59.420> water<00:00:59.870> to<00:01:00.170> collect<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.700> we

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
we're using water to collect and we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.729 
we're using water to collect and we
using<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.510> Pistons<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:03.050> harvest<00:01:03.469> and<00:01:03.649> then

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
using the Pistons to harvest and then

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.580 
using the Pistons to harvest and then
water<00:01:04.009> to<00:01:04.250> collect<00:01:04.899> so<00:01:05.899> do<00:01:06.259> you<00:01:06.290> know<00:01:06.380> if<00:01:06.500> you

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
water to collect so do you know if you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.460 
water to collect so do you know if you
go<00:01:06.740> back<00:01:06.890> there<00:01:06.950> by<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.340> water<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.440> I'll<00:01:09.440> go

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
go back there by the water and I'll go

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.830 
go back there by the water and I'll go
to<00:01:09.680> flip<00:01:10.040> it<00:01:10.070> on<00:01:10.250> yeah<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.090> i'll<00:01:11.210> show<00:01:11.420> how<00:01:11.690> that

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
to flip it on yeah so i'll show how that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.170 
to flip it on yeah so i'll show how that
works<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.040> um<00:01:13.610> i<00:01:14.290> did<00:01:15.430> in<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.610> videos<00:01:16.880> there

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
works so um i did in the videos there

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.690 
works so um i did in the videos there
was<00:01:17.299> no<00:01:17.540> videos<00:01:18.140> that<00:01:18.470> had<00:01:18.680> oh<00:01:18.890> no<00:01:19.130> i<00:01:19.340> just

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
was no videos that had oh no i just

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.370 
was no videos that had oh no i just
turned<00:01:19.820> that<00:01:20.000> into<00:01:20.150> unfertilized<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.229> now

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
turned that into unfertilized and now

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.560 
turned that into unfertilized and now
the<00:01:21.440> melons<00:01:21.860> gone<00:01:22.070> that's<00:01:22.760> okay<00:01:23.000> we<00:01:23.450> got

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
the melons gone that's okay we got

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.160 
the melons gone that's okay we got
putting<00:01:23.780> hands<00:01:24.140> all<00:01:24.920> right<00:01:25.159> okay<00:01:26.000> but<00:01:26.479> anyway

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
putting hands all right okay but anyway

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.609 
putting hands all right okay but anyway
in<00:01:27.610> one<00:01:28.610> in<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.970> videos<00:01:29.299> they<00:01:30.140> never<00:01:30.350> had<00:01:30.590> a

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
in one in the videos they never had a

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.000 
in one in the videos they never had a
water<00:01:31.010> control<00:01:31.630> so<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:32.960> built<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.380> water<00:01:33.560> control

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
water control so I built a water control

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.690 
water control so I built a water control
so<00:01:34.549> where<00:01:34.760> we<00:01:34.970> did<00:01:35.180> um<00:01:35.920> easier<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:37.070> maintain<00:01:37.280> it

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
so where we did um easier to maintain it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.640 
so where we did um easier to maintain it
when<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.850> water<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:38.150> off<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.260> that<00:01:39.409> way<00:01:39.530> we

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
when the water is off and so that way we

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.630 
when the water is off and so that way we
can<00:01:39.799> turn<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.010> water<00:01:40.130> off<00:01:40.250> while<00:01:40.520> we're

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
can turn the water off while we're

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.010 
can turn the water off while we're
maintaining<00:01:40.820> it<00:01:41.240> for<00:01:41.390> you<00:01:41.450> need<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.659> go<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:41.900> and

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
maintaining it for you need to go in and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.539 
maintaining it for you need to go in and
like<00:01:42.140> put<00:01:42.380> some<00:01:42.530> new<00:01:42.650> pellet<00:01:42.920> melon<00:01:43.220> seeds<00:01:43.400> in

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
like put some new pellet melon seeds in

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.460 
like put some new pellet melon seeds in
or<00:01:43.670> something<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.020> can<00:01:45.110> turn<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.350> water

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
or something so we can turn the water

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.890 
or something so we can turn the water
off<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.280> they<00:01:46.430> anyway<00:01:46.700> Daniel<00:01:47.479> came<00:01:47.659> up<00:01:47.780> with

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
off so they anyway Daniel came up with

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.950 
off so they anyway Daniel came up with
that<00:01:48.049> and<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:49.460> there's<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.600> switch<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.930> turn

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
that and so there's the switch to turn

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.590 
that and so there's the switch to turn
the<00:01:51.560> water<00:01:51.770> on<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.700> we<00:01:52.790> just<00:01:52.909> leave<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.090> on<00:01:53.330> and

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
the water on so we just leave it on and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.560 
the water on so we just leave it on and
then<00:01:53.630> down<00:01:54.350> here<00:01:54.380> at<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.680> other<00:01:54.890> end<00:01:55.450> I'll<00:01:56.450> go

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
then down here at the other end I'll go

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.910 
then down here at the other end I'll go
down<00:01:56.720> here

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
down here

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.370 
down here
there's<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.610> switch<00:01:58.880> here<00:01:59.270> to<00:02:00.080> actually

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
there's a switch here to actually

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.980 
there's a switch here to actually
harvest<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.920> melons<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:02.000> then<00:02:02.299> you'll<00:02:02.750> just

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
harvest the melons and then you'll just

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.679 
harvest the melons and then you'll just
watch<00:02:03.409> how<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:04.040> works<00:02:04.280> charla<00:02:04.790> magic<00:02:05.180> let<00:02:05.630> me

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
run through and grab those you can

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.330 
run through and grab those you can
actually<00:02:30.110> if<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:30.530> do<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.709> again<00:02:30.769> Daniel<00:02:31.160> a

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
actually if you do it again Daniel a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.770 
actually if you do it again Daniel a
couple<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.670> Warren<00:02:31.819> will<00:02:31.940> fall<00:02:32.150> down<00:02:35.080> yeah<00:02:37.780> so

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
couple of Warren will fall down yeah so

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.949 
couple of Warren will fall down yeah so
then<00:02:38.959> all<00:02:39.799> those<00:02:40.370> melons<00:02:41.180> are<00:02:41.390> going<00:02:41.690> down<00:02:41.840> in

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
then all those melons are going down in

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.449 
then all those melons are going down in
the<00:02:42.049> water<00:02:42.230> they're<00:02:42.500> floating<00:02:42.769> down<00:02:43.130> in<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
the water they're floating down in the

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.110 
the water they're floating down in the
water<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.739> they're<00:02:45.739> slowly<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.760> go<00:02:46.940> down

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
water and they're slowly and go down

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.710 
water and they're slowly and go down
here<00:02:47.769> so<00:02:48.769> they're<00:02:48.950> slowly<00:02:49.519> floating<00:02:50.000> down<00:02:51.130> and

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
here so they're slowly floating down and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.330 
here so they're slowly floating down and
then<00:02:53.720> this<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.470> our<00:02:54.590> collection<00:02:54.860> point<00:02:55.190> down

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
then this is our collection point down

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.360 
then this is our collection point down
here<00:02:55.519> so<00:02:55.670> Daniel<00:02:55.970> came<00:02:56.120> up<00:02:56.180> with<00:02:56.269> this<00:02:56.330> idea<00:02:56.480> of

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
here so Daniel came up with this idea of

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.559 
here so Daniel came up with this idea of
he<00:02:58.370> put<00:02:58.549> a<00:02:58.580> piston<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.000> very<00:02:59.150> bottom<00:02:59.269> and<00:02:59.450> so

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
he put a piston the very bottom and so

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.150 
he put a piston the very bottom and so
we<00:02:59.660> wait<00:02:59.780> for<00:02:59.959> all<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.500> melons<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.890> travel

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
we wait for all the melons to travel

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.890 
we wait for all the melons to travel
down<00:03:01.280> through<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.549> water<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:02.030> think<00:03:02.690> that's

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
down through the water I think that's

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.390 
down through the water I think that's
time<00:03:03.109> takes<00:03:03.380> just<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.650> few<00:03:03.709> minutes<00:03:03.859> and<00:03:04.340> then

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
time takes just a few minutes and then

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.000 
time takes just a few minutes and then
Daniel<00:03:05.180> will<00:03:05.299> flip<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.630> switch<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.590> it's

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
Daniel will flip that switch and it's

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.440 
Daniel will flip that switch and it's
gonna<00:03:07.100> bring<00:03:07.250> all<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:07.790> melons<00:03:07.940> at<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.239> top

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
gonna bring all the melons at the top

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.759 
gonna bring all the melons at the top
and<00:03:08.660> then<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:08.989> grab<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.200> all<00:03:09.410> at<00:03:09.560> once

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
and then you just grab it all at once

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.039 
and then you just grab it all at once
and<00:03:10.090> we've<00:03:11.090> done<00:03:11.209> this<00:03:11.299> a<00:03:11.359> couple<00:03:11.450> times<00:03:11.720> and

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
and we've done this a couple times and

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.560 
and we've done this a couple times and
you<00:03:12.140> get<00:03:12.260> anywhere<00:03:12.470> from<00:03:12.620> 80<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.070> 100<00:03:13.609> melons

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
you get anywhere from 80 to 100 melons

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.970 
you get anywhere from 80 to 100 melons
and<00:03:14.780> every<00:03:15.380> single<00:03:15.560> suit<00:03:15.980> so<00:03:16.750> that's<00:03:17.829> if<00:03:18.829> you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
and every single suit so that's if you

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.940 
and every single suit so that's if you
wait<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:19.700> let<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.120> melons

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.369 

progress<00:03:23.940> with<00:03:24.180> some<00:03:24.330> bad<00:03:24.720> some<00:03:24.900> bone<00:03:25.080> meal<00:03:25.260> in

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
progress with some bad some bone meal in

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.229 
progress with some bad some bone meal in
there<00:03:25.500> let<00:03:25.650> them<00:03:25.739> progress<00:03:25.890> quickly<00:03:26.220> then<00:03:27.060> you

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
there let them progress quickly then you

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.570 
there let them progress quickly then you
can<00:03:27.330> probably<00:03:27.480> get<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.840> 300<00:03:28.319> an<00:03:28.440> hour<00:03:28.680> easily

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
can probably get to 300 an hour easily

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.170 
can probably get to 300 an hour easily
