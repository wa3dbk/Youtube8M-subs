00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:46.910 

Oh

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.200 

that's<00:05:47.920> the<00:05:48.130> shell<00:05:48.400> drill<00:05:48.670> because<00:05:48.880> that<00:05:49.090> is

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
that's the shell drill because that is

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.560 
what we call the shell drill and then
you<00:05:50.800> can<00:05:50.980> eventually<00:05:51.190> go<00:05:51.640> and<00:05:51.820> play<00:05:52.060> that<00:05:52.270> live

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
you can eventually go and play that live

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.390 
you can eventually go and play that live
in<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:52.900> practice<00:05:53.320> so<00:05:53.830> then<00:05:53.980> you<00:05:54.100> let<00:05:54.280> the

that<00:06:09.670> can<00:06:09.820> be<00:06:09.850> very<00:06:09.940> frustrating<00:06:10.150> and<00:06:10.900> it<00:06:11.350> can

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
that can be very frustrating and it can

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.720 
that can be very frustrating and it can
be<00:06:11.620> but<00:06:11.890> that's<00:06:11.980> what's<00:06:12.220> going<00:06:12.280> to<00:06:12.370> happen<00:06:12.640> in

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
be but that's what's going to happen in

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.920 
be but that's what's going to happen in
a<00:06:12.820> game<00:06:13.000> there's<00:06:13.210> going<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.360> be<00:06:13.420> times<00:06:13.690> we<00:06:13.840> have

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
a game there's going to be times we have

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.540 
a game there's going to be times we have
to<00:06:14.050> step<00:06:14.290> up<00:06:14.320> and<00:06:14.620> make<00:06:14.740> stops<00:06:15.100> and<00:06:15.340> make<00:06:15.430> it

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
to step up and make stops and make it

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.300 
to step up and make stops and make it
consecutive<00:06:16.180> stops<00:06:16.420> so<00:06:17.170> you<00:06:17.830> know<00:06:17.950> when<00:06:18.190> they

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
consecutive stops so you know when they

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:19.380 
consecutive stops so you know when they
pressured<00:06:18.820> you<00:06:18.910> could<00:06:19.030> see<00:06:19.180> when<00:06:19.300> the

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
pressured you could see when the

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.180 
pressured you could see when the
intensity<00:06:19.930> was<00:06:20.080> loud<00:06:20.350> if<00:06:20.680> they<00:06:20.800> were<00:06:20.890> talking

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
intensity was loud if they were talking

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.040 
intensity was loud if they were talking
and<00:06:21.400> they're<00:06:21.550> yelling<00:06:21.730> it's<00:06:22.450> harder<00:06:22.810> for<00:06:22.930> the

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
and they're yelling it's harder for the

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.230 
and they're yelling it's harder for the
offense<00:06:23.410> to<00:06:23.530> play<00:06:23.740> if<00:06:24.250> it<00:06:24.400> was<00:06:24.520> dead<00:06:24.730> silent

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
offense to play if it was dead silent

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.310 
offense to play if it was dead silent
out<00:06:25.330> here<00:06:25.570> it<00:06:25.750> wouldn't<00:06:26.080> be<00:06:26.140> that<00:06:26.290> difficult

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
out here it wouldn't be that difficult

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.290 
out here it wouldn't be that difficult
the<00:06:27.160> team<00:06:27.400> wouldn't<00:06:27.730> know<00:06:27.820> who<00:06:27.970> was<00:06:28.120> there

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
the team wouldn't know who was there

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.430 
the team wouldn't know who was there
they<00:06:28.510> wouldn't<00:06:28.720> be<00:06:28.840> supporting<00:06:29.290> one<00:06:29.410> another

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
they wouldn't be supporting one another

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.530 
they wouldn't be supporting one another
okay<00:06:30.220> so<00:06:30.280> it's<00:06:30.520> team<00:06:30.760> defense<00:06:31.180> you<00:06:31.270> can<00:06:31.300> see
