00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.240
 so that the three situations in which I see that dsk expresses itself and 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.680
 this at all ages since I meet very young children 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.240
 just like students both captivating who has until now in 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.630
 high school 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.230
 for his first situation was actually hours as part of 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.060
 classroom learning 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.970
 % of situations 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.060
 the difficulties of concentration of attention on the duration 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.360
 the concentration of his players 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.640
 what I call this for example 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.969
 and then winter the hesitation more and more important 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.240
 to express oneself 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.590
 when it comes to his personal word 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.620
 second situation I see a lot of subtraction from his deportation delegation 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.940
 interrogation control more and more students statistically a year in 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.940
 my work 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.490
 make it some of the issues dealt with for example he was saying madam 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.749
 I did not have enough gold time behind actually this question of time 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.749
 for me there is a stress that has prevented anticipation 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.310
 I dream of organizing from time to time in the allotted time 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.130
 with actually a lot of doubts and third man 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.390
 a situation in which 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.689
 this stress is expressed it's at home in the personal work 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.170
 more and more two-hour work on February 10 harper had done two 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.660
 to rog off big off-road e to actually postpone work 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.120
 until you do not do it 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.190
 but in any case I see three essential sources 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.820
 the first map 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.240
 r I know that a lot of students 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.240
 he is not in a situation of control in a situation of control 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.480
 for estelle requests for information on the precise school situation 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.670
 1 for example 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.750
 for beziers who do not know how to answer the next question 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.369
 what is the professor of francs that of malta history geography of 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.020
 psa expecting from me for March 8 for example do their teachers me 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.360
 request to work the plan because he does not sell trail spelled that's 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.080
 what is the conclusion 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.870
 also in relation to methods of working more and more students in 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.270
 their relation to stress also hold for their contribution to the water the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.250
 positive technique that often take as an impediment to their freedom as 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.160
 a way to progress and then it's a tool that is otherwise very 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.100
 important for their practices that are primarily needed today 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:26.689
 to return to the balanced budget that will seem to you all 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:27.849
 no harm 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.299
 she is the big family 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.410
 that is to say they can do 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.489
 to read the time that passes to be able to project to be able to anticipate 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.169
 while the war would stop there in the control centers 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:41.609
 I realized 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.689
 for those that their relation to time% actually was one of the sources of 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.549
 stress and the conditions of failure 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.629
 by dint of reading the time on a contrasting note shady talez or on the water 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:53.719
 but alas without 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.420
 Emilie I sign right away and not 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.459
 the time limit that is unique to learning 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.579
 since to learn 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.900
 for actually a quagmire assessment 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.599
 it's about time physics of course the time to assimilate
