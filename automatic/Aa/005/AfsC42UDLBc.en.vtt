00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
to get to your yard sale so i did try

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.770 
to get to your yard sale so i did try
and<00:03:43.320> do<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:43.830> on<00:03:44.130> my<00:03:44.520> last<00:03:44.730> one<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:45.360> threw<00:03:45.720> a

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
and do that on on my last one I threw a

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.600 
and do that on on my last one I threw a
little<00:03:46.020> crappy<00:03:46.800> one<00:03:47.070> here<00:03:47.250> on<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.459> one

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
little crappy one here on this one

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.310 
little crappy one here on this one
because<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.820> didn't<00:03:48.030> happen<00:03:48.150> on<00:03:48.330> this<00:03:48.390> one<00:03:48.540> and

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
because it didn't happen on this one and

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.449 
because it didn't happen on this one and
I'm<00:03:49.410> not<00:03:49.560> sure<00:03:49.680> if<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:49.830> helped<00:03:50.130> or<00:03:50.220> not<00:03:50.250> but

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
I'm not sure if that helped or not but

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.710 
I'm not sure if that helped or not but
it<00:03:50.520> was<00:03:50.610> an<00:03:50.700> idea<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.180> threw<00:03:51.420> out<00:03:51.450> there

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
it was an idea that I threw out there

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.900 
it was an idea that I threw out there
just<00:03:51.900> because<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:52.770> didn't<00:03:53.490> really<00:03:53.580> talk<00:03:53.760> to

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
just because I didn't really talk to

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.160 
just because I didn't really talk to
people<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.150> ask<00:03:54.270> them<00:03:54.420> if<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.720> helped<00:03:54.930> them<00:03:54.959> or

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
people and ask them if it helped them or

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.530 
people and ask them if it helped them or
not<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:55.950> don't<00:03:56.280> know<00:03:56.340> if<00:03:56.430> that's<00:03:56.610> effective

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
not so I don't know if that's effective

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.870 
not so I don't know if that's effective
or<00:03:57.810> not<00:03:57.950> but<00:03:58.950> it's<00:03:59.130> another<00:03:59.340> idea<00:03:59.670> that<00:03:59.820> you

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
or not but it's another idea that you

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.180 
or not but it's another idea that you
can<00:04:00.000> do<00:04:00.090> basically<00:04:01.020> change<00:04:01.620> anything<00:04:02.010> you
