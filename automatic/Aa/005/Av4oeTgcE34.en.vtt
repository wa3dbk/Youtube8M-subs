I recognize Richard from the RC network

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.379 
I recognize Richard from the RC network
and<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> be<00:00:11.429> an<00:00:11.519> unboxing<00:00:11.910> of

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
and this is going to be an unboxing of

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.280 
and this is going to be an unboxing of
the<00:00:12.809> team

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
the team

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.750 
the team
Orion<00:00:13.910> vortex<00:00:14.910> neon<00:00:15.599> eight<00:00:16.070> sensorless<00:00:17.070> four

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
Orion vortex neon eight sensorless four

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.500 
Orion vortex neon eight sensorless four
pole<00:00:18.029> brushless<00:00:18.660> system<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.609> an<00:00:20.760> ESC<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
pole brushless system this is an ESC and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.019 
pole brushless system this is an ESC and
motor<00:00:22.170> inside<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.189> box<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.699> few<00:00:23.880> other

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
motor inside the box and a few other

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.400 
motor inside the box and a few other
things<00:00:24.150> we'll<00:00:24.600> get<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> little<00:00:25.109> bit

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
things we'll get to that a little bit

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.800 
things we'll get to that a little bit
later<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.820> an<00:00:27.029> eight<00:00:27.240> skill

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
later this is going to be an eight skill

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.220 
later this is going to be an eight skill
system<00:00:28.109> thus<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.890> neon<00:00:29.400> eight<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.900> chose

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
system thus the neon eight and I chose

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.560 
system thus the neon eight and I chose
some<00:00:32.009> pretty<00:00:32.219> good<00:00:32.399> parameters<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.239> my<00:00:33.390> new

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
some pretty good parameters for my new

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.020 
some pretty good parameters for my new
projects<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.350> at<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.770> RC<00:00:35.100> Network<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.760> I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
projects here at the RC Network so I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.400 
projects here at the RC Network so I
want<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.540> show<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.690> guys<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:37.110> actually

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
want to show you guys what actually

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.080 
want to show you guys what actually
comes<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> box<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> some<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.760> specs

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
comes in the box and some of the specs

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.110 
comes in the box and some of the specs
from<00:00:39.450> Team<00:00:39.780> Orion<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.100> off<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:42.000> know

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
from Team Orion so right off you know

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.979 
from Team Orion so right off you know
very<00:00:42.390> small<00:00:42.540> box<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.360> large<00:00:45.360> system<00:00:45.660> is

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
very small box that this large system is

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.290 
very small box that this large system is
in<00:00:46.170> usually<00:00:47.039> you'll<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.700> size<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.120> box

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
in usually you'll see this size of box

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.930 
in usually you'll see this size of box
for<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.840> an<00:00:48.989> ESC<00:00:49.320> alone<00:00:49.800> or<00:00:50.190> maybe<00:00:50.610> even<00:00:50.700> just

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
for just an ESC alone or maybe even just

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.290 
for just an ESC alone or maybe even just
a<00:00:51.180> motor<00:00:51.420> alone<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.039> somehow<00:00:53.039> team<00:00:53.820> Orion<00:00:54.090> has

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
a motor alone so somehow team Orion has

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.990 
a motor alone so somehow team Orion has
kind<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.629> crammed<00:00:55.110> everything<00:00:55.829> inside<00:00:56.640> here

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
kind of crammed everything inside here

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.310 
kind of crammed everything inside here
we're<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:58.020> over<00:00:58.050> some<00:00:58.289> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
we're going to kind of go over some of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.630 
we're going to kind of go over some of
the<00:00:58.410> specs<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> outside<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> box

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the specs here on the outside of the box

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.270 
the specs here on the outside of the box
because<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.030> definitely<00:01:00.379> has<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> lot<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.859> good

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
because it definitely has a lot of good

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.219 
because it definitely has a lot of good
branding<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:02.969> here<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.390> first<00:01:03.960> thing<00:01:04.110> right

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
branding on here so first thing right

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.679 
branding on here so first thing right
here<00:01:04.409> waterproof<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> waterproof

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
here waterproof so this is a waterproof

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.649 
here waterproof so this is a waterproof
motor<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.409> ESC<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:08.820> you're<00:01:09.000> kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.479> in

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
motor and ESC so if you're kind of in

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.380 
motor and ESC so if you're kind of in
that<00:01:10.320> wetter<00:01:10.650> climate<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.030> run<00:01:12.210> into

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that wetter climate or like to run into

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.410 
that wetter climate or like to run into
snow<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:13.020> those<00:01:13.470> type<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.740> things<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:15.210> should

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
snow or those type of things you should

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.770 
snow or those type of things you should
have<00:01:15.450> no<00:01:15.689> issues<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.650> motor<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.369> ESC

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
have no issues with this motor and ESC

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.820 
have no issues with this motor and ESC
now<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.439> need<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> take

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
now with that you do need to take

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.620 
now with that you do need to take
precautions<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> other<00:01:20.850> electronics

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
precautions on the other electronics

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.749 
precautions on the other electronics
like<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:21.930> receiver<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.619> servo<00:01:23.040> all<00:01:23.580> your

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
like your receiver your servo all your

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.649 
like your receiver your servo all your
bearings<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.420> car<00:01:24.600> -<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.460> anyways

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
bearings in your car - so anyways

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.789 
bearings in your car - so anyways
waterproof<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.630> sensorless<00:01:30.630> system<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
waterproof it is a sensorless system so

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.950 
waterproof it is a sensorless system so
there's<00:01:32.369> no<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.700> there's<00:01:32.759> no<00:01:33.150> extra<00:01:33.509> sensor

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
there's no that there's no extra sensor

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.490 
there's no that there's no extra sensor
cord<00:01:35.000> for<00:01:36.000> poles<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.659> definitely<00:01:37.229> gonna<00:01:37.380> have

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
cord for poles so definitely gonna have

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
cord for poles so definitely gonna have
more<00:01:37.650> torque<00:01:37.979> than<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.250> two<00:01:38.430> pole<00:01:38.610> motor<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.119> is

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
more torque than a two pole motor it is

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.539 
more torque than a two pole motor it is
brushless<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> full<00:01:41.009> system<00:01:41.430> in

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
brushless and it's the full system in

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.149 
brushless and it's the full system in
here<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.049> other<00:01:43.290> side<00:01:43.619> over<00:01:43.740> here

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
here so on the other side over here

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.429 
here so on the other side over here
let's<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.880> here<00:01:45.180> some<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> specs<00:01:45.869> I'm

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
let's see here some of the specs I'm

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.420 
let's see here some of the specs I'm
going<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.740> links<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.220> video

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
going to have links in the video

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.910 
going to have links in the video
description<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.360> check<00:01:48.960> those<00:01:49.770> out

kind<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> stated<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.360> they're<00:02:00.659> meant<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.560> 1/8

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
kind of stated on they're meant for 1/8

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.810 
kind of stated on they're meant for 1/8
scale<00:02:02.520> off-road<00:02:03.509> cars<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.130> pretty<00:02:05.399> much<00:02:05.549> can

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
scale off-road cars and pretty much can

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.350 
scale off-road cars and pretty much can
handle<00:02:06.149> anywhere<00:02:06.509> from<00:02:06.659> 2<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.960> 4<00:02:07.500> s<00:02:07.680> lipo<00:02:08.360> once

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.780 
handle anywhere from 2 to 4 s lipo once
again<00:02:09.599> 5<00:02:10.020> millimeter<00:02:10.679> shafts<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.489> need

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
again 5 millimeter shafts so you need

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.460 
again 5 millimeter shafts so you need
pretty<00:02:12.599> much<00:02:12.810> a

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
pretty much a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.750 
pretty much a
larger<00:02:14.070> bore<00:02:14.640> opinion<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.570> go<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:15.930> there<00:02:16.170> I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
larger bore opinion to go on there I

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.760 
larger bore opinion to go on there I
overall<00:02:17.760> weight<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.120> motor<00:02:18.300> 344<00:02:19.110> grams<00:02:19.440> so

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
overall weight of the motor 344 grams so

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.820 
overall weight of the motor 344 grams so
pretty<00:02:20.040> hefty<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.610> size<00:02:21.410> speed<00:02:22.410> control<00:02:22.740> right

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
pretty hefty in size speed control right

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.350 
pretty hefty in size speed control right
here<00:02:22.890> it's<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.460> have<00:02:23.640> all<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.120> specs

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
here it's going to have all the specs

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.380 
here it's going to have all the specs
right<00:02:24.540> there<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.140> 130<00:02:26.100> amp<00:02:26.400> speed

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
right there it is a 130 amp speed

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.600 
right there it is a 130 amp speed
control<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> constant

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
control so that is a constant

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.210 
control so that is a constant
you'll<00:02:30.060> notice<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.480> peak<00:02:30.720> right<00:02:30.900> there<00:02:31.220> 760

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
you'll notice the peak right there 760

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.670 
you'll notice the peak right there 760
amps<00:02:32.520> oh<00:02:32.640> my<00:02:33.030> god<00:02:33.270> that's<00:02:33.540> that's<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.470> lot<00:02:34.650> of

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
amps oh my god that's that's a lot of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.520 
amps oh my god that's that's a lot of
hams<00:02:34.920> right<00:02:35.160> there<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.150> once<00:02:36.450> again<00:02:36.570> 2<00:02:36.990> to<00:02:37.110> 4<00:02:37.320> s

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
hams right there so once again 2 to 4 s

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.340 
hams right there so once again 2 to 4 s
lipo<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:38.580> handle<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.210> if<00:02:39.840> you're<00:02:40.020> still

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
lipo it can handle and if you're still

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.770 
lipo it can handle and if you're still
running<00:02:40.500> nickel<00:02:40.950> metal<00:02:41.070> hydride<00:02:41.630> this<00:02:42.630> is

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
running nickel metal hydride this is

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.920 
running nickel metal hydride this is
probably<00:02:43.050> not<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.200> system<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.070> so<00:02:44.930> 110

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
probably not the system for you so 110

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.250 
probably not the system for you so 110
grams<00:02:46.260> with<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.770> wires<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:48.050> pretty<00:02:49.050> much<00:02:49.230> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
grams with the wires so pretty much a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
we have it everything is kind of in its

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.130 
we have it everything is kind of in its
own<00:03:09.960> little<00:03:10.250> spot<00:03:11.250> inside<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.570> cool

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
own little spot inside of this cool

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.840 
own little spot inside of this cool
little<00:03:13.260> box<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.430> going<00:03:14.550> to<00:03:14.640> grab<00:03:14.730> the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
little box so it's going to grab the

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.040 
little box so it's going to grab the
motor<00:03:15.030> first<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.510> we'll<00:03:15.600> take<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.780> look<00:03:15.960> at

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
motor first and we'll take a look at

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.910 
motor first and we'll take a look at
that<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.090> motor<00:03:18.270> wow<00:03:18.720> it's<00:03:19.230> pretty<00:03:19.410> hefty

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
that so the motor wow it's pretty hefty

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.460 
that so the motor wow it's pretty hefty
I've<00:03:20.130> compared<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.870> couple<00:03:22.410> other

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
I've compared it to a couple other

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.850 
I've compared it to a couple other
motors<00:03:22.890> just<00:03:23.160> by<00:03:23.400> looking<00:03:24.150> at<00:03:24.270> it<00:03:24.420> and

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
motors just by looking at it and

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.040 
motors just by looking at it and
definitely<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:27.110> nice<00:03:28.110> sized<00:03:29.660> brushless<00:03:30.660> motor

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
definitely a nice sized brushless motor

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.260 
definitely a nice sized brushless motor

up<00:04:02.640> here<00:04:02.910> pretty<00:04:03.690> much<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:04.019> six<00:04:04.530> inch<00:04:04.769> lead

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
up here pretty much a six inch lead

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.490 
up here pretty much a six inch lead
right<00:04:05.550> there<00:04:05.580> with<00:04:05.940> gold<00:04:06.360> four<00:04:07.019> millimeter

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
right there with gold four millimeter

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.320 
right there with gold four millimeter
plugs<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.640> will<00:04:08.760> plug<00:04:08.910> straight<00:04:09.269> into

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
plugs and that will plug straight into

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.630 
plugs and that will plug straight into
the<00:04:09.870> ESC<00:04:10.320> so<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.709> is<00:04:10.860> pretty<00:04:11.370> much<00:04:11.489> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
the ESC so this is pretty much a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.430 
the ESC so this is pretty much a
plug-and-play<00:04:11.970> once<00:04:12.600> you<00:04:12.810> connect<00:04:13.230> your<00:04:13.380> own

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
plug-and-play once you connect your own

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.810 
plug-and-play once you connect your own
choice<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.870> connectors<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:17.370> that's<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.640> motor

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
choice of connectors so that's the motor

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.979 
choice of connectors so that's the motor
right<00:04:17.970> there<00:04:18.180> let's<00:04:18.419> set<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.720> off<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
right there let's set that off to the

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.140 
right there let's set that off to the
side<00:04:19.130> let's<00:04:20.130> see<00:04:20.340> what<00:04:20.489> else<00:04:20.580> we<00:04:20.760> get<00:04:20.880> inside

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
side let's see what else we get inside

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.740 
side let's see what else we get inside
here<00:04:21.390> here's<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.840> ESC<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:24.450> am<00:04:24.570> mistaken

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
here here's the ESC and I am mistaken

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.140 
here here's the ESC and I am mistaken
actually<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:25.620> actually<00:04:25.950> comes<00:04:26.580> with<00:04:26.669> Dean's

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
actually this actually comes with Dean's

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.390 
actually this actually comes with Dean's
connecters<00:04:27.509> that's<00:04:27.750> pretty<00:04:28.169> cool<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.650> didn't

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
connecters that's pretty cool I didn't

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.520 
connecters that's pretty cool I didn't
realize<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:29.820> so<00:04:30.060> right<00:04:30.930> inside<00:04:31.169> here<00:04:31.350> you're

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
realize that so right inside here you're

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.800 
realize that so right inside here you're
seeing<00:04:31.710> all<00:04:31.979> of<00:04:32.009> the<00:04:32.220> carbon<00:04:32.639> look<00:04:33.060> of<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.479> fan

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
seeing all of the carbon look of the fan

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.350 
seeing all of the carbon look of the fan
right<00:04:34.139> there<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.650> get<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:34.979> aluminum<00:04:35.789> kind<00:04:36.270> of

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
right there you get the aluminum kind of

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.040 
right there you get the aluminum kind of
peeking<00:04:36.780> out<00:04:36.900> from<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:38.570> just<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.810> heat

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
peeking out from the just the heat

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.219 
peeking out from the just the heat
dissipation<00:04:40.560> sinks<00:04:41.539> right<00:04:42.539> here<00:04:42.750> you<00:04:42.900> got<00:04:43.080> the

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
dissipation sinks right here you got the

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.740 
dissipation sinks right here you got the
capacitor<00:04:43.949> covers<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:44.789> on<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.539> flip<00:04:45.720> side

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
capacitor covers and on the flip side

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.990 
capacitor covers and on the flip side
here<00:04:46.169> here<00:04:46.530> as<00:04:46.740> we<00:04:47.070> can<00:04:47.280> kind<00:04:47.520> of<00:04:47.550> look<00:04:47.729> into

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
here here as we can kind of look into

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.590 
here here as we can kind of look into
here<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.930> have<00:04:49.199> a<00:04:49.229> plug<00:04:49.860> for<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.160> fan<00:04:50.600> and

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
here you have a plug for the fan and

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.420 
here you have a plug for the fan and
let's<00:04:52.259> look<00:04:52.410> at<00:04:52.500> these<00:04:52.560> wires<00:04:52.889> here

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
let's look at these wires here

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.409 
let's look at these wires here

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
right there a little set mode indicator

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.120 
right there a little set mode indicator
it<00:05:00.060> is<00:05:00.539> waterproof<00:05:00.840> as<00:05:01.169> well<00:05:01.350> so<00:05:01.650> about<00:05:01.860> four

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
it is waterproof as well so about four

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.710 
it is waterproof as well so about four
inches<00:05:02.400> on<00:05:02.550> that<00:05:02.699> that's<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.150> little<00:05:03.330> bit<00:05:03.449> long

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
inches on that that's a little bit long

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.800 
inches on that that's a little bit long
ish<00:05:03.960> as<00:05:04.949> far<00:05:05.160> as<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.310> receiver<00:05:05.729> wire<00:05:06.090> god<00:05:06.600> this

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
ish as far as a receiver wire god this

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.969 
ish as far as a receiver wire god this
thing<00:05:07.020> is<00:05:07.550> godlike<00:05:08.550> 14<00:05:09.210> inches<00:05:09.539> or<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:09.979> and

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
thing is godlike 14 inches or so and

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.770 
thing is godlike 14 inches or so and
length<00:05:11.370> with<00:05:11.669> you<00:05:11.940> know<00:05:12.270> pretty<00:05:12.449> much<00:05:12.539> if

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
length with you know pretty much if

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.939 
length with you know pretty much if
you're<00:05:12.930> running<00:05:13.050> an<00:05:13.199> eighth<00:05:13.350> scale<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:13.800> may

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
you're running an eighth scale you may

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.879 
you're running an eighth scale you may
need<00:05:14.130> that<00:05:14.280> extra<00:05:14.310> length<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.960> motor<00:05:16.590> wires

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
need that extra length the motor wires

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.040 
need that extra length the motor wires
about<00:05:17.580> eight<00:05:17.789> inches<00:05:18.270> in<00:05:18.330> length<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:18.900> they

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
about eight inches in length and they

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.950 
about eight inches in length and they
are<00:05:19.199> fully<00:05:19.560> covered<00:05:20.130> with<00:05:21.120> some<00:05:21.389> shrink<00:05:21.750> wrap

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
are fully covered with some shrink wrap

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.070 
are fully covered with some shrink wrap
there<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.560> cover<00:05:23.490> the<00:05:23.789> actual<00:05:24.120> seal<00:05:24.570> of<00:05:24.840> the

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
there to cover the actual seal of the

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.409 
there to cover the actual seal of the
gold<00:05:25.289> plugs<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:26.160> then<00:05:26.610> you<00:05:26.729> do<00:05:26.849> have<00:05:26.880> a<00:05:27.030> Deans

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
gold plugs and then you do have a Deans

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.659 
gold plugs and then you do have a Deans
connector<00:05:27.599> this<00:05:28.320> is<00:05:28.380> probably<00:05:29.220> another<00:05:29.430> good

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
connector this is probably another good

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.379 
connector this is probably another good
8<00:05:29.849> inches<00:05:30.210> fairly<00:05:30.990> long<00:05:31.260> and<00:05:31.620> this<00:05:32.340> is<00:05:32.580> a<00:05:32.610> right

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
8 inches fairly long and this is a right

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.810 
8 inches fairly long and this is a right
up<00:05:33.599> to<00:05:33.840> that<00:05:33.870> Deans<00:05:34.440> connector<00:05:34.530> so<00:05:35.099> pretty

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
up to that Deans connector so pretty

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.210 
up to that Deans connector so pretty
cool<00:05:36.380> really<00:05:37.380> liked<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.650> look<00:05:37.800> of<00:05:37.889> this<00:05:38.010> thing

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
cool really liked the look of this thing

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.750 
cool really liked the look of this thing
this<00:05:38.400> it's<00:05:39.270> kind<00:05:39.599> of<00:05:39.630> all<00:05:39.870> one<00:05:40.229> encased<00:05:41.039> into

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
this it's kind of all one encased into

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.000 
this it's kind of all one encased into
that<00:05:42.300> little

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
that little

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.649 
that little
ESC<00:05:44.010> there<00:05:44.430> it's<00:05:44.639> like<00:05:44.909> a<00:05:44.940> it's<00:05:45.449> like<00:05:45.570> a

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
ESC there it's like a it's like a

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.839 
ESC there it's like a it's like a
clamshell<00:05:46.080> design<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:46.949> it's<00:05:47.190> clamped<00:05:47.610> around

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
clamshell design and it's clamped around

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.719 
clamshell design and it's clamped around
so<00:05:48.419> really<00:05:49.169> kind<00:05:49.289> of<00:05:49.409> dig<00:05:49.620> that<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:50.070> has<00:05:50.400> some

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
so really kind of dig that it has some

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.870 
so really kind of dig that it has some
good<00:05:51.539> quality<00:05:52.199> to<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:52.590> and<00:05:52.740> I<00:05:52.979> really<00:05:53.550> like<00:05:53.729> the

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
good quality to it and I really like the

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.580 
good quality to it and I really like the
way<00:05:54.000> this<00:05:54.120> thing<00:05:54.300> look<00:05:54.539> fans<00:05:55.139> kind<00:05:55.409> of<00:05:55.470> all

way this thing look fans kind of all

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.990 
way this thing look fans kind of all
built<00:05:55.830> in<00:05:55.949> there<00:05:56.099> you<00:05:56.220> do<00:05:56.280> have<00:05:56.430> four<00:05:56.639> screws

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
built in there you do have four screws
