that's<00:05:36.490> it<00:05:36.870> 50<00:05:37.870> rounds<00:05:41.400> let's<00:05:42.400> go<00:05:42.690> what<00:05:43.690> we

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
that's it 50 rounds let's go what we

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:57.060 
that's it 50 rounds let's go what we
have<00:05:43.930> then<00:05:55.110> they<00:05:56.110> just<00:05:56.289> have<00:05:56.440> to<00:05:56.590> endure

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.070 
have then they just have to endure

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.110 
have then they just have to endure
watching<00:05:57.550> it<00:05:57.669> as<00:05:58.509> we<00:05:58.810> walk<00:05:59.050> 100<00:05:59.380> yards<00:05:59.889> to<00:06:00.120> the

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
watching it as we walk 100 yards to the

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:20.850 
watching it as we walk 100 yards to the
target<00:06:02.430> to<00:06:03.430> see<00:06:03.580> what<00:06:03.729> it<00:06:03.820> did<00:06:03.940> there<00:06:19.860> it's

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
target to see what it did there it's

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.710 
target to see what it did there it's
actually<00:06:21.840> kind<00:06:22.840> of<00:06:22.900> getting<00:06:23.710> used<00:06:23.919> to

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
actually kind of getting used to

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.270 
actually kind of getting used to
we'll<00:06:25.720> take<00:06:25.840> getting<00:06:26.110> used<00:06:26.289> to<00:06:26.410> a<00:06:26.500> shooting

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
we'll take getting used to a shooting

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.469 
we'll take getting used to a shooting
them<00:06:27.610> around<00:06:27.760> the<00:06:27.880> corner<00:06:28.090> because<00:06:28.270> as<00:06:28.389> you

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
them around the corner because as you

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.950 
them around the corner because as you
can<00:06:28.570> see<00:06:28.780> you<00:06:29.289> cannot<00:06:29.590> really<00:06:30.810> press<00:06:31.810> it

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
can see you cannot really press it

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.990 
can see you cannot really press it
against<00:06:32.259> your<00:06:32.289> shoulder<00:06:32.610> so<00:06:33.610> you're<00:06:33.759> really

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
against your shoulder so you're really

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.750 
against your shoulder so you're really
holding<00:06:34.180> it<00:06:34.419> in<00:06:34.509> two<00:06:34.630> hands<00:06:35.070> so<00:06:36.070> it<00:06:36.190> makes<00:06:36.669> it

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
holding it in two hands so it makes it

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.180 
holding it in two hands so it makes it
really<00:06:37.120> jumpy<00:06:38.160> in<00:06:39.160> the<00:06:39.510> in<00:06:40.510> the<00:06:40.750> scope<00:06:41.160> but<00:06:42.160> I

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
really jumpy in the in the scope but I

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.529 
really jumpy in the in the scope but I
guess<00:06:42.400> in<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:42.610> combat<00:06:42.910> situation<00:06:43.389> that

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
guess in the combat situation that

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:45.540 
guess in the combat situation that
really<00:06:43.660> doesn't<00:06:44.020> matter<00:06:44.190> as<00:06:45.190> long<00:06:45.250> as<00:06:45.370> you

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
really doesn't matter as long as you

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.580 
really doesn't matter as long as you
have<00:06:45.669> the<00:06:45.760> capability<00:06:46.860> okay<00:06:48.419> that's<00:06:49.419> I<00:06:49.840> think

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.590 
have the capability okay that's I think

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.810 
have the capability okay that's I think
it's<00:06:50.860> pretty<00:06:51.039> impressive<00:06:52.320> I<00:06:53.699> think<00:06:54.699> it's

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
it's pretty impressive I think it's

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.469 
it's pretty impressive I think it's
pretty<00:06:54.970> impressive<00:06:55.949> yeah

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
pretty impressive yeah

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:03.330 
pretty impressive yeah
this<00:06:58.479> was<00:06:59.310> me<00:07:00.310> shooting<00:07:00.580> pretty<00:07:00.909> much<00:07:02.340> from

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
this was me shooting pretty much from

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.420 
this was me shooting pretty much from
