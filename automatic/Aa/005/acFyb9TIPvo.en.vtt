type<00:04:50.470> d<00:04:50.620> that<00:04:51.070> makes<00:04:51.280> sense

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
type d that makes sense

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.790

you<00:05:40.590> can<00:05:40.740> vary<00:05:40.979> from<00:05:41.129> 15<00:05:41.310> minutes<00:05:41.759> to<00:05:41.939> half<00:05:41.969> an

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
you can vary from 15 minutes to half an

you can vary from 15 minutes to half an
hour

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
hour

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.209 
hour
and<00:05:44.599> unfortunately<00:05:45.650> staring<00:05:46.650> won't<00:05:46.919> make<00:05:47.099> it

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
and unfortunately staring won't make it

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.610 
and unfortunately staring won't make it
go<00:05:47.250> any<00:05:47.520> faster<00:05:48.110> within<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.289> first<00:05:49.500> couple

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
go any faster within the first couple

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.050 
go any faster within the first couple
minutes<00:05:50.009> it<00:05:50.189> should<00:05:50.219> start<00:05:50.580> thickening<00:05:50.759> up

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
minutes it should start thickening up

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
of your tighty ice cream into it this is

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.950 
of your tighty ice cream into it this is
probably<00:06:14.699> one<00:06:14.819> of<00:06:14.849> the<00:06:14.939> messiest<00:06:15.389> parts<00:06:15.839> of

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
probably one of the messiest parts of

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.019 
probably one of the messiest parts of
this<00:06:16.080> entire<00:06:16.349> tutorial<00:06:16.979> so<00:06:17.460> don't<00:06:17.699> be<00:06:17.789> afraid

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:18.029 
this entire tutorial so don't be afraid

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:21.600 
this entire tutorial so don't be afraid
to<00:06:18.120> use<00:06:18.240> a<00:06:18.270> few<00:06:18.479> paper<00:06:18.689> towels<00:06:18.930> here<00:06:19.229> and<00:06:19.319> there

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.300 

I'm<00:06:22.060> not<00:06:22.719> entirely<00:06:23.080> sure<00:06:23.289> what<00:06:23.800> the<00:06:23.830> size<00:06:24.159> of

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.279 
I'm not entirely sure what the size of
this<00:06:24.430> container<00:06:24.819> is<00:06:24.909> I<00:06:25.270> think<00:06:25.330> it's<00:06:25.810> a<00:06:25.930> quart

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
this container is I think it's a quart
