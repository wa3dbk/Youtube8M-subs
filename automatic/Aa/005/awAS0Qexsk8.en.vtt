00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
time just in case watch closely

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:24.249 
time just in case watch closely
spiral<00:04:16.609> spiral<00:04:19.489> spiral<00:04:20.660> pull<00:04:21.660> down<00:04:23.210> spiral

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
spiral spiral spiral pull down spiral

00:04:24.259 --> 00:05:15.719 
spiral spiral spiral pull down spiral
pull<00:04:25.259> down<00:04:26.930> pretty<00:04:27.930> easy

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.059 

after<00:05:16.729> blow-drying<00:05:17.240> my<00:05:17.389> hair<00:05:17.479> and<00:05:18.069> separating
