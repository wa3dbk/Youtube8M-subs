on<00:00:43.020> top<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.590> issue<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.340> women<00:00:44.850> in

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
on top of this issue I think women in

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.060 
on top of this issue I think women in
their<00:00:45.180> 20s<00:00:45.539> 30s<00:00:45.930> 40s<00:00:45.989> think<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.860> heart

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
their 20s 30s 40s think that heart

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.950 
their 20s 30s 40s think that heart
disease<00:00:47.100> has<00:00:47.550> nothing<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.510> them<00:00:48.660> that

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
disease has nothing to do with them that

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.229 
disease has nothing to do with them that
in<00:00:49.050> fact<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.649> happens<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> older<00:00:50.700> people<00:00:50.730> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
in fact it happens to older people and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.630 
in fact it happens to older people and
that's<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> way<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.530> happens<00:00:52.980> but

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
that's the way it is it just happens but

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520 
that's the way it is it just happens but
what<00:00:53.820> really<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.629> truth<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
what really is the truth is that it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.830 
what really is the truth is that it
takes<00:00:55.710> decades<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:57.120> heart<00:00:57.329> disease<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
takes decades for heart disease to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.049 
takes decades for heart disease to
develop<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.890> when<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.190> have<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.550> social

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
develop so when you have that social

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.209 
develop so when you have that social
smoking<00:01:00.449> thing<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.170> goes<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.590> your<00:01:01.710> 20s

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
smoking thing that goes on in your 20s

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.759 
smoking thing that goes on in your 20s
you're<00:01:03.000> setting<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> stage<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.379> develop

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
you're setting the stage to develop

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.740 
you're setting the stage to develop
heart<00:01:04.890> disease<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.430> future<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.060> takes

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
heart disease in the future it takes

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.859 
heart disease in the future it takes
longer<00:01:07.170> than<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.350> day<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.860> takes<00:01:08.310> years<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.840> I

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
longer than a day it takes years so I

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.600 
longer than a day it takes years so I
think<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.320> very<00:01:10.380> important<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.310> women

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
think it's very important that women

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.030 
think it's very important that women
understand<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:13.049> their<00:01:13.320> risk<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:13.710> heart

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
understand that their risk for heart

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.649 
understand that their risk for heart
disease<00:01:14.159> develops<00:01:14.909> when<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.210> fact<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.630> are

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
disease develops when in fact we are

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.050 
disease develops when in fact we are
younger<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.830> need<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.189> pay<00:01:17.340> attention<00:01:17.369> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
younger and we need to pay attention to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.899 
younger and we need to pay attention to
this<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.900> mean<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.320> you're<00:01:19.740> eating<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.460> lot<00:01:20.759> of

American will develop plaque in their

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
blockages in the arteries and most of us

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.490 
blockages in the arteries and most of us
develop<00:02:32.340> these<00:02:32.519> things<00:02:32.849> as<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:33.480> age<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:34.349> it's

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
develop these things as we age but it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.699 
develop these things as we age but it's
not<00:02:34.590> necessary<00:02:35.599> what<00:02:36.599> kinds<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.049> exams<00:02:37.500> or

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
not necessary what kinds of exams or

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.130 
not necessary what kinds of exams or
tests<00:02:38.250> should<00:02:38.610> we<00:02:38.700> be<00:02:38.849> getting<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:39.420> before

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140

the<00:02:40.260> age<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.739> think<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:41.160> should<00:02:41.400> well<00:02:42.360> starting

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
the age we think we should well starting

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.479 
the age we think we should well starting
at<00:02:42.930> 20<00:02:43.260> years<00:02:43.410> old<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.980> think<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.340> very

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
at 20 years old I think it's very

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.250 
at 20 years old I think it's very
important<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.239> know<00:02:45.540> what<00:02:45.660> your<00:02:45.840> cholesterol

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
important to know what your cholesterol

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.589 
important to know what your cholesterol
is<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.610> very<00:02:47.790> important<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.269> get<00:02:48.480> it

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
is and it's very important to get it

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.259 
is and it's very important to get it
checked<00:02:48.840> maybe<00:02:49.470> not<00:02:49.650> yearly<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:50.880> certainly

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
checked maybe not yearly but certainly

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.630 
checked maybe not yearly but certainly
at<00:02:51.540> 20<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:52.349> five<00:02:52.620> years<00:02:52.650> later<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.430> then

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
at 20 and then five years later and then

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.819 
at 20 and then five years later and then
as<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:53.940> get<00:02:54.180> towards<00:02:54.510> 30<00:02:54.840> really<00:02:55.290> consider

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
as we get towards 30 really consider

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.309 
as we get towards 30 really consider
getting<00:02:56.099> it<00:02:56.280> checked<00:02:56.459> every<00:02:56.790> year<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:58.079> in

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
getting it checked every year but if in

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.500 
getting it checked every year but if in
