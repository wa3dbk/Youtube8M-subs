00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.180 
going to take its crease as well but
because<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.679> thicker<00:01:52.890> you'll

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
because it is a little thicker you'll

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.440 
because it is a little thicker you'll
need<00:01:53.429> to<00:01:53.580> kind<00:01:53.819> of<00:01:53.880> make<00:01:54.030> sure<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.300> make

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
need to kind of make sure you make

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.820 
need to kind of make sure you make
really<00:01:54.720> good<00:01:54.840> creases<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.410> you're<00:01:55.530> making

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
really good creases if you're making

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.150 
really good creases if you're making
something<00:01:56.069> really<00:01:56.459> exact<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.920> would<00:01:58.920> say<00:01:59.099> you

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
something really exact I would say you

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.510 
something really exact I would say you
know<00:01:59.399> it'd<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.880> a<00:02:00.500> challenge<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.590> fold<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
know it'd be a challenge to fold and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.430 
know it'd be a challenge to fold and
make<00:02:02.670> something<00:02:02.940> really<00:02:03.119> complex<00:02:03.899> with<00:02:04.259> this

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
make something really complex with this

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.199 
make something really complex with this
maybe<00:02:04.709> if<00:02:04.950> you're<00:02:05.099> not<00:02:05.220> really<00:02:05.429> used<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.940> doing

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
maybe if you're not really used to doing

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.410 
maybe if you're not really used to doing
origami<00:02:06.660> but<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:08.340> paper<00:02:08.670> design<00:02:09.060> was<00:02:09.239> just

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
origami but this paper design was just

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.330 
origami but this paper design was just
so<00:02:09.539> pretty<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.989> kind<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.380> unique<00:02:10.770> it's<00:02:11.099> got

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
so pretty and kind of unique it's got

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.720 
so pretty and kind of unique it's got
this<00:02:11.520> nice<00:02:11.760> watercolor<00:02:12.630> feel<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.730> a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
this nice watercolor feel to it and a

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.030 
this nice watercolor feel to it and a
very<00:02:14.970> artistic<00:02:15.840> kind<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.290> paper<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.920> I'll

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
very artistic kind of paper so I'll

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.589 
very artistic kind of paper so I'll
finish<00:02:17.190> up<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.550> box<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.940> show<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.209> guys<00:02:18.300> when

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
finish up the box and show you guys when

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.290 
finish up the box and show you guys when
it's<00:02:18.750> done<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.610> yeah<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.640> think<00:02:20.760> because<00:02:21.060> of

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
it's done here yeah I think because of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.330 
it's done here yeah I think because of
the<00:02:21.390> way<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.599> do<00:02:21.959> get<00:02:22.170> kind<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.530> more<00:02:22.800> rounded

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
the way you do get kind of more rounded

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.520 
the way you do get kind of more rounded
edges<00:02:23.819> then<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.360> really<00:02:24.540> crisp<00:02:24.900> ones<00:02:25.200> but

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
edges then you do really crisp ones but

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.500 
edges then you do really crisp ones but
it's<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.799> really<00:02:26.010> pretty<00:02:26.400> really<00:02:26.730> subtle<00:02:27.329> kind

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it's a really pretty really subtle kind

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.160 
it's a really pretty really subtle kind
of<00:02:27.629> pattern

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
of pattern

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.559 
of pattern
it's<00:02:28.590> early<00:02:29.069> i<00:02:29.099> know<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.730> not<00:02:29.910> spring<00:02:30.270> time

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
it's early i know it's not spring time

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:31.910 
it's early i know it's not spring time
but<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:31.020> made<00:02:31.200> me<00:02:31.319> think<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.650> spring

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
but this just made me think of spring

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.130 
but this just made me think of spring
already<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.790> maybe<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:33.750> because<00:02:33.840> we're

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
already so maybe it's because we're

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.839 
already so maybe it's because we're
still<00:02:34.470> not<00:02:34.590> really<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:35.010> cold<00:02:35.280> yet<00:02:35.459> here

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
still not really that cold yet here

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.970 
still not really that cold yet here
where<00:02:36.480> i<00:02:36.510> live<00:02:36.870> i<00:02:37.050> wish<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.380> would<00:02:37.470> get<00:02:37.620> colder

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
where i live i wish it would get colder

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.400 
where i live i wish it would get colder
um<00:02:38.489> i<00:02:38.730> want<00:02:38.910> some<00:02:39.060> snow<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:40.080> not<00:02:40.170> getting

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
um i want some snow but just not getting

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.070 
um i want some snow but just not getting
it<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.819> but<00:02:41.819> yeah<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.540> definitely<00:02:42.690> a

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
it so but yeah this is definitely a

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.170 
it so but yeah this is definitely a
pretty<00:02:43.500> kind<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.010> variation<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.790> paper<00:02:45.030> i

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
pretty kind of variation of paper i

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.090 
pretty kind of variation of paper i
think<00:02:45.480> sometimes<00:02:46.050> if<00:02:46.440> you're<00:02:46.620> coming<00:02:46.890> to

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
think sometimes if you're coming to

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.890 
think sometimes if you're coming to
japan<00:02:47.459> your<00:02:47.670> kind<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:47.970> set<00:02:48.209> on<00:02:48.390> getting<00:02:48.569> things

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
japan your kind of set on getting things

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.690 
japan your kind of set on getting things
that<00:02:49.110> look<00:02:49.230> really<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.739> japanese<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.640> you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
that look really like japanese and you

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.940 
that look really like japanese and you
might<00:02:50.910> kind<00:02:51.569> of<00:02:51.690> shy<00:02:52.140> away<00:02:52.319> from<00:02:52.440> something

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
might kind of shy away from something

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.920 
might kind of shy away from something
like<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.550> has<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> more<00:02:54.239> modern<00:02:54.569> style

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
like this that has a more modern style

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.410 
like this that has a more modern style
to<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.200> but<00:02:55.590> very<00:02:56.160> very<00:02:56.430> beautiful<00:02:56.610> paper<00:02:57.060> and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420
