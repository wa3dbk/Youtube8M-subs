00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
for the vast majority I follow somewhat

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.910 
for the vast majority I follow somewhat
of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.039> same<00:00:53.280> pattern<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.800> three<00:00:55.800> or

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
of the same pattern I have like three or

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.459 
of the same pattern I have like three or
four<00:00:55.949> actual<00:00:56.640> cycles<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.449> within<00:00:58.109> those

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
four actual cycles and within those

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.369 
four actual cycles and within those
cycles<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.430> three<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.210> four<00:01:00.449> exercises

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
cycles I have three to four exercises

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.359 
cycles I have three to four exercises
now<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:03.539> from<00:01:03.750> one<00:01:03.960> exercise<00:01:04.159> directly<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
now I go from one exercise directly to

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.210 
now I go from one exercise directly to
the<00:01:05.489> next<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.930> avoid<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.500> much<00:01:07.680> rest<00:01:07.979> time

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the next and I avoid as much rest time

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.850 
the next and I avoid as much rest time
as<00:01:08.369> possible<00:01:08.939> ideally<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.200> want<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.619> no

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
rest time go straight from one exercise

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.219 
rest time go straight from one exercise
into<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> next<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> next<00:01:14.760> one<00:01:14.970> and

exercises that I do in a particular ab
workout<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.590> varies<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.340> mean<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> try<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
workout really varies I mean I try to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.270 
workout really varies I mean I try to
mix<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.570> exercises<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.320> much<00:01:28.530> as<00:01:28.680> possible

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
mix up the exercises as much as possible

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.270 
mix up the exercises as much as possible
but<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.270> only<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> will<00:01:31.079> also<00:01:31.320> mess

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
but not only that I will also mess

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.090 
but not only that I will also mess
around<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.850> weight<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> use<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:35.070> as

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
around with weight that I use as well as

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.020 
around with weight that I use as well as
the<00:01:35.340> number<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.090> repetitions<00:01:37.579> now<00:01:38.579> what<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the number of repetitions now what you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.730 
the number of repetitions now what you
guys<00:01:39.180> will<00:01:39.390> see<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> did<00:01:40.380> four

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
guys will see is that I did four

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.999 
guys will see is that I did four
exercises<00:01:41.280> total<00:01:42.119> within<00:01:43.020> each<00:01:43.290> cycle<00:01:43.829> in

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
exercises total within each cycle in

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.120 
exercises total within each cycle in
this<00:01:44.399> particular<00:01:44.820> workout<00:01:45.270> um<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.890> did<00:01:47.100> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
this particular workout um and I did a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.539 
this particular workout um and I did a
total<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.670> four<00:01:48.000> cycles<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.920> four<00:01:49.920> cycles<00:01:50.430> of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
total of four cycles so four cycles of

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.319 
total of four cycles so four cycles of
four<00:01:50.759> exercises<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:52.340> with<00:01:53.340> probably<00:01:54.119> like

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
four exercises and with probably like

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.480 
four exercises and with probably like
two<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> three<00:01:54.810> minutes<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.619> between<00:01:56.189> each

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
two to three minutes in between each

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.539 
two to three minutes in between each
cycle<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.299> don't<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.950> allow<00:01:59.189> too

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
cycle I don't really like to allow too

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.359 
cycle I don't really like to allow too
much<00:01:59.790> rest<00:02:00.060> time<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.570> between<00:02:01.070> each<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.250> those

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
much rest time in between each of those

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.010 
much rest time in between each of those
cycles<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.210> don't<00:02:03.479> know<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.960> really

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
cycles but I don't know it really

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.990 
cycles but I don't know it really
depends<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.710> how<00:02:05.100> hard<00:02:05.340> I'm<00:02:05.490> pushing<00:02:05.850> myself

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
depends on how hard I'm pushing myself

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.389 
depends on how hard I'm pushing myself
the<00:02:06.990> intensity<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.710> number<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.009> reps<00:02:08.250> that

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the intensity the number of reps that

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.979 
the intensity the number of reps that
I'm<00:02:08.489> performing<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.090> stuff<00:02:09.300> like<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.660> so

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
I'm performing and stuff like that so

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.470 
I'm performing and stuff like that so
here<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.129> are<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.700> through<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.180> entire

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
here we are going through the entire

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.580 
here we are going through the entire
second<00:02:13.050> cycle

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
second cycle

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.120 
second cycle
so<00:02:14.090> as<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.630> guys<00:02:15.780> saw<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.260> started<00:02:16.739> off<00:02:16.860> with

the constant tension coming in with the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.390 
the constant tension coming in with the

cable but you can also play around with
your<00:02:47.610> leg<00:02:47.790> placement<00:02:48.450> quite<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> bit<00:02:49.019> and

there's a lot of things that you can

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.020 
there's a lot of things that you can
change<00:02:51.180> up<00:02:51.480> with<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:52.190> such<00:02:53.190> as<00:02:53.220> aiming<00:02:53.850> and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
and that the actual hardest part of this

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.130 
and that the actual hardest part of this
exercise<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.400> would<00:03:02.610> say<00:03:02.970> personally<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.660> to

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
exercise I would say personally is to

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.410 
exercise I would say personally is to
keep<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.769> tension<00:03:05.010> on<00:03:05.370> your<00:03:05.580> abs<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:06.150> really

keep the tension on your abs to really

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.500 
keep the tension on your abs to really
feed<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.530> read<00:03:07.739> into<00:03:07.920> your<00:03:08.099> abs<00:03:08.640> doing<00:03:09.360> all

feed in and read into your abs doing all

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.930 
feed in and read into your abs doing all
the<00:03:09.630> work<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.049> trying<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.069> take<00:03:11.310> your<00:03:11.519> arms

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
of the movement is much possible but

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.860 
of the movement is much possible but
from<00:03:16.349> there<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.530> went<00:03:16.890> into<00:03:17.600> another<00:03:18.600> a

doing a knee raise you can do either um
I<00:03:25.799> really<00:03:26.400> try<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.820> go<00:03:27.030> for<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:28.260> burn<00:03:28.620> in<00:03:28.950> my

I really try to go for the burn in my
lower<00:03:29.430> abdominal<00:03:30.269> region<00:03:30.390> because<00:03:31.079> that's

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
I finished off with an oblique crunch

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.050 
I finished off with an oblique crunch
now<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.079> do<00:03:46.440> not<00:03:46.620> have<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:47.130> use<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> 25<00:03:47.850> pound

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
now you do not have to use a 25 pound

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.110 
now you do not have to use a 25 pound
plate<00:03:48.329> of<00:03:48.569> course<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.470> have<00:03:50.370> no<00:03:50.519> problem<00:03:50.970> with

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
plate of course I have no problem with

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.430 
plate of course I have no problem with
maybe<00:03:51.389> adding<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.840> little<00:03:51.959> bit<00:03:52.079> more<00:03:52.170> thickness

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
maybe adding a little bit more thickness

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.590 
maybe adding a little bit more thickness
to<00:03:52.799> my<00:03:52.950> my<00:03:53.310> midsection<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.299> is<00:03:54.420> why<00:03:54.569> I

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600
