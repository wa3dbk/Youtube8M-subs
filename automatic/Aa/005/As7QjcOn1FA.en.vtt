00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.990
 the origins of the city dessau-roßlau go back to the Middle Ages 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.799
 the many small settlements on both sides of Abba and Mulde boxes over 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.989
 the centuries did not make a city together 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.460
 their damage still noticeable today 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.170
 destroyed the team leopard-trek Fürth Hayek he created a residence instead 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.319
 surrounded by small villages 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.319
 and a completely cultivated landscaping 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.489
 a second bloom was better in the twentieth century 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.399
 as courageous Junkers gardens and lives with the Bauhaus innovative Engineers couple 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.130
 which made the city world famous 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.430
 At that time, the city's body was downright inflated 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.420
 with the political change 19 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.940
 The vacancy level in the 81 Kandern and so the pictures today show another 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.670
 Dessau 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.690
 the industry lost importance 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.040
 The people went away. Nobody needs them 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.930
 city-known shrink 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.960
 but what does a city look like in such a short period of only 20 years? 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.280
 Almost a quarter of their population loses 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.670
 fewer people need less housing fewer schools 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.790
 less infrastructure 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.500
 but what to do with the excess build 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 Robert erased and torn off 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.170
 In 1999, the city begins to define the shrinking process the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.200
 As one third of the land becomes vacant, it is intended to run through the city 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.310
 the city center if you disconnect from the industrial areas 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.320
 in a city development concept of the city office Hunger 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.150
 First thoughts are defined for a planar demolition 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.160
 the origins of the city are used 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.000
 to strengthen the land of urban renewal Kerner and land has the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.650
 To bring landscape to the city 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.110
 was born 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.530
 Housing Administration and politics agree for the first time on 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.330
 a demolition consensus 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.750
 but how the surfaces shape 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.899
 for the first time with the national competition 2002 and 2003 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.840
 The Bauhaus Foundation is involved in the discussion 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.159
 and the city additionally commissioned a pilot study 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.049
 the central questions are 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.679
 what potential is in their minds 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:23.619
 what strengths do you have and how can you incorporate them in urban planning? 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.270
 the city's body is being investigated 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.719
 instead islands form out 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.699
 At the same time, one examines the areas becoming free 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:33.579
 how can you shape the teaching? 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.899
 they are declared Green Zones 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:40.059
 which grows together with everyone who continues to grow into a landscape train 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.480
 The surfaces are experimental fields for a new urban aesthetic 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:45.789
 landscape 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:49.659
 But the planners reach their limits because many areas are in 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:50.999
 private property 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.999
 and also the owners have their values 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:58.589
 the development of a city is not controllable from the drawing board 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.940
 because the processes seem to be in a dead end 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.020
 the strategy is changed from the failure to learn another 5 4 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.020
 The city better and the Foundation Bauhaus the planning workshop 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.080
 the basis is a temporal and spatial urban development concept 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.470
 all actors involved in the urban redevelopment 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.410
 should participate in the discussion and with rain also wants to be flexible 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.679
 operate with time and space 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:31.089
 that land management is intended to convey and with the fall in value of land and 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:33.409
 Communicate ground 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:39.359
 new methods are being tested the same is being divided into building blocks and 14 that 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.340
 Principle is 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.319
 kleinteilig and then show represented 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.120
 every single building block is analyzed exactly that happens here 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.939
 and what should happen here in the future 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.579
 on the one hand, the urban cores I stand the payer and 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.099
 become more attractive 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.159
 On the other hand, on the open spaces, a special form of 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.809
 Landscape arise 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:04.009
 Model is the garden kingdom dessau-wörlitz 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.269
 the garden kingdom also grow into the city 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.459
 read on in between individual points of view like the oak groups or 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.560
 Old-time relics such as the Polcher Gates yield a new kind of 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.879
 Landscape that simultaneously tells the story 

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.249
 the idea finds great approval 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:24.499
 but how do you let the citizens shape the new landscape? 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:25.809
 participate 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:27.129
 but now 

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.449
 is the answer 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.350
 19 times 400 square meters of space have been reported so far 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.449
 which belong to the citizens alone 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.599
 the citizens become godparents and shape their 400 square meter TV 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.370
 Even these so-called claims are highly sought after by the pharmacist 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.770
 towards 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.669
 in the multicultural center 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.629
 Also for larger areas there are sponsors such as the mountain bike 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.960
 good money club or the University of Anhalt 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.910
 The demos conveyed and coordinated become a task for the 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.849
 Contact point city tag 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:00.919
 Here all threads go together 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.919
 first green areas are spread over the entire city 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.600
 It will become clear that at some point they will make such a big team move 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.360
 grown 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.330
 a communicable the concept has to come from 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.039
 the answer is red thread the red thread linked connects and hurt 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.119
 new and existing elements of the starting sequence landscape 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.389
 like a band he meanders through the new press Russia 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.130
 In this way, the citizens experience the process of change very closely and 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:30.219
 immediate 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.469
 so-called visual aids in wien-penzing or banners support this 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:35.409
 recall 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.069
 the new garden kingdom in the midst of the city as a brand later than 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.969
 Program negotiable 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.030
 the change of strategy shows a positive effect 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.920
 no longer the negative colored take the way break down or tear off 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.889
 mediates but add and win 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.369
 Shrinking is understood as an opportunity for a new quality 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:01.760
 so far as to strengthen the landscape with the approach to the urban core 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.860
 Remember the spatial typology of 1 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.850
 structurally designed the island and cultivated landscape between Mulde 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.999
 and 11 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:14.819
 For the urban Kerner the planners formulate three principles 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:17.719
 The existing potential should be strengthened 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:22.539
 each core should be considered individually and according to its merits and 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.090
 the third principle is 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.520
 all cores relate to each other 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.530
 together they are a system 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.169
 the anchor is the city center 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:32.919
 the cores are not just spaces 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:36.319
 they are made by the lives of people and their ideas and interests 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.529
 designed and animated 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:41.389
 So it's important to look at people 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.259
 to strengthen 

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:43.999
 and to network 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:48.099
 the picture that arises now no longer is a traditional compact 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:48.759
 instead of 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.979
 No it is a small circle of Famila landscape and urban nuclei 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:58.249
 while you've been focusing on expansion and growth so far this is here and now 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:03.199
 and also the future of a new culture of shrinkage 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:06.789
 it is important that it gets smaller and loses the negative connotation 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:09.379
 Instead, potentials become clear 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.939
 The new urban redevelopment construction should above all have a better quality of life 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:14.349
 bring 

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:18.270
 At the same time, it is feared that the idea of ​​modernity will continue 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.390
 The planning workshop was launched in 2004, and a lot has happened since then 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:25.369
 not completed after the short term 

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:27.139
 we are to be solved
