it together really really quickly but we

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.589 
it together really really quickly but we
are<00:00:30.080> going<00:00:30.259> to<00:00:30.589> start<00:00:30.949> with<00:00:31.339> a<00:00:31.609> skillet<00:00:32.060> set

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
are going to start with a skillet set

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.450 
are going to start with a skillet set

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
pretty high because we're trying to do

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.440 
pretty high because we're trying to do
this<00:00:36.320> really<00:00:36.740> really<00:00:36.980> quickly<00:00:37.250> I<00:00:37.610> like<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.329> use

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
this really really quickly I like to use

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.090 
this really really quickly I like to use
a<00:00:38.480> skillet<00:00:38.900> instead<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.410> a<00:00:39.500> stockpot<00:00:40.070> because

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
a skillet instead of a stockpot because

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.060 
a skillet instead of a stockpot because
it<00:00:40.610> gets<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:40.970> vegetables<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:42.080> protein

to<00:00:43.340> cook<00:00:43.610> a<00:00:43.790> lot<00:00:43.940> faster<00:00:43.970> because<00:00:44.840> it's<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.140> bit

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
to cook a lot faster because it's a bit

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.860 
to cook a lot faster because it's a bit
of<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.560> wider<00:00:45.830> surface<00:00:46.310> I<00:00:46.760> just<00:00:47.510> put<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.720> little

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
you can use a little bit of olive oil if

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.800 
you can use a little bit of olive oil if

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
that's fine we're going to stir it in

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.490 
that's fine we're going to stir it in
the<00:02:45.000> broth<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.900> vegetables<00:02:46.379> are

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500

the broth and the vegetables are
starting<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.609> slightly<00:02:48.090> soften<00:02:48.750> which<00:02:48.870> is

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
starting to slightly soften which is

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.530 
starting to slightly soften which is
perfect<00:02:49.439> so<00:02:49.769> what<00:02:50.459> we're<00:02:50.609> going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.879> do<00:02:51.209> here

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
perfect so what we're going to do here

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.869 
perfect so what we're going to do here
is<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.439> just<00:02:52.709> like<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.099> eyeball<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.400> honestly

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
is I just like to eyeball it honestly

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.490 
is I just like to eyeball it honestly
but<00:02:54.000> about<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> cup<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.959> half<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.379> can

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
but about a cup and a half you can

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.610 
but about a cup and a half you can
measure<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.919> out<00:02:56.010> if<00:02:56.700> you'd<00:02:56.879> like<00:02:57.620> you're

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
measure it out if you'd like you're

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.440 
measure it out if you'd like you're
those<00:02:58.799> big<00:02:59.069> old<00:02:59.220> yellow<00:02:59.609> gloves<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.299> there

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
those big old yellow gloves in there

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.000 
those big old yellow gloves in there
this<00:03:00.930> has<00:03:01.109> been<00:03:01.260> sitting<00:03:01.590> at<00:03:01.799> room

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
this has been sitting at room

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.319 
this has been sitting at room
temperature<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:02.669> a<00:03:02.700> little<00:03:02.909> bit<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.180> it's

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
temperature for a little bit so it's

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.569 
temperature for a little bit so it's
already<00:03:03.750> starting<00:03:04.139> to<00:03:04.220> liquefy<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.370> little

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
already starting to liquefy it a little

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.220 
already starting to liquefy it a little
bit<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:05.909> you<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.000> see<00:03:06.180> as<00:03:06.450> soon<00:03:06.659> as<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.930> hits

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
bit but you can see as soon as that hits

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.129 
bit but you can see as soon as that hits
that<00:03:07.530> pin<00:03:07.889> it<00:03:08.849> goes<00:03:09.120> right<00:03:09.329> back<00:03:09.450> into<00:03:09.689> liquid

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
that pin it goes right back into liquid

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.470 
that pin it goes right back into liquid
so<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.680> gelatin<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.459> actually<00:03:12.030> what's<00:03:12.239> really

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
so the gelatin is actually what's really

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.089 
so the gelatin is actually what's really
good<00:03:12.659> for<00:03:13.019> you<00:03:13.139> so<00:03:13.349> don't<00:03:13.590> let<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.769> freak<00:03:14.069> you

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
good for you so don't let it freak you

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.770 
good for you so don't let it freak you
out<00:03:14.250> when<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.549> first<00:03:14.879> started<00:03:15.150> making<00:03:15.239> bra<00:03:15.540> I

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
out when I first started making bra I

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.360 
out when I first started making bra I
actually<00:03:16.019> used<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.439> scoop<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.859> off<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.159> top

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
actually used to scoop it off the top

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.339 
actually used to scoop it off the top
believe<00:03:17.669> it<00:03:17.760> or<00:03:17.849> not<00:03:17.939> and<00:03:18.299> waste<00:03:18.810> all<00:03:19.079> of<00:03:19.139> those

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
believe it or not and waste all of those

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.020 
believe it or not and waste all of those
nutrients<00:03:19.889> I<00:03:20.040> thought<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.639> was<00:03:20.730> part<00:03:20.970> of

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
nutrients I thought that it was part of

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.119 
nutrients I thought that it was part of
the<00:03:21.150> fat<00:03:21.359> layer<00:03:21.629> and<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.379> grossed<00:03:22.590> me<00:03:22.769> out<00:03:22.799> and

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
the fat layer and it grossed me out and

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.039 
the fat layer and it grossed me out and
I<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.400> would<00:03:23.549> throw<00:03:23.729> it<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:23.909> the<00:03:23.970> trash<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.599> I

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
I just would throw it in the trash and I

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.420 
I just would throw it in the trash and I
didn't<00:03:25.229> know<00:03:25.319> what<00:03:25.409> I<00:03:25.470> was<00:03:25.590> doing<00:03:25.859> apparently

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
didn't know what I was doing apparently

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.300 
didn't know what I was doing apparently
I<00:03:26.900> got<00:03:27.900> a<00:03:27.959> little<00:03:28.169> bit<00:03:28.379> lazy<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.769> my<00:03:29.069> chicken

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
I got a little bit lazy in my chicken

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.309 
I got a little bit lazy in my chicken
dicing<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:30.060> made<00:03:30.540> these<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.780> little<00:03:31.199> bit
