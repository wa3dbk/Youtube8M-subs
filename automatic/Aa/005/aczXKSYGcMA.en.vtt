anything like that
there<00:01:01.089> are<00:01:01.269> definitely<00:01:01.780> we<00:01:02.079> think<00:01:02.679> of<00:01:02.859> it<00:01:03.010> as

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
there are definitely we think of it as

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.030 
there are definitely we think of it as
the<00:01:04.210> first<00:01:04.449> project<00:01:05.019> management<00:01:05.470> system<00:01:05.800> but

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
the first project management system but

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.469 
the first project management system but
for<00:01:06.280> consumers<00:01:06.909> only<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:08.320> really<00:01:08.620> credit<00:01:09.010> or

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
for consumers only we really credit or

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.730 
for consumers only we really credit or
vision<00:01:10.479> was<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:10.720> we<00:01:11.080> have<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.260> creative

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
vision was that we have a creative

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.730 
vision was that we have a creative
environment<00:01:12.070> for<00:01:12.700> people<00:01:13.120> and<00:01:13.510> I<00:01:14.080> think<00:01:14.320> we

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
environment for people and I think we

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.830 
environment for people and I think we
somehow<00:01:15.579> compete<00:01:16.090> with<00:01:16.240> every<00:01:16.540> existing

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
somehow compete with every existing

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.569 
somehow compete with every existing
project<00:01:17.409> management<00:01:17.799> system<00:01:18.100> in<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.250> world

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
project management system in the world

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:24.030 
project management system in the world
but<00:01:19.829> we<00:01:20.829> have<00:01:21.009> of<00:01:21.219> course<00:01:21.520> very<00:01:21.969> very<00:01:23.040> very

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
but we have of course very very very

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.260 
but we have of course very very very
unique<00:01:24.899> approaches<00:01:25.899> to<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:27.189> handle<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.880> handle

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
unique approaches to to handle to handle

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.609 
unique approaches to to handle to handle
or<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:29.140> deal<00:01:29.619> with<00:01:29.860> stuff<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:30.520> this<00:01:31.590> ok<00:01:32.590> and

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
or to deal with stuff so this ok and

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.920 
or to deal with stuff so this ok and
cross-platform<00:01:33.520> as<00:01:34.030> well<00:01:34.210> I'm<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.509> consumer<00:01:34.750> of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
cross-platform as well I'm a consumer of

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.499 
cross-platform as well I'm a consumer of
number<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.200> platforms<00:01:35.409> web<00:01:35.710> browser<00:01:36.640> first

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
number of platforms web browser first

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.539 
number of platforms web browser first
lookey<00:01:38.469> very<00:01:38.649> slick<00:01:38.860> in<00:01:38.979> their<00:01:39.070> browser<00:01:39.250> but

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
lookey very slick in their browser but

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.310 
lookey very slick in their browser but
then<00:01:39.729> what<00:01:39.969> are<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.270> platforms<00:01:40.930> you're

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
then what are the platforms you're

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.609 
then what are the platforms you're
looking<00:01:41.500> at<00:01:41.619> launch<00:01:41.829> am<00:01:42.840> launching<00:01:43.840> it<00:01:44.200> we

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
looking at launch am launching it we

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.560 
looking at launch am launching it we
will<00:01:44.770> launch<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.070> first<00:01:45.369> on<00:01:45.609> the<00:01:45.789> iPhone<00:01:46.149> okay

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
will launch it first on the iPhone okay

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.870 
will launch it first on the iPhone okay
I<00:01:46.750> put<00:01:47.049> up<00:01:47.200> as<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.439> next<00:01:47.560> and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
I put up as the next and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.560 
I put up as the next and
then<00:01:49.480> comes<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.930> course<00:01:50.140> Android<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:52.360> we've

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
then comes of course Android like we've

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.360 
then comes of course Android like we've
did<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.870> with<00:01:53.020> one<00:01:53.050> realist<00:01:53.500> it's<00:01:53.710> nearly<00:01:54.010> it

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
did it with one realist it's nearly it

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.090 
did it with one realist it's nearly it
will<00:01:54.580> be<00:01:54.750> nearly<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.900> same<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.530> same<00:01:56.680> way<00:01:56.890> the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
will be nearly the same the same way the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.150 
will be nearly the same the same way the
makeup<00:01:57.400> of<00:01:57.550> course<00:01:57.820> will<00:01:58.510> be<00:01:58.630> launched<00:01:59.110> in<00:02:00.100> the

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
makeup of course will be launched in the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.250 
makeup of course will be launched in the
first<00:02:00.460> days<00:02:00.640> Berlin

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
first days Berlin

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.560 
first days Berlin
what's<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.160> startup<00:02:03.850> scene<00:02:04.030> in<00:02:04.150> Berlin<00:02:04.420> like

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
what's the startup scene in Berlin like

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.050 
what's the startup scene in Berlin like
at<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.810> moment<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.380> think<00:02:06.100> it's<00:02:06.550> one<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:06.850> the

at the moment I think it's one of the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.969 
at the moment I think it's one of the
most<00:02:07.180> outstanding<00:02:07.780> startup<00:02:08.440> scenes<00:02:08.679> in<00:02:08.890> the

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
most outstanding startup scenes in the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.980 
most outstanding startup scenes in the
world<00:02:09.360> I'm<00:02:10.360> this<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.200> my<00:02:11.520> third<00:02:12.520> company<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.300> I

of the products why do you think that is

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.780 
of the products why do you think that is
it's<00:02:50.739> very<00:02:50.860> particular<00:02:51.160> reason<00:02:51.280> that<00:02:51.459> that

it's very particular reason that that

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.190 
it's very particular reason that that
happens<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.270> Berlin<00:02:52.630> because<00:02:52.870> it's<00:02:53.019> not

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
happens in Berlin because it's not

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.949 
happens in Berlin because it's not
something<00:02:53.350> I<00:02:53.590> see<00:02:53.620> as<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.610> rule<00:02:55.300> around<00:02:55.810> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
something I see as a rule around the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.530 
something I see as a rule around the
rest<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.260> Europe<00:02:56.590> necessarily<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.489> don't<00:02:58.450> know

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
rest of Europe necessarily I don't know

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.120 
rest of Europe necessarily I don't know
where<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.870> come<00:02:59.050> from<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.590> be<00:02:59.680> honest<00:02:59.950> but<00:03:00.070> I

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
where it come from to be honest but I

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.870 
where it come from to be honest but I
think<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.630> right<00:03:01.840> thing<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.320> do<00:03:02.880> you

think that is the right thing to do you
