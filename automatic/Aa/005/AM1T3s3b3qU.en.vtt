you<00:00:23.970> make<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.240> Rooney's<00:00:24.689> sending-off<00:00:24.840> was<00:00:25.350> it

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
you make of Rooney's sending-off was it

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.259 
you make of Rooney's sending-off was it
a<00:00:25.650> poor<00:00:26.070> refereeing<00:00:26.310> decision<00:00:26.910> or<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> poor

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
a poor refereeing decision or a poor

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.900 
a poor refereeing decision or a poor
decision<00:00:27.420> by<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> captive<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.730> think<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.789> was<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
decision by a captive I think it was a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.150 
decision by a captive I think it was a
cynical<00:00:30.330> decision<00:00:31.320> by<00:00:31.439> Rooney<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.009> think

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
cynical decision by Rooney but I think

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440 
cynical decision by Rooney but I think
he<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.399> trying<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.759> win<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> free-kick

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
he was just trying to win as a free-kick

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.630 
he was just trying to win as a free-kick
and<00:00:33.750> take<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> booking<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.649> his<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.070> his<00:00:35.100> mind

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and take a booking in his in his mind

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.610 
and take a booking in his in his mind
and<00:00:35.960> he's<00:00:36.960> obviously<00:00:37.170> thought<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and he's obviously thought it was a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.610 
and he's obviously thought it was a
kick-out<00:00:37.920> rather<00:00:38.160> than<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.430> trip<00:00:38.700> but<00:00:39.620> it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
kick-out rather than a trip but it's

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.930 
kick-out rather than a trip but it's
poor<00:00:40.800> decision<00:00:41.100> from<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> referee<00:00:41.610> do<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
poor decision from the referee do you

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.979 
poor decision from the referee do you
think<00:00:42.149> they<00:00:42.239> could<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.480> scored<00:00:42.660> from<00:00:42.840> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
think they could have scored from that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.479 
think they could have scored from that
position<00:00:43.140> therefore<00:00:43.530> Rooney<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.309> done

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
position therefore Rooney to have done

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.310 
position therefore Rooney to have done
that<00:00:44.610> or<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> risk<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.899> worth<00:00:46.079> taking

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that or was it a risk not worth taking

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.549 
that or was it a risk not worth taking
oh<00:00:46.789> it's<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.879> hard<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.809> they<00:00:49.289> would<00:00:49.440> have

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
oh it's a hard one if if they would have

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.660 
oh it's a hard one if if they would have
gone<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.920> scored<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> goal<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:50.579> have

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
gone on and scored a goal you would have

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.950 
gone on and scored a goal you would have
been<00:00:50.789> saying<00:00:51.120> your<00:00:51.329> captain<00:00:51.690> should<00:00:51.840> have

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
I think Mike was counting up is it about

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.970 
I think Mike was counting up is it about
six<00:02:13.050> players<00:02:13.230> we've<00:02:13.470> got<00:02:13.650> compare

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
six players we've got compare

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.530 
six players we've got compare
to<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.220> Mozilla<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.849> was<00:02:14.940> starting<00:02:15.300> today

to the Mozilla that was starting today

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.720 
to the Mozilla that was starting today
and<00:02:15.780> then<00:02:16.260> that's<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.040> transformation<00:02:17.640> even

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
and then that's a transformation even

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.970 
and then that's a transformation even
from<00:02:18.000> preseason<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.959> once<00:02:19.140> these<00:02:19.290> plays<00:02:19.709> gel

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
from preseason so once these plays gel

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.440 
from preseason so once these plays gel
and<00:02:20.099> bedding<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.849> going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.060> be<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> different

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and bedding it's going to be a different

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.759 
and bedding it's going to be a different
United<00:02:21.870> we've<00:02:22.019> already<00:02:22.170> seen<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.470> attacking

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
United we've already seen that attacking

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.860 
United we've already seen that attacking
going<00:02:23.220> forward<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.940> know<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.390> are<00:02:24.569> something

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
going forward you know we are something

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.960

else<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.230> league<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:26.190> once<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.580> sort

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
else in this league just once we sort

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.880 
else in this league just once we sort
things<00:02:27.150> out<00:02:27.239> in<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.450> back<00:02:27.599> I<00:02:27.870> think<00:02:28.799> that

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
things out in the back I think that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.680 
things out in the back I think that
would<00:02:28.950> be<00:02:29.010> was<00:02:29.190> definitely<00:02:30.120> top<00:02:30.269> for<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.510> end

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
would be was definitely top for the end

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.959 
would be was definitely top for the end
of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.810> season
