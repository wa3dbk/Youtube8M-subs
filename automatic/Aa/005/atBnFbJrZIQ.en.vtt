00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
it's called the vertical project and

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.900 
it's called the vertical project and
what<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.100> vertical<00:00:17.640> leap

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
what the program entails is that it

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.209 
what the program entails is that it
promises<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.020> gain<00:00:37.350> eight<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.800> 14

you harbor docks the program is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.080 
you harbor docks the program is
different<00:00:47.070> than<00:00:47.160> anything<00:00:47.520> else<00:00:47.670> out<00:00:47.850> there

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
different than anything else out there

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.279 
different than anything else out there
it's<00:00:48.210> different<00:00:48.539> than<00:00:48.660> air<00:00:48.840> alert<00:00:49.079> it's

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
than all those types of things basically

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880 
than all those types of things basically
the<00:00:53.820> whole<00:00:54.030> program<00:00:54.680> there<00:00:55.680> are<00:00:55.770> different

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the whole program there are different

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.209 
the whole program there are different
modules<00:00:56.460> what<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.180> does<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.010> focuses<00:00:59.010> more

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
modules what it does is it focuses more

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.900 
modules what it does is it focuses more
on<00:00:59.280> your<00:00:59.640> recovery<00:00:59.910> time<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:01.910> strengthening

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
on your recovery time and strengthening

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.850 
on your recovery time and strengthening
your<00:01:03.149> neurological<00:01:03.660> strength<00:01:04.290> instead<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
your neurological strength instead of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.370 
your neurological strength instead of
strengthening<00:01:05.100> your<00:01:05.460> muscles<00:01:06.260> because<00:01:07.260> it's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
strengthening your muscles because it's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.690 
strengthening your muscles because it's
not<00:01:07.500> how<00:01:07.619> big<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:07.950> muscles<00:01:08.280> are<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.580> it

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
not how big your muscles are that it

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550 
not how big your muscles are that it
turns<00:01:08.880> out<00:01:09.060> how<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.479> jump<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.900> how<00:01:10.110> how

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
turns out how you can jump it how how

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.130 
turns out how you can jump it how how
you<00:01:10.619> train<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.070> muscles<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.330> goes<00:01:12.510> about

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
you train your muscles so it goes about

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.520 
you train your muscles so it goes about
it<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.439> systematic<00:01:13.830> approach<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:15.530> yeah

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it in a systematic approach and yeah

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.740 
it in a systematic approach and yeah
there's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> jumps<00:01:17.070> over<00:01:17.280> there<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.750> basically

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
there's a jumps over there and basically

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.690 
there's a jumps over there and basically
a<00:01:19.380> lot<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.680> people<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:19.890> definitely<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.460> five

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
a lot of people are definitely like five

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.270 
a lot of people are definitely like five
town<00:01:21.000> actually<00:01:21.330> thought<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> myself<00:01:22.280> my

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
town actually thought that I myself my

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.330 
town actually thought that I myself my
brother<00:01:23.310> he's<00:01:23.909> back<00:01:24.150> foot<00:01:24.330> ten<00:01:24.740> he's<00:01:25.740> used<00:01:26.009> one

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
brother he's back foot ten he's used one

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.499 
brother he's back foot ten he's used one
of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.520> techniques<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.060> here<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.360> he's

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
of the techniques in here and he's

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.020 
of the techniques in here and he's
dunking<00:01:28.009> he's<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.159> even<00:01:29.430> done<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> program

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
dunking he's not even done the program

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.310 
dunking he's not even done the program
but<00:01:30.119> he's<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.450> use<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> techniques

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
but he's just use one of the techniques

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440 
but he's just use one of the techniques
that<00:01:31.590> comes<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> program<00:01:32.310> tell<00:01:33.150> aziz

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
that comes with the program tell aziz

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.960 
that comes with the program tell aziz
ansari<00:01:33.869> he's<00:01:34.320> trying<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.009> ban<00:01:35.189> our<00:01:35.400> stan<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
ansari he's trying to ban our stan and

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
ansari he's trying to ban our stan and
so<00:01:36.509> he's<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.780> huge<00:01:37.020> king<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.439> he<00:01:37.470> knows<00:01:37.740> what

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
so he's a huge king that he knows what

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.149 
so he's a huge king that he knows what
he's<00:01:37.950> doing<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.490> basketball<00:01:39.060> field

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
he's doing in the basketball field

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.319 
he's doing in the basketball field
and<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.399> vertical<00:01:41.020> field<00:01:42.020> specifically<00:01:43.329> but

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
and the vertical field specifically but

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.419 
and the vertical field specifically but
that's<00:01:44.990> an<00:01:45.109> right<00:01:45.229> there<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.530> brow<00:01:45.740> please

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
that's an right there the brow please

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
what you get is you get three modules

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.940 
what you get is you get three modules
training<00:01:52.399> recovery<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.560> I'm<00:01:54.560> just<00:01:54.709> like<00:01:54.770> an

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
training recovery and I'm just like an

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.650 
training recovery and I'm just like an
extra<00:01:55.249> module

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.770 

training<00:01:59.830> recovery<00:02:01.300> getting<00:02:02.300> started

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
training recovery getting started

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.630 
training recovery getting started
training<00:02:03.350> in<00:02:03.590> recovery<00:02:03.980> okay<00:02:04.190> so<00:02:04.250> I<00:02:04.400> kind<00:02:04.610> of

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
training in recovery okay so I kind of

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.000 
training in recovery okay so I kind of
the<00:02:04.730> basic<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.990> actual<00:02:06.260> program<00:02:06.620> and<00:02:06.800> on<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
the basic the actual program and on the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.370 
the basic the actual program and on the
recovery<00:02:07.310> your<00:02:07.940> recovery<00:02:08.210> time<00:02:08.539> is<00:02:09.140> really

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
recovery your recovery time is really

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.900 
recovery your recovery time is really
important<00:02:09.770> because<00:02:09.800> that<00:02:10.009> sounds<00:02:10.490> how<00:02:10.640> quick
