00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:11.859 
Amazon Kindle Fire like the just a

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.709 
Amazon Kindle Fire like the just a
standard<00:02:12.279> small<00:02:12.609> one<00:02:12.849> so<00:02:13.029> that's<00:02:13.510> something

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.719 
standard small one so that's something

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.209 
standard small one so that's something
the<00:02:13.959> Apple<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.379> probably<00:02:14.709> going<00:02:14.889> to<00:02:14.950> be<00:02:15.069> doing

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.219 
the Apple is probably going to be doing

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.830 
the Apple is probably going to be doing
that<00:02:15.549> later<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:16.029> year

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
that later this year

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.479 
that later this year
and<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.170> guess<00:02:17.410> that's<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.739> for<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.040> video<00:02:18.190> so

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:19.650 
and I guess that's it for this video so
