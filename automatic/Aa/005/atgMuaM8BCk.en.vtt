actually<00:00:32.890> shooting<00:00:33.520> in<00:00:34.480> this<00:00:34.780> video<00:00:35.140> I<00:00:35.200> do

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
actually shooting in this video I do

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.400 
actually shooting in this video I do
have<00:00:36.070> two<00:00:36.640> pounds<00:00:36.910> of<00:00:37.149> gelatin<00:00:37.660> into<00:00:38.260> two

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
have two pounds of gelatin into two

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.240 
have two pounds of gelatin into two
gallons<00:00:38.860> of<00:00:38.980> water<00:00:39.219> it<00:00:39.789> made<00:00:40.239> a<00:00:40.270> gel<00:00:40.750> block

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
gallons of water it made a gel block

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.760 
gallons of water it made a gel block
once<00:00:42.250> I<00:00:42.370> cut<00:00:42.640> it<00:00:42.789> and<00:00:43.270> shaped<00:00:43.629> it<00:00:43.870> up<00:00:44.110> about

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
once I cut it and shaped it up about

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.220 
once I cut it and shaped it up about
four<00:00:45.039> inches<00:00:45.370> by<00:00:45.640> six<00:00:46.000> inches<00:00:46.210> with<00:00:46.750> twenty

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
four inches by six inches with twenty

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.410 
four inches by six inches with twenty
inches<00:00:47.500> deep<00:00:47.800> now<00:00:48.489> you're<00:00:48.670> gonna<00:00:48.789> want<00:00:49.059> twenty

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
inches deep now you're gonna want twenty

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.240 
inches deep now you're gonna want twenty
inches<00:00:49.780> because<00:00:50.379> some<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:50.739> bullets<00:00:51.100> are

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
inches because some of the bullets are

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.939 
inches because some of the bullets are
gonna<00:00:51.340> go<00:00:51.670> quite<00:00:52.600> far<00:00:52.840> into<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.289> gelatin<00:00:53.530> I

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
gonna go quite far into the gelatin I

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.819 
gonna go quite far into the gelatin I
made<00:00:56.949> a<00:00:57.250> wooden<00:00:57.579> platform<00:00:57.879> with<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.840> wood

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
made a wooden platform with a wood

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.279 
made a wooden platform with a wood
backboard<00:01:00.519> so<00:01:01.090> that<00:01:01.300> ain't<00:01:01.480> bullets<00:01:01.899> that<00:01:02.019> did

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
backboard so that ain't bullets that did

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.020 
backboard so that ain't bullets that did
make<00:01:02.530> it<00:01:02.590> through<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:03.070> gelatin<00:01:03.550> would<00:01:03.879> be

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
make it through the gelatin would be

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.510 
make it through the gelatin would be
stopped<00:01:04.449> by<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.809> backboard<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:06.130> could<00:01:06.370> I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
stopped by the backboard and I could I

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.499 
stopped by the backboard and I could I
wouldn't<00:01:06.790> lose<00:01:07.030> them<00:01:07.300> out<00:01:07.510> into<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.020> woods

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
wouldn't lose them out into the woods

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.450 
wouldn't lose them out into the woods
when<00:01:10.509> you<00:01:10.570> trying<00:01:10.869> this<00:01:11.020> experiment<00:01:11.680> be<00:01:11.890> extra

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
when you trying this experiment be extra

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.700 
when you trying this experiment be extra
safe<00:01:12.670> after<00:01:13.570> shooting<00:01:13.840> you're<00:01:14.200> gonna<00:01:14.290> want<00:01:14.619> to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
safe after shooting you're gonna want to

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.859 
safe after shooting you're gonna want to
inspect<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.400> gel<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:16.299> you<00:01:16.390> need<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.689> make

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
inspect the gel and you need to make

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.039 
inspect the gel and you need to make
sure<00:01:16.900> that<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.680> firearm<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.430> safe<00:01:18.729> before

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
sure that the firearm is safe before

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.510 
sure that the firearm is safe before
anybody<00:01:20.049> steps<00:01:20.619> in<00:01:20.829> front<00:01:21.100> of<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:21.250> firing

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
anybody steps in front of the firing

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:57.089 
anybody steps in front of the firing
line

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:59.529 

all<00:01:58.099> right<00:01:58.250> we're<00:01:58.579> back<00:01:58.610> from<00:01:58.909> shooting<00:01:59.090> and

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
all right we're back from shooting and

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.899 
all right we're back from shooting and
some<00:01:59.810> pretty<00:01:59.989> interesting<00:02:00.439> results<00:02:00.799> all<00:02:01.310> of

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
some pretty interesting results all of

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.330 
some pretty interesting results all of
the<00:02:02.119> hollow-point<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.319> 22<00:02:03.799> rounds

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
the hollow-point and the 22 rounds

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.839 
the hollow-point and the 22 rounds
penetrated<00:02:04.969> about<00:02:05.209> 11<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.929> 14<00:02:06.170> inches<00:02:06.739> I<00:02:07.280> think

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
penetrated about 11 to 14 inches I think

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.130 
penetrated about 11 to 14 inches I think
there<00:02:07.969> was<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> little<00:02:08.329> bit<00:02:08.420> of<00:02:08.509> variation

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
there was a little bit of variation

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.050 
there was a little bit of variation
because<00:02:09.590> once<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.069> bullet<00:02:10.340> starts<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.819> tumble

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
because once the bullet starts to tumble

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.110 
because once the bullet starts to tumble
it's<00:02:11.480> kind<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.750> like<00:02:11.959> random<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.760> full<00:02:13.940> metal

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
it's kind of like random the full metal

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.420 
it's kind of like random the full metal
jackets<00:02:14.690> penetrated<00:02:15.440> all<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.890> gelatin

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
jackets penetrated all of the gelatin

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.729 
jackets penetrated all of the gelatin
they<00:02:16.640> did<00:02:16.879> hit<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.209> backboard<00:02:17.540> put<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.530> little

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
they did hit the backboard put a little

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.830 
they did hit the backboard put a little
small<00:02:19.040> dent<00:02:19.340> in<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.940> backboard<00:02:20.690> but

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
small dent in the backboard but

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.170 
small dent in the backboard but
essentially<00:02:21.530> they<00:02:21.799> got<00:02:22.040> trapped<00:02:22.489> between<00:02:22.819> the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
essentially they got trapped between the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:03:57.600 
essentially they got trapped between the
gelatin<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.049> wood

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.700 

the<00:03:58.610> cavity<00:03:59.120> left<00:03:59.810> by<00:04:00.020> the<00:04:00.080> hollow-point

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
the cavity left by the hollow-point

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.950 
the cavity left by the hollow-point
bullets<00:04:01.070> is<00:04:01.220> pretty<00:04:01.730> interesting<00:04:02.090> as<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:02.840> can

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
bullets is pretty interesting as you can

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.320 
bullets is pretty interesting as you can
see<00:04:03.140> in<00:04:03.230> this<00:04:03.380> photo<00:04:03.830> within<00:04:04.430> an<00:04:04.670> inch<00:04:04.910> of

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
see in this photo within an inch of

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.540 
see in this photo within an inch of
entering<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.990> gelatin<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:06.950> bullet<00:04:07.340> tip

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
entering the gelatin the bullet tip

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.910 
entering the gelatin the bullet tip
begins<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.390> expand<00:04:08.780> it<00:04:08.990> kind<00:04:09.260> of<00:04:09.320> creates<00:04:09.680> this

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
begins to expand it kind of creates this

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.960 
begins to expand it kind of creates this
star<00:04:10.310> shape<00:04:10.720> after<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:12.470> expansion<00:04:12.950> bowl<00:04:13.850> up

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
star shape after the expansion bowl up

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.670 
star shape after the expansion bowl up
against<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.420> tumble<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.870> little<00:04:15.110> bit<00:04:15.290> and

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
against the tumble a little bit and

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.699 
against the tumble a little bit and
cavity<00:04:16.430> begins<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.970> orbit<00:04:17.420> change<00:04:17.720> shake<00:04:18.050> but

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
cavity begins to orbit change shake but

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.620 
cavity begins to orbit change shake but
still<00:04:19.160> pretty<00:04:19.310> cool

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.350 

when<00:04:22.500> we<00:04:22.680> were<00:04:22.800> done<00:04:22.950> with<00:04:23.040> all<00:04:23.280> pistols<00:04:23.910> and
