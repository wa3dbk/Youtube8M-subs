00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
 the next exercise for triceps muscles 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:12.170
 it is clear that up to 3 from raiter means 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.700
 1 2 and 3 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.490
 there is a universal exercise which 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.960
 work through all three 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.689
 there can get a variety on 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.180
 I do a lot of exercise 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.320
 there will be one exercise and i recommend it 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.920
 press narrow grip when desire for 3 and 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.040
 here you flexion extension completely felled 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.420
 all and as those who swing and those who 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.790
 engaged in combat 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.899
 technique a little different now show 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.899
 bye for jocks 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.149
 becomes one we have two points 1 in 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.890
 general faith is here look here is the most 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.710
 the main rule is those training by force 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.370
 by and perishing not this full stretch full 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.949
 reduction 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.700
 and the matrix itself is this stretching game 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.700
 stretching 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.649
 Accordingly, the future is daily 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.399
 we throw forward and bring back 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.899
 there is a distance from this point and 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.390
 stretching this point that is this 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:23.080
 here is a part of stretched from us removes 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.430
 here 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.110
 this part is stretched to typical 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.240
 so it turns out that we 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.799
 should stretch 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.000
 in all directions in the area we are what 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.939
 look you no longer feel 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.159
 painted then not yet stretched and 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.659
 then give up lift we feel 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.440
 dinner with stretching 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.899
 there is now you have raised the news all 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.909
 I feel now pour it out if i am u so 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.679
 its something I'm not pulling anything intelligible 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.770
 the point is that in this exercise like this it is not 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:00.100
 you can flood it very big 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.780
 job issue but one for example 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.479
 do the French press full 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.119
 cuts will raise because you have to 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.830
 could bring closer here if from 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.840
 naturally there is a natural 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.730
 the movement that you apply in 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.010
 life for work 30 is difficult here it is 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.049
 further here is this job 30 water 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.450
 natural pond we take the same 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.120
 exactly moisturizing 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.590
 that's the easiest or most traumatic 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.660
 understandably stretched a little from 3 years of porn 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.420
 bring armpits straighten once 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.120
 strained as much as possible did not give a platoon 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.819
 here but they, too, will straighten 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:44.330
 you will not feel here I straighten 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:48.840
 slightly suspecting down to feel 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.530
 three years are being done to the very same age 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:59.010
 seconds 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:03:05.280
 they held 23 not 123 123 123 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:08.519
 it is a sport 1 2 3 and he you do that is 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.540
 3 approaches of 10 are made the same way. 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.549
 repetitions before failure here on failure for 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.160
 the limits 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.230
 everyone can not really finish principle 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.420
 how to trade this is not such a huge muscle 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.549
 what will you be 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.939
 static kimi to dive though principle 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.389
 You can fake this to failure 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:41.079
 could nâ€™t do more 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:44.560
 immediately go jumped until the force. 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:47.139
 no, it won't end and until you fall 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.049
 that is, now become become obsess 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.030
 protection of the very weight if stitches a verdict of 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.159
 night it asked mom before 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.680
 strain your hands faster 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.400
 we learn your fast that is why 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.689
 after finished off 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:08.379
 on a bar even finish everything static 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:10.569
 shutdown is you stepping over 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.560
 turn on my measure and reset 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.560
 inclusions
