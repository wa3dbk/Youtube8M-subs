00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
the only reason I say x-men is because

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.450 
the only reason I say x-men is because
there's<00:00:54.260> a<00:00:54.320> classic<00:00:54.770> move<00:00:54.950> from<00:00:55.100> that<00:00:55.250> series

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460

around and ends up throwing him at an

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.319 
around and ends up throwing him at an
enemy<00:01:00.380> and<00:01:00.590> he<00:01:00.890> ends<00:01:01.190> up<00:01:01.250> using<00:01:01.309> his<00:01:01.820> bladed

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
claws to take them out and that's

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.490 
claws to take them out and that's
exactly<00:01:04.339> what<00:01:04.820> Zorro<00:01:05.089> does<00:01:05.449> in<00:01:05.780> this<00:01:06.259> week's

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
chapter however I really love the way he

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.300 
chapter however I really love the way he
was<00:01:09.080> able<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.440> defeat<00:01:09.590> him<00:01:09.860> because<00:01:10.159> he

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
was able to defeat him because he

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.460 
was able to defeat him because he
actually<00:01:10.460> learned<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:11.510> can<00:01:11.659> actually<00:01:11.810> single

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
actually learned you can actually single

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.070 
actually learned you can actually single
out<00:01:12.620> the<00:01:12.890> alive<00:01:13.400> portions<00:01:14.120> of<00:01:14.270> pika<00:01:14.780> stone

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.800 
out the alive portions of pika stone
body<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:15.799> if<00:01:16.010> you<00:01:16.370> cut<00:01:16.640> them<00:01:16.760> in<00:01:16.850> half<00:01:16.880> one<00:01:17.780> half

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
body so if you cut them in half one half

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.450 
body so if you cut them in half one half
of<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.290> body<00:01:18.470> is<00:01:18.680> going<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:18.950> be<00:01:19.040> completely

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
of the body is going to be completely

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.800 
of the body is going to be completely
dead<00:01:19.760> and<00:01:19.970> will<00:01:20.060> no<00:01:20.180> longer<00:01:20.210> be<00:01:20.600> able<00:01:20.659> to

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
dead and will no longer be able to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.719 
dead and will no longer be able to
communicate<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.440> just<00:01:21.590> crumble<00:01:21.979> whereas<00:01:22.549> his

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
communicate and just crumble whereas his

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.060 
communicate and just crumble whereas his
consciousness<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:23.600> self<00:01:23.900> will<00:01:24.409> exist<00:01:24.890> in

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
consciousness and self will exist in

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.219 
consciousness and self will exist in
another<00:01:25.190> big<00:01:25.670> chunk<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.600> only<00:01:26.810> way<00:01:27.049> he

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
another big chunk so the only way he

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.570 
another big chunk so the only way he
decides<00:01:27.590> he's<00:01:27.770> going<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.040> be<00:01:28.100> able<00:01:28.190> to<00:01:28.310> single

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
decides he's going to be able to single

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.789 
decides he's going to be able to single
him<00:01:28.640> out<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:29.119> if<00:01:29.479> he<00:01:29.570> completely<00:01:30.110> cuts<00:01:30.560> him<00:01:30.710> in

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
him out is if he completely cuts him in

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.130 
him out is if he completely cuts him in
half<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.340> if<00:01:31.670> his<00:01:31.880> consciousness<00:01:32.600> goes<00:01:32.900> up<00:01:33.080> to

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
half and if his consciousness goes up to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.200 
half and if his consciousness goes up to
the<00:01:33.229> top<00:01:33.409> half<00:01:33.680> he'll<00:01:34.159> just<00:01:34.400> start<00:01:34.640> cutting<00:01:34.939> up

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
the top half he'll just start cutting up

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.270 
the top half he'll just start cutting up
everything<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:35.990> that's<00:01:36.350> exactly<00:01:36.619> what<00:01:37.189> he

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
Luffy I think Zorro has probably the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.880 
Luffy I think Zorro has probably the
best<00:03:09.430> action<00:03:09.730> scenes<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.959> entire<00:03:11.410> series

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
best action scenes of the entire series

is the one character of the series I

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.110 
is the one character of the series I
feel<00:03:17.470> could<00:03:17.890> have<00:03:18.040> his<00:03:18.220> own<00:03:18.370> spin-off<00:03:18.700> like

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
feel could have his own spin-off like

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.610 
feel could have his own spin-off like
he's<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.450> one<00:03:19.660> member<00:03:19.989> of<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.200> straw<00:03:20.410> hat

I think he can carry himself that much
mostly<00:03:26.560> for<00:03:26.890> his<00:03:27.070> coolness<00:03:27.370> factor<00:03:27.579> but<00:03:28.570> still

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
mostly for his coolness factor but still

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.080 
mostly for his coolness factor but still
it<00:03:29.350> was<00:03:29.650> really<00:03:29.950> demonstrated<00:03:30.610> in<00:03:30.730> this<00:03:30.880> one

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
it was really demonstrated in this one

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.660 
it was really demonstrated in this one
the<00:03:31.540> battle<00:03:31.810> between<00:03:31.930> him<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.440> pica<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:32.920> not

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
the battle between him and pica is not

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.430 
the battle between him and pica is not
exactly<00:03:34.150> what<00:03:34.360> i<00:03:34.390> was<00:03:34.540> expecting<00:03:34.959> i<00:03:35.230> thought

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
exactly what i was expecting i thought

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.630 
exactly what i was expecting i thought
there<00:03:35.590> might<00:03:35.799> be<00:03:35.829> a<00:03:36.010> little<00:03:36.489> more

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
there might be a little more

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.610 
there might be a little more
hand-to-hand<00:03:37.239> combat<00:03:37.690> although<00:03:38.079> with<00:03:38.590> a

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
hand-to-hand combat although with a

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.979 
hand-to-hand combat although with a
character<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.190> pika<00:03:39.579> he<00:03:39.790> can't<00:03:40.120> really<00:03:40.570> do

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
character like pika he can't really do

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.330 
character like pika he can't really do
that<00:03:41.019> especially<00:03:41.380> with<00:03:41.799> his<00:03:41.980> powers

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340
