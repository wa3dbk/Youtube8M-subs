of the Year know you though is garbage I

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.359 
of the Year know you though is garbage I
think<00:01:15.390> every<00:01:15.990> goalkeeper<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> game<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
think every goalkeeper in the game is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.520 
think every goalkeeper in the game is
gabadh<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.570> think<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.869> paid<00:01:19.020> around<00:01:19.170> two

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
gabadh and I think we paid around two

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.899 
gabadh and I think we paid around two
million<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.189> card<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.610> well<00:01:20.640> which<00:01:20.880> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
million for this card as well which is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
million for this card as well which is
pretty<00:01:21.180> crazy<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.560> expect<00:01:22.920> him

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
pretty crazy and then you do expect him

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.920 
pretty crazy and then you do expect him
to<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.159> unstoppable<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:23.790> unfortunately<00:01:24.479> he's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
to be unstoppable but unfortunately he's
