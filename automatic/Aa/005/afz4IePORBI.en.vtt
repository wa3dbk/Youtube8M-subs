then<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:09.260> as<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
then we have this as you see is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.109 
then we have this as you see is
three-dimensional<00:01:11.930> it's<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.140> tall<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.130> think

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
three-dimensional it's a tall I think

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.580 
three-dimensional it's a tall I think
it's<00:01:15.270> very<00:01:15.299> similar<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it's very similar to the one in the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.490 
it's very similar to the one in the
cemetery<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.460> don't<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.570> similar

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
cemetery I don't know if it's similar

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.010 
cemetery I don't know if it's similar
from<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.490> some<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.330> stories<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.840> have

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
from what some of the stories I have

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.950 
from what some of the stories I have
heard<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:22.770> about<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.549> toll<00:01:23.960> creatures

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
in the desert acharyas but as you see
this<00:01:28.770> looks<00:01:29.189> very<00:01:29.310> real<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.030> analyzed

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
this looks very real we have analyzed

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.370 
this looks very real we have analyzed
everything<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.159> doesn't<00:01:32.780> again<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
everything and it doesn't again it is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.399 
everything and it doesn't again it is
not<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> hoax<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.939> image<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.600> could<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
not a hoax in the image it could be a

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.460 
not a hoax in the image it could be a
hoax<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.939> dummy<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
hoax in the dummy in the in the in the

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.639 
hoax in the dummy in the in the in the
creature<00:01:40.799> by<00:01:41.070> itself<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.299> what<00:01:42.479> reason

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
creature by itself but for what reason

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.620 
creature by itself but for what reason
this<00:01:43.649> should<00:01:43.950> be<00:01:43.979> expensive<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.970> make<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> drum

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this should be expensive to make a drum

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.139 
this should be expensive to make a drum
in<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.020> size<00:01:46.430> should<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.460> very<00:01:47.790> expensive

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
in this size should be very expensive

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.410 
in this size should be very expensive
and<00:01:49.130> finally<00:01:50.130> we<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.560> last<00:01:52.799> case

as we get close to it it's very clear
it's<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.489> very<00:02:43.760> small<00:02:44.030> creature<00:02:44.800> moving<00:02:45.800> very

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
it's a very small creature moving very

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:59.700 
it's a very small creature moving very
fast<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:48.290> middle<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.709> two<00:02:48.860> policemen

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.259 

ok

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:30.270 

we<00:03:04.269> come<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.689> the<00:03:04.810> best<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.469> think

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.760 

even<00:03:31.280> though<00:03:31.460> i'm<00:03:31.760> not<00:03:32.150> an<00:03:32.330> expert<00:03:32.480> in<00:03:33.110> the

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
crop circle phenomenon i think freddie

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.460 
crop circle phenomenon i think freddie
silver<00:03:36.530> here<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.070> many<00:03:37.610> others<00:03:38.090> are<00:03:38.470> better

there<00:03:47.210> are<00:03:47.360> many<00:03:47.570> many<00:03:47.990> figures<00:03:48.500> through<00:03:49.460> the

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
there are many many figures through the

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.770 
there are many many figures through the
years<00:03:50.120> from<00:03:50.780> a<00:03:51.080> two<00:03:51.590> hours<00:03:52.100> every<00:03:52.340> year<00:03:52.880> but<00:03:53.450> i

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
years from a two hours every year but i

chilbolton we have this we didn't know
how<00:04:28.400> important<00:04:28.940> this<00:04:29.090> was<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:30.080> same<00:04:30.410> day<00:04:30.760> same

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
how important this was the same day same

how important this was the same day same
day<00:04:32.060> next<00:04:32.480> year<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:33.370> don't<00:04:34.370> know<00:04:34.460> why<00:04:34.900> many

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
day next year I don't know why many

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.110 
day next year I don't know why many
investigators<00:04:36.590> haven't<00:04:36.980> give<00:04:37.310> important<00:04:37.940> to

this do you think this could be done at

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.540 
this do you think this could be done at
night<00:04:40.910> in<00:04:41.440> one<00:04:42.440> night<00:04:43.360> look<00:04:44.360> at
