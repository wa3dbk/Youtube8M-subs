00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
wear a belt to like a Velcro thing you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.959 
wear a belt to like a Velcro thing you
wear<00:00:58.140> around<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.039> stomach<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.850> it's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
supposed to tone your abs and so I guess

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.549 
supposed to tone your abs and so I guess
such<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.629> beginning<00:01:03.750> if<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.110> but<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.439> it

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
such as the beginning if I but if it

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.960 
such as the beginning if I but if it
works<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:04.949> maybe<00:01:05.220> I'll<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.700> yes

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
works or not maybe I'll do that so yes

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.270 
works or not maybe I'll do that so yes
this<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.510> truly<00:01:07.229> think<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> really

remote there's only a few buttons it's

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.690 
remote there's only a few buttons it's
really<00:04:12.230> simple<00:04:12.500> there's<00:04:12.799> a<00:04:12.859> power<00:04:13.099> button<00:04:13.459> the

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
really simple there's a power button the

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.999 
really simple there's a power button the
program<00:04:14.150> button<00:04:14.659> this<00:04:15.170> if<00:04:15.439> you<00:04:15.590> use<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.829> arrow

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009 
program button this if you use the arrow

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:17.680 
program button this if you use the arrow
up<00:04:16.280> you'll<00:04:16.519> increase<00:04:16.820> intensity<00:04:17.359> and<00:04:17.600> then

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
up you'll increase intensity and then

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.360 
up you'll increase intensity and then
you'll<00:04:17.810> decrease<00:04:18.019> intensity<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.160> then<00:04:19.280> you

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
you'll decrease intensity and then you

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.849 
you'll decrease intensity and then you
can<00:04:19.579> also<00:04:20.329> adjust<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.109> time<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:21.590> how<00:04:21.709> long

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
can also adjust the time of how long

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.499 
can also adjust the time of how long
you're<00:04:22.039> doing<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.550> think<00:04:22.910> it's<00:04:23.000> preset<00:04:23.389> to

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
you're doing it I think it's preset to

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.180 
you're doing it I think it's preset to
20<00:04:23.810> or<00:04:23.930> 30<00:04:24.199> I<00:04:24.320> might<00:04:24.560> have<00:04:24.680> lowered<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:24.979> down<00:04:25.009> to

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
20 or 30 I might have lowered it down to

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.040 
20 or 30 I might have lowered it down to
20<00:04:25.460> but<00:04:25.639> I<00:04:25.669> usually<00:04:25.940> do<00:04:26.210> for<00:04:26.240> 20<00:04:26.690> minutes<00:04:27.020> I

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
20 but I usually do for 20 minutes I

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.620 
20 but I usually do for 20 minutes I
like<00:04:27.530> edit<00:04:27.919> a<00:04:27.979> video<00:04:28.070> or<00:04:28.610> watch<00:04:28.850> a<00:04:28.970> show<00:04:29.210> you

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
like edit a video or watch a show you

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.090 
like edit a video or watch a show you
can<00:04:29.750> do<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:29.900> for<00:04:30.169> 40<00:04:30.410> we're<00:04:30.650> gonna<00:04:30.800> watch<00:04:30.919> your

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
can do it for 40 we're gonna watch your

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.350 
can do it for 40 we're gonna watch your
whole<00:04:31.220> show<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:31.490> really<00:04:31.610> depends<00:04:32.060> on<00:04:32.150> what

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
whole show it really depends on what

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.129 
whole show it really depends on what
you're<00:04:32.539> doing

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
you're doing

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.020 
you're doing
right<00:04:33.410> now<00:04:33.500> I<00:04:33.560> have<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.710> full<00:04:33.860> battery<00:04:34.039> so<00:04:34.820> let's

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
right now I have a full battery so let's

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.189 
right now I have a full battery so let's
say<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.150> want<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.360> start<00:04:35.660> it<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:35.900> would<00:04:36.080> just

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
say I want to start it I would just

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.010 
say I want to start it I would just
start<00:04:36.380> increasing<00:04:36.860> my<00:04:36.949> intensity<00:04:38.020> I'll

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
start increasing my intensity I'll

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.779 
start increasing my intensity I'll
upload<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.620> 10<00:04:39.860> it<00:04:40.099> says<00:04:40.130> that<00:04:40.430> you<00:04:40.610> should

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
upload it to 10 it says that you should

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.689 
upload it to 10 it says that you should
probably<00:04:40.940> get<00:04:41.150> up<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.300> 15<00:04:41.720> per<00:04:42.320> session<00:04:43.130> but<00:04:43.580> it

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
probably get up to 15 per session but it

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.460 
probably get up to 15 per session but it
really<00:04:43.789> is<00:04:43.910> about<00:04:44.000> like<00:04:44.419> up<00:04:44.599> to<00:04:44.810> you<00:04:45.199> and<00:04:45.349> how

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
really is about like up to you and how

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.810 
really is about like up to you and how
comfortable<00:04:45.740> you<00:04:46.009> are<00:04:46.130> like<00:04:46.340> how<00:04:46.550> strong

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
comfortable you are like how strong

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.070 
comfortable you are like how strong
about<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.090> contractions<00:04:47.570> to<00:04:47.660> be<00:04:47.780> you'll

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
about the contractions to be you'll

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.719 
about the contractions to be you'll
start<00:04:48.320> feeling<00:04:48.680> it<00:04:48.800> so<00:04:49.250> you<00:04:49.370> can<00:04:49.550> kind<00:04:49.639> of

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
start feeling it so you can kind of

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:50.890 
start feeling it so you can kind of
adjust<00:04:49.849> it<00:04:50.090> from<00:04:50.150> there<00:04:50.360> I'll<00:04:50.449> give<00:04:50.570> you<00:04:50.660> we're

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
adjust it from there I'll give you we're

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.120 
adjust it from there I'll give you we're
not<00:04:51.020> feeling<00:04:51.229> that<00:04:51.470> much<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:51.800> can<00:04:51.919> make<00:04:51.949> it

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
not feeling that much you can make it

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.980 
not feeling that much you can make it
higher<00:04:52.340> and<00:04:52.729> lower<00:04:53.210> they<00:04:53.449> basically<00:04:53.630> tell<00:04:53.900> you

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
higher and lower they basically tell you

that you want to put up to the highest

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:56.350 
that you want to put up to the highest
contraction<00:04:55.639> that<00:04:55.729> you're<00:04:55.820> comfortable<00:04:56.000> to

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
contraction that you're comfortable to

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.089 
contraction that you're comfortable to
kind<00:04:56.509> of<00:04:56.539> like<00:04:56.660> get<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.229> big<00:04:57.470> like<00:04:57.770> greatest
