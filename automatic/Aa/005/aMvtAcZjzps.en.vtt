you decide to braid your hair for the
weed<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.860> best<00:05:11.069> braiding<00:05:11.819> technique<00:05:12.270> is

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
weed the best braiding technique is

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.920 
weed the best braiding technique is
circle<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.979> circle<00:05:14.219> my<00:05:14.550> own<00:05:14.729> motion<00:05:14.969> like<00:05:15.599> you

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
circle the circle my own motion like you

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.980 
circle the circle my own motion like you
know<00:05:16.020> straight<00:05:16.409> across<00:05:16.860> or<00:05:17.699> around<00:05:18.300> circular

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
know straight across or around circular

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.269 
know straight across or around circular
motion<00:05:19.229> because<00:05:19.379> that<00:05:19.560> we<00:05:19.680> have<00:05:19.889> more<00:05:20.099> access

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279 
motion because that we have more access

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.260 
motion because that we have more access
to<00:05:20.879> your<00:05:21.240> scalp<00:05:21.569> because<00:05:22.080> if<00:05:22.319> you<00:05:22.439> do<00:05:22.620> it<00:05:22.800> like

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
to your scalp because if you do it like

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.050 
to your scalp because if you do it like
cornrow<00:05:24.270> going<00:05:24.599> back<00:05:24.900> then<00:05:25.650> you're<00:05:26.460> limited

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
cornrow going back then you're limited

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.459 
cornrow going back then you're limited
there<00:05:27.300> like<00:05:27.449> you're<00:05:27.659> fighting<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:28.349> get

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
there like you're fighting to get

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.290 
there like you're fighting to get
through<00:05:28.770> where<00:05:29.099> I<00:05:29.129> love<00:05:29.400> this<00:05:29.520> with<00:05:29.789> the<00:05:29.939> track

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
through where I love this with the track

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.869 
through where I love this with the track
you<00:05:30.990> can<00:05:31.020> actually<00:05:31.409> access<00:05:31.800> your<00:05:32.370> scalp

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:32.879 
you can actually access your scalp

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.719 
you can actually access your scalp
better<00:05:33.409> but<00:05:34.409> you<00:05:34.589> can<00:05:34.770> really<00:05:34.860> get<00:05:35.219> into<00:05:35.580> your

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
better but you can really get into your

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.769 
better but you can really get into your
scalp<00:05:36.139> because<00:05:37.759> easier<00:05:38.759> it's<00:05:39.509> a<00:05:39.569> really

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:39.779 
scalp because easier it's a really

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.480 
scalp because easier it's a really
massage<00:05:41.270> along<00:05:42.270> better<00:05:42.979> so<00:05:43.979> I<00:05:44.009> think<00:05:44.159> it's

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
massage along better so I think it's

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.649 
massage along better so I think it's
very<00:05:44.550> important<00:05:45.089> to<00:05:45.500> braid<00:05:46.500> your<00:05:46.529> hair<00:05:47.659> in

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
very important to braid your hair in

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.110 
very important to braid your hair in
that<00:05:49.319> motion<00:05:50.099> into<00:05:50.279> circular<00:05:50.669> motion<00:05:51.000> it's

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
that motion into circular motion it's

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.629 
that motion into circular motion it's
the<00:05:51.240> best<00:05:51.449> we<00:05:51.689> can<00:05:51.750> technique<00:05:52.339> there<00:05:53.339> is<00:05:53.490> out

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
the best we can technique there is out

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.999 
the best we can technique there is out
there<00:05:53.669> for<00:05:54.509> I<00:05:54.539> would<00:05:54.779> think<00:05:54.990> if<00:05:55.259> specially<00:05:55.919> if

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
there for I would think if specially if

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.159 
there for I would think if specially if
you<00:05:56.039> want<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.490> maintain<00:05:56.639> your<00:05:57.180> real<00:05:57.899> hair

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
you want to maintain your real hair

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.070 
you want to maintain your real hair
underneath<00:05:58.529> so<00:05:59.310> anyway<00:05:59.729> that's<00:06:00.479> that<00:06:00.689> with

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
underneath so anyway that's that with

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.189 
underneath so anyway that's that with
the<00:06:01.349> air<00:06:01.529> with<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:01.919> be<00:06:02.009> home<00:06:02.159> a<00:06:02.250> bohemian
