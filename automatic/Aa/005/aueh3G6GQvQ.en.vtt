so<00:00:07.379> these<00:00:07.649> are<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.890> instructions<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.429> the

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
so these are the instructions for the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.060 
so these are the instructions for the
origami<00:00:09.000> penis<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.630> balls<00:00:09.800> so<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.889> first

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
origami penis and balls so the first

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.980 
origami penis and balls so the first
step<00:00:11.280> for<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.580> origami<00:00:11.700> penis<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.509> we're

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
step for the origami penis is we're

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.560 
step for the origami penis is we're
going<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.349> make<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.860> book<00:00:14.820> fold<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.360> it's<00:00:15.450> going

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
going to make a book fold so it's going

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.390 
going to make a book fold so it's going
to<00:00:15.630> start<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.960> white<00:00:16.170> side<00:00:16.199> up<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.800> going

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
to start with the white side up so going

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.920 
to start with the white side up so going
to<00:00:17.490> take<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> bottom<00:00:17.820> edge<00:00:18.150> up<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.750> top

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
to take the bottom edge up to the top

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.189 
to take the bottom edge up to the top
edge<00:00:19.400> make<00:00:20.400> sure<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> lines<00:00:20.880> up<00:00:21.210> nice<00:00:22.170> and

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
edge make sure it lines up nice and

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.240 
edge make sure it lines up nice and
precisely<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:25.529> then<00:00:25.680> make<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> good<00:00:26.070> crease

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
precisely and then make a good crease

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.849 
precisely and then make a good crease
fold<00:00:26.490> open<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.230> do<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> other<00:00:28.560> book

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
fold open it up and do the other book

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.069 
fold open it up and do the other book
fold<00:00:30.050> just<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.809> what<00:00:33.809> we're<00:00:33.930> going

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
fold just like this and what we're going

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.870 
fold just like this and what we're going
to<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.350> we're<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.590> make<00:00:34.800> an<00:00:35.040> 8x8<00:00:35.850> grid

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
to do is we're going to make an 8x8 grid

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180 
to do is we're going to make an 8x8 grid
all<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.989> way<00:00:37.079> across<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> next<00:00:38.010> step

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
all the way across so the next step

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.190 
all the way across so the next step
we're<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> fold<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> bottom<00:00:39.450> edge<00:00:39.809> into

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
we're going to fold the bottom edge into

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.990 
we're going to fold the bottom edge into
the<00:00:40.710> center<00:00:41.870> like<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.250> and<00:00:44.250> we're<00:00:44.789> gonna<00:00:44.910> do

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the center like that and we're gonna do

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.580 
the center like that and we're gonna do
that<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.210> both<00:00:45.390> sides<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.989> try<00:00:46.170> not<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.469> make

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
that on both sides and try not to make

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.650 
that on both sides and try not to make
these<00:00:46.800> put<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.489> top<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.879> each<00:00:47.969> other<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.420> all

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
these put on top of each other at all

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.779 
these put on top of each other at all
make<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.289> nicely<00:00:49.649> they<00:00:50.070> come<00:00:50.610> right

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
make it so that's nicely they come right

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.650 
make it so that's nicely they come right
up<00:00:50.879> against<00:00:51.180> each<00:00:51.270> other<00:00:51.390> without

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
up against each other without

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.930 
up against each other without
overlapping<00:00:52.309> we're<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> open<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.820> up

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
overlapping we're going to open it up

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
overlapping we're going to open it up
and<00:00:54.210> now<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.199> order<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.399> go

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
and now in order to get this one to go

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.799 
and now in order to get this one to go
in<00:00:56.640> half<00:00:56.789> we're<00:00:56.969> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> take<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.539> bottom

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
in half we're going to take the bottom

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.560 
in half we're going to take the bottom
edge<00:00:57.930> we're<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> take<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:59.570> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
edge we're going to take it up to the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.820 
edge we're going to take it up to the
quarter<00:01:01.020> line<00:01:02.570> up<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> top<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.619> going<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
quarter line up on the top I'm going to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.830 
quarter line up on the top I'm going to
open<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.510> take<00:01:06.659> the

open that one up and then take the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.460 
open that one up and then take the
bottom<00:01:07.250> up<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.180> line<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.869> one-quarter

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
bottom up to this line this one-quarter

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.039 
bottom up to this line this one-quarter
line<00:01:10.880> let's<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.000> how<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.150> divided<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> bottom

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
line let's see how we divided the bottom

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.260 
line let's see how we divided the bottom
half<00:01:13.229> into<00:01:13.560> fourths<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.640> equal<00:01:15.060> eights

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
half into fourths we have equal eights

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
half into fourths we have equal eights
right<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:15.900> I'm<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> rotate<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.650> over

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
right there I'm going to rotate it over

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.100 
right there I'm going to rotate it over
and<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.880> same<00:01:17.970> thing<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.930> sure

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and do the same thing up here make sure

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
and do the same thing up here make sure
that<00:01:19.229> when<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.860> other<00:01:20.009> side

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
that when you do it on the other side

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.920 
that when you do it on the other side
that<00:01:20.610> you're<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> fourth

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that you're just going up to the fourth

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.469 
that you're just going up to the fourth
line<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.650> eighth<00:01:22.860> line<00:01:23.330> fold<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
line and not that eighth line fold that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.969 
line and not that eighth line fold that
one<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.780> half<00:01:25.549> and<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.820> fold<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.770> up<00:01:28.770> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
one in half and then fold this one up to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.080 
one in half and then fold this one up to
the<00:01:29.009> bottom<00:01:30.049> like<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.610> open<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.820> then<00:01:33.030> I'm

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the bottom like that open it up then I'm

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.399 
the bottom like that open it up then I'm
going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> rotate<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> side<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> now

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
going to rotate it to the side and now

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.859 
going to rotate it to the side and now
we're<00:01:34.500> going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.680> divide<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.909> into<00:01:36.600> fourths

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
we're going to divide this into fourths

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.870 
we're going to divide this into fourths
as<00:01:37.110> well<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.130> go<00:01:38.220> ahead<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.460> take<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> bottom

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
as well so go ahead and take the bottom

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.050 
as well so go ahead and take the bottom
edge<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:40.040> fold<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> middle

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
edge there fold that up to the middle

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.240 
edge there fold that up to the middle
and<00:01:43.189> then<00:01:44.189> open<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:45.680> one<00:01:46.680> more<00:01:46.710> time<00:01:46.890> there

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
and then open it up one more time there

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.359 
and then open it up one more time there
that<00:01:47.399> will<00:01:47.490> give<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.790> fourths<00:01:48.180> line<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
that will give you the fourths line and

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.389 
that will give you the fourths line and
then<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.490> order<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.820> cut<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.420> half

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
then in order to cut this one in half

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.039 
then in order to cut this one in half

line is right there and sort of see if

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.620 
line is right there and sort of see if
you<00:01:59.189> can<00:01:59.369> get<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.790> connect<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.270> see<00:02:00.420> right

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you can get it to connect you see right

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.359 
you can get it to connect you see right
there<00:02:00.810> how<00:02:00.930> those<00:02:01.079> two<00:02:01.290> lines<00:02:01.469> are<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.130> top<00:02:02.340> of

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
there how those two lines are on top of

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.580 
there how those two lines are on top of
each<00:02:02.549> other<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.360> then<00:02:03.509> rotate<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.020> over<00:02:04.350> until

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
each other and then rotate it over until

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.310 
each other and then rotate it over until
they're<00:02:05.189> right<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.939> top<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.170> right

they're right on top you can see right

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.779 
they're right on top you can see right
over<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.590> as<00:02:07.680> well<00:02:07.920> we're<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> get

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
over here as well we're going to get

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.800 
over here as well we're going to get
these<00:02:09.090> two<00:02:09.390> edges

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
these two edges

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.949 
these two edges
-<00:02:10.959> line<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.200> together<00:02:12.630> just<00:02:13.630> like<00:02:13.750> that

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.559 

alright<00:02:17.430> next<00:02:18.430> we're<00:02:18.670> going<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.850> fold<00:02:19.090> this

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
alright next we're going to fold this

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.740 
alright next we're going to fold this
one<00:02:19.810> up<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.850> make<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.000> one<00:02:22.180> leave<00:02:22.390> when<00:02:22.690> you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
one up and make that one leave when you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.570 
one up and make that one leave when you
fold<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.080> bottom<00:02:23.350> edge<00:02:23.500> up<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.920> this<00:02:24.040> up<00:02:24.250> to

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
fold the bottom edge up to this up to

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.309 
fold the bottom edge up to this up to
the<00:02:24.670> center<00:02:24.940> line<00:02:25.120> leave<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.870> one<00:02:25.990> there<00:02:26.200> and

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
the center line leave that one there and

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.920 
the center line leave that one there and
flip<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.740> model<00:02:26.890> over<00:02:27.630> now<00:02:28.630> we're<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
flip the model over now we're going to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.350 
flip the model over now we're going to
make<00:02:29.140> a<00:02:29.380> diagonal<00:02:29.890> fold<00:02:30.280> that's<00:02:30.640> three<00:02:31.180> blocks

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
make a diagonal fold that's three blocks

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.180 
make a diagonal fold that's three blocks
in<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.110> take<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> bottom<00:02:32.739> edge<00:02:32.860> right<00:02:33.130> here

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
in so take the bottom edge right here

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.260 
in so take the bottom edge right here
fold<00:02:34.120> it<00:02:34.239> up<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.540> top<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.760> third<00:02:37.120> of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
fold it up to the top of the third of

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.820 
fold it up to the top of the third of
this<00:02:37.690> line<00:02:37.959> right<00:02:38.170> here<00:02:38.230> so<00:02:38.500> there's<00:02:38.650> still

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
this line right here so there's still

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.910 
this line right here so there's still
five<00:02:39.190> units<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:40.020> that<00:02:41.020> side<00:02:41.260> fold<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.770> one

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
five units on that side fold that one

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.310 
five units on that side fold that one
over<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:43.540> same<00:02:43.750> thing<00:02:44.080> on<00:02:44.820> this<00:02:45.820> side

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
over and do the same thing on this side

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.930 
over and do the same thing on this side
like<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.739> then<00:02:48.430> we're<00:02:48.519> going<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.670> open

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
like that and then we're going to open

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.949 
like that and then we're going to open
those<00:02:49.239> two<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.860> flip<00:02:50.860> it<00:02:50.980> back<00:02:51.100> over<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.959> then

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
those two up flip it back over and then

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.630 
those two up flip it back over and then
open<00:02:53.350> this<00:02:53.470> up<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:55.150> V<00:02:55.660> right<00:02:56.050> here<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:56.709> the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
open this up this V right here is the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.740 
open this up this V right here is the
line<00:02:57.790> that<00:02:57.819> we're<00:02:58.060> going<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.300> use<00:02:58.510> I'm<00:02:58.720> going

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
line that we're going to use I'm going

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.030 
line that we're going to use I'm going
to<00:02:58.900> fold<00:02:59.230> three<00:02:59.890> units<00:03:00.310> over<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:01.830> then<00:03:02.830> use

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
to fold three units over and then use

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.800 
to fold three units over and then use
that<00:03:03.069> V<00:03:03.610> fold<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.150> up<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.709> squash<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.739> down

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
that V fold that up and squash it down

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.259 
that V fold that up and squash it down
like<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:08.580> I'll<00:03:09.580> show<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.760> again<00:03:09.880> from

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
like that so I'll show you again from

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.790 
like that so I'll show you again from
here<00:03:10.510> you're<00:03:10.900> going<00:03:10.989> to<00:03:11.080> use<00:03:11.200> this<00:03:11.380> line<00:03:11.620> right

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
here you're going to use this line right

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.550 
here you're going to use this line right
here<00:03:11.860> this<00:03:12.280> line<00:03:12.519> right<00:03:12.670> here<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.239> line

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
here this line right here and this line

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.990 
here this line right here and this line
coming<00:03:14.560> across<00:03:14.860> this<00:03:15.310> hole<00:03:15.579> going<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.880> take

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
coming across this hole going to take

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.210 
coming across this hole going to take
three<00:03:16.299> units<00:03:16.600> are<00:03:16.660> going<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.810> come<00:03:16.989> over<00:03:17.220> and

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
three units are going to come over and

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.460 
three units are going to come over and
use<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.579> diagonal<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.209> fold<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.540> up<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.900> that

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
use that diagonal to fold it up and that

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.970 
use that diagonal to fold it up and that
will<00:03:20.560> squash<00:03:20.860> down<00:03:21.100> like<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:22.560> next<00:03:23.560> we're

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
will squash down like that next we're

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.880 
will squash down like that next we're
going<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.130> use<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.610> line<00:03:24.910> right<00:03:25.120> here<00:03:25.510> on<00:03:25.890> the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
going to use this line right here on the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.830 
going to use this line right here on the
one<00:03:27.100> third<00:03:27.370> line<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:27.910> we're<00:03:28.150> going<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.450> inside

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
one third line and we're going to inside

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.100 
one third line and we're going to inside
reverse<00:03:28.900> fold<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.680> back<00:03:30.070> this<00:03:30.430> way<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.540> fold<00:03:31.989> it

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
reverse fold it back this way so fold it

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:41.250 
reverse fold it back this way so fold it
over<00:03:35.370> like<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.660> starts<00:03:40.930> over<00:03:41.049> here

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
over like that so it starts over here

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.360 
over like that so it starts over here
like<00:03:41.350> this<00:03:41.620> and<00:03:41.890> then<00:03:42.880> it<00:03:43.000> pushes<00:03:43.239> through<00:03:43.600> and

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
like this and then it pushes through and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.400 
like this and then it pushes through and
folds<00:03:45.370> over<00:03:45.660> like<00:03:46.660> that<00:03:46.900> now<00:03:47.170> we're<00:03:47.260> going<00:03:47.350> to

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
folds over like that now we're going to

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.680 
folds over like that now we're going to
repeat<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.859> same<00:03:47.890> thing<00:03:48.310> on<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:49.180> side

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
repeat the same thing on this side

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.750 
repeat the same thing on this side
so<00:03:50.079> if<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:50.320> was<00:03:50.500> over<00:03:50.709> we<00:03:51.160> take<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.489> three

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
so if this was over we take the three

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.599 
so if this was over we take the three
units<00:03:52.090> over<00:03:52.239> fold<00:03:52.630> those<00:03:52.870> three<00:03:53.079> units<00:03:53.230> over

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
units over fold those three units over

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.550 
units over fold those three units over
like<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:56.880> using<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:58.780> fold<00:03:59.049> and<00:03:59.230> that

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
like that using that fold and that

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.060 
like that using that fold and that
crease<00:03:59.890> folds<00:04:00.280> over<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.810> then<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:02.560> one-third

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
crease folds over and then the one-third

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.430 
crease folds over and then the one-third
line<00:04:03.340> right<00:04:03.820> here<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.750> going<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.079> inside

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
line right here is going to inside

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.190 
line right here is going to inside
reverse<00:04:05.470> fold<00:04:06.299> back<00:04:07.299> the<00:04:07.570> opposite<00:04:08.079> direction

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
reverse fold back the opposite direction

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.840 
reverse fold back the opposite direction
and<00:04:08.820> if<00:04:09.820> you've<00:04:09.970> done<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.209> correctly<00:04:11.850> what

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
and if you've done that correctly what

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.159 
and if you've done that correctly what
will<00:04:12.940> happen<00:04:13.359> is<00:04:14.489> these<00:04:15.489> two<00:04:15.730> edges<00:04:15.900> will<00:04:16.900> line

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
will happen is these two edges will line

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.529 
will happen is these two edges will line
up<00:04:17.410> right<00:04:18.070> next<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.459> each<00:04:18.549> other<00:04:18.729> next<00:04:19.239> we're

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
up right next to each other next we're

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.300 
up right next to each other next we're
going<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.690> fold<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.560> top<00:04:21.010> unit<00:04:21.370> down

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
going to fold this top unit down

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.600 
going to fold this top unit down
and<00:04:22.419> what<00:04:23.419> and<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.870> way<00:04:24.020> this<00:04:24.200> works<00:04:24.560> is<00:04:24.860> go

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
and what and the way this works is go

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.550 
and what and the way this works is go
ahead<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:25.820> pinch<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:26.450> whole<00:04:26.810> trying<00:04:27.260> this

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
pinch that whole square fold the whole

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.260 
pinch that whole square fold the whole
thing<00:04:31.400> down<00:04:31.669> over<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.180> edge<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.630> then<00:04:32.800> this

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
thing down over the edge and then this

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.650 
thing down over the edge and then this
side<00:04:35.270> panel<00:04:35.780> will<00:04:36.530> swing<00:04:36.860> over<00:04:37.220> in<00:04:37.660> response

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
side panel will swing over in response

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.740 
side panel will swing over in response
go<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.620> do<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.889> on<00:04:40.100> both<00:04:40.730> sides<00:04:40.790> fold<00:04:41.510> this

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
go and do that on both sides fold this

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.610 
go and do that on both sides fold this
one<00:04:41.930> down<00:04:41.990> as<00:04:42.320> well<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.820> that<00:04:43.820> will<00:04:44.000> thin<00:04:44.620> the

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
one down as well and that will thin the

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.920 
one down as well and that will thin the
top<00:04:45.860> like<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:46.730> next<00:04:47.270> we're<00:04:47.510> going<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.660> fold

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
top like that next we're going to fold

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.890 
top like that next we're going to fold
the<00:04:48.110> top<00:04:48.139> up<00:04:49.210> after<00:04:50.210> this<00:04:50.300> has<00:04:50.450> come<00:04:50.600> down<00:04:50.750> and

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
the top up after this has come down and

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.550 
the top up after this has come down and
we're<00:04:50.990> going<00:04:51.080> to<00:04:51.169> use<00:04:51.350> both<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.800> these<00:04:53.560> little

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
we're going to use both of these little

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.740 
we're going to use both of these little
squares<00:04:55.040> when<00:04:55.310> fold<00:04:55.700> those<00:04:55.880> triangles<00:04:56.540> down

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
squares when fold those triangles down

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.460 
squares when fold those triangles down
and<00:04:57.639> fold<00:04:58.639> the<00:04:58.729> whole<00:04:58.910> thing<00:04:59.180> back<00:04:59.389> down<00:04:59.630> we<00:05:00.320> do

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
and fold the whole thing back down we do

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.060 
and fold the whole thing back down we do
that<00:05:00.590> on<00:05:00.710> the<00:05:00.830> left<00:05:01.040> side<00:05:01.870> also<00:05:03.070> the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
that on the left side also the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.270 
that on the left side also the
right-hand<00:05:04.550> side<00:05:04.790> and<00:05:05.650> this<00:05:06.650> will<00:05:06.860> come<00:05:07.040> down

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
right-hand side and this will come down

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.650 
right-hand side and this will come down
like<00:05:08.229> that<00:05:09.250> as<00:05:10.510> well

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
like that as well

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.210 
like that as well
after<00:05:12.410> that<00:05:12.560> we're<00:05:12.740> going<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:12.919> take<00:05:13.070> the

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
after that we're going to take the

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.200 
after that we're going to take the
bottom<00:05:13.370> edge<00:05:14.650> fold<00:05:15.650> that<00:05:15.830> up<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.639> right<00:05:16.880> about

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
bottom edge fold that up to right about

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.330 
bottom edge fold that up to right about
here<00:05:17.720> you<00:05:17.870> can<00:05:18.380> see<00:05:18.530> how<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:18.770> lines<00:05:19.010> up<00:05:19.190> with

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
here you can see how it lines up with

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.080 
here you can see how it lines up with
the<00:05:19.460> next<00:05:19.729> line<00:05:20.020> right<00:05:21.020> there<00:05:21.290> and<00:05:21.940> then<00:05:22.940> we're

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
the next line right there and then we're

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.450 
the next line right there and then we're
going<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.270> fold<00:05:24.520> this<00:05:25.900> triangle<00:05:26.900> flap<00:05:27.460> fold

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
going to fold this triangle flap fold

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.840 
going to fold this triangle flap fold
that<00:05:28.610> down<00:05:28.880> on<00:05:29.180> both<00:05:29.479> sides<00:05:30.550> right<00:05:31.550> over<00:05:31.760> the

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
that down on both sides right over the

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.150 
that down on both sides right over the
top<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.240> then<00:05:33.110> once<00:05:33.590> we<00:05:33.740> have<00:05:33.860> the<00:05:33.950> triangle

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
top and then once we have the triangle

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.040 
top and then once we have the triangle
flap<00:05:34.430> folded<00:05:34.729> over<00:05:34.850> open<00:05:35.390> it<00:05:35.539> back<00:05:35.630> up<00:05:35.690> and

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
flap folded over open it back up and

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.200 
flap folded over open it back up and
then<00:05:36.140> turn<00:05:36.530> that<00:05:36.560> into<00:05:36.830> a<00:05:36.979> squash<00:05:37.520> fold<00:05:37.550> and

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
then turn that into a squash fold and

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.090 
then turn that into a squash fold and
that<00:05:38.960> will<00:05:39.080> give<00:05:39.200> you<00:05:39.320> the<00:05:39.440> full<00:05:39.620> shape<00:05:39.860> on<00:05:40.039> the

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
that will give you the full shape on the

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.450 
that will give you the full shape on the
front<00:05:41.380> open<00:05:42.380> it<00:05:42.530> up<00:05:42.650> there<00:05:42.860> on<00:05:42.979> the<00:05:43.070> other<00:05:43.190> side

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
front open it up there on the other side

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.090 
front open it up there on the other side
as<00:05:43.610> well

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.790 

like<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:48.750> then<00:05:49.080> after<00:05:49.200> you<00:05:49.410> have<00:05:49.440> that

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
like that and then after you have that

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.830 
like that and then after you have that
we<00:05:50.700> have<00:05:50.790> a<00:05:50.850> little<00:05:51.030> bit<00:05:51.120> of<00:05:51.210> shaping<00:05:51.510> that's

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
we have a little bit of shaping that's

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.210 
we have a little bit of shaping that's
left<00:05:52.080> to<00:05:52.170> do<00:05:52.320> so<00:05:52.350> instead<00:05:52.770> of<00:05:52.890> having<00:05:53.040> these

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
left to do so instead of having these

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.820 
left to do so instead of having these
sharp<00:05:53.490> corners<00:05:53.850> we're<00:05:54.000> going<00:05:54.120> to<00:05:54.180> round<00:05:54.360> these

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
sharp corners we're going to round these

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.970 
sharp corners we're going to round these
so<00:05:55.830> that<00:05:55.890> they<00:05:56.040> will<00:05:56.160> be<00:05:56.280> more<00:05:56.460> spherical<00:05:57.120> on

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
so that they will be more spherical on

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.560 
so that they will be more spherical on
the<00:05:58.980> top<00:05:59.220> the<00:06:00.060> left<00:06:00.240> and<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.750> bottom<00:06:02.510> all<00:06:03.510> the

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
the top the left and the bottom all the

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:11.420 
the top the left and the bottom all the
way<00:06:04.200> around<00:06:06.530> and<00:06:07.640> then<00:06:08.640> at<00:06:08.730> this<00:06:08.790> point<00:06:10.430> like

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
way around and then at this point like

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.520 
way around and then at this point like
it's<00:06:11.640> those<00:06:11.910> set<00:06:12.660> up<00:06:12.810> properly<00:06:13.230> and<00:06:13.350> then

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
it's those set up properly and then

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.350 
it's those set up properly and then
we're<00:06:13.680> going<00:06:13.800> to<00:06:13.830> work<00:06:13.950> on<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.220> top<00:06:14.430> go<00:06:15.210> ahead

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
we're going to work on the top go ahead

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.230 
we're going to work on the top go ahead
and<00:06:15.450> make<00:06:15.540> just<00:06:15.690> a<00:06:15.750> little<00:06:15.780> pleat<00:06:16.200> fold<00:06:17.240> right

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
and make just a little pleat fold right

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.320 
and make just a little pleat fold right
there<00:06:18.630> about<00:06:19.050> one<00:06:19.410> unit<00:06:19.830> down<00:06:20.670> and<00:06:21.030> then<00:06:21.180> as

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
there about one unit down and then as

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.960 
there about one unit down and then as
tiny<00:06:21.720> of<00:06:21.870> a<00:06:21.960> pleat<00:06:22.170> fold<00:06:22.350> as<00:06:22.500> you<00:06:22.590> can<00:06:22.970> I'm

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
tiny of a pleat fold as you can I'm

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.280 
tiny of a pleat fold as you can I'm
going<00:06:24.120> to<00:06:24.210> fold<00:06:24.480> that<00:06:24.600> over<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:25.560> then<00:06:27.290> flip

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
going to fold that over and then flip

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.840 
going to fold that over and then flip
the<00:06:28.410> model<00:06:28.590> over<00:06:28.800> and<00:06:29.810> thin<00:06:30.810> this<00:06:31.080> edge<00:06:31.640> over<00:06:32.640> a

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
the model over and thin this edge over a

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.330 
the model over and thin this edge over a
bit<00:06:33.150> it'll<00:06:33.330> stretch<00:06:33.750> over<00:06:34.200> it'll<00:06:35.190> make<00:06:35.310> a

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
bit it'll stretch over it'll make a

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.060 
bit it'll stretch over it'll make a
little<00:06:35.550> bit<00:06:35.790> of<00:06:35.820> a<00:06:36.030> stretch<00:06:36.360> fold<00:06:36.720> of<00:06:37.560> a<00:06:37.710> squash

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
little bit of a stretch fold of a squash

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.530 
little bit of a stretch fold of a squash
and<00:06:38.370> that'll<00:06:38.610> thin<00:06:39.830> the<00:06:40.830> center<00:06:41.420> so<00:06:42.420> that<00:06:42.450> the

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
and that'll thin the center so that the

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.260 
and that'll thin the center so that the
tip<00:06:42.870> has<00:06:43.050> a<00:06:43.080> little<00:06:43.410> bit<00:06:43.500> more<00:06:43.940> thickness<00:06:44.940> to

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
tip has a little bit more thickness to

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:50.440 
tip has a little bit more thickness to
it<00:06:45.860> like<00:06:46.860> that<00:06:47.040> and<00:06:47.280> then<00:06:47.820> shape<00:06:48.630> to<00:06:48.870> taste

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.450 
it like that and then shape to taste

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:56.210 
it like that and then shape to taste
like<00:06:51.450> that<00:06:52.070> and<00:06:54.440> should<00:06:55.440> be<00:06:55.560> just<00:06:55.680> a<00:06:55.830> little

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
like that and should be just a little

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.820 
like that and should be just a little
bit<00:06:57.020> of<00:06:58.020> an<00:06:58.530> action<00:06:59.060> right<00:07:00.060> there<00:07:00.650> for<00:07:01.650> the

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
bit of an action right there for the

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.940 
bit of an action right there for the
origami<00:07:02.250> penis<00:07:02.670> and<00:07:02.880> balls
