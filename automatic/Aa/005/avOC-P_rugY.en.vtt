so here's how I did it so the first

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.680 
so here's how I did it so the first
thing<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.650> I<00:00:36.739> took<00:00:36.800> our<00:00:37.550> tractor<00:00:38.059> shade<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:38.600> I

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
thing is I took our tractor shade and I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.350 
thing is I took our tractor shade and I
mixed<00:00:39.110> it<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.440> one-to-one<00:00:39.860> with<00:00:40.280> water<00:00:40.730> just

mixed it the one-to-one with water just

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.360 
mixed it the one-to-one with water just
to<00:00:41.840> make<00:00:41.989> sure<00:00:42.170> that<00:00:42.290> my<00:00:42.440> wash<00:00:42.739> was<00:00:42.949> not<00:00:43.190> too

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
strong and still gonna flow really well

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.290 
strong and still gonna flow really well
in<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:12.830> cracks<00:01:13.280> still<00:01:13.520> gonna<00:01:13.729> make<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.090> the

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
in the cracks still gonna make the the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.810 
in the cracks still gonna make the the
model<00:01:14.630> look<00:01:14.810> pretty<00:01:15.080> but<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:16.039> will<00:01:16.220> not<00:01:16.490> have

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
model look pretty but it will not have

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.330 
model look pretty but it will not have
us<00:01:17.060> as<00:01:17.570> a<00:01:17.630> strong<00:01:18.200> effect<00:01:18.560> if<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:18.710> would<00:01:19.039> use

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
us as a strong effect if you would use

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.820 
us as a strong effect if you would use
it<00:01:19.550> pure<00:01:19.789> right<00:01:20.060> off<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.450> bottle<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:21.680> that's

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
it pure right off the bottle so that's

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.800 
it pure right off the bottle so that's
what<00:01:21.979> I<00:01:22.009> did<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.280> apply<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.700> wash<00:01:23.030> everywhere<00:01:23.660> on

the model on the other side and
everything<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:27.550> that's<00:01:28.550> pretty<00:01:28.729> much<00:01:28.940> it

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
everything and that's pretty much it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:40.230

used the same a renegade chrome use the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.890 
used the same a renegade chrome use the
same<00:04:19.430> needle<00:04:19.639> technically<00:04:20.389> you<00:04:20.570> should<00:04:20.750> be

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
same needle technically you should be

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.650 
same needle technically you should be
fine<00:04:21.289> with<00:04:21.590> that

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.930 

once<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.810> OSL<00:04:29.290> was<00:04:29.470> done<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:29.740> took<00:04:29.949> my<00:04:30.490> games<00:04:30.760> in

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
once the OSL was done I took my games in

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.470 
once the OSL was done I took my games in
gear<00:04:31.210> brush<00:04:31.980> number<00:04:32.980> three<00:04:33.699> right<00:04:34.000> there<00:04:34.210> and

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
gear brush number three right there and

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.010 
gear brush number three right there and
then<00:04:34.840> I<00:04:34.870> apply<00:04:35.680> some<00:04:36.310> gloss<00:04:37.000> varnish<00:04:37.419> to<00:04:37.840> make

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
then I apply some gloss varnish to make

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.260 
then I apply some gloss varnish to make
the<00:04:38.199> whole<00:04:38.410> thing<00:04:38.440> pop<00:04:38.979> try<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.550> keep<00:04:40.090> the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
the whole thing pop try to keep the

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.969 
the whole thing pop try to keep the
gloss<00:04:40.570> varnish<00:04:40.750> in<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.169> middle<00:04:41.440> strip<00:04:41.740> but<00:04:41.919> I

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
gloss varnish in the middle strip but I

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.219 
gloss varnish in the middle strip but I
went<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:42.580> little<00:04:42.699> bit<00:04:42.880> overboard<00:04:43.180> but<00:04:43.630> you<00:04:44.110> know

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
went a little bit overboard but you know

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.710 
went a little bit overboard but you know
it<00:04:44.320> gives<00:04:44.500> it<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.830> nice<00:04:45.340> little<00:04:45.610> shine<00:04:46.060> compared

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
it gives it a nice little shine compared

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.110 
it gives it a nice little shine compared
to<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.930> rest<00:04:47.650> of<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.889> model<00:04:48.490> which<00:04:48.669> is<00:04:48.850> flat

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
to the rest of the model which is flat

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.270 
to the rest of the model which is flat
black<00:04:49.449> and<00:04:49.960> not<00:04:50.139> flat<00:04:50.410> black<00:04:50.650> with<00:04:50.860> flat

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
black and not flat black with flat

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.480 
black and not flat black with flat
colors<00:04:51.870> so<00:04:52.870> that's<00:04:53.139> pretty<00:04:53.350> much<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:53.949> to

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
colors so that's pretty much it and to

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.930 
colors so that's pretty much it and to
top<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:54.940> off<00:04:55.090> I<00:04:55.300> took<00:04:55.740> my<00:04:56.740> salt<00:04:57.250> our<00:04:57.400> 20/20

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
top it off I took my salt our 20/20

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.760 
top it off I took my salt our 20/20
again<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:58.810> use<00:04:58.990> some<00:04:59.199> raven<00:04:59.590> black

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
again and I use some raven black

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.850

part if it would have been me I wouldn't
have<00:05:09.940> made<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.360> in<00:05:10.720> those<00:05:10.960> angles<00:05:11.560> because<00:05:11.889> you

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
have made it in those angles because you

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.310 
have made it in those angles because you
know<00:05:12.280> technically<00:05:12.669> if<00:05:12.850> the<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.930> falcon

is<00:05:14.440> running<00:05:14.830> forward<00:05:15.430> those<00:05:15.970> streak<00:05:16.389> will<00:05:16.630> not

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
is running forward those streak will not

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.840 
is running forward those streak will not
follow<00:05:17.139> the<00:05:17.620> you<00:05:18.100> know<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.340> pattern<00:05:18.729> that

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
follow the you know the pattern that

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.629 
follow the you know the pattern that
those<00:05:19.210> exhaust<00:05:19.780> or<00:05:19.990> whatever<00:05:20.320> have<00:05:20.650> but<00:05:21.430> they

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
those exhaust or whatever have but they

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.219 
those exhaust or whatever have but they
were<00:05:21.700> already<00:05:22.180> there<00:05:22.330> so<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:22.810> just<00:05:23.050> followed

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
were already there so I just followed

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.180 
were already there so I just followed
that<00:05:23.530> pattern<00:05:23.830> and<00:05:24.130> question<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.150> making

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
that pattern and question of making

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.500 
that pattern and question of making
model<00:05:27.190> look<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.460> little<00:05:27.610> bit<00:05:27.789> more<00:05:27.970> gritty<00:05:28.300> I

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
model look a little bit more gritty I

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.689 
model look a little bit more gritty I
went<00:05:29.080> when<00:05:29.289> there<00:05:29.710> was<00:05:29.889> those<00:05:30.070> little<00:05:30.190> holes

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
went when there was those little holes

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.820 
went when there was those little holes
and<00:05:30.940> recessed<00:05:31.419> and<00:05:31.660> I<00:05:31.720> just<00:05:32.050> tinned<00:05:32.410> them<00:05:32.650> I
