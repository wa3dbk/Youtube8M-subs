this<00:02:00.510> team<00:02:00.690> certainly<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.410> for<00:02:01.710> level<00:02:01.980> four

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280

from their usual avant-garde modern
choices<00:02:12.830> but<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.920> seems<00:02:14.129> everything<00:02:14.610> comes<00:02:15.060> so

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.230 

well<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.260> think<00:02:18.350> that's<00:02:18.650> because<00:02:18.920> they're<00:02:19.280> both

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
well I think that's because they're both

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.210
