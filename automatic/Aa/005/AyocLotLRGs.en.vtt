00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.920 
then lift her up but if she can stay a
bit<00:01:59.130> longer<00:01:59.189> try<00:01:59.969> every<00:02:00.210> time<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.479> little<00:02:00.689> bit

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
bit longer try every time a little bit

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.630 
bit longer try every time a little bit
longer<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.350> she<00:02:01.560> gets<00:02:01.829> used<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
longer so she gets used to this and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.789 
longer so she gets used to this and
eventually<00:02:02.960> she<00:02:03.960> will<00:02:04.079> start<00:02:04.380> reaching

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
eventually she will start reaching

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.520 
eventually she will start reaching
forward<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:06.060> she's<00:02:06.299> crawling

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
forward like she's crawling

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
forward like she's crawling
now<00:02:07.830> from<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> age<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.670> about<00:02:08.880> three<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.360> four

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
now from the age of about three to four

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.630 
now from the age of about three to four
months<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.319> head<00:02:10.500> controls<00:02:10.979> obviously<00:02:11.130> a<00:02:11.459> lot

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
months the head controls obviously a lot

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.930 
months the head controls obviously a lot
better<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.380> actually<00:02:13.560> roll<00:02:14.550> up<00:02:14.790> a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
better so you can actually roll up a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.540 
better so you can actually roll up a
towel<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.600> pop<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.260> under<00:02:16.560> her<00:02:16.680> forearms<00:02:17.370> so

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
towel and pop it under her forearms so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.360 
towel and pop it under her forearms so
she's<00:02:17.910> leaning<00:02:18.150> over<00:02:18.450> these<00:02:18.930> now<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.190> in

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
she's leaning over these now this in

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.480 
she's leaning over these now this in
itself<00:02:20.760> should<00:02:21.420> try<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.900> help<00:02:22.260> her<00:02:22.560> start<00:02:23.370> to

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
itself should try and help her start to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.330 
itself should try and help her start to
reach<00:02:23.850> forward<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.660> encourage<00:02:25.290> her<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.709> crawl

take this town away now there are

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.260 
take this town away now there are
statistics<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.200> came<00:02:34.470> out<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:35.060> 2006<00:02:36.060> which

were<00:02:36.390> quite<00:02:36.569> surprising<00:02:37.380> which<00:02:37.920> showed<00:02:38.250> that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
were quite surprising which showed that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.780 
were quite surprising which showed that
19<00:02:39.000> percent<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.720> moms<00:02:40.140> never<00:02:40.800> give<00:02:41.580> their

time<00:02:47.130> these<00:02:48.060> statistics<00:02:48.720> are<00:02:48.870> hopefully

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
time these statistics are hopefully

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.220 
time these statistics are hopefully
changing<00:02:49.920> with<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.519> new<00:02:51.019> publications<00:02:52.019> and
