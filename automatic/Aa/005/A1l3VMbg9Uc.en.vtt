00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
rifle in this first person view right

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.999 
rifle in this first person view right
now<00:06:05.449> this<00:06:06.449> is<00:06:06.629> the<00:06:06.659> exact<00:06:07.020> same<00:06:07.199> size<00:06:07.469> as<00:06:07.800> the

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
now this is the exact same size as the

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.990
