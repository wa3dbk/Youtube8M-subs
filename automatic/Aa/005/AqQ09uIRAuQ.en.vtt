00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.189 
coinciding would cause bad form there's
probably<00:05:14.229> not<00:05:14.380> a<00:05:14.440> good<00:05:14.650> thing<00:05:14.860> but<00:05:15.520> however

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
probably not a good thing but however

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.629 
probably not a good thing but however
they<00:05:17.199> just<00:05:17.409> have<00:05:17.530> to<00:05:17.560> start<00:05:17.919> a<00:05:17.979> new<00:05:18.009> start<00:05:18.490> over

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
they just have to start a new start over

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.040 
they just have to start a new start over
fresh<00:05:18.849> look<00:05:19.300> at<00:05:19.389> that<00:05:19.509> long<00:05:19.659> but<00:05:19.810> from<00:05:19.960> the

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
fresh look at that long but from the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.510 
fresh look at that long but from the
kickoff<00:05:20.199> i<00:05:20.530> thought<00:05:20.710> i<00:05:20.740> was<00:05:20.979> a<00:05:21.009> that<00:05:21.460> was

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
kickoff i thought i was a that was

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.820 
kickoff i thought i was a that was
offside<00:05:22.270> but<00:05:22.509> why<00:05:22.719> not<00:05:22.930> just<00:05:22.990> take<00:05:23.409> it<00:05:23.620> there

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
offside but why not just take it there

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.119 
offside but why not just take it there
and<00:05:24.130> cool<00:05:24.490> actually<00:05:24.699> puts<00:05:25.180> them<00:05:25.479> back<00:05:25.830> in<00:05:26.830> this

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 
and cool actually puts them back in this

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.670 
and cool actually puts them back in this
game<00:05:27.400> from<00:05:27.699> another<00:05:28.210> kick<00:05:28.509> off<00:05:28.690> in<00:05:28.930> this<00:05:29.259> am<00:05:29.500> at
