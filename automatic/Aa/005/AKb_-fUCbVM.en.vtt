to this video and I saw this Lewis in

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.880 
to this video and I saw this Lewis in
the<00:01:41.579> lane<00:01:41.819> on<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.149> side<00:01:42.569> so<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> decided<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the lane on the side so I decided to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.789 
the lane on the side so I decided to
make<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> copy<00:01:44.549> because<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.359> was<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.649> curious<00:01:46.649> on

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
make a copy because I was a curious on

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.859 
make a copy because I was a curious on
how<00:01:47.039> they<00:01:47.249> would<00:01:47.460> work<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.329> swim<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:50.869> they

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
how they would work and swim and they

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.539 
how they would work and swim and they
came<00:01:52.109> quite<00:01:52.469> easy<00:01:52.859> to<00:01:53.520> shape<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:56.039> see<00:01:56.069> that's

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
came quite easy to shape you see that's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.120 
came quite easy to shape you see that's
just<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:57.149> disc<00:01:57.889> don't<00:01:58.889> or<00:01:59.399> copped<00:02:00.709> the<00:02:01.709> copping

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
just a disc don't or copped the copping

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.819 
just a disc don't or copped the copping
shouldn't<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.609> so<00:02:02.880> much<00:02:03.229> because<00:02:04.229> then<00:02:04.679> they

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
shouldn't be so much because then they

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.600 
shouldn't be so much because then they
would<00:02:04.979> turn<00:02:05.249> over<00:02:05.819> and<00:02:06.149> flutter<00:02:07.049> hook<00:02:07.979> must<00:02:08.310> be

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
would turn over and flutter hook must be

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.260 
would turn over and flutter hook must be
fairly<00:02:09.240> large<00:02:09.690> in<00:02:10.350> case<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.400> fish<00:02:11.910> bites

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
fairly large in case the fish bites

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.089 
fairly large in case the fish bites
crosswise<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.410> he<00:02:13.620> would<00:02:13.860> still<00:02:14.190> hook<00:02:14.430> up<00:02:14.780> and

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
crosswise so he would still hook up and

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.330 
crosswise so he would still hook up and
well<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.150> see<00:02:18.329> of<00:02:18.510> me<00:02:18.749> quite<00:02:19.049> a<00:02:19.079> few<00:02:19.499> and<00:02:19.920> I'm

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
well you see of me quite a few and I'm

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.679 
well you see of me quite a few and I'm
gonna<00:02:20.549> fish<00:02:20.939> them<00:02:21.209> now<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.689> then<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:23.450> if<00:02:24.450> I

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
gonna fish them now and then and if I

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.259 
gonna fish them now and then and if I
should<00:02:24.870> catch<00:02:25.230> something<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.269> considering

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
should catch something on considering

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.559 
should catch something on considering
about<00:02:27.659> making<00:02:28.409> a<00:02:28.620> tutorial<00:02:28.950> video<00:02:29.700> about<00:02:30.239> how

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
about making a tutorial video about how

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.949 
about making a tutorial video about how
to<00:02:30.599> make<00:02:30.840> these<00:02:31.379> at<00:02:31.650> homes<00:02:31.950> at<00:02:32.849> home<00:02:33.209> which

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
to make these at homes at home which

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.069 
to make these at homes at home which
will<00:02:34.260> be<00:02:34.590> about<00:02:35.250> copper<00:02:35.730> sheet<00:02:36.060> only<00:02:36.359> because

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
will be about copper sheet only because

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.800 
will be about copper sheet only because
stainless<00:02:37.709> steel<00:02:38.010> sheet<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:39.090> very<00:02:39.329> hard<00:02:39.689> to

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
stainless steel sheet is very hard to

stainless steel sheet is very hard to
work<00:02:40.079> on<00:02:40.349> at<00:02:40.530> home<00:02:40.799> I'm<00:02:42.079> shaping<00:02:43.079> them<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:44.250> my

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
but copper soft you could do it at home

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.990 
but copper soft you could do it at home
shouldn't<00:02:52.650> be<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.769> problem<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:53.669> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
the swimming hat you see the way it

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.880 
the swimming hat you see the way it
rocks<00:03:22.950> back<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:24.269> forth<00:03:24.799> as<00:03:25.799> a<00:03:25.860> very<00:03:26.459> strong

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
rocks back and forth as a very strong

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.350 
rocks back and forth as a very strong
we<00:03:28.490> go

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.050 

if<00:03:33.660> this<00:03:33.900> video<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.440> not<00:03:34.710> going<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.580> turn<00:03:35.850> out

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
if this video is not going to turn out

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.290 
if this video is not going to turn out
well

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
well

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.350 
well
I'd<00:03:37.780> also<00:03:38.260> do<00:03:38.440> a

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
I'd also do a

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:49.630 
I'd also do a
the<00:03:39.690> boss<00:03:39.930> top<00:03:40.380> display

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.220 

I<00:03:49.670> hope<00:03:49.850> you<00:03:50.030> can<00:03:50.270> see<00:03:50.510> something

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.059 

make<00:03:53.800> quite<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.190> few<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.730> these<00:03:54.970> schools

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
make quite a few of these schools

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.550 
make quite a few of these schools
because<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.610> accent<00:03:58.270> really<00:03:58.420> convinced<00:03:59.230> me

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.750 

and<00:04:02.950> what<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.190> found<00:04:04.020> these<00:04:05.100> 1.5<00:04:06.100> millimeter

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
and what I found these 1.5 millimeter

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.040 
and what I found these 1.5 millimeter
thick<00:04:07.180> ones<00:04:07.620> they<00:04:08.620> really<00:04:09.069> stay<00:04:09.430> deep<00:04:09.780> by<00:04:10.780> what

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
thick ones they really stay deep by what

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.180 
thick ones they really stay deep by what
shallow<00:04:11.500> volumes

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
shallow volumes

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.220 
shallow volumes
I<00:04:12.280> gotta<00:04:12.520> make<00:04:12.850> them<00:04:13.060> off<00:04:13.300> maybe<00:04:13.540> only<00:04:13.900> one

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
I gotta make them off maybe only one

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.500 
I gotta make them off maybe only one
millimeter<00:04:14.500> Seto

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
millimeter Seto

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.530 
millimeter Seto
last<00:04:17.200> one<00:04:17.770> I<00:04:17.800> guess<00:04:18.340> you<00:04:18.520> can<00:04:18.730> see<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.120> action

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
last one I guess you can see the action

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.180 
last one I guess you can see the action
quite<00:04:19.810> well<00:04:20.050> now

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
quite well now

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.630 
quite well now
if<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.670> pull<00:04:22.970> it<00:04:23.150> fast<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.840> was<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:25.340> will

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
if you pull it fast that was it will

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
if you pull it fast that was it will
stop<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.480> wobble<00:04:27.400> but<00:04:28.400> dot<00:04:28.850> upward<00:04:29.480> or

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
stop to wobble but dot upward or

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.360 
stop to wobble but dot upward or
downward<00:04:30.220> so<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:31.280> should<00:04:31.760> do

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.130 

changing<00:04:35.370> a<00:04:36.080> tweet<00:04:37.080> was<00:04:37.410> changing<00:04:38.010> cases

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
changing a tweet was changing cases

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.230 
changing a tweet was changing cases
pausing<00:04:40.140> it<00:04:40.320> letting<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.860> job<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.220> salary<00:04:42.000> it

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
pausing it letting a job a salary it

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.029 
pausing it letting a job a salary it
again

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
again

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.929 
again
so<00:04:44.610> I'm<00:04:44.879> pretty<00:04:45.119> much<00:04:45.800> pretty<00:04:46.800> much<00:04:47.099> convinced

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:47.939 
so I'm pretty much pretty much convinced

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:52.710 
so I'm pretty much pretty much convinced
that<00:04:47.999> these<00:04:48.360> would<00:04:48.719> catch<00:04:49.680> something

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.980 

I<00:04:52.810> was<00:04:53.560> concerned<00:04:54.430> that<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:55.030> big<00:04:55.240> hooks<00:04:55.600> might

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
I was concerned that the big hooks might

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.310 
I was concerned that the big hooks might
fall<00:04:56.770> was<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.460> leader<00:04:57.730> when<00:04:58.120> casting<00:04:58.810> because

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
fall was the leader when casting because

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.190 
fall was the leader when casting because
I<00:04:59.770> need<00:05:00.040> a<00:05:00.070> fairly<00:05:00.970> big<00:05:01.210> hook<00:05:01.540> because<00:05:01.750> the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
I need a fairly big hook because the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.250 
I need a fairly big hook because the
spoon<00:05:02.500> is<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:02.770> wide<00:05:03.460> is<00:05:03.790> 2<00:05:04.030> inches<00:05:04.480> wide<00:05:04.720> 50

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
spoon is so wide is 2 inches wide 50

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.920 
spoon is so wide is 2 inches wide 50
millimeters<00:05:07.110> casting<00:05:08.110> performance<00:05:08.830> is<00:05:09.930> not

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
millimeters casting performance is not

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.140 
millimeters casting performance is not
that<00:05:11.410> good

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.590 

it's<00:05:15.690> still<00:05:16.050> manageable

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
it's still manageable

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
it's still manageable
main<00:05:18.320> thing<00:05:18.650> is<00:05:18.890> that<00:05:18.920> it<00:05:19.340> doesn't<00:05:19.580> tangle<00:05:20.000> or

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
main thing is that it doesn't tangle or

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:26.110 
main thing is that it doesn't tangle or
fouls<00:05:21.620> to<00:05:21.830> either<00:05:22.480> okay<00:05:24.430> here's<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.550> smaller

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
fouls to either okay here's a smaller

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.410 
fouls to either okay here's a smaller
version<00:05:26.870> of<00:05:27.020> this<00:05:27.440> disc<00:05:27.860> school

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
version of this disc school

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.770 
version of this disc school
millimeters<00:05:29.720> in<00:05:30.230> diameter<00:05:30.440> of<00:05:31.390> 1<00:05:32.390> millimeter

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
millimeters in diameter of 1 millimeter

stainless steel sheet

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.890 
stainless steel sheet
so<00:05:36.069> let's<00:05:36.400> see<00:05:36.610> if<00:05:36.759> I<00:05:36.910> could<00:05:37.150> capture<00:05:37.449> the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
so let's see if I could capture the

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.119 
so let's see if I could capture the
action

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:39.129 
action

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.909 
action
you<00:05:39.669> see<00:05:39.939> it<00:05:40.059> rocks<00:05:40.419> very<00:05:40.749> nice<00:05:41.199> at<00:05:41.499> the<00:05:41.529> slow

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
you see it rocks very nice at the slow

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.720 
you see it rocks very nice at the slow
speed

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.770 

rocks<00:05:49.360> back<00:05:49.720> and<00:05:49.750> forth

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
rocks back and forth

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.610 
rocks back and forth
you<00:05:52.170> can<00:05:52.410> retrieve<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:53.100> spoons<00:05:53.460> very<00:05:53.850> slow

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.450 

but<00:05:59.100> could<00:06:00.030> steer<00:06:00.419> something<00:06:00.960> up<00:06:01.110> today

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
but could steer something up today

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.390 
but could steer something up today
and<00:06:02.729> sexes<00:06:03.630> are<00:06:03.840> very<00:06:04.080> reluctant<00:06:04.560> my<00:06:05.130> wife

caught a few carp over there but only

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.620 
caught a few carp over there but only
because<00:06:08.250> he<00:06:08.310> was<00:06:08.699> lucky<00:06:09.000> to<00:06:09.740> meet<00:06:10.740> the<00:06:11.039> bunch

disk schools I call them
that's<00:06:38.760> not<00:06:39.030> easy<00:06:39.300> to<00:06:39.600> display

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.450 

but<00:06:44.570> the

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.230 

-<00:06:48.030> lens<00:06:48.330> diameter<00:06:48.720> ones<00:06:49.520> they<00:06:50.520> really<00:06:50.940> stay

deep

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940

so<00:06:55.180> do<00:06:55.600> skew<00:06:56.050> casts<00:06:56.740> was<00:06:56.980> this<00:06:57.190> small<00:06:57.580> one

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
so do skew casts was this small one

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.110 
so do skew casts was this small one
and<00:06:59.690> then<00:07:00.050> I'll<00:07:00.289> switch<00:07:00.710> lures<00:07:01.250> to<00:07:01.430> crankbaits

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
and then I'll switch lures to crankbaits

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.260 
and then I'll switch lures to crankbaits
or<00:07:02.360> something<00:07:02.840> I'm<00:07:03.680> very<00:07:04.130> sure<00:07:04.490> that<00:07:04.520> one<00:07:05.000> day

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
or something I'm very sure that one day

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.249 
or something I'm very sure that one day
I<00:07:05.300> would<00:07:05.509> catch<00:07:05.990> on<00:07:06.259> these<00:07:06.580> this<00:07:07.750> you<00:07:08.750> see<00:07:08.990> this

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:09.259 
I would catch on these this you see this

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:15.000 
I would catch on these this you see this
small<00:07:09.590> one<00:07:09.860> runs<00:07:10.160> very<00:07:10.460> shallow

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.870 

if<00:07:15.490> you<00:07:15.730> speed<00:07:16.090> up<00:07:16.120> the<00:07:16.570> pace<00:07:17.220> it<00:07:18.220> will<00:07:18.550> turn<00:07:18.850> on

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 
if you speed up the pace it will turn on

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.540 
if you speed up the pace it will turn on
its<00:07:19.240> back<00:07:19.540> and<00:07:19.780> glide

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:21.550 
its back and glide

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.540 
its back and glide
so<00:07:22.060> as<00:07:22.690> I<00:07:22.930> said<00:07:23.259> before<00:07:23.500> you<00:07:23.919> should<00:07:23.949> change

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
so as I said before you should change

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:27.570 
so as I said before you should change
the<00:07:25.080> cases<00:07:26.080> of<00:07:26.259> retreats<00:07:26.830> to<00:07:27.160> get<00:07:27.400> an

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:27.580 
the cases of retreats to get an

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.310 
the cases of retreats to get an
attractive<00:07:28.530> swimming<00:07:29.530> pattern

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:31.320 
attractive swimming pattern

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.080 
attractive swimming pattern
