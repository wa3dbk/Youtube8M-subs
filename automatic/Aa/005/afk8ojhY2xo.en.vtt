00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.000
 now very good friends pablo martÃ­nez 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.469
 I'm the guy who makes the website is 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.120
 of computer technical support blog 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.610
 dedicated to the administration of networks and 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.080
 of computer systems and good block 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.330
 where you can find many videos 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.099
 and many articles to train you and 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.110
 learn the subject will be at the station 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.940
 of networks and servers according 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.520
 in principle all the information there 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.410
 Here it's free, it 's through the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.420
 you can catch the youtube channel of 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.309
 here of the articles but good if 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.560
 you have some duric or loose out there and what 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.420
 you want 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.580
 to invest in this blog let's say 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.080
 some way or you want to compensate the blog 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.390
 for everything it offers you here 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.790
 you have an eurico a month you make a 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.840
 donation of one euro or 50,000 what 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.970
 you see what is loose in the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.010
 portfolio or else you can also 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.170
 throwing a pack of videotutorials is worth a 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.880
 course in the course of virtualbox a 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.770
 Office contact management course 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.310
 2010 windows 7 etc. etcetera 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.080
 etc 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.580
 which is what the subject of 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.470
 share on social networks too 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.620
 it's very important we go with the topic that 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.620
 It concerns us 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.060
 the functional level that is the level 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.930
 functional functional active directory the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.610
 active level of active directory 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.470
 therefore determines the functional level of 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.270
 directory 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.460
 the capabilities that this has 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.120
 directory this a little bit more 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.350
 explained folksy level 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.479
 functional determines the operating system 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.040
 more prehistoric no older than 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.860
 we are going to have circling around the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.479
 domain by the forest of levels 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.430
 functional we can have two we can 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.670
 have functional level of the forest that 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.640
 can be 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.930
 older and we can not have the level 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.070
 domain functional 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.810
 well the functional level of the forest as 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.729
 I say determines the functional level more 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.140
 under the entire structure of active 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.170
 directory and the functional level of 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.000
 domain may be superior to the forest 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.430
 ok but can not be less than the 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.290
 forest now if the functional level of 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.590
 all the forest is windows server 2003 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.780
 windows server 2008 without functional level 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.990
 of the forest is 2008 that of the domain has 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:12.450
 to be 2008 2008 r2 or server 8 is not worth 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.370
 it can be 2003 or 2007 according 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.080
 then we start from that clear point the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.810
 functional level of the forest determines the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.820
 basic functional level of all the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.640
 structure if the functional level of the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.410
 forest is windows server 2008 r2 no 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.750
 domain of the forest may be windows 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.670
 server 2008 and windows server 2003 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.440
 not so if the windows and the level 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.330
 forest functional the windows server 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.650
 2000 the domain so it may be 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.710
 2003 2008 2008 r2 observer 8 in which 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.810
 OK touch after we have another 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.450
 point if the functional level of the domain 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.459
 is windows server 2003 all 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.170
 servers that are part of that 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.680
 domain that are added there will have 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.980
 have to be at least the functional level of 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.870
 that domain 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.690
 of agreement they will have to have minimum the 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.330
 same level works 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.720
 in agreement 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.700
 well how do we change how we configure the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.280
 functional level at functional level or 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.810
 we can modify the domain from here 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.120
 of active users and teams 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.430
 directory we give you here right button 5 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.750
 raise the functional level of the domain of 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.050
 agreement 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.820
 or we can also from the consolidated 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.250
 is of domain and confidence of active 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.840
 directory so here we have to raise 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.490
 the functional level of the forest and we have 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.670
 to raise the functional level of 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.099
 domain 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.569
 at the functional level of the domain because it 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.030
 we give properties to the domain we have 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.890
 here windows 2000 native is worth 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.380
 I have commented before 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.569
 you can put the functional level of 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.620
 domain above the forest but the 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.230
 of the forest can not be above 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.810
 from the domain of agreement let's see 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.190
 let's do a test I'm going to go 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.870
 to the domain and I will raise the level 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.640
 functional domain is valid for 2003 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.330
 to elevate 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.580
 we accept and accept 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.470
 if now I go here I go to properties 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.430
 we see that the functional level of the domain 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.500
 is 2003 and the forest is 2000 we see 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.790
 that we have and that domain is allowed 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.580
 functional level of the forest can be 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.460
 inferior to what may be anterior high to 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.350
 functional level of the domain 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.060
 okay because I know there are 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.040
 backwards compatibility but towards 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.730
 go ahead and not like the forest is behind 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.890
 of the domain when being on the forest the 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.060
 domain yes you can communicate with the 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.040
 forest 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.720
 but the forest 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.020
 with the rest of the forest domains 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.020
 sorry 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.750
 let's see we raise the functional level 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.070
 of the forest now we come here raise the 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.540
 functional of the forest and we see that we have 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.280
 windows server 2003 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.190
 I'm going to try windows server 2008 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.870
 I give him to raise and he tells me this change 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.370
 affects the entire forest once it has 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.139
 elevated in functional level of the forest is 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.090
 possible that I can not reverse it very well 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.680
 we will accept 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.889
 functional level was increased 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.090
 correctly new functional level is 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.860
 will replicate on each domain controller 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.240
 of active forest directory time 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.979
 necessary to complete the replication 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.610
 it will depend on its topology we are going to 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.560
 accept and we come here we come to 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.900
 properties and we see that 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.139
 automatically when raising the level 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.160
 functional of the forest above the 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.320
 domain has updated all levels 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.020
 functional elements of the active structure 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.669
 directory 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.530
 we have seen yes we can maintain a 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.750
 lower level in the forest but not in 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.659
 I repeat the domain many times to see 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.030
 if you learn in agreement the forest can 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:38.770
 be less than the domain is worth for 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.939
 that you understand it in the sense that the 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.249
 functional level and other characteristics 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:43.779
 well, that every 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.149
 there is documentation to fill 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.199
 Exactly of all editions 

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:48.699
 will try to leave some link in which 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.259
 come specified but I would not be surprised 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.330
 if you come here to raise the level 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.310
 functional help 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.699
 so here you will have butter 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.699
 I imagine 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.140
 at the current functional level of the domain 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.240
 2008 delivered interface 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.380
 there will be documentation that I will look for 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.950
 Over there 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:13.290
 important thing if we increase the 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.730
 functional level of the forest domain 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.380
 we can not go back 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.140
 it means that if later we have 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.820
 think for example we put a 2008 r2 in 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.480
 the domain we configure as a level 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.760
 Functional domain r2 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.830
 of 2008 r2 when we try to put a 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.390
 2003 or a 2008 will not let us go 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.960
 to say that it is not compatible or what 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.759
 be 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.950
 It's a mistake that it's not that it's not 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.170
 generated 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.570
 and good friends well with this I'm going to 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.100
 let me think that writing in a 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.410
 text we will see it better at least already 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.540
 we have seen the practical way how 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.190
 carries out the theme of raising the level 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.430
 functional well of the forest or of the 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.280
 domain with windows server 2008 r2 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.990
 agreement 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.880
 with this I say goodbye in the next 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.889
 video I hope you 're liking the 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.680
 videos is this and leave me comments 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:02.360
 and share them out there on facebook 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.360
 opinion come friends see you later
