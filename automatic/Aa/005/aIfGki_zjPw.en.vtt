00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.130 

I

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:02.140 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:14.880 

you

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:14.890 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.560 

we're<00:00:15.040> in<00:00:15.160> a<00:00:15.220> financial<00:00:15.460> bust<00:00:16.030> and<00:00:16.300> I<00:00:16.360> think

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
we're in a financial bust and I think

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.170 
we're in a financial bust and I think
you<00:00:16.690> agree<00:00:16.900> with<00:00:17.050> me<00:00:17.200> when<00:00:17.230> I<00:00:17.410> say<00:00:17.680> that<00:00:18.180> what

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
you agree with me when I say that what

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.210 
you agree with me when I say that what
would<00:00:19.330> be<00:00:19.480> your<00:00:19.510> sense<00:00:20.080> as<00:00:20.320> to<00:00:20.350> how<00:00:20.860> long<00:00:21.010> it's

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
would be your sense as to how long it's

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.310 
would be your sense as to how long it's
going<00:00:21.400> to<00:00:21.520> be<00:00:21.790> before<00:00:22.270> this<00:00:22.570> financial<00:00:23.080> bust

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
going to be before this financial bust

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.790 
going to be before this financial bust
you<00:00:23.800> know<00:00:23.890> ends<00:00:24.340> and<00:00:24.550> economic<00:00:25.119> activity

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
you know ends and economic activity

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800 
you know ends and economic activity
that's<00:00:26.800> more<00:00:27.100> normal<00:00:27.520> starts<00:00:27.910> to<00:00:28.060> resume<00:00:28.390> is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
that's more normal starts to resume is

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.750 
that's more normal starts to resume is
this<00:00:29.050> something<00:00:29.260> that<00:00:29.380> is<00:00:29.860> coming<00:00:30.250> sooner<00:00:30.700> is

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
this something that is coming sooner is

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.070 
this something that is coming sooner is
it<00:00:30.880> going<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.090> be<00:00:31.180> a<00:00:31.210> few<00:00:31.419> years<00:00:31.630> yet<00:00:31.900> or

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
it going to be a few years yet or

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.650 
it going to be a few years yet or
perhaps<00:00:32.560> even<00:00:32.770> longer<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.370> wish<00:00:34.210> I<00:00:34.300> could<00:00:34.450> be<00:00:34.570> an

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
perhaps even longer I wish I could be an

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.410 
perhaps even longer I wish I could be an
optimist<00:00:35.110> James<00:00:35.440> but<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:36.340> problem<00:00:37.150> is<00:00:37.240> our

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
optimist James but the problem is our

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.100 
optimist James but the problem is our
policymakers<00:00:38.410> don't<00:00:39.100> really<00:00:42.840> understand<00:00:43.840> the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
policymakers don't really understand the

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.390 
policymakers don't really understand the
discipline<00:00:44.620> that's<00:00:44.800> required<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.370> I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
discipline that's required and I

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.670 
discipline that's required and I
understand<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.600> position<00:00:46.840> that<00:00:47.289> they're<00:00:47.500> in

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
understand the position that they're in

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.060 
understand the position that they're in
because<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:49.510> Henry<00:00:50.079> kaufman<00:00:50.590> said<00:00:50.620> at<00:00:50.949> our

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
because as Henry kaufman said at our

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
because as Henry kaufman said at our
symposium<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.930> in<00:00:53.109> 1999<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.160> he<00:00:54.430> was<00:00:54.609> asked

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
symposium back in 1999 and he was asked

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.819 
symposium back in 1999 and he was asked
you<00:00:55.570> know<00:00:55.600> what<00:00:55.960> we<00:00:56.079> should<00:00:56.260> do<00:00:56.379> about<00:00:56.410> it

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
you know what we should do about it

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.819 
you know what we should do about it
today<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:58.000> he<00:00:58.210> said<00:00:58.570> he<00:00:59.289> looked<00:00:59.530> at<00:00:59.679> the

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
today and and he said he looked at the

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.279 
today and and he said he looked at the
interviewer<00:01:00.370> in<00:01:00.489> his<00:01:00.640> eye<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:01.090> he<00:01:01.210> said<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
interviewer in his eye and he said the

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.490 
interviewer in his eye and he said the
Fed<00:01:02.620> missed<00:01:03.010> its<00:01:03.219> timing<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.930> in<00:01:05.050> other<00:01:05.199> words

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
Fed missed its timing so in other words

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.640 
Fed missed its timing so in other words
the<00:01:06.100> Fed<00:01:06.400> had<00:01:06.700> screwed<00:01:07.090> up<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:07.570> badly<00:01:07.900> even

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
the Fed had screwed up so badly even

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.300 
the Fed had screwed up so badly even
from<00:01:08.890> 1996-99<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:11.260> know<00:01:11.380> by<00:01:11.620> not<00:01:11.860> doing<00:01:12.100> the

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
from 1996-99 you know by not doing the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.730 
from 1996-99 you know by not doing the
right<00:01:12.340> thing<00:01:12.730> earlier<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.600> not<00:01:14.170> you<00:01:14.710> know

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
right thing earlier and not you know

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.590 
right thing earlier and not you know
imposing<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.760> discipline<00:01:16.330> that<00:01:16.360> was

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
imposing the discipline that was

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.740 
imposing the discipline that was
required<00:01:17.080> back<00:01:17.830> earlier<00:01:18.400> and<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:19.150> what<00:01:19.570> do<00:01:19.659> you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
required back earlier and so what do you

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.140 
required back earlier and so what do you
must<00:01:20.020> be<00:01:20.140> thinking<00:01:20.350> today<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.670> know<00:01:21.759> after

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
must be thinking today you know after

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.440 
must be thinking today you know after
another<00:01:22.750> 12<00:01:23.350> years<00:01:24.130> of<00:01:24.400> kicking<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.210> can<00:01:25.390> down

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
another 12 years of kicking the can down

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.800 
another 12 years of kicking the can down
the<00:01:25.720> road<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.820> essentially<00:01:27.820> enacting<00:01:28.540> all

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
the road and essentially enacting all

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.580 
the road and essentially enacting all
the<00:01:29.200> wrong<00:01:29.409> policies<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:30.899> creating<00:01:31.899> more<00:01:32.259> and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
the wrong policies and creating more and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.749 
the wrong policies and creating more and
more<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.250> more<00:01:33.549> you<00:01:34.270> know<00:01:35.280> reckless<00:01:36.280> credit

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
more and more you know reckless credit

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.289 
more and more you know reckless credit
extension<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:38.020> know<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:38.500> makes<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.579> the

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
extension you know it makes the the

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.200 
extension you know it makes the the
aftermath<00:01:41.140> all<00:01:41.439> the<00:01:41.710> worse<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.460> therefore<00:01:42.670> I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
aftermath all the worse and therefore I

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.209 
aftermath all the worse and therefore I
feel<00:01:43.780> for<00:01:44.110> them<00:01:44.290> because<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:45.219> the<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:46.180> the

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
feel for them because that the that the

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.440 
feel for them because that the that the
hangover<00:01:48.219> that<00:01:48.700> we're<00:01:48.850> going<00:01:48.939> to<00:01:49.000> have<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.299> go

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
hangover that we're going to have to go

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.870 
hangover that we're going to have to go
through<00:01:49.479> is<00:01:50.200> going<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.619> be<00:01:50.770> so<00:01:51.130> pronounced<00:01:51.579> and

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
through is going to be so pronounced and

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.850 
through is going to be so pronounced and
so<00:01:52.240> ugly<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:54.280> just<00:01:54.670> boggles<00:01:55.329> my<00:01:55.689> mind<00:01:55.719> yeah<00:01:56.469> the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
so ugly it just boggles my mind yeah the

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.590 
so ugly it just boggles my mind yeah the
best<00:01:57.130> way<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.340> prepare<00:01:57.579> for<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:57.969> as<00:01:58.390> an

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
best way to prepare for that as an

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.800 
best way to prepare for that as an
individual<00:01:59.229> would<00:01:59.469> be<00:01:59.770> to<00:02:00.240> own<00:02:01.240> gold<00:02:01.570> and

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
individual would be to own gold and

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.410 
individual would be to own gold and
silver<00:02:02.110> well<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:02.799> think<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.369> reduce<00:02:04.210> your

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
silver well I think to reduce your

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.090 
silver well I think to reduce your
equity<00:02:04.899> exposure<00:02:05.409> own<00:02:06.159> gold<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:07.030> silver<00:02:08.100> you

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
equity exposure own gold and silver you

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.550 
equity exposure own gold and silver you
know<00:02:09.220> protect<00:02:10.180> yourself<00:02:10.690> as<00:02:11.020> best<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.440> can

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
know protect yourself as best you can

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
actually took the interest I think your

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.500

account<00:04:35.680> at<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.550> end<00:04:36.670> of<00:04:36.730> the<00:04:36.850> year<00:04:37.030> in<00:04:37.150> effect

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
account at the end of the year in effect

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.420 
account at the end of the year in effect
but<00:04:37.750> I<00:04:38.080> read<00:04:38.680> in<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:38.890> paper<00:04:38.980> this<00:04:39.370> morning

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
but I read in the paper this morning

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.110 
but I read in the paper this morning
that<00:04:39.970> I<00:04:40.960> think<00:04:41.800> was<00:04:41.890> Mellon<00:04:42.220> Bank<00:04:42.370> back<00:04:42.910> in<00:04:43.030> New

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
that I think was Mellon Bank back in New

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.210 
that I think was Mellon Bank back in New
York<00:04:43.270> Mellon<00:04:43.420> that<00:04:43.720> was<00:04:44.500> starting<00:04:44.890> to<00:04:44.980> impose

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
York Mellon that was starting to impose

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.980 
York Mellon that was starting to impose
large<00:04:45.520> fees<00:04:45.790> if<00:04:45.970> you're<00:04:46.120> looking<00:04:46.450> for<00:04:46.480> safety

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
large fees if you're looking for safety

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.910 
large fees if you're looking for safety
because<00:04:47.200> they're<00:04:47.320> viewed<00:04:47.560> as<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.710> custodian

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
because they're viewed as a custodian

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.560 
because they're viewed as a custodian
bank<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.670> didn't<00:04:48.850> have<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:49.000> lot<00:04:49.120> of<00:04:49.150> credit

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
bank it didn't have a lot of credit

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.890 
bank it didn't have a lot of credit
exposure<00:04:49.930> so<00:04:50.710> you've<00:04:50.830> really<00:04:51.010> got<00:04:51.250> some

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
exposure so you've really got some

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.930 
exposure so you've really got some
really<00:04:52.900> weird<00:04:53.260> things<00:04:53.620> happening<00:04:54.580> which<00:04:54.790> I

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
really weird things happening which I

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.060 
really weird things happening which I
guess<00:04:55.120> is<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.330> sign<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.740> things<00:04:56.740> are<00:04:56.890> spinning

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
guess is a sign that things are spinning

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.520 
guess is a sign that things are spinning
out<00:04:57.340> of<00:04:57.370> control
