00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
in many ways reacting against the very

there was that first kind of wave of
Pacific<00:00:31.769> Islanders<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:32.880> very<00:00:33.149> few<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.450> them

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
Pacific Islanders but very few of them

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.810 
Pacific Islanders but very few of them
was<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> much<00:00:34.680> smaller<00:00:34.890> university<00:00:35.670> at<00:00:35.730> that

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
was a much smaller university at that

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.810 
was a much smaller university at that
point<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.390> after<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.020> 1950s<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.040> 60s<00:00:38.070> when

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
point but after the 1950s and 60s when

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.990 
point but after the 1950s and 60s when
the<00:00:39.090> university<00:00:39.600> itself<00:00:39.870> grew<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:41.579> Pacific

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
the university itself grew the Pacific

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790 
the university itself grew the Pacific
population<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.780> all<00:00:42.870> Clinton<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.290> growing<00:00:43.559> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
population of all Clinton is growing and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.209 
population of all Clinton is growing and
so<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.670> big<00:00:44.850> change<00:00:45.149> there<00:00:45.480> was<00:00:46.100> just<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
so the big change there was just a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.220 
so the big change there was just a
massive<00:00:47.460> increase<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.000> numbers<00:00:48.539> particularly

future it's not quite what it should be

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.229 
future it's not quite what it should be
and<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.019> think<00:03:34.189> the<00:03:35.189> university<00:03:35.790> knows<00:03:36.000> this

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
and I think the university knows this

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.020 
and I think the university knows this
but<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.840> some<00:03:37.019> ways<00:03:37.579> the<00:03:38.579> face<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.970> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
but in some ways the face of the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.180 
but in some ways the face of the
university<00:03:39.510> should<00:03:39.569> be<00:03:39.720> looking<00:03:40.530> forward<00:03:40.799> so

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
university should be looking forward so

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.240 
university should be looking forward so
it<00:03:42.000> has<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.360> look<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.840> how<00:03:43.349> things<00:03:43.650> will<00:03:43.829> be<00:03:43.890> in

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
it has to look to how things will be in

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.910 
it has to look to how things will be in
a<00:03:44.340> generation<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.870> think<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.680> know<00:03:46.739> that's

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
a generation and I think you know that's

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.890 
a generation and I think you know that's
a<00:03:47.040> job<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.400> university<00:03:47.909> takes<00:03:48.180> seriously<00:03:48.720> and

a job the university takes seriously and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.720 
a job the university takes seriously and
as<00:03:48.989> always<00:03:49.140> working<00:03:49.590> towards<00:03:49.769> this<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.549> like

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
as always working towards this is like

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.789 
as always working towards this is like
like<00:03:51.599> Harvard<00:03:51.989> for<00:03:52.140> example<00:03:52.500> they've<00:03:52.620> had

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
very great leaders of those universities

have to struggle that much I mean when

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.150 
have to struggle that much I mean when
you<00:04:22.079> get<00:04:22.410> people<00:04:22.560> from<00:04:22.860> very<00:04:23.070> different

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
you get people from very different

you get people from very different
backgrounds<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:24.030> put<00:04:24.150> them<00:04:24.300> together<00:04:24.449> in<00:04:25.260> an

environment<00:04:25.530> that's<00:04:25.979> about<00:04:26.340> discovering<00:04:27.120> and

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
environment that's about discovering and

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.719 
environment that's about discovering and
about<00:04:27.710> trying<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.860> understand<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.400> patterns

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
about trying to understand the patterns

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.060 
about trying to understand the patterns
of<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:29.940> world<00:04:30.150> which<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.110> what<00:04:31.289> we<00:04:31.620> all<00:04:31.740> do<00:04:31.949> in

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
of the world which is what we all do in

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.839 
of the world which is what we all do in
the<00:04:32.160> university<00:04:32.449> you<00:04:33.449> get<00:04:34.130> different<00:04:35.130> ways<00:04:35.610> of

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
the university you get different ways of

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.480 
the university you get different ways of
knowing<00:04:36.410> engaging<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.770> ways<00:04:38.039> that<00:04:38.250> can<00:04:38.370> be

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
knowing engaging in ways that can be

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.730 
knowing engaging in ways that can be
extremely<00:04:39.060> productive<00:04:39.419> and<00:04:39.900> very<00:04:40.380> creative

extremely productive and very creative

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.110 
extremely productive and very creative
and<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.960> think<00:04:43.289> a<00:04:43.590> great<00:04:44.340> University<00:04:44.970> will

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
and and I think a great University will

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.620 
and and I think a great University will
understand<00:04:45.599> that<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:45.960> always<00:04:46.199> pursue<00:04:46.560> it
