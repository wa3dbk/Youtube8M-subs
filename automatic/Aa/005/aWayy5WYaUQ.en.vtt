00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.890 
crazy you're hiding what something looks
like<00:06:18.770> but<00:06:19.370> when<00:06:19.490> you<00:06:19.520> remove<00:06:19.940> it<00:06:20.090> you<00:06:20.479> can<00:06:20.600> see

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
like but when you remove it you can see

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.840 
like but when you remove it you can see
exactly<00:06:21.350> what<00:06:21.800> it<00:06:21.950> looks<00:06:22.160> like<00:06:22.310> and<00:06:22.550> I<00:06:22.580> think

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
exactly what it looks like and I think

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.909 
exactly what it looks like and I think
as<00:06:22.970> a<00:06:23.000> country<00:06:23.419> we're<00:06:23.570> falling<00:06:24.020> in<00:06:24.110> love<00:06:24.380> with
