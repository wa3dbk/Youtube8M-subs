so<00:06:27.820> we<00:06:28.000> have<00:06:28.120> tritter<00:06:28.360> scare<00:06:28.630> to<00:06:28.750> do<00:06:28.840> that<00:06:29.020> and

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
so we have tritter scare to do that and

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.890 
so we have tritter scare to do that and
transfer<00:06:30.699> just<00:06:30.910> really<00:06:31.120> helps<00:06:31.360> against<00:06:31.780> the
