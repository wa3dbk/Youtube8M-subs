00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.180
 Disney present are welcome to this 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.160
 video and I very very fast halo 2 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.259
 anniversary where we will find 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.389
 all terminals there is one per mission 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.610
 and good, we start with the first 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.920
 fallen station is in this part 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.660
 exactly where we kill these two 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.360
 propellers and the left side is 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.460
 background to the left side and basically it 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.800
 will download the highland if it is 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.510
 still do not have because that's where 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.220
 we can see the cinematics and everything 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.619
 that offers us this and good is the 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.019
 terminal number 2 is in the mission the 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.640
 outskirts is in this part can get 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.760
 obviously with the cart with a cause 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.409
 as it is and there is a this little house is almost 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.350
 of chiquita and well inside in 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.600
 we found the second terminal the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.489
 terminal number 3 is the mission of 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.649
 metropolis and flights before just 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.659
 before arriving with the ska there was almost 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.370
 end of the mission and here in that part 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.260
 the Marines are there, it's just there 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.699
 back is too easy to 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.399
 find it is very hidden that 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.499
 let's say the part of 14 the terminal 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.720
 number 4 rather it is from the inquisitor the 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:06.760
 mission of the inquisitor is in this part 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.630
 where are these coils that can 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.310
 exploit 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.350
 the blue river that I like 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.780
 call it and well is the background the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.430
 right up to the top that like 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.500
 you can see it you can pause the video or 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.530
 something if they do not know the location very well 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.780
 but it's very simple in what the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.000
 terminal number 5 is the oracle in this 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.500
 part where you get a good afloat so 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.630
 it's only here back back uncover 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.030
 she is a bit hidden because 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.689
 It's not like you put that wall 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.020
 mission 6 of the suit and ends on the 6th 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.209
 instead of the buttons where you activate the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.439
 bridge because it's on the side just what 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.420
 from left that this the button where 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.310
 we activate a bridge and developed 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.459
 the terminal is terminal number 6 very 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.030
 simple very easy to find mission 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.890
 to start this is the terminal number 7 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.270
 and well basically it 's next to the side 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.310
 of what has become the prophet 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.229
 totally this is the same very easy to 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.289
 find even though it's almost at the end of 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.299
 the mission and with the sacred the mission and 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.770
 let's find the terminal number 8 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.349
 in that part where you see a very landscape 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.210
 very own is up here back is the 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.130
 true 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.440
 but very hidden is very difficult to 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.290
 find her because you usually follow 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.540
 heston in quarantine and good the terminal 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.610
 number 9 is in the first part where 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.890
 we found these ship crap 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.510
 and you are once already finishing of 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.250
 killed in the carts and good until 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.780
 down here just below the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.580
 right side down is the first 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.680
 fourth that we are 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.680
 grapevine in this and I recommend that 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.270
 follow this path so to speak it is 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.880
 in the first courtyard that we are 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.620
 already happening as half of the mission and 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.020
 well we will find it until 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.360
 racing is before the start of the 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.670
 steel I'm going to the left since 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.830
 we found the terminal something simple 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.590
 but they have to know exactly the 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.840
 place rise of the mission and we're going to 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.640
 find in terminal number 11 is in 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.050
 the part of the pillars where they come out 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.330
 the viruses and all this already almost also 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.860
 to determine the mission and basically 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.930
 is here here behind this pillar 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.520
 so this is very very simple 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.410
 It is also easy to find something to 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.760
 unless you spend a great time running 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.560
 quality I think is the simplest 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.110
 in the part where the sword is so 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.240
 I have only left and ready there 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.300
 it is as you can see it is very very 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.540
 very easy and it is the terminal number 12 and 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.130
 finally the last terminal is then in 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.590
 last mission the big trip and he 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.640
 found in one of these cells so 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.980
 I recommend you to be invisible 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.690
 they obviously shot him or something was going to 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.270
 been to the bottom just enter and 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.340
 ready if you already have all the terminals 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.780
 It will also unblock the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.250
 what they have invented for some 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.260
 strange reason for the government's achievements 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.840
 but here as you can see ready me 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.490
 unlock all the achievements themselves 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.530
 each terminal here determinant down what 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.500
 I see 5 and in the end they give you an achievement of 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.090
 20 where you unlock you all all 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.100
 all completed here we can see 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.740
 so if you liked the video, 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.360
 its like and I commented on subscribe and a 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.360
 little finger up thank you
