00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.869
 there are no doubts the emotions are the 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.930
 salt of life but you've ever wondered 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.640
 where emotions are born 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.220
 someone definitely a doctor 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.470
 will answer and what questions from the brain 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.710
 obvious someone else 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.070
 ordinary people will surely say from the heart 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.149
 who is right but above all 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.800
 let us ask ourselves what emotions are 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.700
 before attempting an answer to these 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.440
 questions 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.620
 let's find out the differences 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.380
 functional between the two organs the brain 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.780
 lives like a recluse in a box is 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.360
 defined by experts as a cold organ 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.210
 which begins its anatomical development in the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.340
 fetus but it is after birth that thanks 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.190
 to information received through i 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.790
 sensory and assimilated channels from the world 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.799
 external that evolves completely that 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.810
 saw my previous videos on 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.060
 brain knows that this organ is 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.340
 consisting of three overlaps 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.440
 phylogenetic with precise tasks 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.630
 especially voted by the party 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.460
 so-called reptilian and from the system 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.890
 limbic to survival 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.870
 individual 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.420
 however among his tasks the brain 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.520
 human also to analyze and 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.299
 elaborate the myriad of information 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.820
 coming from the outside, filtering them 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.760
 cataloging them by rearranging them not only 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.830
 whatever event happens to us in life 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.320
 must be compared with the 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.750
 past experiences to understand if the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.040
 new situation is positive or negative 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.650
 or even dangerous that's why one 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.830
 scene can be experienced in a comic way 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.310
 from one person can be source of 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.790
 anger for another or despair 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.670
 for a third the heart on its part is a 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.250
 powerful and tireless muscle and the 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.349
 first organ that forms in the fetus and al 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.799
 time of birth is already complete is 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.959
 able to perform its functions 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:16.390
 also the heart as the neocortex is 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.209
 consisting of two parts the right side 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.720
 thinner has the task of receiving the 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.180
 poor blood god 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.100
 yes geno and rich in carbon dioxide 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.160
 coming from all the organs of the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.740
 body and send it to the pulmonary artery 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.970
 to allow him to purify himself from the 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.980
 toxins and renewal of oxygen there 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.720
 the left side of the heart is more robust 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.700
 of the other because it has the task of 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.130
 receive from the pulmonary artery the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.720
 oxygenated blood and to send it 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.000
 through the horta to the areas 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.220
 body peripherals 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.940
 if the brain is considered an organ 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.520
 cold distant isolated the heart instead 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.250
 powerful and warm because the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.070
 blood not only produces a field 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.200
 electromagnetic like the brain 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.380
 only that it is 5 thousand times more powerful 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.820
 of the other then where are born 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.560
 emotions from the heart or from the brain 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.080
 the big wrong question 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.600
 neuroscientist can de spirt recently 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.820
 disappearance found that thoughts i 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.070
 feelings are mediated by substances 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.530
 brain chemistry that regulates the 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.959
 immune defenses also 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.650
 incredible was to discover that these 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.810
 Neurotransmitter chemicals 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.250
 they are not produced exclusively 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.320
 from the hypothalamus the chemical central of the 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.170
 brain but they are also produced by 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.810
 heart that has something like 40 thousand 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.450
 neurons and even those neurons that 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.110
 find their location 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.910
 in the gut 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.450
 how to say that our body possesses 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.489
 actually three brains working in 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.280
 other words we can say that the 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.519
 to a constituted physical substrate 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.560
 from the brain and body a network 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.410
 in short, psychosomatic is an immaterial one 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.489
 consisting of the flow of substances 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.150
 information that travels along 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.860
 this network the neurotransmitters 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.019
 represent the biochemical basis of 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.060
 emotions which cannot be achieved 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.450
 locate only in the area 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.100
 cerebral but throughout the body to this 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.100
 point we can conclude that the 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.410
 emotions are actual molecules e 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.450
 have great importance in the life of 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.030
 every human being 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.450
 however the problem remains open 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.790
 of how to manage them from the eighties of 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.250
 last century took hold of the 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.670
 so-called quantum medicine that does 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.590
 reference to the laws in some ways 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.570
 paradoxes of quantum physics for 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.690
 explain the miracles of the disease e 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.360
 of healing thanks to it one is 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.700
 discovered that thoughts and emotions do not 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.910
 they are only biochemical substances but 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.670
 electromagnetic vibrations to this 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.860
 dot the heart comes back into play with the 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.260
 its neural part experimental tests 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.870
 have shown that even the heart on 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.000
 brain influence each other 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.120
 from the point of view of nervous stimuli 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.290
 but that the heart sends more stimuli to the 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.540
 brain of those who actually receive it 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.640
 we saw in a previous video that 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.890
 the heart is a very oscillatory system 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.250
 powerful and that is what establishes it 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.830
 vibratory state of the organism 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.780
 feelings such as fear, anger 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.420
 depression can alter the 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.610
 our vibrational state producing a 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.320
 chaotic electromagnetic field e 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.240
 messy 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.400
 on the contrary feelings like the 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.610
 gratitude the solidarity love 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.760
 create an ordered vibrational field e 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.160
 consistent when the heart is in 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.500
 perfect balance that is in the state 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.630
 so-called coherence succeeds 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.030
 hook our brain to 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.370
 align the two hemispheres harmonizing them 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.890
 in a brain 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.320
 particular in which they are sharpened 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.600
 intuitive understanding the understanding 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.420
 creativity , wellness 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.190
 it follows that if we human beings 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.310
 we will learn to manage ours 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:15.760
 potential we will no longer experience emotions 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.710
 but we will be our emotions 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.070
 let me explain better today it's easier 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.770
 react to emotions but if we learn to 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.390
 addressing them knowingly we will be 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.520
 also able to change ours 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.860
 even physical reality 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.660
 focusing on health instead of 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.030
 on the disease 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.580
 let us allow ourselves to be guided by the heart rather than by 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:40.979
 brain and find that the mind 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.979
 neighbor of the soul is called love 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.210
 to
