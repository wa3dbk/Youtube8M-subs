00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
these so you want

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.330 
these so you want
to<00:02:13.780> see<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:13.960> quick<00:02:14.170> side<00:02:14.410> by<00:02:14.620> side<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.130> ones

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
to see a quick side by side of the ones

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.510 
to see a quick side by side of the ones
and<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.610> nine<00:02:15.820> so<00:02:16.090> there<00:02:16.210> you<00:02:16.300> go<00:02:17.340> same<00:02:18.340> color

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
and the nine so there you go same color

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.750 
and the nine so there you go same color
themes<00:02:19.060> as<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:20.620> both<00:02:20.890> sneakers<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
themes as on both sneakers the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.190 
themes as on both sneakers the
difference<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.990> material<00:02:24.750> they<00:02:25.750> used<00:02:26.020> is

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
difference is the material they used is

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.680 
difference is the material they used is
different<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.190> if<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.820> can<00:02:28.000> tell<00:02:28.180> up<00:02:28.450> close

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
different so if you can tell up close

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.860 
different so if you can tell up close
the<00:02:29.590> material<00:02:30.220> on<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.460> nines<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.940> kind<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.300> it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
the material on the nines is kind of it

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.770 
the material on the nines is kind of it
looks<00:02:32.760> reflective<00:02:33.760> but<00:02:34.180> it's<00:02:34.330> actually<00:02:34.450> not

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
looks reflective but it's actually not

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.190 
looks reflective but it's actually not
and<00:02:35.080> then<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.560> more<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.520> durable

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
and then this is more of a durable

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.400 
and then this is more of a durable
swedish<00:02:38.200> nubuck<00:02:39.130> material<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.480> once<00:02:40.690> at

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
swedish nubuck material on the once at

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.260 
swedish nubuck material on the once at
least<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:41.710> parts<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.940> interesting

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
least on parts of it so interesting

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.820 
least on parts of it so interesting
enough<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.840> looks<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.350> same<00:02:44.530> but<00:02:44.590> they're

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
enough it looks the same but they're

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.770 
enough it looks the same but they're
actually<00:02:45.010> different<00:02:45.250> materials<00:02:45.880> for<00:02:46.660> those

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
actually different materials for those

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.400 
actually different materials for those

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
punch in that that thing and so some

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.430

chance<00:03:34.360> than<00:03:34.720> they<00:03:34.870> do<00:03:35.190> so<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.220> don't<00:03:36.459> know<00:03:36.550> go

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
chance than they do so I don't know go

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:12.159 
dig about the nines is that 45 on the

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.670 
dig about the nines is that 45 on the
back<00:05:12.370> but<00:05:13.030> it<00:05:13.180> was<00:05:13.300> kind<00:05:13.479> of<00:05:13.509> cool<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.229> be<00:05:14.620> able

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
back but it was kind of cool to be able

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.960

to cut both of them it felt pretty good

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.589 
to cut both of them it felt pretty good
it<00:05:16.330> took<00:05:16.419> me<00:05:16.569> a<00:05:16.599> while<00:05:16.780> because<00:05:17.110> um<00:05:18.039> I<00:05:18.539> ended<00:05:19.539> up

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
it took me a while because um I ended up

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.870 
it took me a while because um I ended up
getting<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:19.960> ones<00:05:20.319> from<00:05:20.830> nike<00:05:21.310> store<00:05:21.550> and<00:05:21.789> it

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.430 
aired out for so long my whole thing was
I<00:05:25.360> knew<00:05:25.509> that<00:05:25.539> the<00:05:25.750> nines<00:05:25.990> were<00:05:26.169> probably
