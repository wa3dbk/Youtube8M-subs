00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.989
 but first I will tell you where we are 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.820
 we are with you under stockholm this 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.800
 one of the islands of Stockholm 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.359
 archipelago 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.659
 on which we will this knife 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:18.150
 wonderful so green practically 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:20.939
 custom handle and the same 10 do not read 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.920
 wants to focus petri approach with him 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.960
 wonderful such a handle she 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.820
 a small enough knife is very small 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.790
 as you see it fits completely my 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.070
 small palm I had to weave 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.430
 for him so shorty to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.710
 just how to keep it right away 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.310
 will show 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.930
 wedge with us let's go like this 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.759
 support 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:50.490
 klinochek we almost in the center knife 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.439
 understood once all why 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.850
 that he was very tight at the very beginning 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.390
 great just great very 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.149
 beautiful in my opinion the clip she just 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.670
 Well, she's gorgeous just nobody here 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.420
 such a cool clip there is no clip very 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.879
 soft 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.520
 but it is quite elastic sits 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.640
 on the pocket just very well removed 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.390
 wonderful how you see it 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.750
 such a kind of frame locke so much on 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.750
 the blade 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:29.320
 447 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:31.910
 here dark with the usual he is very so 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.130
 thin hamster and wheelbarrow clip can 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.810
 rearrange as you see in two 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.790
 provisions but this suits me 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.739
 initially it opened enough 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.680
 hard, that is, it was hard to open 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:51.190
 now but it opens about here 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:57.080
 so see yes that is 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:00.290
 get after the stud that's specifically me 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.420
 not easy enough I'm not used to 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.090
 I can say that it is bad or 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.500
 okay, but personally, this is mine 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.260
 I won't get used to the opinion 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.769
 but now it opens easily 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.050
 after the back again can be here 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.390
 this thumb opens 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.200
 fine 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.200
 such a little one 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.930
 him 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.549
 working surface 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:34.190
 a small stonewash which unfortunately 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:40.310
 I can not see right really weak and here 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:43.640
 this turned out legs shorter smoke 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.360
 You know, you probably will see better here. 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.989
 he is curtis and here she is a clip to that is 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:55.670
 roughly speaking in his hand he looks like that 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:57.470
 so here is the emphasis under the thumb here 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:02.079
 me this karatesh to keep it 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.079
 comfortable and here it is ours 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:11.630
 from got for shorty got opened 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.640
 suffered something here now we are the camera 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:20.440
 a little bit 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.440
 tilt and look at it for more 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:31.040
 comfortable see here is such a knife here 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:37.840
 the knife didn't drag anything out of the box 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.840
 such pleasant specimens were not made 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.840
 its stump storm will not spoil 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.020
 Sorry any wand me now 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:55.150
 I guess you will not find 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:57.970
 around all living knife loose enough 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:03.730
 difficult in the grass we try to thread 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:06.280
 drop dropped here so he legs in the grass like 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:11.790
 you see it is natural to lose it 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.650
 almost unreal wild 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.620
 a hamster in the wild is natural if 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:24.300
 it falls on the gray part of you 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:26.740
 so in general, it will turn out like this 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.360
 we can not say that our little can not 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.110
 say that our big is all in 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.060
 comparing 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:36.580
 and here for you to compare 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.700
 the second knife which with it 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:43.410
 small wix 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.410
 Now we will open the wedge 1 of 2 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.260
 and 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:57.180
 let's see it is clear 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:59.759
 at comparable sizes here bipper 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:04.830
 here and so it looks like a whole knife 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:06.710
 great I like it very much great 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.930
 in my opinion and disie 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:16.080
 Here is such a little nice hamster 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:21.229
 very catchy such a bill cut 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:28.620
 suffer by tradition by heart 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:31.410
 let's say this to me here it is all the same 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:36.720
 I waited for the ferry to show you 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:39.780

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.740
