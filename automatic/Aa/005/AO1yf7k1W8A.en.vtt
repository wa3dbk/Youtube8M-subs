domination<00:00:08.960> on<00:00:09.440> grid<00:00:09.770> i'm<00:00:10.010> using<00:00:10.309> the<00:00:10.400> PSG

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
domination on grid i'm using the PSG

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.060 
domination on grid i'm using the PSG
which<00:00:11.180> is<00:00:11.330> pretty<00:00:11.510> unusual<00:00:11.719> for<00:00:12.200> me<00:00:12.290> typically

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
which is pretty unusual for me typically

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.150 
which is pretty unusual for me typically
I<00:00:13.160> used<00:00:13.520> the<00:00:13.730> l<00:00:13.879> 96<00:00:14.150> exclusively<00:00:15.110> but<00:00:15.379> because

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
I used the l 96 exclusively but because

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.770 
I used the l 96 exclusively but because
this<00:00:16.309> is<00:00:16.460> ground<00:00:16.700> war<00:00:16.910> and<00:00:17.150> there's<00:00:17.600> three

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 
this is ground war and there's three

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.980 
this is ground war and there's three
extra<00:00:18.080> players<00:00:18.289> on<00:00:18.470> each<00:00:18.500> team<00:00:18.619> I<00:00:19.070> thought<00:00:19.990> the

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
extra players on each team I thought the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.570 
extra players on each team I thought the
semi-automatic<00:00:21.500> sniper<00:00:21.770> rifle<00:00:22.250> would<00:00:22.310> help

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
semi-automatic sniper rifle would help

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.310 
semi-automatic sniper rifle would help
deal<00:00:22.880> with<00:00:22.940> the<00:00:23.120> extra<00:00:23.570> people<00:00:23.840> make<00:00:24.050> things<00:00:24.230> a

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
deal with the extra people make things a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.980 
deal with the extra people make things a
bit<00:00:24.350> easier<00:00:24.530> so<00:00:25.000> yeah<00:00:26.000> generally<00:00:26.480> I<00:00:26.540> used<00:00:26.810> the

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
bit easier so yeah generally I used the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.960 
bit easier so yeah generally I used the
l<00:00:27.080> 96<00:00:27.320> exclusively<00:00:28.190> and<00:00:28.430> that's<00:00:28.640> just<00:00:28.790> because

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
l 96 exclusively and that's just because

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.380 
l 96 exclusively and that's just because
I<00:00:29.530> don't<00:00:30.530> usually<00:00:30.740> play<00:00:31.040> ground<00:00:31.310> war<00:00:31.390> usually

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
I don't usually play ground war usually

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.229 
I don't usually play ground war usually
I'd<00:00:32.870> play<00:00:33.370> peer<00:00:34.370> team<00:00:34.520> deathmatch<00:00:34.879> which<00:00:35.059> is

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
I'd play peer team deathmatch which is

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.630 
I'd play peer team deathmatch which is
66<00:00:35.870> obviously<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:36.559> there's<00:00:36.980> no<00:00:37.100> perks<00:00:37.340> kill

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
66 obviously and there's no perks kill

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.520 
66 obviously and there's no perks kill
streaks<00:00:37.850> or<00:00:38.000> weapon<00:00:38.210> attachments<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:38.840> it's<00:00:39.410> a

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
streaks or weapon attachments so it's a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.210 
streaks or weapon attachments so it's a
bit<00:00:39.680> slower<00:00:39.980> pace<00:00:40.250> not<00:00:40.640> as<00:00:40.820> much<00:00:41.920> it's<00:00:42.920> not<00:00:43.070> as

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
bit slower pace not as much it's not as

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.069 
bit slower pace not as much it's not as
hectic<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:43.790> there's<00:00:44.270> really<00:00:44.480> no<00:00:44.690> need<00:00:44.810> for<00:00:45.020> the

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
hectic so there's really no need for the

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.390 
hectic so there's really no need for the
higher<00:00:45.230> fire<00:00:45.500> rate<00:00:45.650> and<00:00:45.829> personally<00:00:46.190> I<00:00:46.250> like

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
higher fire rate and personally I like

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.010 
higher fire rate and personally I like
the<00:00:46.550> look<00:00:46.670> feel<00:00:46.880> and<00:00:46.940> sound<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.450> bolt<00:00:47.720> action

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
the look feel and sound of bolt action

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.440 
the look feel and sound of bolt action
sniper<00:00:48.110> rifles<00:00:48.560> better<00:00:48.770> but<00:00:49.210> yeah<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.239> thought

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
sniper rifles better but yeah I thought

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.910 
sniper rifles better but yeah I thought
I'd<00:00:50.570> just<00:00:50.600> throw<00:00:50.780> on<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.050> PSG<00:00:51.440> see<00:00:51.649> how<00:00:51.770> it

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
I'd just throw on the PSG see how it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.250 
I'd just throw on the PSG see how it
went<00:00:52.130> and<00:00:52.370> I<00:00:52.460> guess<00:00:52.610> this<00:00:52.790> is<00:00:52.910> a<00:00:52.940> result<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:53.540> the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
went and I guess this is a result so the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.990 
went and I guess this is a result so the
reason<00:00:54.410> I<00:00:54.590> used<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.860> play<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.040> lot<00:00:55.430> of<00:00:55.610> peer<00:00:55.850> team

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
reason I used to play a lot of peer team

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.700 
reason I used to play a lot of peer team
deathmatch<00:00:56.390> in<00:00:56.510> this<00:00:56.630> game<00:00:56.809> is<00:00:56.960> because<00:00:57.320> I

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
deathmatch in this game is because I

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.650 
deathmatch in this game is because I
didn't<00:00:58.340> like<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.610> deal<00:00:58.760> with<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.090> obviously

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
didn't like to deal with the obviously

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.729 
didn't like to deal with the obviously
perks<00:00:59.899> kill<00:01:00.140> streaks<00:01:00.380> and<00:01:00.500> weapon

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
perks kill streaks and weapon

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.530 
perks kill streaks and weapon
attachments<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:01.280> were<00:01:01.460> in<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.670> game<00:01:01.850> but

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
attachments that were in this game but

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.509 
attachments that were in this game but
now<00:01:02.750> that<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.230> lot<00:01:03.469> of<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.620> people<00:01:03.950> who<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:04.129> think

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
now that a lot of the people who I think

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.700 
now that a lot of the people who I think
used<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.149> annoying<00:01:05.479> stuff<00:01:05.810> have<00:01:06.170> moved<00:01:06.409> on<00:01:06.590> to

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
used the annoying stuff have moved on to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.550 
used the annoying stuff have moved on to
modern<00:01:06.920> warfare<00:01:07.070> 3<00:01:07.219> like<00:01:07.670> for<00:01:07.909> example<00:01:07.969> the<00:01:08.930> RC

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
modern warfare 3 like for example the RC

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.219 
modern warfare 3 like for example the RC
cars<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.880> last<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.450> those<00:01:12.080> people

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
cars and the last and those people

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.560 
cars and the last and those people
because<00:01:12.860> those<00:01:13.520> perks<00:01:13.790> are<00:01:14.000> gauged<00:01:14.210> towards

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
because those perks are gauged towards

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.660 
because those perks are gauged towards
newer<00:01:14.810> players<00:01:15.159> those<00:01:16.159> are<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.340> people<00:01:16.490> who

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
newer players those are the people who

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.620 
newer players those are the people who
aren't<00:01:16.880> really<00:01:17.090> going<00:01:17.180> to<00:01:17.270> come<00:01:17.450> back<00:01:17.570> and

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
aren't really going to come back and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.240 
aren't really going to come back and
play<00:01:17.810> old<00:01:18.080> call<00:01:18.260> of<00:01:18.350> duties<00:01:18.590> as<00:01:18.740> much<00:01:18.890> I<00:01:19.010> think

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
play old call of duties as much I think

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.420 
play old call of duties as much I think
so<00:01:19.960> as<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.080> can<00:01:21.170> see<00:01:21.350> here<00:01:21.619> almost<00:01:21.860> nobody's

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
so as you can see here almost nobody's

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.039 
so as you can see here almost nobody's
using<00:01:22.640> last<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:23.540> I<00:01:23.570> don't<00:01:23.720> think<00:01:23.900> there's

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
using last and and I don't think there's

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.250 
using last and and I don't think there's
an<00:01:24.170> RC<00:01:24.470> car<00:01:24.619> this<00:01:24.830> entire<00:01:25.130> game<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.110> I've<00:01:27.110> been

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.280 
an RC car this entire game so I've been
having<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:27.560> lot<00:01:27.650> more<00:01:27.710> fun<00:01:28.010> in<00:01:28.900> ground<00:01:29.900> war<00:01:30.080> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.990 
things I didn't like so yeah like I've
said<00:01:42.200> I've<00:01:42.409> been<00:01:42.650> playing<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.100> more<00:01:43.640> because

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
said I've been playing this more because

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.210 
said I've been playing this more because
of<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.600> things<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.110> annoy<00:01:45.619> me<00:01:45.830> not<00:01:46.010> being

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
of the things that annoy me not being

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.850 
of the things that annoy me not being
here<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:46.580> I<00:01:47.180> found<00:01:47.900> that<00:01:48.140> playing<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:48.650> game

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
here and I found that playing this game

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.740 
here and I found that playing this game
is<00:01:48.920> now<00:01:49.189> a<00:01:49.220> lot<00:01:49.700> less<00:01:49.880> stressful<00:01:50.180> because<00:01:50.509> you

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
is now a lot less stressful because you

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.399 
is now a lot less stressful because you
don't<00:01:50.930> get<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:52.729> random<00:01:53.150> deaths<00:01:53.360> from<00:01:53.720> RC<00:01:54.170> cars

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
don't get the random deaths from RC cars

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.010 
don't get the random deaths from RC cars

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
and dying trying to kill people who are

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.050 
and dying trying to kill people who are
in<00:01:57.140> last<00:01:57.350> hand<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:57.830> all<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.070> stuff<00:01:58.220> but

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
in last hand and all that stuff but

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.969 
in last hand and all that stuff but
anyways<00:01:59.630> I'm<00:01:59.780> sure<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.020> guys<00:02:00.140> are<00:02:00.500> all<00:02:00.740> aware

anyways I'm sure you guys are all aware

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.789 
anyways I'm sure you guys are all aware
that<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.729> new<00:02:01.939> map<00:02:02.630> pack<00:02:02.869> just<00:02:03.110> dropped<00:02:03.470> for

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
that the new map pack just dropped for

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.980 
that the new map pack just dropped for
modern<00:02:04.189> warfare<00:02:04.310> 3<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.640> lot<00:02:04.939> of<00:02:05.090> face<00:02:05.540> off<00:02:05.689> stuff

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
modern warfare 3 a lot of face off stuff

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.770 
modern warfare 3 a lot of face off stuff
three<00:02:06.259> new<00:02:06.350> maps<00:02:06.500> for<00:02:06.799> face<00:02:06.950> off<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.250> think

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
three new maps for face off I think

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.850 
three new maps for face off I think
three<00:02:08.780> new<00:02:08.899> maps<00:02:09.049> and<00:02:09.349> one<00:02:09.470> of<00:02:09.530> them<00:02:09.679> was

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
three new maps and one of them was

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.890 
three new maps and one of them was
terminal<00:02:10.700> 4<00:02:10.849> modern<00:02:11.000> warfare<00:02:11.090> 2<00:02:11.390> brought<00:02:11.720> back

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
terminal 4 modern warfare 2 brought back

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.320 
terminal 4 modern warfare 2 brought back
into<00:02:12.110> modern<00:02:12.409> warfare<00:02:12.530> 3<00:02:12.650> but<00:02:13.459> then<00:02:14.090> bringing

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
into modern warfare 3 but then bringing

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.820 
into modern warfare 3 but then bringing
back<00:02:14.540> terminal<00:02:14.930> actually<00:02:15.230> got<00:02:15.380> me<00:02:15.470> thinking

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
back terminal actually got me thinking

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.380 
back terminal actually got me thinking
about<00:02:15.950> what<00:02:16.280> they're<00:02:16.400> going<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.550> do<00:02:16.700> for<00:02:17.150> black

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
about what they're going to do for black

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.440 
about what they're going to do for black
ops<00:02:17.510> 2<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:17.930> terms<00:02:18.110> of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
ops 2 in terms of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.479 
ops 2 in terms of
maps<00:02:19.080> from<00:02:19.379> previous<00:02:19.830> call<00:02:19.980> beauties<00:02:20.280> into

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
maps from previous call beauties into

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.559 
maps from previous call beauties into
black<00:02:20.670> ops<00:02:20.879> 2<00:02:21.060> maybe<00:02:21.300> as<00:02:21.420> DLC<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:23.269> honestly<00:02:24.269> I

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
black ops 2 maybe as DLC and honestly I

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.420 
black ops 2 maybe as DLC and honestly I
would<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.170> like<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.500> see<00:02:25.739> them<00:02:25.980> bring<00:02:26.220> this

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
would really like to see them bring this

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.699 
would really like to see them bring this
map<00:02:26.670> into<00:02:26.970> black<00:02:27.150> ops<00:02:27.360> 2<00:02:27.629> like<00:02:28.260> they<00:02:28.410> did<00:02:28.560> with

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
map into black ops 2 like they did with

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.830 
map into black ops 2 like they did with
terminal<00:02:29.220> into<00:02:29.489> modern<00:02:29.700> warfare<00:02:29.849> 3<00:02:30.000> because

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
terminal into modern warfare 3 because

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.420 
terminal into modern warfare 3 because
this<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.110> definitely<00:02:31.530> my<00:02:31.560> favorite<00:02:31.980> map<00:02:32.160> in

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
this is definitely my favorite map in

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.600 
this is definitely my favorite map in
black<00:02:33.239> ops<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.110> think<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.709> if<00:02:35.400> they're

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
black ops and I think that if they're

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.280 
black ops and I think that if they're
gonna<00:02:35.730> bring<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.120> map<00:02:36.300> from<00:02:36.660> black<00:02:36.900> ops<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
gonna bring a map from black ops in the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.559 
gonna bring a map from black ops in the
black<00:02:37.440> ops<00:02:37.650> 2<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.280> would<00:02:38.459> be<00:02:39.120> my<00:02:39.540> first

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
black ops 2 this would be my first

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.330 
black ops 2 this would be my first
choice<00:02:39.930> it'd<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.709> close<00:02:40.950> call<00:02:41.130> though

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
choice it'd be a close call though

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.089 
choice it'd be a close call though
between<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:41.849> Hanoi<00:02:42.330> array<00:02:43.319> and<00:02:43.650> summit<00:02:44.010> I

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
between this Hanoi array and summit I

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.800 
between this Hanoi array and summit I
think<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.849> most<00:02:45.030> people<00:02:45.150> don't<00:02:45.420> really<00:02:45.660> like

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
think and most people don't really like

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.330 
think and most people don't really like
array<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.049> think<00:02:46.319> because<00:02:46.590> they<00:02:46.739> feel<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.130> slow

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
array I think because they feel it slow

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.369 
array I think because they feel it slow
pace<00:02:47.549> but<00:02:47.849> in<00:02:48.000> my<00:02:48.480> opinion<00:02:48.599> all<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.049> action

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
pace but in my opinion all the action

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.850 
pace but in my opinion all the action
happens<00:02:49.410> like<00:02:49.860> on<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.190> side<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.580> map<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:50.970> i

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
happens like on one side of the map so i

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.039 
happens like on one side of the map so i
personally<00:02:52.860> like<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.220> but<00:02:53.459> anyways<00:02:54.330> um<00:02:54.630> one<00:02:55.019> of

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
personally like it but anyways um one of

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.289 
personally like it but anyways um one of
the<00:02:55.140> problems<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.590> have<00:02:55.620> with<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.920> PSG<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.579> I

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
the problems I have with the PSG and I

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.640 
the problems I have with the PSG and I
guess<00:02:57.540> I'd<00:02:57.690> never<00:02:57.959> really<00:02:58.170> realized<00:02:58.380> this

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
guess I'd never really realized this

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.600 
guess I'd never really realized this
because<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> never<00:02:59.099> use<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.489> psg<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.030> um<00:03:01.610> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
because I never use the psg is um the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.800 
because I never use the psg is um the
amount<00:03:02.819> of<00:03:02.910> bullets<00:03:03.180> they<00:03:03.269> give<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.630> just

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
amount of bullets they give you is just

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.750 
amount of bullets they give you is just
ridiculous<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.590> think<00:03:04.829> they<00:03:05.010> give<00:03:05.610> you

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
ridiculous like I think they give you

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.430 
ridiculous like I think they give you
nowhere<00:03:06.060> near<00:03:06.329> as<00:03:06.450> many<00:03:06.630> bullets<00:03:06.989> as<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.200> should

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
nowhere near as many bullets as I should

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.770 
nowhere near as many bullets as I should
and<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.980> keep<00:03:08.519> on<00:03:08.700> having<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.299> pick<00:03:09.450> up<00:03:09.599> new

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
and I keep on having to pick up new

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.430 
and I keep on having to pick up new
weapons<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:11.690> even<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:12.810> game<00:03:13.049> isn't<00:03:13.230> that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
weapons and I even this game isn't that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.720 
weapons and I even this game isn't that
great<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.739> an<00:03:13.829> example<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.250> that<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.430> think<00:03:14.670> I

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
great of an example of that I think I

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.759 
great of an example of that I think I
only<00:03:14.849> pick<00:03:15.060> up<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.360> other<00:03:15.510> guns<00:03:15.750> but<00:03:16.049> some

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
only pick up to other guns but some

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.259 
only pick up to other guns but some
games<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.190> just<00:03:17.400> found<00:03:17.519> myself<00:03:17.730> having<00:03:18.090> to

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
games I just found myself having to

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.420 
games I just found myself having to
constantly<00:03:18.540> go<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.500> find<00:03:19.739> weapons<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.370> die

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
constantly go and find weapons and I die

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.030 
constantly go and find weapons and I die
because<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.090> because<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:22.410> keep<00:03:22.889> on

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
because of it because I I keep on

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.400 
because of it because I I keep on
running<00:03:23.310> out<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.430> bullets<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.180> guess<00:03:24.630> you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
running out of bullets and I guess you

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.140 
running out of bullets and I guess you
could<00:03:25.440> say<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.769> should<00:03:26.040> run<00:03:26.220> scavenger<00:03:26.790> but<00:03:26.940> the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
could say I should run scavenger but the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.509 
could say I should run scavenger but the
thing<00:03:27.359> about<00:03:27.500> black<00:03:28.500> ops<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.889> that<00:03:29.130> for<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
thing about black ops is that for the

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.670 
thing about black ops is that for the
first<00:03:29.730> here<00:03:30.030> perk<00:03:30.329> slot<00:03:30.480> they<00:03:31.139> make<00:03:31.319> you<00:03:31.440> pick

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
think I'm really using ghost like a

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.980 
think I'm really using ghost like a
bitch<00:03:38.820> like<00:03:38.970> some<00:03:39.210> people<00:03:39.450> do<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.600> don't<00:03:39.840> think

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
bitch like some people do I don't think

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.480 
bitch like some people do I don't think
it's<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.170> big<00:03:40.290> deal<00:03:40.350> in<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.800> situation<00:03:41.070> but

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
it's a big deal in this situation but

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.310 
it's a big deal in this situation but
you'll<00:03:42.120> see<00:03:42.300> in<00:03:42.390> this<00:03:42.480> game<00:03:42.720> I<00:03:42.750> get<00:03:43.020> a<00:03:43.050> death

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
saddle striking off in a spawn and I'll

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.650 
saddle striking off in a spawn and I'll
point<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:47.850> out<00:03:47.970> when<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.180> happens<00:03:48.450> but<00:03:48.600> i

mean<00:03:48.870> i'm<00:03:49.710> not<00:03:49.860> using<00:03:50.040> ghost<00:03:50.490> like<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.700> bitch

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
mean i'm not using ghost like a bitch

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.820 
mean i'm not using ghost like a bitch
i'm<00:03:51.090> using<00:03:51.330> it<00:03:51.420> because<00:03:51.510> in<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.500> ground<00:03:52.680> war

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
i'm using it because in a ground war

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.440 
i'm using it because in a ground war
situation<00:03:53.370> which<00:03:53.640> i<00:03:53.850> don't<00:03:53.910> usually<00:03:54.120> play

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
situation which i don't usually play

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.080 
situation which i don't usually play
ground<00:03:54.690> with<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:54.960> much<00:03:55.140> um<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:56.640> chances<00:03:57.060> of

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
ground with that much um the chances of

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.420 
ground with that much um the chances of
them<00:03:57.330> not<00:03:57.600> having<00:03:57.630> UAV<00:03:58.350> is<00:03:58.590> really<00:03:59.130> slim

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
them not having UAV is really slim

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.400 
them not having UAV is really slim
because<00:03:59.670> when<00:04:00.420> there's<00:04:00.570> nine<00:04:00.780> people<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.320> all

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
because when there's nine people and all

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.350 
because when there's nine people and all
it<00:04:01.530> takes<00:04:01.710> is<00:04:01.830> three<00:04:02.130> kills<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.520> believe<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:03.240> get

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
it takes is three kills I believe to get

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.440 
it takes is three kills I believe to get
a<00:04:03.390> UAV<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:05.160> know<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.520> basically<00:04:06.120> gonna<00:04:06.270> be

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
a UAV you know it's basically gonna be

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.750 
a UAV you know it's basically gonna be
UAV<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.230> whole<00:04:07.380> game<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.800> I<00:04:07.980> think<00:04:08.640> it's

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
UAV for the whole game and I think it's

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.150 
UAV for the whole game and I think it's
kind<00:04:09.030> of<00:04:09.150> fair<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.630> avoid<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.740> with<00:04:10.890> ghosts

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
kind of fair to avoid that with ghosts

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.470 
kind of fair to avoid that with ghosts
and<00:04:12.980> before<00:04:13.980> scavenger<00:04:14.580> I'd<00:04:14.730> want<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.060> use<00:04:15.270> a

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
and before scavenger I'd want to use a

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.140 
and before scavenger I'd want to use a
flak<00:04:15.780> jacket<00:04:15.810> actually<00:04:16.320> because<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:17.150> the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
flak jacket actually because of the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.360 
flak jacket actually because of the
people<00:04:18.420> who<00:04:18.540> fill<00:04:19.440> me<00:04:19.530> with<00:04:19.590> explosives<00:04:20.190> I'm

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
people who fill me with explosives I'm

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.490 
people who fill me with explosives I'm
like<00:04:20.580> my<00:04:21.090> first<00:04:21.299> death<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.720> believe<00:04:21.959> what<00:04:22.109> was<00:04:22.440> a

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
like my first death I believe what was a

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.990 
like my first death I believe what was a
new<00:04:22.770> tube<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.190> then<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.310> respond<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.850> died

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
new tube and then I respond and died

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.360 
new tube and then I respond and died
from<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.300> jeep<00:04:24.480> exploding<00:04:24.990> like<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.410> could<00:04:26.250> have

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
from a jeep exploding like I could have

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.860 
from a jeep exploding like I could have
used<00:04:26.490> flak<00:04:27.000> jacket<00:04:27.360> in<00:04:27.420> this<00:04:27.510> game<00:04:27.690> definitely

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
used flak jacket in this game definitely

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.980 
used flak jacket in this game definitely
and<00:04:28.320> I<00:04:28.910> don't<00:04:29.910> know<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.180> just<00:04:30.419> kind<00:04:30.750> of<00:04:30.810> sucks

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
and I don't know it just kind of sucks

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.090 
and I don't know it just kind of sucks
that<00:04:31.140> they<00:04:31.290> don't<00:04:31.470> give<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.650> enough<00:04:31.740> bullets

that they don't give you enough bullets

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.430 
that they don't give you enough bullets
with<00:04:32.280> the<00:04:32.400> PSG<00:04:32.910> like<00:04:33.240> in<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:33.660> modern<00:04:34.320> warfare

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
with the PSG like in and modern warfare

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.110 
with the PSG like in and modern warfare

3 they give you so many bullets and you
don't<00:04:36.270> even<00:04:36.360> have<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.630> worry<00:04:36.810> about<00:04:36.990> it<00:04:37.230> but<00:04:37.440> I

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
don't even have to worry about it but I

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.650 
don't even have to worry about it but I
don't<00:04:38.610> know<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:38.760> just<00:04:38.820> wish<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.390> could

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
don't know I just wish that you could

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.210 
don't know I just wish that you could
spawn<00:04:40.200> with<00:04:40.350> more<00:04:40.530> bullets<00:04:40.770> in<00:04:40.860> this<00:04:40.980> without

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
spawn with more bullets in this without

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.790 
spawn with more bullets in this without
having<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.820> use<00:04:42.450> scavenger<00:04:42.990> over<00:04:43.290> ghosts<00:04:43.560> or

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
having to use scavenger over ghosts or

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.870 
having to use scavenger over ghosts or
or<00:04:44.190> a<00:04:44.510> flak<00:04:45.510> jacket<00:04:45.540> but<00:04:46.370> anyways<00:04:47.370> yeah<00:04:47.580> this

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
or a flak jacket but anyways yeah this

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.360 
or a flak jacket but anyways yeah this
is<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.330> think<00:04:48.660> a<00:04:49.110> pretty<00:04:49.350> decent<00:04:49.800> game<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:50.190> only

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
is I think a pretty decent game the only

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.159 
is I think a pretty decent game the only
thing<00:04:50.550> is<00:04:50.580> I<00:04:50.910> get<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.150> bunch<00:04:51.480> of<00:04:51.600> death<00:04:51.810> set

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
and you know I knew this was gonna be a

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.490 
and you know I knew this was gonna be a
game<00:05:11.130> plan<00:05:11.630> because<00:05:12.630> right<00:05:12.810> here<00:05:12.960> i<00:05:13.140> think<00:05:13.410> i

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
game plan because right here i think i

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.090 
game plan because right here i think i
already<00:05:13.620> have<00:05:13.830> 84<00:05:14.190> kills<00:05:14.490> and<00:05:15.620> somehow<00:05:16.620> i<00:05:16.770> just

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
already have 84 kills and somehow i just

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.310 
already have 84 kills and somehow i just
keep<00:05:17.310> on<00:05:17.490> dying<00:05:17.700> and<00:05:18.150> it's<00:05:18.419> really<00:05:18.690> stupid<00:05:18.990> i

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
keep on dying and it's really stupid i

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.560 
keep on dying and it's really stupid i
think<00:05:19.680> that<00:05:20.640> kid<00:05:20.790> with<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:20.940> dragon<00:05:21.240> off<00:05:21.330> kills

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
think that kid with the dragon off kills

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.110 
think that kid with the dragon off kills
me<00:05:21.720> again<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.950> when<00:05:23.220> it's<00:05:23.370> like<00:05:23.669> starts<00:05:24.000> to

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
me again and when it's like starts to

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.810 
me again and when it's like starts to
lag<00:05:24.330> it's<00:05:24.960> just<00:05:25.290> really<00:05:25.860> bad<00:05:26.100> luck<00:05:26.400> one<00:05:26.610> bad

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
lag it's just really bad luck one bad

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.340 
lag it's just really bad luck one bad
thing<00:05:26.850> after<00:05:27.150> another<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:27.720> i<00:05:27.870> end<00:05:27.990> up<00:05:28.050> getting

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
thing after another and i end up getting

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.920 
thing after another and i end up getting
10<00:05:28.560> deaths<00:05:28.800> so<00:05:29.130> obviously<00:05:29.910> 10<00:05:30.450> death<00:05:30.660> isn't

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
10 deaths so obviously 10 death isn't

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.010 
10 deaths so obviously 10 death isn't
really<00:05:31.590> ideal<00:05:31.860> for<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.160> gameplay<00:05:32.580> but<00:05:32.850> I<00:05:33.150> mean

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
really ideal for a gameplay but I mean

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.270 
really ideal for a gameplay but I mean
the<00:05:34.169> deaths<00:05:34.380> weren't<00:05:34.560> really<00:05:34.770> my<00:05:34.919> fault<00:05:35.130> I

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
the deaths weren't really my fault I

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.380 
the deaths weren't really my fault I
don't<00:05:35.430> really<00:05:35.580> feel<00:05:35.820> like<00:05:35.850> I<00:05:36.030> could<00:05:36.090> have<00:05:36.270> done

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
don't really feel like I could have done

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.230 
don't really feel like I could have done
much<00:05:36.570> about<00:05:36.840> it<00:05:36.990> so<00:05:37.910> except<00:05:38.910> right<00:05:39.030> there<00:05:39.210> I

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
much about it so except right there I

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.460 
much about it so except right there I
wasn't<00:05:39.510> paying<00:05:39.720> attention<00:05:39.840> to<00:05:40.169> the<00:05:40.229> flags

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
wasn't paying attention to the flags

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.950 
wasn't paying attention to the flags
like<00:05:40.740> they<00:05:40.919> clearly<00:05:41.220> had<00:05:41.520> um<00:05:41.820> what<00:05:42.720> is<00:05:42.840> that
