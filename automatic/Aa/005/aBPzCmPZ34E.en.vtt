00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello everyone i'm coming back today 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.299
 for a nice video so today this 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.470
 will still be a good video this is 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.900
 a good plan that is not the least 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.190
 since it's a video where I'm going to 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.450
 present the duke of the pallet 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.190
 chocolate baird at all fai not 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.340
 cracked for chocolate birch chokes 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.189
 is simply because it does not 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.900
 did not interest me and so when betty 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.189
 lately told me listen loulou if you 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.570
 do not have joe cole albert there is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.610
 one who is totally his duke I you the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 advice I saw the swatch of the blow on 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.910
 internet and I thought why not 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 especially at the price where it costs 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.860
 it's a palette that costs 9 euros 90 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.489
 so much to tell you that it's great 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.270
 interesting 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.820
 it is four times cheaper than the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.129
 chocolate berre and especially she is 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.530
 ultra pigmented she is not very 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.360
 powdery I made up all 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 summer with this palette is simple 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.890
 I brought back this one is a small 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.829
 from home to fight and finally I'm 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.570
 do not know I could not do it my lover 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.369
 get by actually I thought but 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.439
 hand this pallet in the final I like 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.840
 so I'm really happy to have it 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.540
 paid only 9 euros 90 and that's the mark 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.509
 aloft make-up so you have 16 blush to 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.640
 eyelids and so it's the world 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.990
 chocolate at the packaging level as 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.140
 you can see it so it's 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.939
 little chocolate tiles that's 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.799
 plastic do not expect a 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.290
 packaging that's it's still done 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.750
 it's not that it's cheap it's solid 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.860
 but here it is not the super materials 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.960
 if we can say that like that 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 inside this palette you have 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.490
 so a little plastic film with all 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.240
 the names of dumps keep them but 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.890
 I wish it because 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.659
 frankly it's boring and at 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.549
 inside the palette you have a 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.930
 big mirror so very practical is 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.899
 really the mirror he takes all the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.619
 pallet and then you have the headlights 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.530
 and a little booth that fell 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.810
 so the only thing that tell me he 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.460
 change from chocolate baer 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.469
 from all buttocks you know they have 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.719
 simply reversed these two lighthouses 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.820
 there normally you have this lighthouse here 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.439
 with the chocolate berre and get there 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.810
 there they are just the inverted so I 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.310
 do not know why but here it is 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.099
 exactly 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.770
 almost the same thing frankly to 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.390
 the yeah I watched the swatch on 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.550
 internet since I do not have the palette 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.640
 I looked at the wedges on the internet and 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.430
 honestly I have not seen any difference 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.099
 maybe this one and again and again 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.170
 Frankly the rest I have not seen more than 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.849
 difference we'll go to swatch and 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.349
 then I'll tell you where you can 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.550
 you likely how the present 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.920
 palette I show it to you anyway 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.819
 I think it's the most 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:46.470
 interesting so then this one there 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.910
 this one are a little dusty then 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.340
 you have this one as well as a little bit 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.630
 powdery but frankly 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.810
 finally here's what but look at me this 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.069
 this crazy pigmentation I wanted 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.819
 either play fair because frankly 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.340
 it's just a hit what's it 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.560
 a crazy thing but anyway the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.950
 be frozen or you will follow so 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.660
 that's how the palette here is 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.110
 I'm taking you there is actually both 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.170
 leiter there the big bottom right and the 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.209
 lite the math key actually lifted jma 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.820
 you 're here then it's really in 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.400
 order so see it's hyper hyper 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.810
 spicy then these two lighthouses there and a 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.940
 last I showed you are a 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.200
 little powdery I do not know if 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.319
 it's due to glitter or what but 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.709
 frankly see it fades very well 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.380
 and that's how presents itself 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.359
 swatch is the one that is a little powders 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.040
 it's this one too but frankly 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.500
 here you are tapping your brush it is 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.569
 hyper pigmented it will put tremendously 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.700
 eyes to blue eyes in value 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.370
 everything is a dish for blue eyes 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.690
 It's just wonderful 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.220
 so here you have the little pale pink 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.410
 here I do not know if he'll take out the camera 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.489
 but it is well pigmented but that's it 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.530
 how is the palette 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.450
 frankly there's nothing to say I think 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.000
 that she has nothing to finally I'm even 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.319
 sure she has nothing to take away from envy 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.200
 sorry to the 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.379
 Joe Cole is father of all feist and you 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:17.250
 have as you can see a two 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:19.289
 three four five six games 7 matt 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.780
 so on ceze lighthouse you still have 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.610
 seven games so plenty of what to do 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.310
 what I find unfortunate is that there 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.099
 there are no black lights, but there you go 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.530
 it's the basis a good chocolate can 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:34.110
 to say dark chocolate but hey there is one 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.220
 there who is very dark so I did not 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.419
 not many wish at home but you 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.289
 can really have something 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.120
 very dark with this one so that's it 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.099
 think the swatch speak for themselves 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.710
 I'm wearing makeup today 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.800
 so with this palette there I have everything 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.210
 simply used in the hollow sorry 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.690
 in the broad hollow 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.389
 I used that and used this rape 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.229
 and lara and in point of light I 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.340
 used this golden brown that absolutely 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.139
 told me to make up that is enough 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.789
 loaded but here with an eyeliner 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.380
 quite busy but I wanted to 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.419
 I wanted that not wrong as I 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.599
 wanted 17 pl is there I paid them 9 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.840
 90 euros and I take them on the site of 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:18.810
 maquis alia here and it seems to me that he 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.580
 there was 3 euros 99 or 4 euros 90 of 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.690
 shipping so it happens from spain 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.030
 and then I've never seen a site that 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.710
 deliver fast as I believe that 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.930
 I was delivered in two to three days 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.250
 something like that maxi knowing 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.130
 it's a truck that ties you see 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.539
 the little writing finally the follow-up the follow-up 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.620
 of the command and you see the little 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.810
 truck every time where is it 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.370
 I find it rather nice is really 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.789
 on this site there are small 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.409
 wonders 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.169
 but gaudet that's it I think I'm you 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.070

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.410
