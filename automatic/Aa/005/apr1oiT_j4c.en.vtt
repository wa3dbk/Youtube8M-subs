in her attacking gameplay typically the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.350 
in her attacking gameplay typically the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
most of her attacks over the stuff

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.520 
most of her attacks over the stuff
through<00:01:12.570> ball<00:01:12.689> down<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> wing<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.229> she's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
through ball down the wing and she's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
through ball down the wing and she's
just<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.890> try<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.040> sprint<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.060> score

goal<00:01:15.570> you're<00:01:15.960> probably<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.350> score<00:01:16.560> more<00:01:16.799> but

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
goal you're probably to score more but

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.710 
goal you're probably to score more but
you<00:01:17.280> concede<00:01:17.580> once<00:01:18.090> you're<00:01:18.360> typically

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
you concede once you're typically

successful match over Jesse all starts

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.190 
successful match over Jesse all starts
with<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> defense<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.960> said<00:01:25.170> previously

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
with the defense as I said previously

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.560 
with the defense as I said previously
I'm<00:01:25.890> expecting<00:01:26.400> her<00:01:26.520> place<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> five<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I'm expecting her place of five of the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600 
I'm expecting her place of five of the
back<00:01:27.720> formations<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.799> might<00:01:28.950> also<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
back formations so you might also use a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.219 
back formations so you might also use a
433<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.720> gives<00:01:30.869> her<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> best

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
433 that gives her the best

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.749 
433 that gives her the best
counter-attacking<00:01:31.619> option<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.579> wing

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
counter-attacking option for the wing

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
counter-attacking option for the wing
fling<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.960> overcome<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.860> that's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
fling and if you overcome it that's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.230 
fling and if you overcome it that's
where<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.460> punished<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:36.060> where<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
where you get punished that's where a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.929 
where you get punished that's where a
