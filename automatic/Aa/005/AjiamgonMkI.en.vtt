 I'm going down to the coffee with Calita. 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:19.039
 Kalita is characterized by the fact that there are three new holes under the feature. 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:22.070
 Since they are made in Japan and they come up and down , 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:28.009
 Technology is getting a lot of impact. 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:33.320
 He filters are used in the form of a filter is to bite the bottom of urinary Date 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:35.800
 So, after you take a look at the side and put it down , 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.800
 Please 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.239
 The filter of Adleaf is able to draw more delicious coffee for close contact 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.929

 You can give yourself a lot of this . 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:57.019
 You can also use it after you pour the water.

 And you can get rid of the static electricity and help the ground coffee . 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:06.130

 Let's get it sorted. 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:16.240
 And put it on the server. 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:20.439
 The server should be so that farmers kkomi and glass graduated iteoyaji 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.250
 Because you know how much coffee I've got. 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:30.459
 Use a server with eye dreams on that server. 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:36.600
 Present temperature in water and use about 90 degrees of water 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:36.600
 If the water temperature is too high , it can be poured into the server 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:45.670
 After covering the lid, hold your posture comfortably and bend your waist slightly 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.670
 You'll have to look good. 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.250
