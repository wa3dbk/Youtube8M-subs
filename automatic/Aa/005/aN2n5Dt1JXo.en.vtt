00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 hey people get back just like today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.400
 is about fkg traction and that is what I have 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.010
 for that the new adidas it here 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.230
 The new LEDs are a first 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.420
 football school are equipped with the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.060
 f gag note system 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.760
 the special thing about the new system is 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.019
 the fg stands for ahead that is for 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.570
 grass pitches and ag for artificial turf pitches 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:30.660
 thus preserves a combination of old 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.430
 slightly longer lure elements and 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.380
 short curls elements so that the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.960
 shoes played on the artificial turf field 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.360
 be allowed and on the normal 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.030
 lawn place so far was a fg shoes 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.879
 exclusively for grass pitches and ag 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.789
 shoes for the artificial turf are now all 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.860
 FKG shoes free for both places 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.160
 small tip 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.100
 the ace uses a system with 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.629
 Small round curls element as you like 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.000
 it can also be seen right here 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.239
 front area which is especially good 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.870
 for older and a little harder 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.119
 artificial turf pitches are suitable 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.340
 by that considerably attract more 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.340
 are applied 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.310
 and then there is the adidas tax at all 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.880
 the sex comes to the explorer system 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.540
 commitment 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.310
 that also fgh ag is that is the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.869
 shoes are for artificial turf and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.560
 lawn areas released 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.540
 the somewhat significantly longer and about 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.200
 or slightly longer cam elements 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.880
 however, are particularly suitable for 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.530
 artificial turf pitches of the newer generation 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.900
 that means already right ones 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.189
 Half elements are used and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.329
 rather less for artificial turf pitches 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.060
 older generation 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.920
 You can both football boots 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.170
 However, on the artificial turf and the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.990
 hard place ask the recommendation however 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.700
 fkg is harder in the ace 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.780
 artificial turf and older 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.570
 artificial turfs to play the total 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.930
 are and speak to the older generation 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.090
 who play as ex on the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.369
 artificial turf pitches of the new generation 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.819
 Both of them, as I said, for grass pitches 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.379
 ask for 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:18.510
 to the fbg construction or adidas asics 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.510
 let the communes have until then
