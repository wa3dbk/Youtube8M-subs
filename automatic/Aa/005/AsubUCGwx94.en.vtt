00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.910 
than shoulder width apart now the actual
pull<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.689> with<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.930> grip<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.470> your<00:01:55.500> palms

shoulder width the difference is the
chin-ups<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.570> little<00:02:03.869> bit<00:02:03.990> easier<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.680> it's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
chin-ups a little bit easier and it's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.889 
chin-ups a little bit easier and it's
going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.340> work<00:02:05.520> your<00:02:05.700> biceps<00:02:05.909> more<00:02:06.570> because

in this position you're going to engage
these<00:02:08.640> biceps<00:02:08.910> more

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
these biceps more

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
chin up and we're going to work our way

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.890 
chin up and we're going to work our way
up<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.710> pull-up<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.940> we're<00:02:18.480> going<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.780> do

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
up to the pull-up so we're going to do

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.290 
up to the pull-up so we're going to do
this<00:02:19.110> by<00:02:19.380> using<00:02:19.620> just<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.070> bar<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.030> don't

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
this by using just a bar so you don't

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.180 
this by using just a bar so you don't
need<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.450> lot<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.690> equipment<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.410> we're<00:02:23.010> going

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
need a lot of equipment and we're going

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.900 
need a lot of equipment and we're going
to<00:02:23.250> use<00:02:23.520> a<00:02:23.820> chair<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:26.040> begin<00:02:26.190> with<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.670> chin

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
to do what's called a negative so step

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.470 
to do what's called a negative so step
one<00:02:31.950> we're<00:02:32.130> going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> do<00:02:32.490> negative<00:02:32.790> chin-ups

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
the bar and to do this we're going to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.600 
the bar and to do this we're going to
start<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:42.989> our<00:02:43.200> chin<00:02:43.470> above<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.920> bar<00:02:44.130> you're

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610

step off lower yourself nice slow and
control<00:02:51.239> as<00:02:51.709> slowly<00:02:52.709> as<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.570> then<00:02:54.570> when

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
control as slowly as you can then when

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.090 
control as slowly as you can then when
you're<00:02:54.780> all<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.020> way<00:02:55.110> down<00:02:55.350> we're<00:02:55.890> going<00:02:56.040> to

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
you're all the way down we're going to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.460 
you're all the way down we're going to
do<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.340> again<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:58.440> want<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.920> do<00:02:59.100> 10<00:02:59.910> of

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
do it again and I want you to do 10 of

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.250 
do it again and I want you to do 10 of
these<00:03:01.470> negative<00:03:02.250> channels<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.870> you're

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
these negative channels and you're

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.590 
these negative channels and you're
probably<00:03:08.040> not<00:03:08.610> going<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.940> be<00:03:09.060> able<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.390> lower

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
begin but that's okay you can build on

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.550 
begin but that's okay you can build on
that<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:20.090> once<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.239> hit<00:03:21.480> 10<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.470> these

that and once you hit 10 of these
negative<00:03:23.070> reps<00:03:23.310> you're<00:03:24.000> going<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.239> take<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.420> one

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
negative reps you're going to take a one

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.660 
negative reps you're going to take a one
minute<00:03:24.900> rest<00:03:25.049> break<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.799> then<00:03:26.430> you're<00:03:26.549> going

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
minute rest break and then you're going

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.210 
minute rest break and then you're going
to<00:03:26.730> do<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.090> again<00:03:27.720> one<00:03:28.590> minute<00:03:28.860> rest<00:03:28.980> break

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
to do that again one minute rest break

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.240 
to do that again one minute rest break
do<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.180> again<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:30.660> three<00:03:31.019> sets<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.590> 10

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
do it again so three sets of 10

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.310 
do it again so three sets of 10
negatives<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:32.910> that's<00:03:33.450> step<00:03:33.780> one<00:03:34.049> we're

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
negatives and that's step one we're

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.590 
negatives and that's step one we're
going<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.560> continue<00:03:34.709> doing<00:03:35.130> step<00:03:35.610> one<00:03:35.940> doing
