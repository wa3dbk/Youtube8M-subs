 Germany had the operating system Android 2 2 and 1 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.259
 and especially this is also the leak fast 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.880
 because the aluminum housing is milled from a block 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.369
 that is a title meter and also no screws 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:25.949
 it really is appoint 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.319

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.330
 find 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.800
 Here he puts the sender unit, like for example it 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.530
 voters 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.210
 then you will also get the 5-megapixel camera here 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.680
 and down here 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.760
 Did you notice then you have at various slots for example for the El 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.900
 Negro sd card or the sim card and the fetuses also placed the battery 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.700
 Included is an 8 gigabyte 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.530
 Nico sd card 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.020
 and "If I'm in the plane business, you can barely get in with just three 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.760
 2 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 big around AMOLED display 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.410
 that even in Qatar jumps to the usual one then 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.149
 but also only these three buttons operated 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.000
 and now has as a special renewal 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.540
 for an optical mouse 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.540
 On the one hand, we still have two buttons for the volume 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.530
 and otherwise 4 million more room eleven percent more space 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.590
 So the connection for a track make Lehmann 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.229
 Percent headphones and find the perished 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.040
 after leaving or how 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.210
 like the activist 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.220
 even at the glaciers test for the user interface, IT has fifth 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.130
 stage 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.150
 that means you can, for example, overview here 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.650
 his numbers 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.869
 Years favorite enemy Zion on the phone fits here 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.860
 because of me I own this optical mouse, you just go 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.460
 just 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.090
 driving over 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.950
 with the cayman 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.560
 and then he jumps here 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.620
 my different fields 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.820
 "I may also have something activating it by tagging on it 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.749
 and we see such a bow here 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:18.089

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:22.340
 want to serve 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.619
 Of course I can do that too 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:27.619
 Serve Gassmann via the touchscreen 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.079
 and to tear with liquidity the first class 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:34.810

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.949
 Tell the world 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:38.749

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.700
 where to sit now the Sparrowhawk can go all programs 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.600

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.039
 on and on 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.950
 Kicker is no longer the short side to 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.909
 according to my wishes to adapt to adapt the origin in the bodies 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.300

 Eternal Friend Stream 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.019
 Thailand behind the figure does not shoot here 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.369
 Weight war on the side can be one too 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:30.229

 you go to the appropriate 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.719
 wiped, that is, want to activate a surface of Mannis 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.609
 Kigali on the plus one can here 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.529

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.159
 wants to connect daily 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.550
 to the accused 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.270
 you can remove that too 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.630
 that keep up a fat Infinera feast day then appears down here 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:32.529
 Box and then the widget 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:33.949
 main goal 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.349
 I now have another logic Chatham House 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.890
 you can 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.710
 Benny CF - throat 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.090
 I have now the ESC drives the possibilities 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.140
 the mood of the big one would have been different in different ways 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.200
 if I had it here now 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.440
 a case goes on hans-jÃ¼rgen Klein has joined the Times 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.189
 saves space 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.099
 I want that now 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.099
 It can choose more here what I take 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.430
 I'm with Merlin's hike June through 7 at www the current market analysis 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.120

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.680
 and he would not blame 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.680
 Jens two men deadly also my own 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.099
 do not write 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.199
 that reduces when IT starts giving more after that 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.530
 died listening to the IAF news ads 8 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.460
 now I have this virtual qwerty keyboard anyway, the Mr portrait format 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.460
 operated or in landscape format which films now turn around 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.360
 so IT can not feel like having both hands 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:44.729
 whenever I turned a bush in mid-third in this 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.389
 little as confirmation 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.509
 who has found himself in letters 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.490
 and you can see the touchscreen is responding well 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.210
 Ticket you have the opportunity 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.210
 To look for Weidhaas 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.099
 and 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.119

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:04.449
 I am the man who can give you the cell phone 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.840
 that these resignations exhausted and better serve in landscape mode 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.379
 the wind blowing in the east are bigger 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.969
 h you can see here 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:16.969

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.219
 Developer really good in the hand 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:29.789

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:32.809
 wrote about the Autostadt 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:36.249
 Everything is easy to use and thus this Wichert 

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:41.030
 at 8:30 am its best features and its favorite function the duty 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.940
 in no one at a glance and no one directly access it and also 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.740
 this optical mouse 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.050
 which is actually very good as a really nice race
