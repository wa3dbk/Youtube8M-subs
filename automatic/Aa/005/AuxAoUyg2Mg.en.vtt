fortunate enough to go to school where I
knew<00:04:33.730> a<00:04:33.760> couple<00:04:33.910> of<00:04:34.150> girls<00:04:34.450> who<00:04:34.840> knew<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.080> couple

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
knew a couple of girls who knew a couple

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.780 
knew a couple of girls who knew a couple
of<00:04:35.530> girls<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:35.890> it's<00:04:36.040> like<00:04:36.160> basically<00:04:36.400> almost

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
of girls so it's like basically almost

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.100 
of girls so it's like basically almost
like<00:04:37.120> everyone<00:04:37.390> kind<00:04:37.510> of<00:04:37.600> knows<00:04:37.660> each<00:04:37.990> other

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
like everyone kind of knows each other

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.409 
like everyone kind of knows each other
some<00:04:38.860> way<00:04:39.010> here<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.370> there<00:04:39.490> but<00:04:39.669> it<00:04:40.300> was

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
some way here and there but it was

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.680 
some way here and there but it was
really<00:04:40.600> a<00:04:40.690> big<00:04:40.930> deal<00:04:40.960> because<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:42.160> mean

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
really a big deal because I mean

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.880 
really a big deal because I mean
everyone<00:04:43.690> was<00:04:43.780> kind<00:04:43.960> of<00:04:44.080> knew<00:04:44.380> some<00:04:44.680> people

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
everyone was kind of knew some people

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.730

already<00:04:45.010> went<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.400> school<00:04:45.730> before<00:04:46.630> that<00:04:47.140> but

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
already went to school before that but

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.230 
already went to school before that but
just<00:04:47.980> accident<00:04:48.580> like<00:04:48.760> maybe<00:04:49.030> I<00:04:49.120> don't

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
just accident like maybe I don't

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.850 
just accident like maybe I don't
lunchable<00:04:49.690> are<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:50.020> you'll<00:04:50.290> see<00:04:50.500> someone<00:04:50.770> who
