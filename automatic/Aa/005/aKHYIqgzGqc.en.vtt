um<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.649> when<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.890> was<00:01:53.130> using<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.640> blue<00:01:53.850> tip

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
um but when I was using the blue tip

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.050 
um but when I was using the blue tip
honestly<00:01:54.509> i<00:01:54.600> felt<00:01:55.170> absolutely<00:01:55.530> no<00:01:56.460> pain<00:01:56.759> I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
honestly i felt absolutely no pain I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.730 
honestly i felt absolutely no pain I
didn't<00:01:57.479> feel<00:01:57.570> anything<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.229> all<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.590> was<00:01:58.680> just

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
didn't feel anything at all it was just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.520 
didn't feel anything at all it was just
like<00:01:59.520> something<00:01:59.670> gliding<00:02:00.329> up<00:02:00.420> along<00:02:01.079> my<00:02:01.229> skin

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
like something gliding up along my skin

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.160 
like something gliding up along my skin
but<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> felt<00:02:02.189> more<00:02:02.490> irritation<00:02:02.909> from<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.360> so

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
but I felt more irritation from it so

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.230 
but I felt more irritation from it so
the<00:02:04.710> next<00:02:04.740> thing<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.189> used<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> actually<00:02:05.939> used

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
the next thing I used it I actually used

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.550 
the next thing I used it I actually used
a<00:02:06.329> green<00:02:06.540> tip<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.079> little<00:02:07.320> bit<00:02:07.409> more

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
a green tip it's a little bit more

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.660 
a green tip it's a little bit more
coarse<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:09.569> feel<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.129> was<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.370> whole

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
coarse and I feel that it was a whole

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.930 
coarse and I feel that it was a whole
lot<00:02:11.849> better<00:02:12.030> because<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.420> actually

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
lot better because I actually

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.810 
lot better because I actually
and<00:02:13.420> rubbing<00:02:13.780> against<00:02:14.200> my<00:02:14.230> skin<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.400> just

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
and rubbing against my skin and I just

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.400 
and rubbing against my skin and I just
feel<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.060> it's<00:02:16.330> more<00:02:16.510> effective<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.200> way

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
feel like it's more effective that way

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.170 
feel like it's more effective that way
if<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.680> can<00:02:17.830> actually<00:02:17.980> feel<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.430> along<00:02:18.790> my<00:02:18.910> skin

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
if I can actually feel it along my skin

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.360 
if I can actually feel it along my skin
because<00:02:19.450> with<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.750> blue<00:02:19.990> tip<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.380> absolutely

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
because with the blue tip I absolutely

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.480 
because with the blue tip I absolutely
felt<00:02:21.760> nothing<00:02:22.060> at<00:02:22.390> all<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:24.040> I've<00:02:24.130> been<00:02:24.310> using

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
this for two and a half weeks I use it

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.190 
this for two and a half weeks I use it
mainly<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.610> my<00:02:27.850> acne<00:02:28.060> scars<00:02:28.540> as<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:28.870> guys<00:02:29.050> can

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
here and I have some breakouts on my

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.470 
here and I have some breakouts on my
chin<00:02:34.270> no<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:34.960> didn't<00:02:35.560> use<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.280> PMD<00:02:36.790> on<00:02:37.000> my<00:02:37.180> chin

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
chin no I didn't use the PMD on my chin

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.390 
chin no I didn't use the PMD on my chin
because<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:38.020> breakouts<00:02:38.470> were<00:02:38.590> just<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.070> big

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
because the breakouts were just so big

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.750 
them pop that would just be a huge mess
and<00:02:43.720> waiting<00:02:44.290> for<00:02:44.500> them<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.040> go<00:02:45.250> away<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.490> they

and waiting for them to go away and they

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.300 
and waiting for them to go away and they
use<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.060> PMD<00:02:46.480> over<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.020> just<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.740> get<00:02:48.040> rid<00:02:48.280> of

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310

the<00:02:48.640> scar<00:02:48.940> that's<00:02:49.240> going<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.660> be<00:02:49.750> left<00:02:49.930> behind

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
the scar that's going to be left behind

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.490

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
since i've used it i haven't had one

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.440 
since i've used it i haven't had one
single<00:03:02.410> break<00:03:02.710> out<00:03:02.920> on<00:03:03.130> those<00:03:03.460> areas<00:03:03.760> it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
single break out on those areas it

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.510

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.180 
hasn't even been one time is it I
promise<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.180> was<00:03:07.660> just<00:03:07.870> pretty<00:03:08.350> fascinating

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
promise you was just pretty fascinating

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.370 
promise you was just pretty fascinating
um<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.670> feel<00:03:10.150> like<00:03:10.270> because<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.780> PMD<00:03:11.200> it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
um I feel like because of the PMD it

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.770 
um I feel like because of the PMD it
strips<00:03:11.710> away<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.980> top<00:03:12.310> layer<00:03:12.550> of<00:03:12.730> my<00:03:12.790> skin<00:03:12.970> and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
strips away the top layer of my skin and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.990 
strips away the top layer of my skin and
then<00:03:14.110> um<00:03:14.410> afterwards<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.130> would<00:03:15.280> go<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.580> with<00:03:15.790> my

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
then um afterwards I would go in with my

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.270 
then um afterwards I would go in with my
toner<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.750> used<00:03:16.989> one<00:03:17.290> that's<00:03:17.530> by<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.800> plans

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
toner and I used one that's by the plans

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.000 
toner and I used one that's by the plans
simple<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:19.200> that's<00:03:20.200> just<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.470> balance<00:03:20.800> out<00:03:20.920> of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
simple and that's just a balance out of

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.120 
simple and that's just a balance out of
pH<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.700> then<00:03:22.090> afterwards<00:03:22.570> I<00:03:22.690> got<00:03:22.720> my<00:03:23.380> bio<00:03:23.709> oil

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
pH and then afterwards I got my bio oil

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.460 
pH and then afterwards I got my bio oil
and<00:03:24.550> it<00:03:24.700> just<00:03:24.910> soaks<00:03:25.330> into<00:03:25.570> my<00:03:25.780> skin<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:26.290> much

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
and it just soaks into my skin so much

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.110 
and it just soaks into my skin so much
better<00:03:26.709> than<00:03:26.920> without<00:03:27.220> using<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.670> PMD

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
better than without using the PMD

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.180 
better than without using the PMD
beforehand<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.350> feel<00:03:29.560> like<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.770> does<00:03:29.950> that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
beforehand and I feel like it does that

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.760 
beforehand and I feel like it does that
with<00:03:30.310> any<00:03:30.580> product<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:31.900> um<00:03:32.200> your<00:03:32.560> skin<00:03:32.739> is

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
with any product because um your skin is

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.530 
with any product because um your skin is
just<00:03:32.890> so<00:03:33.190> sensitive<00:03:33.550> at<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:33.940> time<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.420> it's

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
just so sensitive at that time and it's

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.280 
just so sensitive at that time and it's
just<00:03:34.720> waiting<00:03:35.080> to<00:03:35.200> absorb<00:03:36.570> nutrients<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:38.080> to

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
just waiting to absorb nutrients and to

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.260 
just waiting to absorb nutrients and to
absorb<00:03:38.709> any<00:03:38.920> products<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.520> you<00:03:39.640> apply<00:03:39.970> onto

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
absorb any products that you apply onto

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.680 
absorb any products that you apply onto
it<00:03:40.570> now<00:03:41.010> obviously<00:03:42.010> i'm<00:03:42.190> not<00:03:42.220> an<00:03:42.550> expert<00:03:42.700> i

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
it now obviously i'm not an expert i

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.750 
it now obviously i'm not an expert i
have<00:03:44.050> no<00:03:44.260> background<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.830> dermatology<00:03:45.310> or

anything<00:03:46.120> of<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:46.269> sort<00:03:46.390> but<00:03:47.019> this<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.650> just

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
anything of that sort but this is just

anything of that sort but this is just
entirely<00:03:49.480> based<00:03:49.840> on<00:03:50.019> my<00:03:50.110> own<00:03:50.140> experience<00:03:50.290> and

but after the first day that I've used
that<00:04:24.230> my<00:04:24.530> initial<00:04:24.950> thought<00:04:25.130> was<00:04:25.370> I<00:04:25.580> did<00:04:25.850> not

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
that my initial thought was I did not

see the difference that night but when I
woke<00:04:27.590> up<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.950> thought<00:04:28.190> that<00:04:28.370> my<00:04:28.490> skin<00:04:28.730> was<00:04:28.880> a

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
woke up I thought that my skin was a

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.180 
woke up I thought that my skin was a
whole<00:04:29.210> lot<00:04:29.389> brighter<00:04:29.570> right<00:04:29.990> here<00:04:30.290> um<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.980> did

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
whole lot brighter right here um it did

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.100 
whole lot brighter right here um it did
not<00:04:31.400> feel<00:04:31.700> any<00:04:31.850> more<00:04:32.270> sensitive<00:04:32.840> than<00:04:32.960> it

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
not feel any more sensitive than it

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.990 
not feel any more sensitive than it
usually<00:04:33.290> does<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.910> was<00:04:35.210> less<00:04:35.480> oily<00:04:36.110> though<00:04:36.320> and

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
usually does it was less oily though and

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.150 
usually does it was less oily though and
um<00:04:38.000> there<00:04:38.540> was<00:04:38.630> no<00:04:38.900> significant<00:04:39.590> difference

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
um there was no significant difference

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.640 
um there was no significant difference
in<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.550> scarring<00:04:41.090> or<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.360> color<00:04:41.600> but<00:04:42.350> today

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
in the scarring or the color but today

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.210 
in the scarring or the color but today
afterwards<00:04:43.400> when<00:04:44.150> I<00:04:44.180> woke<00:04:44.450> up<00:04:44.630> again<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.290> saw<00:04:45.980> a

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
afterwards when I woke up again I saw a

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.720 
afterwards when I woke up again I saw a
huge<00:04:46.850> difference<00:04:47.210> if<00:04:47.660> my<00:04:48.230> scar<00:04:48.800> were<00:04:49.190> at<00:04:49.460> like

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
huge difference if my scar were at like

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.000 
huge difference if my scar were at like
a<00:04:49.760> time<00:04:50.120> in<00:04:50.270> pigmentation<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:51.290> probably<00:04:51.919> went

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
a time in pigmentation it probably went

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.640 
a time in pigmentation it probably went
not<00:04:52.220> to<00:04:52.400> a<00:04:52.430> seven<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:53.120> then<00:04:53.960> a<00:04:54.020> few<00:04:54.440> days<00:04:54.500> later

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
not to a seven and then a few days later

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.710 
not to a seven and then a few days later
I<00:04:55.100> tried<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.490> again<00:04:55.610> and<00:04:55.820> I<00:04:56.090> tried<00:04:56.389> with<00:04:56.600> the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
I tried it again and I tried with the

I tried it again and I tried with the
Green<00:04:56.930> episode<00:04:57.200> of<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:57.710> blue<00:04:57.919> tip<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.430> again

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
Green episode of the blue tip and again

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.270 
Green episode of the blue tip and again

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
I told you that I actually felt this one

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.310 
I told you that I actually felt this one
on<00:05:01.430> my<00:05:01.520> skin<00:05:01.880> rather<00:05:02.419> than<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.840> blue<00:05:03.050> tip

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
on my skin rather than the blue tip

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.600 
on my skin rather than the blue tip
which<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:03.740> felt<00:05:03.979> nothing<00:05:04.760> from<00:05:05.330> it<00:05:05.419> at<00:05:05.630> all<00:05:06.610> but

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
which I felt nothing from it at all but

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.370 
which I felt nothing from it at all but
don't<00:05:07.790> worry<00:05:07.880> results<00:05:08.270> from<00:05:08.360> the<00:05:08.450> blue<00:05:08.630> one<00:05:08.810> so

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
don't worry results from the blue one so

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.440 
don't worry results from the blue one so
I<00:05:09.410> tried<00:05:09.860> this<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:10.220> then<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.820> next<00:05:10.850> moment<00:05:11.180> to

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
I tried this and then the next moment to

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.180 
I tried this and then the next moment to
walk<00:05:11.570> up<00:05:11.720> there<00:05:11.840> was<00:05:11.930> a<00:05:11.960> visible<00:05:12.440> difference<00:05:12.770> I

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
walk up there was a visible difference I

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.129 
walk up there was a visible difference I
went<00:05:13.700> down<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:14.120> like<00:05:14.270> a<00:05:14.300> number<00:05:14.660> three<00:05:14.930> or

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
went down to like a number three or

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.710 
went down to like a number three or
number<00:05:15.169> four<00:05:15.800> in<00:05:16.100> pigmentation<00:05:17.000> that's<00:05:17.479> just

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
number four in pigmentation that's just

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.440 
number four in pigmentation that's just
amazing<00:05:18.080> because<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:19.520> pigmentation<00:05:19.970> was<00:05:20.300> at

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
amazing because the pigmentation was at

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.090 
amazing because the pigmentation was at
level<00:05:20.810> 10<00:05:21.020> and<00:05:21.050> now<00:05:21.380> it's<00:05:21.530> only<00:05:21.800> around<00:05:21.889> the

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
level 10 and now it's only around the

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.570 
level 10 and now it's only around the
three<00:05:22.430> or<00:05:22.669> four<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.660> that's<00:05:23.870> just<00:05:24.310> pretty<00:05:25.310> low

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
three or four and that's just pretty low

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.630 
three or four and that's just pretty low
because<00:05:25.789> I've<00:05:26.090> tried<00:05:26.240> so<00:05:26.570> many<00:05:26.720> um<00:05:27.640> products
