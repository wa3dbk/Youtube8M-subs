 how to pass games to five people is a 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.270
 trick that you have to have one thing in 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.730
 account but before telling you that you get 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.300
 headphones and you can to understand 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.029
 better my explanation is well said 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.590
 this is clear that you are some cracks and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.599
 that's why you're going to like it 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.719
 well in the previous video we got to 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.630
 almost 150 likes at the moment I do not know if 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.300
 we have arrived but it can be 150 likes 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.120
 is a brutality you are some cracks 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.430
 it's really a brutality and so I 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.930
 you want to do things so for 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.420
 please collaborate with a like that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.670
 costs nothing click click that does not cost 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.800
 nothing you already know helps a lot and I 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.219
 motivates more to make videos and of course 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.629
 you are not all in this channel 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.090
 also ask me anything that 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.859
 do not understand since I do not explain myself well to 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.809
 Sometimes I'm a little bit stubborn 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.510
 idiot and good I understand it so that you 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.730
 I will answer all the questions 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.210
 one thing that you have to take into account in 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.030
 this trick method is that it only serves to 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.250
 the people who have passed their games to 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.010
 a person remember that we said that the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.360
 maximum they are two well then I'm sorry 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.620
 it's bad news I know 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.800
 yes yes yes you pass games to two people 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.350
 the loop closes the door closes and 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.090
 this trick no longer works only serves for 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.770
 example if steps to a person or to 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.590
 no person so I'm sorry 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.750
 a lot is like this is information that 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.060
 did not take into account and I have it now in 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.040
 account so good to try it if 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.650
 you want there may be a patch out there 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.900
 good a patch that I say or a book and 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.550
 work but I do not think it's worth depending on what 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.960
 I know it does not work so just 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.970
 would serve for people who have 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.030
 past content in this case games to 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.310
 a person then we would do this trick 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.759
 and you could do it up to four times is 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.430
 say that person that you have passed the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.170
 game plus four if you have not passed anything to 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.940
 nobody, you could spend about five 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.370
 people is this trick you could 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.010
 do with five people five times is 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.060
 a very simple and simple trick 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.190
 we would go 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.190
 well first of all also that I know 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.230
 has escaped a little is to give the email and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.700
 our password to a person from 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.620
 trust in this case our friend 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.170
 but be careful with this I do not do 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.670
 responsible with no case of theft 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.980
 Be careful who you give yours 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.140
 mind beware kings you go your 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.720
 I have seen many comments from 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.459
 say this happened because this happened this 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.060
 this imagine that they steal it is that 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.430
 is something is something that bothers a lot of truth 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.519
 and I would not give accounts to 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.920
 strangers so be careful 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.799
 well said this this recommendation between 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.210
 quotes we would give for example imagine 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:59.310
 that I'm going to pass a game to a friend 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.590
 would give my email and my password to me 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.880
 friend he would enter and go to the bullfight 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.650
 to the downloads section and it 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.330
 I would download that game remember that this 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.620
 it comes out in the previous video 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.250
 by the channel if you have not seen it 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.590
 then he would get out of my account and 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.730
 while your download is without 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.430
 complete I would go to 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.019
 account management would enter 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.239
 it would take a person a little 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.549
 it would take time to charge, so to speak , 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.379
 somehow and we would go activation 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.099
 of the system and what we have to do then 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:36.099
 very simple ps3 game system and you 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.170
 we would give in deactivate system and it is very 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.870
 logical for those to think a little bit about what 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.329
 happens with this it's as if now you do not 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.099
 nothing would have happened to anyone 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.840
 in this case as if my friend did not 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.940
 they would have downloaded nothing you have 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.650
 understood is very easy and that I have to 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.459
 do to be able to pass it to more people 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.950
 I just play and this time we activate 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.810
 the system is everything is very simple is 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.780
 very logical if it seems to think 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.299
 it 's like your friend erase us that 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.709
 download is as if it is very simple is 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.810
 as if nothing had been downloaded 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.390
 as if I had not given my account to 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.310
 nobody so nothing this is the little 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.049
 trick I hope you have understood it if 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.220
 not if you have not understood well then 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.780
 you can ask less 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.060
 what you want you already know that I answer 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.590
 all nothing I hope you liked it already 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.080
 you know the favorites and how much 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.610
 of course you're a crack and nothing 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.610
 we see in the next video goodbye people 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.010
