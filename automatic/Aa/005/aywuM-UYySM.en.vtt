00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.150 
do nuclear bombs exist your immediate
answer<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.520> yes<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.720> how<00:00:42.900> do<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.230> during

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
answer is yes but how do you know during

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.370 
answer is yes but how do you know during
the<00:00:44.340> mid<00:00:44.550> 20th<00:00:44.970> century<00:00:45.230> television<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
the mid 20th century television and

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.990 
the mid 20th century television and
movie<00:00:46.650> watchers<00:00:47.100> were<00:00:47.250> bombarded<00:00:47.940> with

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
movie watchers were bombarded with

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.910 
movie watchers were bombarded with
imagery<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.720> what<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.140> purported<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> be

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
imagery of what was purported to be

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.910 
imagery of what was purported to be
atomic<00:00:50.460> test<00:00:50.970> footage<00:00:51.500> but<00:00:52.500> what<00:00:52.680> were<00:00:52.800> they

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
atomic test footage but what were they

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.780 
atomic test footage but what were they
really<00:00:52.950> watching

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
really watching

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.580 
really watching
they<00:00:53.970> couldn't<00:00:54.270> rewind<00:00:54.720> a<00:00:54.840> videotape<00:00:55.380> or

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
they couldn't rewind a videotape or

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
they couldn't rewind a videotape or
rescan<00:00:56.190> through<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.490> video<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.940> their<00:00:57.090> computer

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
rescan through a video on their computer

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.570 
rescan through a video on their computer
so<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.380> option<00:00:58.740> did<00:00:58.890> they<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.190> but<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
so what option did they have but to

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.480 
so what option did they have but to
accept<00:00:59.970> these<00:01:00.120> images<00:01:00.690> at<00:01:00.840> their<00:01:01.110> face<00:01:01.350> value

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
accept these images at their face value

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.520 
accept these images at their face value
now<00:01:02.490> we<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.910> opportunity<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> scrutinize

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
now we have opportunity to scrutinize

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.710 
now we have opportunity to scrutinize
these<00:01:04.830> images<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.820> see<00:01:05.850> if<00:01:06.120> they<00:01:06.240> hold<00:01:06.450> up<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
these images to see if they hold up to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.070 
these images to see if they hold up to
analysis<00:01:10.940> take<00:01:11.940> a<00:01:11.970> look<00:01:12.210> at<00:01:12.300> these<00:01:12.420> trees<00:01:15.080> now

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
analysis take a look at these trees now

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.990 
analysis take a look at these trees now
what<00:01:16.290> was<00:01:16.440> that<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.890> who<00:01:17.280> turned<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.640> camera

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.090 

they're<00:01:22.570> an<00:01:22.750> awfully<00:01:23.140> straight<00:01:23.500> lines<00:01:23.800> aren't

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
they're an awfully straight lines aren't

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.200 
they're an awfully straight lines aren't
they<00:01:25.860> now<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:27.100> must<00:01:27.310> be<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.520> different<00:01:27.940> blast

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
they now this must be a different blast

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.280 
they now this must be a different blast
because<00:01:28.510> it's<00:01:28.660> coming<00:01:28.840> from<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.140> different

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
because it's coming from a different

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.210 
because it's coming from a different
direction

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
direction

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.850 
direction
wait<00:01:30.670> now<00:01:30.940> they've<00:01:31.150> put<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.630> back<00:01:31.780> but<00:01:32.710> those

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
wait now they've put it back but those

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.440 
wait now they've put it back but those
are<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.130> same<00:01:33.340> trees<00:01:33.670> we<00:01:33.820> saw<00:01:34.000> in<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.210> first

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
are the same trees we saw in the first

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.880 
are the same trees we saw in the first
clip<00:01:34.690> aren't<00:01:34.990> they<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:36.850> this<00:01:37.620> first<00:01:38.620> they

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
clip aren't they and now this first they

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.950 
clip aren't they and now this first they
showed<00:01:39.160> us<00:01:39.280> these<00:01:39.430> trees<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.180> they<00:01:40.330> pan<00:01:40.660> left

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
showed us these trees that they pan left

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.840 
showed us these trees that they pan left
on<00:01:41.230> then<00:01:41.740> they<00:01:41.920> show<00:01:42.100> us<00:01:42.250> these<00:01:42.430> trees<00:01:42.820> that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
on then they show us these trees that

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.880 
on then they show us these trees that
look<00:01:43.180> like<00:01:43.360> they<00:01:43.540> should<00:01:43.570> be<00:01:43.750> next<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.350> model

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
look like they should be next to a model

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
look like they should be next to a model
train<00:01:45.570> notice<00:01:46.570> how<00:01:46.690> straight<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.230> rows<00:01:47.470> are

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
train notice how straight the rows are

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.580 
train notice how straight the rows are
it<00:01:48.910> looks<00:01:49.030> artificial<00:01:49.630> to<00:01:49.720> me<00:01:49.750> then<00:01:50.380> there

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
it looks artificial to me then there

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.320 
it looks artificial to me then there
shows<00:01:50.770> these<00:01:50.980> trees<00:01:51.250> again<00:01:51.550> where's<00:01:52.150> the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
shows these trees again where's the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.270 
shows these trees again where's the
forward<00:01:52.750> camera<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.320> then<00:01:53.770> back<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.130> these

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
forward camera and then back to these

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.480 
forward camera and then back to these
trees<00:01:54.520> again<00:01:54.790> and<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:56.140> they<00:01:56.290> show<00:01:56.500> us<00:01:56.680> what

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
trees again and then they show us what

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.520 
trees again and then they show us what
looks<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.820> be<00:01:57.910> a<00:01:57.940> real<00:01:58.210> forest<00:01:58.570> that's<00:01:59.260> been

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
looks to be a real forest that's been

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.710 
looks to be a real forest that's been
chopped<00:02:00.430> down<00:02:00.550> or<00:02:00.880> torn<00:02:01.270> down

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
chopped down or torn down

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.260 
chopped down or torn down
now<00:02:02.200> take<00:02:02.470> a<00:02:02.500> look<00:02:02.590> at<00:02:02.830> this<00:02:03.070> it's<00:02:03.280> footage<00:02:04.090> of

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
now take a look at this it's footage of

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.520 
now take a look at this it's footage of
the<00:02:04.630> first<00:02:04.990> h-bomb<00:02:05.830> test<00:02:05.979> called<00:02:06.550> IV<00:02:07.030> Mike

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:19.430 

watch<00:02:11.530> how<00:02:11.740> it<00:02:11.860> changes

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.630 

that's<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.100> composite

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.790 

then<00:02:24.210> it<00:02:24.390> morphs<00:02:24.720> into<00:02:24.870> this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.650 

looks<00:02:29.430> like<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> completely<00:02:30.090> separate

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
looks like a completely separate

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.960 
looks like a completely separate
explosion<00:02:34.040> now<00:02:35.040> take<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> look<00:02:35.550> at<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.700> frame

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
explosion now take a look at the frame

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.090 
explosion now take a look at the frame
before<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.690> explosion<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:38.030> then<00:02:39.030> what<00:02:39.300> after

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
before the explosion and then what after

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.800 
before the explosion and then what after
these<00:02:41.100> friends<00:02:41.550> were<00:02:41.580> cut<00:02:41.940> together<00:02:42.410> why<00:02:44.810> then

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
these friends were cut together why then

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.350 
these friends were cut together why then
this<00:02:46.020> frame<00:02:46.320> was<00:02:46.470> cut<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.640> which<00:02:48.090> looks

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
this frame was cut to this which looks

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.120 
this frame was cut to this which looks
like<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.690> Sun<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:49.170> me<00:02:49.320> looks<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.710> they're

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
like the Sun to me looks like they're

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.940 
like the Sun to me looks like they're
zooming<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.180> Sun<00:02:51.450> maybe<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.350> composite

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
zooming in on the Sun maybe a composite

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.640 
zooming in on the Sun maybe a composite
because<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.310> clouds<00:02:53.550> aren't<00:02:53.850> moving<00:02:54.650> then

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
because the clouds aren't moving then

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.340 
because the clouds aren't moving then
they<00:02:55.800> introduce<00:02:56.250> some<00:02:56.520> sort<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.850> liquid<00:02:57.630> it

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
they introduce some sort of liquid it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.890 
they introduce some sort of liquid it
looks<00:02:59.040> like<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> laboratory<00:02:59.720> concoction<00:03:00.720> in

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
looks like a laboratory concoction in

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.150 
looks like a laboratory concoction in
