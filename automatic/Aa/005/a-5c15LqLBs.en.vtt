00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.859
 with you to me are more serious 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.800
 Good night, I think dads 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.119
 they teach super weird things for example you 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.279
 they teach that everything can be solved 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.130
 praying as he prays so that when he arrives 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.780
 to the house be everything ordered bars from 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.360
 there you know that you are going to rotate the same 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.940
 because surely God is going to listen to me 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.400
 there are earthquakes there are disasters 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.930
 hey although my mom I do not know I do not know by fa 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.790
 amman and if it goes I think the second 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.120
 name they put it just to challenge you 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.480
 so that he keeps the middle name as 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.030
 alison takes what they said but allison 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.750
 katelynas to those who said what the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.970
 threw 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.950
 the parents become hysterical 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.500
 since you're little, if I eat 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.030
 you take out diapers both 885 look 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.070
 He learned to pee and goes to the bathroom 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.070
 sold pee and suddenly you tell me 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.450
 how they want it to be tranquil 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.979
 they can 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.290
 I get the impression that all the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.350
 people who are dad do not want one to be 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.280
 dad still with that cute your son 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.280
 what do you want to have one 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.810
 do not forget your walls forget about 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.250
 sleep forget about freedom and 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.870
 in between, how is it justified or 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.240
 It is the cutest thing in the world when you 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.070
 smile see if he could wait wait 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.380
 there is something that moms do that is super 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.420
 bad wave that give a teaching that already 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.420
 they should not do more than a little girl and 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.360
 is crying that put my love that is 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.120
 the child hit me you know because you fear doubts 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.580
 because who loves you bores you 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.560
 more and more moms say who is the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.020
 most beautiful girl in the world 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.110
 they have the princess the only princess in 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.540
 this world 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.640
 I should not do that to you 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.560
 because tomorrow you go to the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.320
 outside world and you realize that one is 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.509
 the most beautiful 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.970
 and that there are those that we did the claudia 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.330
 schiffer 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.550
 it was not me mom watches TV 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.930
 or they teach you that with food you do not know 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.849
 play 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.680
 the first day of the first basic arrives 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.540
 at school they tell you tomorrow bring 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.890
 noodle because we're going to make a card 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.290
 for mom 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.110
 but it is so unfair to make education 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.790
 Chile is so different than the schools 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.470
 paid from the upper quarter do the same 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.680
 cards for mom but they force you 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.000
 help the child instead of noodles 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.470
 bring ravioli 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.390
 as the compas said as you 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.870
 they press for one to learn to manage 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.390
 at 18 years later, he already turned 18 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.520
 take leave now and then you go the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.290
 course went the workshop don your license 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.290
 to live lend the car not 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.460
 or they tell you that everything that is in the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.860
 They teach you that they are here 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.170
 If you drop poop, take away the sleep, no, no, 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.640

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.640
 walking with her boyfriend and he falls 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.609
 do not 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.930
 dads pretend to do magic 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.790
 they say shut up once and eat 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.939

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.120
 he carries it but I can not 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.310
 or children who do not want to eat all the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.120
 food dads like blackmailing them 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.960
 a little bit like this is with this spoonful 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.350
 is 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.940
 for mom and even for dad and one does not 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.090
 he wants to eat more but he still did not want 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.129
 be her mom who did not want her 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.940

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:57.340
 childish is pure family love 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.030
 mexico teaches you dads that lying is 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.890

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.609
 the little rabbit 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.409

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.389

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.939

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:18.430
 Place your pololo here the house 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.630
