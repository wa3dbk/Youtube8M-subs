bright<00:00:16.470> idea<00:00:16.500> was<00:00:16.980> for<00:00:17.400> all<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.670> us<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.940> go

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
bright idea was for all of us to go

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.480 
bright idea was for all of us to go
poseidon<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.050> then<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.830> would<00:00:19.980> make<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> bunch

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
poseidon and then we would make a bunch

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.359 
poseidon and then we would make a bunch
of<00:00:20.609> buckets<00:00:21.000> some<00:00:21.240> armor<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.840> then<00:00:22.350> flood<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
of buckets some armor and then flood the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.849 
of buckets some armor and then flood the
entire<00:00:23.460> spawn<00:00:24.359> area<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.779> hundred<00:00:25.320> blocks<00:00:25.590> in

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
entire spawn area a hundred blocks in

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.210 
entire spawn area a hundred blocks in
every<00:00:26.519> direction<00:00:26.760> from<00:00:27.720> zero<00:00:28.199> zero<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
every direction from zero zero and the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.640 
every direction from zero zero and the
goal<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.000> was<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.630> when<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.960> final<00:00:31.349> pit

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
goal of this was so when the final pit

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950 
goal of this was so when the final pit
spawned<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.090> didn't<00:00:33.329> know<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.630> spawns

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
spawned and if you didn't know it spawns

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.500 
spawned and if you didn't know it spawns
within<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> hundred<00:00:34.829> blocks<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.969> random

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
within a hundred blocks in a random

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.260 
within a hundred blocks in a random
direction<00:00:36.660> from<00:00:37.110> spawn<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.670> water<00:00:39.000> will

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
direction from spawn that water will

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.530 
direction from spawn that water will
rush<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:41.070> hopefully<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.940> will<00:00:42.059> drown

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
rush in and that hopefully it will drown

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.450 
rush in and that hopefully it will drown

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
before where the feast is actually

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.899 
before where the feast is actually
spawned<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.350> i'm<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.130> curious<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
spawned on you and i'm really curious to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.810 
spawned on you and i'm really curious to
see<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.659> actually<00:01:30.689> happens<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
see if it actually happens like that so

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.179 
see if it actually happens like that so
we<00:01:32.909> ended<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.210> looting<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.720> feast<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.439> first<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
we ended up looting the feast at first I

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.770 
we ended up looting the feast at first I
thought<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.520> shouldn't<00:01:35.850> get<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.420> I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
thought we shouldn't get it because I

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.539 
thought we shouldn't get it because I
wanted<00:01:37.079> them<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.470> get<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.770> full<00:01:37.950> diamond<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
wanted them to get the full diamond the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
wanted them to get the full diamond the
video<00:01:38.790> would<00:01:38.939> look<00:01:39.090> better<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.689> trap<00:01:39.869> was

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
video would look better if the trap was

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.069 
video would look better if the trap was
successful<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.670> what<00:01:42.509> actually

going<00:02:43.760> up<00:02:43.850> the<00:02:44.000> side<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.600> water<00:02:44.810> source<00:02:45.110> then

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
going up the side of a water source then

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.340 
going up the side of a water source then
