00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.930 

it's<00:00:08.560> going<00:00:08.680> to<00:00:08.740> be<00:00:08.830> a<00:00:08.860> little<00:00:09.190> bit<00:00:09.460> different

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:09.940 
it's going to be a little bit different

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.270 
it's going to be a little bit different
control<00:00:10.480> on<00:00:10.840> the<00:00:11.080> unbaked<00:00:11.500> because<00:00:11.980> obviously

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
control on the unbaked because obviously

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.940 
control on the unbaked because obviously
it's<00:00:12.639> a<00:00:12.730> lot<00:00:12.910> softer<00:00:13.180> and<00:00:13.600> and<00:00:14.440> you<00:00:14.650> have<00:00:14.770> more

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
it's a lot softer and and you have more

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.860 
it's a lot softer and and you have more
of<00:00:15.010> a<00:00:15.070> tendency<00:00:15.280> to<00:00:15.550> dig<00:00:15.760> down<00:00:15.940> into<00:00:16.299> it<00:00:16.420> so<00:00:16.630> be

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:16.870 
of a tendency to dig down into it so be

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.420 
of a tendency to dig down into it so be
very<00:00:17.080> careful<00:00:17.380> when<00:00:17.710> you're<00:00:17.800> just<00:00:17.950> going<00:00:18.310> and

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
very careful when you're just going and

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.820 
very careful when you're just going and
try<00:00:18.640> to<00:00:18.700> just<00:00:18.910> kind<00:00:19.060> of<00:00:19.180> skim<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.630> surface

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
try to just kind of skim the surface

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.960 
try to just kind of skim the surface
you're<00:00:20.830> probably<00:00:21.100> going<00:00:21.340> to<00:00:21.400> get<00:00:21.460> a<00:00:21.520> thicker

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
you're probably going to get a thicker

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.779 
you're probably going to get a thicker
line<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:23.080> a<00:00:23.980> more<00:00:24.130> consistently<00:00:26.460> deep<00:00:27.460> and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
line and a more consistently deep and

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.499 
line and a more consistently deep and
wide<00:00:28.330> line<00:00:28.900> that's<00:00:29.560> a<00:00:29.679> much<00:00:29.830> different<00:00:30.509> look

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
wide line that's a much different look

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.980 
wide line that's a much different look
so<00:00:32.850> different<00:00:33.850> projects<00:00:34.420> will<00:00:34.570> call<00:00:34.780> for

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
so different projects will call for

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.420 
so different projects will call for
different<00:00:35.290> things<00:00:35.470> just<00:00:35.620> depends<00:00:36.130> on<00:00:36.220> what

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
different things just depends on what

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:46.770 
different things just depends on what
you<00:00:36.490> want<00:00:36.640> to<00:00:36.700> do<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:46.059> I'm<00:00:46.270> just<00:00:46.420> doing<00:00:46.570> the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
you want to do so I'm just doing the

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.479 
you want to do so I'm just doing the
same<00:00:47.020> pattern<00:00:47.620> just<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.949> show<00:00:48.219> you<00:00:48.280> the

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
same pattern just to show you the

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.590 
same pattern just to show you the
different<00:00:51.449> lines<00:00:52.449> here<00:00:52.600> so<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:54.670> really

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
different lines here so that's really

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.700 
different lines here so that's really
really<00:00:55.899> basic<00:00:56.550> carving<00:00:57.550> you<00:00:58.449> can<00:00:58.710> nicest

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
really basic carving you can nicest

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.319 
really basic carving you can nicest
thing<00:00:59.859> about<00:00:59.890> where<00:01:00.550> all<00:01:00.640> playa's<00:01:00.910> if<00:01:01.180> you

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
thing about where all playa's if you

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.880 
thing about where all playa's if you
messed<00:01:01.750> up<00:01:01.870> like<00:01:02.050> they<00:01:02.170> just<00:01:02.410> press<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.710> back

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
messed up like they just press the back

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.830 
messed up like they just press the back
into<00:01:03.070> place<00:01:03.370> and<00:01:03.730> start<00:01:04.480> again<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:07.690> go

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
into place and start again there you go

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.110 
into place and start again there you go
so<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:08.380> get<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.830> idea<00:01:09.130> it's<00:01:09.490> just<00:01:09.760> real<00:01:09.940> basic

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
so you get the idea it's just real basic

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.429 
so you get the idea it's just real basic
carbon<00:01:11.759> then<00:01:12.759> of<00:01:13.570> course<00:01:13.780> with<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:14.049> one<00:01:14.290> you

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
carbon then of course with this one you

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.929 
carbon then of course with this one you
would<00:01:14.560> bake<00:01:14.799> it<00:01:14.979> before<00:01:15.400> you<00:01:15.460> do<00:01:15.610> any<00:01:15.790> of<00:01:15.880> the

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
would bake it before you do any of the

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.510 
would bake it before you do any of the
other<00:01:16.060> steps<00:01:16.689> in<00:01:16.900> this<00:01:17.049> process<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:18.310> one's

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
other steps in this process this one's

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.319 
other steps in this process this one's
ready<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.820> go<00:01:19.080> okay<00:01:20.080> so<00:01:22.920> let's<00:01:23.920> do<00:01:24.460> some

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
ready to go okay so let's do some

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.149 
ready to go okay so let's do some
excellent<00:01:26.049> now<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:28.049> happen<00:01:29.049> to<00:01:29.079> love<00:01:29.380> grout<00:01:29.740> and

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
excellent now I happen to love grout and

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.850 
excellent now I happen to love grout and
I<00:01:30.430> like<00:01:30.750> making<00:01:31.750> light<00:01:31.960> when<00:01:32.200> I<00:01:32.229> do<00:01:32.320> mosaics

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
I like making light when I do mosaics

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.399 
I like making light when I do mosaics
and<00:01:33.009> polymer<00:01:33.340> I<00:01:33.490> like<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:34.030> make<00:01:34.810> my<00:01:34.990> own<00:01:35.020> grout

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
and polymer I like to make my own grout

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.810 
and polymer I like to make my own grout
I<00:01:35.439> don't<00:01:35.710> like<00:01:35.829> to<00:01:35.950> actually<00:01:36.070> use<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.579> one

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
I don't like to actually use that one

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.679 
I don't like to actually use that one
for<00:01:37.060> tile<00:01:37.570> I<00:01:37.899> make<00:01:38.380> it<00:01:38.500> out<00:01:38.619> of<00:01:38.649> polymer<00:01:39.280> clay

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
for tile I make it out of polymer clay

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.830 
for tile I make it out of polymer clay
so<00:01:40.710> she<00:01:41.710> was<00:01:41.829> the<00:01:41.950> color<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:42.399> want<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.939> little

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
so she was the color you want a little

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.499 
so she was the color you want a little
grout<00:01:44.079> goes<00:01:44.350> a<00:01:44.380> really<00:01:44.740> long<00:01:44.860> way<00:01:45.009> so<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.000> just

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
grout goes a really long way so I just

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.700 
grout goes a really long way so I just
picked<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.259> little<00:01:47.500> bit<00:01:47.799> of<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:49.710> contrasting

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
picked a little bit of a contrasting

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.010 
picked a little bit of a contrasting
color<00:01:50.920> there<00:01:51.219> and<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:52.540> need<00:01:52.719> to<00:01:52.810> make<00:01:52.930> it

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
color there and you need to make it

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.719 
color there and you need to make it
really<00:01:53.409> really<00:01:53.619> soft<00:01:53.860> so<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.399> will<00:01:54.520> actually

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
really really soft so it will actually

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.270 
really really soft so it will actually
press<00:01:55.240> into<00:01:55.570> those<00:01:55.689> lines<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.500> stay<00:01:56.860> in<00:01:57.070> there

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
press into those lines and stay in there

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.850 
press into those lines and stay in there
so<00:01:57.880> I<00:01:58.240> make<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:58.689> soft<00:01:58.960> by<00:01:59.380> getting<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.740> little

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
so I make it soft by getting a little

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.429 
so I make it soft by getting a little
bit<00:02:00.040> of<00:02:00.130> mineral<00:02:00.310> oil<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:01.719> face<00:02:01.930> it<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.200> more

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
bit of mineral oil just face it the more

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.639 
bit of mineral oil just face it the more
oil<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.860> got<00:02:02.890> at<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.250> store<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.960> pharmacy

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
oil I got at the store in the pharmacy

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.999 
oil I got at the store in the pharmacy
section<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:07.259> little<00:02:08.259> bit<00:02:08.410> goes<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.590> long<00:02:08.710> way

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
section and a little bit goes a long way

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.780 
section and a little bit goes a long way
I<00:02:09.390> would<00:02:10.390> suggest<00:02:10.539> that<00:02:10.960> you<00:02:11.110> pour<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.790> into

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
I would suggest that you pour it into

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.080 
I would suggest that you pour it into
some<00:02:13.630> other<00:02:13.810> container<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.470> cup<00:02:14.650> or<00:02:14.770> something

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
some other container a cup or something

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.880 
some other container a cup or something
because<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.690> not<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.960> matter<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.290> if<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:17.590> when

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
because it's not a matter of if but when

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.200 
because it's not a matter of if but when
you<00:02:18.490> tip<00:02:18.790> this

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
you tip this

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.420 
you tip this
and<00:02:19.570> it'll<00:02:19.720> be<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> lot<00:02:20.410> less<00:02:20.650> messy<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.190> clean

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
and it'll be a lot less messy to clean

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.550 
and it'll be a lot less messy to clean
up<00:02:21.550> this<00:02:21.730> little<00:02:21.940> bit<00:02:22.120> than<00:02:22.300> here<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:23.410> be

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
up this little bit than here just be

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.260 
up this little bit than here just be
real<00:02:23.710> careful<00:02:23.950> with<00:02:24.430> Medora<00:02:24.820> because<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.150> is

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
real careful with Medora because it is

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.240 
real careful with Medora because it is
kind<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.660> goopy<00:02:25.960> anyway<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:26.710> you<00:02:26.920> just<00:02:27.070> take<00:02:27.220> a

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
kind of goopy anyway so you just take a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.060 
kind of goopy anyway so you just take a
tiny<00:02:27.760> little<00:02:28.060> finger<00:02:28.420> fold<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.620> clay<00:02:29.830> of

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
tiny little finger fold of the clay of

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.550 
tiny little finger fold of the clay of
the<00:02:30.310> mineral<00:02:30.760> oil<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.330> rub<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.230> onto<00:02:32.350> the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
the mineral oil and rub it onto the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.130 
the mineral oil and rub it onto the
surface<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.450> clay<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.900> want<00:02:35.050> to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
surface of the clay that you want to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.440 
surface of the clay that you want to
turn<00:02:35.320> into<00:02:35.440> grout<00:02:35.740> and<00:02:36.070> just<00:02:36.730> mix<00:02:37.090> thoroughly

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
turn into grout and just mix thoroughly

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.030 
turn into grout and just mix thoroughly
and<00:02:39.660> depends<00:02:40.660> on<00:02:40.750> your<00:02:40.930> project<00:02:41.560> how<00:02:41.770> deep

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
and depends on your project how deep

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.360 
and depends on your project how deep
your<00:02:42.250> lines<00:02:42.490> are<00:02:42.850> how<00:02:43.240> messy<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.750> want<00:02:43.960> to<00:02:44.050> get

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
your lines are how messy you want to get

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.000 
your lines are how messy you want to get
as<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.730> how<00:02:46.030> much<00:02:46.570> oil<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.230> want<00:02:47.470> this<00:02:47.800> is

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
as to how much oil you want this is

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.600 
as to how much oil you want this is
pretty<00:02:48.430> warm<00:02:48.640> clay<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.900> has<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.770> bit<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.070> oil<00:02:51.430> in

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
pretty warm clay and has a bit of oil in

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.580 
pretty warm clay and has a bit of oil in
it<00:02:51.700> already<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.630> ready<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.170> go<00:02:53.320> this

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
it already so this is ready to go this

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.870 
it already so this is ready to go this
is<00:02:53.650> it's<00:02:53.890> sticky<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.130> will<00:02:57.310> fill<00:02:57.640> in<00:02:57.760> those

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
is it's sticky but it will fill in those

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.260 
is it's sticky but it will fill in those
cracks<00:02:58.800> so<00:03:01.050> aside<00:03:02.050> before<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:02.470> spill<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.270> and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
cracks so aside before I spill it and

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.210 
cracks so aside before I spill it and
you<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:04.540> want<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.410> actually<00:03:05.620> put<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
you just want to actually put the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.860 
you just want to actually put the
blowout<00:03:06.400> right<00:03:06.610> on<00:03:06.850> top<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.120> press<00:03:07.840> right<00:03:08.770> in

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
blowout right on top and press right in

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.240 
blowout right on top and press right in
and<00:03:10.870> I'm<00:03:11.080> both<00:03:11.590> pressing<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.520> pulling<00:03:13.330> back

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
and I'm both pressing and pulling back

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.640 
and I'm both pressing and pulling back
so<00:03:15.250> I'm<00:03:15.430> kind<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.030> removing<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.660> surface<00:03:16.900> as<00:03:17.290> I

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
so I'm kind of removing the surface as I

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.790 
so I'm kind of removing the surface as I
fill<00:03:17.920> in<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:19.000> cracks<00:03:19.300> now<00:03:20.290> this<00:03:20.470> doesn't<00:03:20.680> have

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
fill in the cracks now this doesn't have

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.380 
fill in the cracks now this doesn't have
to<00:03:20.950> be<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.190> one-step<00:03:21.970> process<00:03:22.030> if<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.200> if<00:03:24.390> your

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
to be a one-step process if you if your

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.050 
to be a one-step process if you if your
clay<00:03:26.080> is<00:03:26.110> sticking<00:03:26.770> for<00:03:26.980> some<00:03:27.160> reason<00:03:27.550> or<00:03:27.820> if

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
clay is sticking for some reason or if

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.790 
clay is sticking for some reason or if
when<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.480> pull<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.990> it<00:03:29.110> pulls<00:03:29.320> it<00:03:29.500> right<00:03:29.530> back

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
when you pull it it pulls it right back

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.530 
when you pull it it pulls it right back
out<00:03:29.950> on<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.160> channel<00:03:30.520> you<00:03:30.670> can<00:03:31.060> do<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.210> partial

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
out on the channel you can do a partial

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.290 
out on the channel you can do a partial
fill<00:03:31.960> and<00:03:32.230> then<00:03:33.040> go<00:03:33.490> ahead<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.700> bake<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.120> and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
fill and then go ahead and bake it and

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.690 
fill and then go ahead and bake it and
then<00:03:34.360> go<00:03:34.780> back<00:03:34.990> in<00:03:35.200> later<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.680> fill<00:03:36.370> in<00:03:36.520> more

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
then go back in later and fill in more

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:45.690 
then go back in later and fill in more
gaps<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.910> I'm<00:03:40.090> just<00:03:40.330> going<00:03:40.570> to<00:03:44.280> get<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.460> there

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
gaps so I'm just going to get in there

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.620 
gaps so I'm just going to get in there
pretty<00:03:45.940> well<00:03:47.460> we'll<00:03:48.460> just<00:03:48.490> do<00:03:48.790> one<00:03:49.030> side<00:03:49.330> for

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
pretty well we'll just do one side for

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.850 
pretty well we'll just do one side for
now<00:03:49.750> but<00:03:50.020> you<00:03:50.230> can<00:03:50.500> do<00:03:50.740> both<00:03:50.920> sides<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:53.590> it's

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
now but you can do both sides and it's

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.800 
now but you can do both sides and it's
really<00:03:54.190> really<00:03:54.460> present<00:03:54.910> make<00:03:55.030> sure<00:03:55.210> it's<00:03:55.390> you

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
really really present make sure it's you

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.540 
really really present make sure it's you
don't<00:03:55.990> want<00:03:56.110> any<00:03:56.260> air<00:03:56.440> gaps<00:03:56.470> in<00:03:57.040> there<00:03:57.220> either

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
don't want any air gaps in there either

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.250 
don't want any air gaps in there either
because<00:03:57.850> when<00:03:58.270> you<00:03:58.390> when<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.750> clean<00:03:58.960> up<00:03:58.990> the

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
because when you when you clean up the

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.050 
because when you when you clean up the
top<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.680> will<00:03:59.800> actually<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.580> know<00:04:00.700> pull<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
top it will actually you know pull the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.510 
top it will actually you know pull the
clay<00:04:01.300> right<00:04:01.480> back<00:04:01.660> out<00:04:02.580> so<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:04.420> want<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:05.520> you

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
clay right back out so you want to you

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.860 
clay right back out so you want to you
can<00:04:06.670> leave<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.850> little<00:04:07.000> bit<00:04:07.210> on<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.420> surface

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
can leave a little bit on the surface

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.130 
can leave a little bit on the surface
there's<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.770> messy<00:04:09.010> part<00:04:09.450> or<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.690> messy<00:04:10.900> ear

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
there's the messy part or the messy ear

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.650 
there's the messy part or the messy ear
part<00:04:11.610> I'm<00:04:12.610> going<00:04:12.820> to<00:04:12.880> take<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.090> little<00:04:13.360> paper

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
part I'm going to take a little paper

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.500 
part I'm going to take a little paper
towel<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:15.220> just<00:04:15.280> rip<00:04:15.580> off<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:15.790> little<00:04:16.120> bit<00:04:16.270> at<00:04:16.450> a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
towel and just rip off a little bit at a

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.060 
towel and just rip off a little bit at a
time<00:04:16.810> because<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:17.380> gets<00:04:17.530> kind<00:04:17.710> of<00:04:17.799> messy

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.390 

okay<00:04:21.070> take<00:04:21.880> my<00:04:22.240> oil<00:04:22.530> just<00:04:23.530> keep<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:23.920> little<00:04:24.220> bit

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
okay take my oil just keep a little bit

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.570 
okay take my oil just keep a little bit
of<00:04:24.520> oil<00:04:24.700> onto<00:04:25.060> your<00:04:25.330> paper<00:04:25.690> towel<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.580> wipe

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
of oil onto your paper towel and wipe

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.640 
of oil onto your paper towel and wipe
the<00:04:28.570> surface

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
the surface

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.250 
the surface
and<00:04:29.889> you'll<00:04:30.699> see<00:04:30.940> that<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.510> clay<00:04:31.720> stuck<00:04:32.050> to

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
and you'll see that the clay stuck to

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.140 
and you'll see that the clay stuck to
the<00:04:32.410> raised<00:04:32.889> areas<00:04:33.430> will<00:04:33.639> come<00:04:33.820> off<00:04:33.970> on<00:04:34.120> your

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
the raised areas will come off on your

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.290 
the raised areas will come off on your
paper<00:04:34.419> towel<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.820> stuff<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:37.889> in<00:04:38.889> the

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
paper towel and the stuff in the in the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.810 
paper towel and the stuff in the in the
egg<00:04:40.300> filled<00:04:40.660> area<00:04:41.040> will<00:04:42.040> hopefully<00:04:42.280> stay<00:04:42.669> in

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
egg filled area will hopefully stay in

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.090 
egg filled area will hopefully stay in
there<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:43.240> got<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:43.990> little<00:04:44.290> bit<00:04:44.410> too<00:04:44.680> much<00:04:44.860> clay

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
there I got a little bit too much clay

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.620 
there I got a little bit too much clay
there<00:04:45.340> so<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.520> can<00:04:45.639> just<00:04:45.729> use<00:04:45.910> your<00:04:45.940> nail<00:04:46.240> or<00:04:46.419> a

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
there so you can just use your nail or a

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.570 
there so you can just use your nail or a
blade<00:04:47.050> or<00:04:47.290> something<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:47.770> scrape<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.220> little

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
blade or something to scrape a little

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:56.340 
blade or something to scrape a little
bit<00:04:48.729> out<00:04:52.139> go<00:04:53.139> ahead<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:53.490> use<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:55.050> paper<00:04:56.050> towels

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
bit out go ahead and use a paper towels

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.020 
bit out go ahead and use a paper towels
that<00:04:56.530> you<00:04:56.680> need<00:04:56.830> because<00:04:56.979> you<00:04:57.669> know<00:04:57.729> once<00:04:57.910> it

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
that you need because you know once it

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.430 
that you need because you know once it
gets<00:04:58.180> saturated<00:04:58.360> like<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:58.960> it's<00:04:59.110> not<00:04:59.260> gonna

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
gets saturated like that it's not gonna

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:08.610 
gets saturated like that it's not gonna
do<00:05:00.430> you<00:05:00.550> any<00:05:00.610> good<00:05:06.030> so<00:05:07.030> that's<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.229> basic

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
do you any good so that's the basic

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.939 
do you any good so that's the basic
principle<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.240> both<00:05:10.240> grouting<00:05:11.199> a<00:05:11.260> mosaic<00:05:11.680> and

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
principle of both grouting a mosaic and

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.120 
principle of both grouting a mosaic and
backfilling<00:05:13.229> you're<00:05:14.229> really<00:05:14.530> just<00:05:14.710> filling

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
backfilling you're really just filling

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.020 
backfilling you're really just filling
in<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.520> gaps<00:05:15.729> with<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:17.820> contrasting<00:05:18.820> clay

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
in the gaps with a contrasting clay

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.600 
in the gaps with a contrasting clay
alright<00:05:25.020> so<00:05:26.020> I<00:05:26.350> can<00:05:27.010> spend<00:05:27.220> a<00:05:27.340> little<00:05:27.430> more

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
alright so I can spend a little more

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.120 
alright so I can spend a little more
time<00:05:27.820> doing<00:05:28.090> that<00:05:28.330> but<00:05:28.600> I<00:05:28.900> won't<00:05:29.710> waste<00:05:29.919> their

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
time doing that but I won't waste their

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.200 
time doing that but I won't waste their
time<00:05:30.330> but<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.570> get<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.840> idea<00:05:31.900> that<00:05:33.120> you<00:05:34.120> know

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
time but you get the idea that you know

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.580 
time but you get the idea that you know
you<00:05:34.240> want<00:05:34.450> to<00:05:34.510> remove<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:34.930> clay<00:05:35.110> from<00:05:35.260> the<00:05:35.380> top

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
you want to remove the clay from the top

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.920 
you want to remove the clay from the top
surface<00:05:35.830> and<00:05:36.340> leave<00:05:36.550> it<00:05:36.729> in<00:05:36.849> those<00:05:37.060> gaps<00:05:38.789> mmm

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
surface and leave it in those gaps mmm

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
surface and leave it in those gaps mmm
that's<00:05:40.930> what<00:05:41.139> it<00:05:41.229> looked<00:05:41.410> like<00:05:41.500> if<00:05:41.740> you've

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
that's what it looked like if you've

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:48.600 
that's what it looked like if you've
done<00:05:42.130> it<00:05:42.160> nice<00:05:42.400> careful<00:05:42.789> job<00:05:47.400> just<00:05:48.400> put<00:05:48.520> on

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
done it nice careful job just put on

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.560 
done it nice careful job just put on
okay<00:05:49.740> take<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.770> second<00:05:51.160> this<00:05:51.700> blew<00:05:52.270> off<00:05:52.539> my

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
okay take a second this blew off my

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.040 
okay take a second this blew off my
hands<00:05:53.200> I<00:05:53.320> must<00:05:53.680> admit<00:05:53.860> that<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:55.419> gooey<00:05:55.660> grout

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
hands I must admit that the gooey grout

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.170 
hands I must admit that the gooey grout
is<00:05:56.380> probably<00:05:56.979> one<00:05:57.250> of<00:05:57.280> my<00:05:57.400> favorite<00:05:57.729> parts<00:05:58.030> are

is probably one of my favorite parts are

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.990 
is probably one of my favorite parts are
doing<00:05:58.360> on<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.750> clip
