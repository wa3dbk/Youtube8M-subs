00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.929 

we've<00:00:01.470> been<00:00:01.590> talking<00:00:01.770> about<00:00:01.980> how<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.340> get<00:00:02.580> hood

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
we've been talking about how to get hood

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.410 
we've been talking about how to get hood
Springs<00:00:03.689> off<00:00:04.140> of<00:00:04.440> our<00:00:04.590> hood<00:00:04.830> hinges<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.460> one

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
Springs off of our hood hinges and one

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.270 
Springs off of our hood hinges and one
of<00:00:06.510> the<00:00:06.570> ideas<00:00:06.960> that<00:00:06.990> we've<00:00:07.290> talked<00:00:07.680> about<00:00:07.800> are

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
of the ideas that we've talked about are

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.640 
of the ideas that we've talked about are
these<00:00:08.519> simple<00:00:08.850> little<00:00:08.880> tools<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.510> tubing<00:00:09.930> with

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
these simple little tools of tubing with

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.910 
these simple little tools of tubing with
washers<00:00:11.220> welded<00:00:11.610> on<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.880> ends<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.920> we'll

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
washers welded on the ends and we'll

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.230 
washers welded on the ends and we'll
demonstrate<00:00:14.070> how<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.639> works<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.210> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
demonstrate how this works this is a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.640 
demonstrate how this works this is a
1953<00:00:15.929> Oldsmobile<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:19.050> shop<00:00:19.260> manual

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
1953 Oldsmobile and the shop manual

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.980 
1953 Oldsmobile and the shop manual
actually<00:00:19.770> calls<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.430> this<00:00:20.520> tool<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.360> found

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
actually calls for this tool and I found

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.720 
actually calls for this tool and I found
a<00:00:22.140> catalog<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.920> tools<00:00:23.190> and<00:00:23.520> saw<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
a catalog for the tools and saw the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.980 
a catalog for the tools and saw the
picture<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.359> made<00:00:24.630> one<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.960> real<00:00:25.109> quick

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
picture and just made one up real quick

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.390 
picture and just made one up real quick
recent<00:00:27.990> thought<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.890> works<00:00:29.160> real

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
recent thought is that this works real

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.730 
recent thought is that this works real
well<00:00:29.430> on<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> hinge<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.420> has<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> spring<00:00:31.439> that's

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
well on a hinge that has a spring that's

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.200 
well on a hinge that has a spring that's
outside<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.820> hinge

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
outside of the hinge

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.229 
outside of the hinge
I<00:00:33.390> think<00:00:34.260> our<00:00:34.410> de<00:00:34.530> Soto's<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.340> often<00:00:36.090> have

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
I think our de Soto's have often have

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.850 
I think our de Soto's have often have
the<00:00:36.420> spring<00:00:36.720> on<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> inside<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.620> hinge

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the spring on the inside of the hinge

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
the spring on the inside of the hinge
and<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.910> might<00:00:39.090> make<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> difference<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.840> on

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
and that might make a difference just on

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.690 
and that might make a difference just on
how<00:00:40.290> effective<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.829> particular<00:00:41.100> tool<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
how effective this particular tool is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.350 
how effective this particular tool is
for<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.870> application<00:00:43.910> but<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.000> works<00:00:45.149> real

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
for that application but it works real

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.180 
for that application but it works real
well<00:00:45.390> when<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> hood<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.410> obviously<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
well when the hood is up obviously the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.290 
well when the hood is up obviously the
hinge<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.140> spring<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:50.090> contracted<00:00:51.090> and

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
hinge or the spring is contracted and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.260 
hinge or the spring is contracted and
short<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.219> we<00:00:53.219> need<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.640> able<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.850> pull<00:00:54.120> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
short and we need to be able to pull it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.000 
short and we need to be able to pull it
off<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> hood<00:00:55.559> goes<00:00:55.739> down

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
off of there so when the hood goes down

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.170 
off of there so when the hood goes down
the<00:00:56.969> spring<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.899> extended<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:58.949> longer<00:00:59.430> so

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the spring is extended and is longer so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.299 
the spring is extended and is longer so
in<00:01:00.809> order<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.110> be<00:01:01.199> able<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> use<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.800> tool<00:01:02.039> on

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
in order to be able to use this tool on

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.160 
in order to be able to use this tool on
this<00:01:02.699> application<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.449> put<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.780> hood<00:01:03.930> down

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
this application we put the hood down

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.929 
this application we put the hood down
and<00:01:04.559> we're<00:01:05.249> going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.399> put<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.639> down<00:01:05.759> just

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and we're going to put it down just

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.160 
and we're going to put it down just
enough<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.359> that<00:01:06.389> we<00:01:06.569> can<00:01:06.719> get<00:01:06.840> our<00:01:06.959> hands

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
enough so that we can get our hands

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.529 
enough so that we can get our hands
still<00:01:07.499> in<00:01:07.679> there<00:01:07.859> in<00:01:08.009> the<00:01:08.130> tool<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:09.420> we're

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
still in there in the tool and we're

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.999 
still in there in the tool and we're
going<00:01:09.569> to<00:01:09.749> wedge<00:01:09.929> this<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:11.929> to<00:01:12.929> those<00:01:13.170> expanded

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
going to wedge this in to those expanded

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:20.230 
going to wedge this in to those expanded
coils<00:01:17.569> and<00:01:18.569> get<00:01:18.749> it<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.959> there<00:01:19.079> real<00:01:19.289> good<00:01:19.319> deep

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
coils and get it in there real good deep

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.660 
coils and get it in there real good deep
you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.359> see<00:01:21.539> it<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.779> there<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.549> put<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you can see it in there and then put the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.649 
you can see it in there and then put the
hood<00:01:23.849> back<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.939> should<00:01:27.179> hold<00:01:27.389> that

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
hood back up and it should hold that

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.679 
hood back up and it should hold that
spring<00:01:28.079> and<00:01:28.380> an<00:01:28.529> extended<00:01:29.039> length<00:01:29.539> then<00:01:30.539> it

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
spring and an extended length then it

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.969 
spring and an extended length then it
does<00:01:31.039> and<00:01:32.039> it<00:01:32.189> comes<00:01:32.399> off<00:01:32.609> that<00:01:32.849> easy

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
does and it comes off that easy

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.419 
does and it comes off that easy
so<00:01:35.090> on<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.359> my<00:01:36.539> postings<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.429> message

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
so on one of my postings on the message

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.429 
so on one of my postings on the message
board<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.880> showed<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.419> the<00:01:39.740> modified<00:01:42.439> bumper

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
board I showed you the modified bumper

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.139 
board I showed you the modified bumper
jack<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.859> made<00:01:44.069> the<00:01:44.219> stretch<00:01:44.489> spring<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
jack that I made the stretch spring so I

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.519 
jack that I made the stretch spring so I
don't<00:01:45.299> need<00:01:45.389> to<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.599> that<00:01:45.749> again<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.349> but

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:46.529 
don't need to do that again for you but

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:49.320 
don't need to do that again for you but
then<00:01:46.679> of<00:01:46.799> course<00:01:46.969> just<00:01:47.969> as<00:01:48.119> easy

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
then of course just as easy

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.420 
then of course just as easy
you<00:01:49.930> can<00:01:50.110> put<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.410> back<00:01:50.560> on<00:01:50.800> there<00:01:51.070> in<00:01:51.280> its

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
you can put it back on there in its

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.650 
you can put it back on there in its
extended<00:01:52.300> position<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.670> think<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:55.030> need

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
extended position and I think you need

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.250 
extended position and I think you need
to<00:01:55.750> go<00:01:55.900> up<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.050> little<00:01:56.110> more<00:01:56.310> with<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.340> hood

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
to go up a little more with the hood

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.430 
to go up a little more with the hood
there<00:01:59.260> you<00:01:59.350> go<00:02:00.090> put<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.120> back<00:02:01.540> in<00:02:01.780> again<00:02:02.050> and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
there you go put that back in again and

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.600
