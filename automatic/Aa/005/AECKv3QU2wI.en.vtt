00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
building back I'm gonna do just a little

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.520 
building back I'm gonna do just a little
bit<00:00:43.829> different<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:44.809> somehow<00:00:45.809> her<00:00:46.110> window

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
bit different but somehow her window

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.240 
bit different but somehow her window
went<00:00:46.829> from<00:00:47.250> being<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.020> wall<00:00:49.230> she<00:00:49.920> pushed

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
went from being on the wall she pushed

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.639 
went from being on the wall she pushed
out<00:00:50.460> from<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> wall<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.719> saw<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.559> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
out from the wall so I saw that and I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.639 
out from the wall so I saw that and I
was<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:52.860> maybe<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:54.180> replicate<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.989> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
was like maybe I can replicate that you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.660 
was like maybe I can replicate that you
know<00:00:55.770> do<00:00:55.980> something<00:00:56.309> different<00:00:56.670> with<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:58.640> okay

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
know do something different with it okay

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.990 
know do something different with it okay
have<00:01:00.030> windows<00:01:02.000> okay<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:04.339> it's<00:01:05.339> been<00:01:05.610> kind<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
have windows okay so it's been kind of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.719 
have windows okay so it's been kind of
iffy<00:01:06.360> sometimes<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.140> wants<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.710> sometimes<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
iffy sometimes it wants to sometimes it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.320 
iffy sometimes it wants to sometimes it
doesn't

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
doesn't

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.250 
doesn't
what<00:01:09.869> she<00:01:10.020> did<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.409> she<00:01:10.439> hold<00:01:11.250> back<00:01:11.549> this<00:01:12.260> wall

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
what she did is she hold back this wall

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.179 
what she did is she hold back this wall
to<00:01:13.830> make<00:01:16.100> room<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.850> push<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> windows<00:01:19.290> out

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to make room and push the windows out

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.090 
to make room and push the windows out
like<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:22.490> okay<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.950> I'm

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
like that you see that okay so what I'm

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.300 
like that you see that okay so what I'm
gonna<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:27.799> go<00:01:28.799> go<00:01:29.009> back<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.630> Windows<00:01:30.630> and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
gonna do is go go back to Windows and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.050 
gonna do is go go back to Windows and
I'm<00:01:32.310> hoping<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.119> work<00:01:33.299> because<00:01:35.060> it's

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
I'm hoping this will work because it's

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.510 
I'm hoping this will work because it's
been<00:01:36.329> kind<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.750> iffy<00:01:37.409> if<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> wants<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.460> not

these real quick cuz I got the plane
around<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.980> found<00:02:37.220> something<00:02:37.700> else<00:02:37.849> while

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
around and I found something else while

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.849

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
doing this can't it glitch that one time

00:02:45.859 --> 00:03:01.990 
doing this can't it glitch that one time
it<00:02:46.010> goes<00:02:46.129> four<00:02:46.609> on<00:02:46.819> each<00:03:00.220> this<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.430> exciting

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:35.560
