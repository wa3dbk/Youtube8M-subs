00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.080
 Welcome to the modest Taste video recipes section 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.720
 we have a different vegetable recipe in this section 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.840
 "Tatar fries" will do 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.480
 But as always before the materials 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 40 pieces of dried pointed pepper 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560
 2 cups oil 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.080
 1 cup yogurt 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.400
 2 cloves of garlic 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.480
 and 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.720
 now we can go by the fire now 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.120
 First of all, we leave the dry peppers in the pot. 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.720
 hot water 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.600
 and soften until soft 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 15 minutes later 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.600
 peppers 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 we close the fire, we take the water 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 and wait for the water to drain completely 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.520
 we put the pan in the fire 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.520
 I prefer a small pan 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.440
 Now we'll make deep frying 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.720
 Welcome 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.000
 chillies after we whisked ... 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 now we can fry in hot oil 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.760
 Our fries were very nice 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.600
 now we can take it to the serving plate 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.040
 As the last stage of Tatar fries ... 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.040
 we continue preparing our garlic yogurt 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.600
 yogurt into a mixing bowl 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.080
 add as much salt as we desire 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.240
 and adding garlic 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.600
 we're just a nice flap until it's no more rough 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.160
 sufficient 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.400
 let's pour over our fries now 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.720
 glorious flavor 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.680
 We have shared a different recipe in the kitchen of Modest Tastes. 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.440
 "Tatar fries" 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.440
 I wish you to try and remember as soon as possible 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.280
 Good bye
