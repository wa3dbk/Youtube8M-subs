00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.760
 some at the mwc 2015 we are at 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.139
 lenovo lenovo has a lot here 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.839
 interesting smartphones presented 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.779
 that they do not get that far 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.029
 So have the specification 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.980
 Medium to upper class wants to be 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.669
 not so accurate here are 64 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.500
 bit snapdragon 615 processor in it 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.430
 the whole thing is running smoothly here 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.010
 is synonymous, inter alia, that here 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.300
 Android 5.0 already installed me 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.370
 I just wanted to show you I think so 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.500
 but not we have capacitive down below 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.219
 buttons so you can not be as accurate 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.420
 now sometimes a little 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.309
 harder through the menus too 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.449
 because they either do not navigate now 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.309
 are lit or the lighting 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:50.309
 but it does not matter 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.350
 we are full in full hd display ps 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.769
 colors good views from the side 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.079
 The device feels relatively edgy 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.390
 And that is because I'm in 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.859
 send metal frames also have like 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.749
 said not necessarily rounded 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.180
 up here but the jack hit here 

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.940
 below name micro usb connector this 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.520
 are apparently stereo speakers on 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.110
 on the left side we have a spot 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.000
 There are never two slots for sim cards 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.190
 of course, questionable 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.600
 depending on the country version what was there because 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.000
 now just like many sim cards after 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.280
 income volume rocker power button 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.880
 and here it gets right now 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.770
 interesting and we have here 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.940
 a dedicated camera button and the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.550
 is a small toggle switch i believe 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.050
 Here you can between the so-called 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.910
 In between such a profi mode and 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.560
 a beginner mode of everything itself 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.840
 makes switch yes but what is for 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.570
 this mode simply the device 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.090
 makes from behind quite the impression 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.520
 a compact camera and that is also 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.990
 not least because that's really here 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.880
 interesting camera specifications in it 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.440
 are built so this is a 16 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.430
 megapixel camera with optical 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.280
 image stabilizer 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.560
 here we have threefold 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.690
 LED's vacancy can really pay 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.770
 even dark scenes very beautiful 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.420
 light 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.909
 yes this is the one behind 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.250
 glass surface under here is a 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.690
 little metal is processed 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.259
 But you are not a transition, but you are 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.940
 there's still some grass left over there and that 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.860
 what the camera does matter is that 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.830
 They really very good photos 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.090
 shoots I just tried it 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.550
 on the back that they are very 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.080
 very sharp 16 megapixel as I said but 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.300
 also the front camera which has neat 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.650
 what on it and that I show you that 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.500
 unfortunately flickers here are unfortunately 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.810
 because of the fair light on the front 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.580
 camera there is my mate child channel 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.190
 and our led light and lenovo 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.440
 also sells such an accessory 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.260
 additional part that calls itself far 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.420
 you can delete extension proserv here 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.319
 see on the basis of this 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.380
 small advertising 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.330
 that is a kind of essay for the 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.680
 jack plug from it also electricity 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.160
 refers and thus really fast 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.840
 really bright lights and health service 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.140
 really well lit I am doing now 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.540
 Here is a test photo and then 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.659
 Let's take a look 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.530
 Now it's from Canada 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.239
 or not at all in the gallery 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.620
 but it does not matter if you do not care 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.060
 what we miss anywhere else in with us 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.409
 youtube channel you can have here 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.180
 subscribe to us over there there is one 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.590
 head and down here you know that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.719
 youtube there's and thing there you can 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.370

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.870
