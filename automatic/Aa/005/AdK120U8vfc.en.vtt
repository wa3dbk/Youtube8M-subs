00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello everyone with you channel junk i 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.640
 Today I will tell you about the converter 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.050
 most likely if you watch this video 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.389
 Before you got a choice what to buy 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.400
 converter or oil heater but 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.160
 Looking ahead I will immediately say that the converter 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.640
 wins in many ways since 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:26.279
 having an oil heater is what 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.830
 compare that is , we have a much converter 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.420
 Looks neater you can it 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.260
 put like the olives heater on 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.050
 wheel 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:43.860
 can be mounted on the wall here with 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:45.570
 here these are the guides of what's wrong 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.780
 oil heater oil on knock out 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.460
 or copper too high temperature then 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.620
 there is oil inside the heater 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.360
 warms up almost to boiling 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.710
 states and thus the metal 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.230
 on the oil heater can 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.809
 microcracks appear due to these 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.760
 microcrack oil can evaporate can 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.890
 flow out 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.420
 that is, you will not fill up the oil there 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.259
 and and he will simply become worthless 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.189
 take him to the dump and all the converter 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.229
 inside has only a temperature sensor and 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:26.549
 about heating element heating 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.220
 the element is made of metals with high 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.310
 the degree of return that is aluminum 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.829
 silumin or copper has quite such 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.810
 nice aesthetic appearance of the front 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.000
 metal backing panels become this 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.680
 swept away radiator guides 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.960
 grating where it comes from 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.190
 hot air from the top 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.619
 there is a temperature adjustment and a button 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.290
 Inclusions Incidentally firm balu Russian 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:02.290
 the manufacturer is completely satisfied with her on the left 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.350
 more precisely the right waterproof button has 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.670
 3 position two 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:13.890
 0 that is disabled and the unit to unit 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.290
 given this device we spend 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.360
 500 watts of electricity per hour and per 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.610
 two he spends a thousand watts 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.680
 electricity per hour has an energy class 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.370
 of protection 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.420
 1 well, in principle, all that is here 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.480
 need to know what is written on the sticker 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.900
 rated power is not so interesting 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.840
 voltage moisture protection simple 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.370
 construction is very simple design and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.459
 high degree 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.430
 heating that is 15 20 square 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.320
 meters of room you more than enough 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.110
 the output of such a small neat 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.730
 the converter is almost impossible 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.160
 get burned but again this is a stick of two 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.560
 the ends to compare if with oil 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.299
 Of course it is very difficult to burn yourself 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.140
 I think you can get burned if you 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:17.739
 turn on full power and 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:19.630
 per kilowatt is a very good machine 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.510
 Well, I think that he is not only 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.880
 aesthetic but also for efficiency wins 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:29.049
 u oil heater oil 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.170
 the heater gets too hot 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.769
 if you have small children I think 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.019
 what better to buy here 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.790
 converter how converter is fashionable 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.970
 the word envelope again it's called 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.910
 household electric heater 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:49.959
 brackets converter what he did in 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:54.880
 Russia did not bother me at all because 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:58.959
 the design inside is too simple 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.910
 and break there is nothing to wait for new 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.590
