00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
I've got to level 35 and I haven't even

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.490

used<00:00:41.790> yet<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> complete<00:00:43.170> waste<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
used yet and it was a complete waste of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.889 
used yet and it was a complete waste of
time<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:43.890> using<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> start<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.210> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
time not using this at the start and I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.180 
time not using this at the start and I
realized<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.350> should<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.649> spent<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.010> on

realized that I should have spent it on

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.880 
realized that I should have spent it on
the<00:00:47.340> an-94<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> EMP<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.050> there's<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
the an-94 not the EMP so there's the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.160 
the an-94 not the EMP so there's the
reason<00:00:50.129> I'm<00:00:50.280> using<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.610> m27<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> mtar<00:00:51.989> so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
reason I'm using the m27 and the mtar so

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.049 
reason I'm using the m27 and the mtar so
anyway<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.309> play<00:00:53.430> i'm<00:00:53.610> using<00:00:53.940> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
about this dlc a few days ago and I

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.529 
about this dlc a few days ago and I
wasn't<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.430> spend<00:01:02.670> any<00:01:03.000> money<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.359> each

but<00:03:10.940> I<00:03:10.970> still<00:03:11.150> think<00:03:11.330> it's<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> bit<00:03:11.660> sneaky<00:03:11.840> the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
but I still think it's a bit sneaky the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.770 
but I still think it's a bit sneaky the
triac<00:03:12.500> don't<00:03:13.160> even<00:03:13.670> give<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.390> season<00:03:14.660> pass

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780

probably<00:03:16.519> Activision's<00:03:17.180> decision<00:03:17.750> not<00:03:18.350> to

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
probably Activision's decision not to

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.560 
probably Activision's decision not to
