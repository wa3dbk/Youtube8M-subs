dark what's the point right so the fact
of<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.280> buttons<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.090> know<00:02:06.180> are<00:02:06.329> eliminated

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
of the buttons you know are eliminated

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.600 
of the buttons you know are eliminated
you<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.710> what<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:07.950> are<00:02:08.069> that's<00:02:08.310> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
you can see see what they are that's a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.630 
you can see see what they are that's a
big<00:02:08.879> plus

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.410 

I<00:02:11.700> don't<00:02:12.030> know<00:02:12.120> what<00:02:12.920> an<00:02:14.150> internal<00:02:15.150> sound

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
I don't know what an internal sound

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.150 
I don't know what an internal sound
generator<00:02:16.020> now<00:02:16.319> see<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> don't<00:02:16.680> understand

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
generator now see I don't understand

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.110 
generator now see I don't understand
what<00:02:17.280> that's<00:02:17.430> for<00:02:20.120> sheezy<00:02:22.790> I'll<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.030> look

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
what that's for sheezy I'll have to look

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.100 
what that's for sheezy I'll have to look
into<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.569> see<00:02:24.630> what<00:02:24.720> that's<00:02:24.900> all<00:02:25.050> about

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
into that and see what that's all about

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.720 
into that and see what that's all about
it<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:26.130> now<00:02:26.160> any<00:02:26.550> information<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:28.730> Roy

it right now any information on that Roy

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.570 
it right now any information on that Roy
buildings<00:02:30.270> you<00:02:30.470> insured<00:02:31.470> was<00:02:31.650> improved<00:02:32.070> hot

camera that's always a plus because

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.660 
camera that's always a plus because
you've<00:02:43.980> got<00:02:44.690> something<00:02:46.100> you've<00:02:47.100> got<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.280> heavy

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
you've got something you've got to heavy

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.540

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
objects connected to each other but yet

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.600 
objects connected to each other but yet
normally<00:02:51.120> it's<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:52.739> thinnest<00:02:53.160> part<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.489> its

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
normally it's the thinnest part of its

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.890 
normally it's the thinnest part of its
which<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.820> where<00:02:54.030> they<00:02:54.120> actually<00:02:54.239> connect<00:02:54.810> to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
which is where they actually connect to

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.810 
which is where they actually connect to
each<00:02:54.989> other<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.470> anything<00:02:56.459> they<00:02:56.550> can<00:02:56.700> do<00:02:56.790> to

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
each other so anything they can do to

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.180 
each other so anything they can do to
improve<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.989> in<00:02:58.200> my<00:02:58.320> opinion<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.890> good

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
improve that is in my opinion is a good

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.710 
improve that is in my opinion is a good
thing<00:03:01.670> flush<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.880> improve<00:03:03.269> flash<00:03:03.510> yet

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
thing flush it improve flash yet

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.890 
thing flush it improve flash yet
durability<00:03:04.110> that's<00:03:04.470> good<00:03:05.390> they<00:03:06.390> had<00:03:06.540> improved

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
durability that's good they had improved

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.229

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
sealing that's obviously good and then

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.240

that<00:03:24.620> that's<00:03:25.620> good<00:03:25.860> I<00:03:25.920> guess<00:03:26.040> um<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:28.100> mean<00:03:29.100> I

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
that that's good I guess um I mean I

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.850 
that that's good I guess um I mean I
guess<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:31.829> good<00:03:32.010> hey<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.630> obviously<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.530> put

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
guess it's good hey so obviously I put

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.150 
guess it's good hey so obviously I put
something<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.250> makes<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.549> worse<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:37.160> overall

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
something that makes it worse so overall

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.850 
something that makes it worse so overall
it<00:03:38.730> looks<00:03:38.760> nice<00:03:39.329> I'm<00:03:40.230> sure<00:03:40.530> it'll<00:03:40.680> do

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
it looks nice I'm sure it'll do

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.920 
it looks nice I'm sure it'll do
everything<00:03:41.190> my<00:03:41.459> career<00:03:42.150> horrible<00:03:42.510> down<00:03:42.690> and

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
everything my career horrible down and

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.440 
everything my career horrible down and
then<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.950> then<00:03:44.549> some<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:45.060> mean<00:03:45.209> it's<00:03:45.329> basically

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
then and then some I mean it's basically

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.199 
then and then some I mean it's basically
is<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.769> worth<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.130> price<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.400> upgrading<00:03:48.000> from

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
is it worth the price of upgrading from

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.150 
is it worth the price of upgrading from
what<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> have<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.320> this<00:03:49.500> yeah<00:03:50.220> probably<00:03:50.910> not<00:03:52.160> if

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
what I have to this yeah probably not if

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.289 
what I have to this yeah probably not if
I<00:03:53.280> had<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.489> money<00:03:53.519> what<00:03:53.880> I'd<00:03:53.970> do<00:03:54.150> it

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
I had the money what I'd do it

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.190 
I had the money what I'd do it
absolutely<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.290> would<00:03:55.530> upgrade<00:03:56.870> because<00:03:57.870> I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
absolutely I would upgrade because I

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.810 
absolutely I would upgrade because I
like<00:03:58.350> it's<00:03:58.650> probably<00:03:59.040> I'm<00:03:59.310> sure<00:03:59.340> to<00:03:59.579> feel<00:03:59.730> me

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
like it's probably I'm sure to feel me

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.930 
like it's probably I'm sure to feel me
faster<00:04:00.150> what<00:04:00.329> I've<00:04:00.420> got<00:04:01.760> because<00:04:02.760> they're

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
faster what I've got because they're

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.009 
faster what I've got because they're

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
so I'm sure this is a lot faster what

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.180 
so I'm sure this is a lot faster what
I've<00:04:24.070> got<00:04:24.220> now<00:04:24.900> but<00:04:25.900> one<00:04:26.440> ounce<00:04:26.740> pretty<00:04:27.040> good

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
but again we're going to spend the money

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.120
