on Android but you have to go to the at
the<00:00:39.630> island<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.470> sign<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.489> hold<00:00:41.700> on

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.939 
really weird symbol then after you have
to<00:00:44.969> click<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.300> number<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.410> will<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.920> know

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
to click a number and it will you know

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.849 
to click a number and it will you know
like<00:00:47.429> show<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.969> color<00:00:48.179> so<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.929> is<00:00:49.109> that

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
like show up a color so this is that

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.639 
like show up a color so this is that
black<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.699> black<00:00:51.109> color<00:00:52.109> is<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
black that black color is like the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.069 
black that black color is like the
original<00:00:53.309> kind<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.789> color<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.179> all<00:00:54.629> over<00:00:54.899> that

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
original kind of color and all over that

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.349 
original kind of color and all over that
you<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> blue<00:00:55.679> so<00:00:56.309> every<00:00:57.030> different

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
you see the blue so every different

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.579 
you see the blue so every different
number<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.839> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.109> different<00:00:58.350> colors

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
number it's going to be different colors

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.619 
number it's going to be different colors
so<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.070> blue<00:00:59.309> two<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.969> green<00:01:00.239> over<00:01:00.600> here

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
so one was blue two is green over here

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.760 
so one was blue two is green over here
and<00:01:01.339> try<00:01:02.339> one<00:01:02.519> more<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:06.380> do<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.440> again<00:01:07.620> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and try one more and do it again and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.649 
and try one more and do it again and
three<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.190> think<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.730> going<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.270> yeah

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
three I think is going to be yeah

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.960 
three I think is going to be yeah
probably<00:01:10.290> turquoise<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.159> think<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.790> yeah

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
probably turquoise I think that yeah

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.310 
probably turquoise I think that yeah
that's<00:01:12.060> kind<00:01:12.300> of<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.450> turquoise<00:01:12.720> are<00:01:13.110> really

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
that's kind of like turquoise are really

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.859 
that's kind of like turquoise are really
light<00:01:13.470> blue<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.980> um<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.330> yeah<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> guess<00:01:15.720> this

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
light blue and um so yeah I guess this

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.120 
light blue and um so yeah I guess this
is<00:01:15.930> pretty<00:01:16.079> cool<00:01:16.290> trick<00:01:16.590> it'll<00:01:16.890> help<00:01:17.040> with

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
is pretty cool trick it'll help with

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.399 
is pretty cool trick it'll help with
servers<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.909> stuff<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.960> guess<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.259> just

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
servers and stuff it I guess it just

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.590 
servers and stuff it I guess it just
helps<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.040> great<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.549> don't<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.210> your<00:01:21.450> world
