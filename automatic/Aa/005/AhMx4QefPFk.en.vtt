00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the ring here is repainted because it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.069 
the ring here is repainted because it
chipped<00:00:49.770> off<00:00:49.950> really<00:00:50.610> badly<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.930> did

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
chipped off really badly so I did

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.220 
chipped off really badly so I did
spray-painted<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:52.890> sadly<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:54.079> don't<00:00:55.079> know

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
spray-painted but sadly I don't know

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.200 
spray-painted but sadly I don't know
what<00:00:55.469> happened<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.100> didn't<00:00:56.460> come<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.699> smooth

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
what happened it didn't come out smooth

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.840 
what happened it didn't come out smooth
it<00:00:57.600> looks<00:00:57.809> fine<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:59.100> mean<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.670> as

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
it looks fine but I mean it's not as

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.540 
it looks fine but I mean it's not as
smooth<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.539> was<00:01:00.780> before<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.460> of

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
smooth as it was before so that kind of

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.920 
smooth as it was before so that kind of
sucks<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.059> mean<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.329> looks<00:01:03.480> way<00:01:03.750> better

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
sucks but I mean it looks way better

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.109 
sucks but I mean it looks way better
than<00:01:04.229> having<00:01:04.409> silver<00:01:04.979> chunks<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.369> there<00:01:05.519> but

you know I'm pretty sure I have enough
RAM<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:14.970> but<00:02:15.270> anyways<00:02:15.900> that'sthat's

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
not what you're here for

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.950 
not what you're here for
the<00:02:17.130> unboxing<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.850> thing<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.420> only<00:02:18.450> thing<00:02:18.660> I

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
the unboxing the thing the only thing I

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.080 
the unboxing the thing the only thing I
believe<00:02:19.140> I<00:02:19.500> don't<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:20.010> here<00:02:20.220> are<00:02:20.820> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
believe I don't have in here are the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.680 
believe I don't have in here are the
instructions<00:02:21.410> which<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.760> ran<00:02:24.360> into

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
instructions which I do have I ran into

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.780 
instructions which I do have I ran into
them<00:02:24.840> not<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.170> long<00:02:25.320> ago<00:02:25.350> but<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.790> misplaced

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
them not that long ago but I misplaced

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.330 
them not that long ago but I misplaced
them<00:02:27.060> right<00:02:27.330> after<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> ran<00:02:28.140> into<00:02:28.350> them<00:02:28.560> so

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
them right after I ran into them so

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.960 
them right after I ran into them so
they're<00:02:29.460> probably<00:02:29.580> somewhere<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.360> my<00:02:30.480> closets

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
they're probably somewhere in my closets

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.180 
they're probably somewhere in my closets
so<00:02:33.020> hopefully<00:02:34.020> eventually<00:02:34.290> they'll<00:02:34.680> find<00:02:35.100> a

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
so hopefully eventually they'll find a

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.110 
so hopefully eventually they'll find a
way<00:02:35.220> inside<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.910> box<00:02:36.500> anyways<00:02:37.970> it's<00:02:38.970> like

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
way inside this box anyways it's like

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.860 
way inside this box anyways it's like
weird<00:02:39.600> how<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.750> opens<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:44.870> cardboard

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
weird how it opens like that cardboard

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.240 
weird how it opens like that cardboard
here<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:48.560> believe<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.770> just<00:02:49.950> slide

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
here so just I believe you just slide

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.140 
here so just I believe you just slide
everything<00:02:50.640> yep<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:52.500> light<00:02:52.680> everything<00:02:53.100> out

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.010 

it's<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.240> cardboard<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.720> believe<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
it's a cardboard I believe the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.390 
it's a cardboard I believe the
instructions<00:02:58.440> were<00:02:58.560> like<00:02:58.680> right<00:02:58.860> behind<00:02:59.190> this

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
instructions were like right behind this

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.190 
instructions were like right behind this
and<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.790> came<00:03:00.000> wrapped<00:03:00.510> actually<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:02.760> this

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
and this came wrapped actually in this

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.910 
and this came wrapped actually in this
little<00:03:04.200> paper<00:03:04.440> thingy<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:07.290> desk<00:03:07.560> didn't

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
little paper thingy so the desk didn't

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.270 
little paper thingy so the desk didn't
come<00:03:08.100> bare<00:03:08.340> like<00:03:08.550> this<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:09.210> so<00:03:09.960> you<00:03:09.990> know<00:03:10.280> in

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
come bare like this just so you know in

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.650 
come bare like this just so you know in
case<00:03:11.340> you're<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.910> know<00:03:12.030> wandering<00:03:12.450> or

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
case you're you know wandering or

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.190 
case you're you know wandering or
something

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
something

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.640 
something
there's<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.980> under<00:03:14.310> part<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:15.600> then<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.380> disc

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
there's the under part and then the disc

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.550 
there's the under part and then the disc
which<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.630> believe<00:03:18.630> even<00:03:19.230> though<00:03:19.350> it's

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
which I believe even though it's

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.480 
which I believe even though it's
scratched<00:03:20.100> up<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:21.120> believe<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.810> still<00:03:21.990> works

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
scratched up and believe it still works

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.280 
scratched up and believe it still works
I<00:03:23.490> am<00:03:23.760> planning<00:03:24.390> on<00:03:24.540> getting<00:03:24.660> an<00:03:24.870> adapter

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
I am planning on getting an adapter

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.150 
I am planning on getting an adapter
since<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:25.560> like<00:03:25.650> 2<00:03:25.800> bucks

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
since it's like 2 bucks

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.270 
since it's like 2 bucks
a<00:03:26.280> serial<00:03:26.850> adapter<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.720> 2<00:03:28.350> USB<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.920> see<00:03:29.100> if

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
a serial adapter and 2 USB to see if

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280 
a serial adapter and 2 USB to see if
this<00:03:29.580> will<00:03:29.790> connect<00:03:30.150> at<00:03:30.420> all<00:03:30.540> even<00:03:31.050> though<00:03:31.260> I

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
this will connect at all even though I

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.780 
this will connect at all even though I
know<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.530> servers<00:03:32.010> for<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.310> game<00:03:32.459> are<00:03:32.640> shut

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
know the servers for the game are shut

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.470 
know the servers for the game are shut
down<00:03:33.380> just<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.470> see<00:03:34.500> if<00:03:34.830> it'll<00:03:35.010> connect<00:03:35.400> by<00:03:36.300> any

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
down just to see if it'll connect by any

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
down just to see if it'll connect by any
chance<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:38.010> wire<00:03:38.610> for<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:40.850> which<00:03:41.850> is<00:03:42.090> cool

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
chance the wire for it which is cool

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.860 
chance the wire for it which is cool
looks<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.590> lot<00:03:43.860> like<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.220> VGA<00:03:44.970> cable<00:03:45.060> wire<00:03:45.600> but

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
looks a lot like a VGA cable wire but

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.980 
looks a lot like a VGA cable wire but
it's<00:03:46.020> not<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:47.790> blue<00:03:48.000> card<00:03:48.270> which<00:03:48.480> my<00:03:48.720> blue

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
it's not the blue card which my blue

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.210 
it's not the blue card which my blue
card<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.530> definitely<00:03:49.950> showing<00:03:51.770> some<00:03:52.770> damage

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
card is definitely showing some damage

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.730 
card is definitely showing some damage
you<00:03:53.400> know<00:03:53.580> right<00:03:53.760> there<00:03:54.000> but<00:03:54.690> uh<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:55.620> know

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
you know right there but uh you know

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
you know right there but uh you know
it's<00:03:55.920> still<00:03:56.190> in<00:03:56.490> one<00:03:56.880> piece<00:03:57.209> which<00:03:57.990> is<00:03:58.020> cool

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
it's still in one piece which is cool

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.980 
it's still in one piece which is cool
