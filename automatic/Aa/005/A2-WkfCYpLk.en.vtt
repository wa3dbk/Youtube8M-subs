00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
is he's just a kid he's he's still got

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.969 
is he's just a kid he's he's still got
it<00:05:34.699> I<00:05:35.029> told<00:05:35.689> him<00:05:35.839> the<00:05:35.989> other<00:05:36.079> night<00:05:36.199> you<00:05:36.889> know

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
it I told him the other night you know

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.100 
it I told him the other night you know
he<00:05:37.039> had<00:05:37.069> made<00:05:37.279> a<00:05:37.309> basket<00:05:37.549> yet<00:05:37.939> means<00:05:38.299> he's<00:05:38.869> the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
he had made a basket yet means he's the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.579 
he had made a basket yet means he's the
tension<00:05:39.439> he's<00:05:39.559> received<00:05:39.979> is<00:05:40.189> based<00:05:40.909> on

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:41.589 
tension he's received is based on

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:43.509 
tension he's received is based on
potential<00:05:42.589> it's<00:05:42.709> not<00:05:42.829> based<00:05:43.069> on<00:05:43.279> anything

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:43.519 
potential it's not based on anything

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:46.959 
potential it's not based on anything
he's<00:05:43.759> done<00:05:43.969> so<00:05:45.189> you<00:05:46.189> know<00:05:46.279> I<00:05:46.339> but<00:05:46.610> I<00:05:46.639> think<00:05:46.699> he

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
he's done so you know I but I think he

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:48.399 
he's done so you know I but I think he
should<00:05:47.149> welcome<00:05:47.329> the<00:05:47.569> expectations<00:05:48.229> I<00:05:48.289> don't

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
should welcome the expectations I don't

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:49.989 
should welcome the expectations I don't
think<00:05:48.559> there's<00:05:48.679> any<00:05:48.860> reason<00:05:49.009> try<00:05:49.519> to<00:05:49.579> run<00:05:49.819> from

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:49.999 
think there's any reason try to run from

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:51.369 
think there's any reason try to run from
them<00:05:50.179> because<00:05:50.449> he's<00:05:50.809> going<00:05:50.959> to<00:05:51.019> have<00:05:51.110> them<00:05:51.229> no

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:51.379 
them because he's going to have them no

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.309 
them because he's going to have them no
matter<00:05:51.499> what<00:05:51.619> so<00:05:52.539> we'll<00:05:53.539> talk<00:05:53.689> more<00:05:53.929> as<00:05:54.079> we<00:05:54.199> get

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
matter what so we'll talk more as we get

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:55.809 
matter what so we'll talk more as we get
closer<00:05:54.589> on<00:05:54.829> the<00:05:54.919> best<00:05:55.099> way<00:05:55.219> to<00:05:55.279> have<00:05:55.789> a

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
closer on the best way to have a

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:58.149 
closer on the best way to have a
strategy<00:05:56.239> on<00:05:56.419> handling<00:05:56.779> things<00:05:57.019> but<00:05:57.319> I<00:05:57.529> do

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:58.159 
strategy on handling things but I do

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:59.679 
strategy on handling things but I do
kind<00:05:58.459> of<00:05:58.610> think<00:05:59.149> that's<00:05:59.360> going<00:05:59.509> to<00:05:59.569> be<00:05:59.659> a

00:05:59.679 --> 00:05:59.689 
kind of think that's going to be a

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.199 
kind of think that's going to be a
situation<00:06:00.289> where<00:06:00.469> you<00:06:01.309> know<00:06:01.429> players<00:06:01.999> can

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:02.209 
situation where you know players can

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:04.059 
situation where you know players can
have<00:06:02.419> rock<00:06:02.629> star<00:06:02.899> status<00:06:03.019> or<00:06:03.469> whatnot<00:06:03.649> but<00:06:03.979> I

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:04.069 
have rock star status or whatnot but I

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:05.259 
have rock star status or whatnot but I
think<00:06:04.309> this<00:06:04.429> could<00:06:04.639> be<00:06:04.669> a<00:06:04.789> little<00:06:04.999> bit

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:05.269 
think this could be a little bit

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:08.739 
think this could be a little bit
ridiculous<00:06:06.759> if<00:06:07.759> he<00:06:07.969> lets<00:06:08.179> it<00:06:08.300> get<00:06:08.449> to<00:06:08.629> him

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:08.749 
ridiculous if he lets it get to him

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.079 
ridiculous if he lets it get to him
because<00:06:09.219> he<00:06:10.219> just<00:06:10.399> wants<00:06:10.610> to<00:06:10.699> be<00:06:10.789> he<00:06:10.939> just

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:11.089 
because he just wants to be he just

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:12.549 
because he just wants to be he just
wanted<00:06:11.239> to<00:06:11.329> come<00:06:11.419> here<00:06:11.629> and<00:06:11.749> enjoy<00:06:12.019> the<00:06:12.319> summer

00:06:12.549 --> 00:06:12.559 
wanted to come here and enjoy the summer

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.649 
wanted to come here and enjoy the summer
and<00:06:12.919> hopefully<00:06:13.789> people<00:06:13.939> allowed<00:06:14.360> him<00:06:14.479> to<00:06:14.539> do

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:14.659 
and hopefully people allowed him to do

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:17.709 
and hopefully people allowed him to do
that<00:06:15.610> it's<00:06:16.610> a<00:06:16.699> sort<00:06:17.089> of<00:06:17.119> this<00:06:17.300> one<00:06:17.479> you<00:06:17.569> got

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
that it's a sort of this one you got

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.629
