jtagging<00:00:13.889> tutorial<00:00:14.429> whatever<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.820> want<00:00:14.969> to

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
jtagging tutorial whatever you want to

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.310 
jtagging tutorial whatever you want to
call<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:16.279> so<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.240> finished<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> solder

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
call it so we just finished the solder

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.660 
call it so we just finished the solder
and<00:00:19.529> all<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> points<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.369> motherboard

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
and all the points to the motherboard

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.990 
and all the points to the motherboard
and<00:00:21.090> now<00:00:21.330> we're<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.750> starting<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.220> other

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
and now we're just starting a the other

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.950 
and now we're just starting a the other
ends<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> wires<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.109> pleasure<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
ends of the wires to the pleasure and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.769 
ends of the wires to the pleasure and
again<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:29.000> this<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.480> easy

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
again this this is this is really easy

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.840 
again this this is this is really easy
compared<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.410> starting<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> board<00:00:32.700> just

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
compared to starting to the board just

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.780 
compared to starting to the board just
because<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.780> mean<00:00:34.649> there's<00:00:35.219> nothing<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.670> your

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
because I mean there's nothing in your

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:44.920 
because I mean there's nothing in your
way<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:37.140> easy<00:00:37.550> oh<00:00:39.379> yeah<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:42.090> basically

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930

video<00:02:17.819> i'm<00:02:18.239> using<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.780> pretty<00:02:19.079> big<00:02:19.760> filtering

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
video i'm using a pretty big filtering

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.089 
video i'm using a pretty big filtering
iron<00:02:20.910> as<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.299> can<00:02:21.450> see<00:02:23.690> if<00:02:24.769> you<00:02:25.769> haven't

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
iron as you can see if you haven't

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.470 
iron as you can see if you haven't
bought<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.430> parts<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.000> tools<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.450> need

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
bought the parts of the tools you need

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.360 
bought the parts of the tools you need
yet<00:02:27.870> i<00:02:28.110> would<00:02:28.319> definitely<00:02:28.620> recommend<00:02:28.799> buying

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
yet i would definitely recommend buying

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.630 
yet i would definitely recommend buying
a<00:02:29.519> fine<00:02:29.819> tip<00:02:30.739> soldiering<00:02:31.739> iron<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.280> because

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
a fine tip soldiering iron just because

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.759 
a fine tip soldiering iron just because
it<00:02:32.910> would<00:02:33.090> make<00:02:33.299> things<00:02:33.359> a<00:02:33.750> lot<00:02:33.989> easier<00:02:34.049> and

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
it would make things a lot easier and

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.500 
it would make things a lot easier and
yeah<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.510> would<00:02:36.690> also<00:02:36.750> recommend<00:02:36.959> using

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
yeah and I would also recommend using

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.930 
yeah and I would also recommend using
really<00:02:39.510> really<00:02:39.810> thin<00:02:40.049> rosin<00:02:40.590> core<00:02:40.940> solder

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
really really thin rosin core solder

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.629 
really really thin rosin core solder
just<00:02:42.599> because<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.530> would<00:02:43.709> also<00:02:44.010> make<00:02:44.370> things

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
just because that would also make things

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:57.410 
just because that would also make things
easier<00:02:46.609> yeah<00:02:47.630> that's<00:02:48.630> uh<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:51.739> yeah

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.140 

so<00:02:57.990> right<00:02:58.170> here<00:02:58.380> I'm<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.040> know

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
soldering all the points to the flesh

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.410 
soldering all the points to the flesh
and<00:03:01.890> everything<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:04.819> rushed<00:03:05.819> a<00:03:06.030> lot<00:03:06.239> on

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
and everything and I rushed a lot on

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.380 
and everything and I rushed a lot on
this<00:03:06.540> video<00:03:07.020> like<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:08.099> you<00:03:08.880> can<00:03:09.060> take<00:03:09.239> your

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
this video like you you can take your

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.350 
this video like you you can take your
time<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.870> mean<00:03:10.050> I<00:03:10.430> recently<00:03:11.430> had<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.849> jtag

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
time I mean I recently had a jtag

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.190 
time I mean I recently had a jtag
another<00:03:12.660> console<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:14.600> didn't<00:03:15.600> record<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.050> or

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
another console I didn't record it or

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.290 
another console I didn't record it or
anything<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.520> think<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.819> took<00:03:17.940> me<00:03:18.150> about

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
anything and I think it took me about

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.690 
anything and I think it took me about
hours<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.410> take<00:03:19.890> care<00:03:20.069> of<00:03:20.130> all<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.489> sudden

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
hours to take care of all the sudden

hours to take care of all the sudden

when I did this I only followed the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.940 
when I did this I only followed the
diagrams<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.630> didn't<00:03:36.989> watch<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.440> video<00:03:37.830> or

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
anything you don't even need a diagram

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.979 
anything you don't even need a diagram
or<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.200> video<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:41.190> be<00:03:41.310> honest<00:03:41.640> it's<00:03:41.880> just<00:03:41.989> it's

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
or a video to be honest it's just it's

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.300 
or a video to be honest it's just it's
pretty<00:03:43.260> self-explanatory<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.600> yeah<00:03:45.600> I<00:03:46.310> would

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
pretty self-explanatory but yeah I would

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.000 
pretty self-explanatory but yeah I would
recommend<00:03:47.880> just<00:03:48.239> using<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.630> diagram<00:03:49.140> instead

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
recommend just using the diagram instead

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.170 
recommend just using the diagram instead
of<00:03:51.799> instead<00:03:52.799> of<00:03:52.950> trying<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.489> go<00:03:53.610> off<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.819> this

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
of instead of trying to go off of this

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.729 
of instead of trying to go off of this
video<00:03:55.370> but<00:03:56.370> yeah<00:03:58.370> but<00:03:59.370> as<00:03:59.580> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.880> see<00:04:00.060> here<00:04:00.480> I

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
video but yeah but as you can see here I

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.560 
video but yeah but as you can see here I
started<00:04:01.739> all<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.010> points<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.090> I'm

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
started all the points to it and I'm

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.630 
started all the points to it and I'm
just<00:04:04.019> making<00:04:04.380> sure<00:04:04.440> there's<00:04:04.829> no<00:04:05.220> solder

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
just making sure there's no solder

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.910 
just making sure there's no solder
touching<00:04:06.570> any<00:04:06.810> other<00:04:07.079> solder<00:04:07.440> porn<00:04:07.799> or

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
touching any other solder porn or

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.590 
touching any other solder porn or
anything<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.940> need<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.209> make<00:04:09.390> sure<00:04:09.420> that

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
anything you need to make sure that

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.500 
anything you need to make sure that

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
because something could go pretty wrong

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.779
