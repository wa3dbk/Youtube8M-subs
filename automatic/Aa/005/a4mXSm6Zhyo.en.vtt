pros<00:01:04.210> color<00:01:05.210> scheme<00:01:05.570> definitely<00:01:06.080> stone

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
pros color scheme definitely stone

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.150 
pros color scheme definitely stone
stones<00:01:07.789> can<00:01:07.970> be<00:01:08.090> brown<00:01:08.470> might<00:01:09.470> also<00:01:09.649> work<00:01:09.950> for

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
stones can be brown might also work for

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.050 
stones can be brown might also work for
dirt<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.700> course<00:01:11.090> because<00:01:11.270> dirt<00:01:12.259> can<00:01:12.440> be<00:01:12.470> brown

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
dirt of course because dirt can be brown

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
desert II feel because this TOA he

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.109 
desert II feel because this TOA he
basically<00:01:21.170> looks<00:01:21.530> over<00:01:21.830> pakora<00:01:22.460> which<00:01:22.759> is<00:01:23.770> 10

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
basically looks over pakora which is 10

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.850 
basically looks over pakora which is 10
like<00:01:26.119> his<00:01:26.299> color<00:01:26.479> scheme<00:01:26.810> i'll<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:30.170> function

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
like his color scheme i'll the function

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.340 
like his color scheme i'll the function
of<00:01:31.250> course<00:01:31.460> now<00:01:31.670> function<00:01:32.240> is<00:01:32.390> different<00:01:32.900> in

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
of course now function is different in

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.249 
of course now function is different in
this<00:01:33.500> guy<00:01:33.970> because<00:01:34.970> his<00:01:35.119> torso<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.780> obviously

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
this guy because his torso is obviously

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.490 
this guy because his torso is obviously
inverted<00:01:36.829> it's<00:01:36.979> upside<00:01:37.369> down<00:01:38.110> this<00:01:39.110> allows

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
inverted it's upside down this allows

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.590 
inverted it's upside down this allows
one<00:01:39.829> of<00:01:40.189> his<00:01:40.310> legs<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:42.110> move<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.600> mine

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
one of his legs to move and mine

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.810 
one of his legs to move and mine
apparently<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.200> be<00:01:45.320> squeaky<00:01:45.740> now<00:01:46.400> with<00:01:46.610> the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
apparently to be squeaky now with the

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.310 
apparently to be squeaky now with the
set<00:01:47.090> comes<00:01:47.689> this<00:01:47.810> rock<00:01:48.259> system<00:01:49.220> rock<00:01:50.049> for<00:01:51.049> this

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
set comes this rock system rock for this

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.609 
set comes this rock system rock for this
purpose<00:01:52.060> notice<00:01:53.060> he<00:01:53.240> has<00:01:53.360> feet<00:01:54.020> extensions

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
purpose notice he has feet extensions

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.730 
purpose notice he has feet extensions
these<00:01:54.770> are<00:01:54.890> basically<00:01:55.250> his<00:01:55.460> weapons<00:01:56.740> they

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
these are basically his weapons they

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.959 
these are basically his weapons they
allow<00:01:57.950> him<00:01:58.159> to<00:01:59.079> kick<00:02:00.079> rocks<00:02:01.840> very<00:02:02.840> well<00:02:03.170> i

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
allow him to kick rocks very well i

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.819 
allow him to kick rocks very well i
think<00:02:04.969> that's<00:02:05.329> really<00:02:05.659> neat<00:02:05.840> ins<00:02:06.079> very<00:02:06.380> unique

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
think that's really neat ins very unique

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.219 
think that's really neat ins very unique
and<00:02:07.070> works<00:02:07.490> because<00:02:07.820> he's<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.060> toe<00:02:08.299> of<00:02:08.450> stone

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
and works because he's a toe of stone

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.289 
and works because he's a toe of stone
rocks<00:02:09.799> it<00:02:10.459> would<00:02:10.579> only<00:02:10.670> make<00:02:10.850> sense<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.180> he

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
rocks it would only make sense that he

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.850 
rocks it would only make sense that he
can<00:02:11.510> kick<00:02:11.720> rocks<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:14.350> these<00:02:15.350> are<00:02:15.560> also<00:02:15.680> very

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
can kick rocks so these are also very

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.340 
can kick rocks so these are also very
unique<00:02:16.190> i<00:02:16.489> find<00:02:16.790> those<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:17.090> be<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.239> pro<00:02:17.510> they

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
unique i find those to be a pro they

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.789 
unique i find those to be a pro they
also<00:02:18.530> add<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.130> little<00:02:19.970> bit<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.480> variety<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
also add a little bit of variety in the

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.789 
also add a little bit of variety in the
color<00:02:22.040> scheme<00:02:22.400> meaning<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:24.140> other<00:02:24.260> TOA<00:02:24.530> don't

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
color scheme meaning the other TOA don't

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.380 
color scheme meaning the other TOA don't
have<00:02:25.010> any<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.519> secondary<00:02:26.030> color<00:02:26.209> and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
have any of the secondary color and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.090 
have any of the secondary color and
their<00:02:26.480> feet<00:02:26.720> he's<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.350> only<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:27.650> who<00:02:27.739> does<00:02:27.920> i

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
their feet he's the only one who does i

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.050 
their feet he's the only one who does i
think<00:02:28.400> that's<00:02:28.549> neat<00:02:29.889> so<00:02:30.889> let's<00:02:31.519> get<00:02:31.669> into<00:02:31.940> the

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
think that's neat so let's get into the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.850 
think that's neat so let's get into the
cons<00:02:32.419> a<00:02:32.690> little<00:02:32.870> bit

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
cons a little bit

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.220 
cons a little bit
some<00:02:34.820> people<00:02:35.120> might<00:02:35.270> consider<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.840> function

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
some people might consider the function

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.130 
some people might consider the function
akan<00:02:36.530> have<00:02:37.520> as<00:02:37.730> I've<00:02:38.240> said<00:02:38.450> before<00:02:38.510> there's<00:02:39.080> a
