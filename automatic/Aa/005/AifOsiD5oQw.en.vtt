a computer monitor or an a' keyboard you

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.949 
a computer monitor or an a' keyboard you
can<00:03:21.739> configure<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.610> using<00:03:23.030> any<00:03:23.239> computer<00:03:23.510> on

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
can configure this using any computer on

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.949 
can configure this using any computer on
the<00:03:24.050> network<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:24.620> I'm<00:03:24.739> using<00:03:24.980> my<00:03:25.250> Mac<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:26.660> the

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
the network so I'm using my Mac and the

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.410 
the network so I'm using my Mac and the
procedure<00:03:27.350> for<00:03:27.800> using<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.160> PC<00:03:28.580> is<00:03:28.700> very<00:03:28.910> similar

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
procedure for using a PC is very similar

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.600 
procedure for using a PC is very similar
so<00:03:29.840> it's<00:03:29.989> worth<00:03:30.320> having<00:03:30.350> up<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.070> asterisks

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
so it's worth having up the asterisks

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.850 
so it's worth having up the asterisks

ok<00:03:41.480> now<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:42.200> like<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.890> use<00:03:43.100> a<00:03:43.130> piece<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.610> software

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
ok now I like to use a piece of software

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.580 
ok now I like to use a piece of software
called<00:03:44.000> land<00:03:44.510> scan<00:03:44.930> because<00:03:45.080> I<00:03:45.230> actually<00:03:45.410> like

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
called land scan because I actually like

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.900 
called land scan because I actually like
to<00:03:45.920> know<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.459> physical<00:03:47.030> IP<00:03:47.269> address<00:03:47.840> of<00:03:48.050> my

to know the physical IP address of my
Raspberry<00:03:49.910> Pi<00:03:49.940> now<00:03:50.420> I<00:03:50.450> will<00:03:50.810> at<00:03:50.959> some<00:03:50.989> point

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
Raspberry Pi now I will at some point

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.050 
Raspberry Pi now I will at some point
fix<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:53.030> because<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:54.019> need<00:03:54.320> that<00:03:54.350> for<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.640> fixed

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060

fix it because I need that for a fixed
IP<00:03:56.180> address<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:56.900> I'll<00:03:57.260> go<00:03:57.500> into<00:03:57.769> that<00:03:57.800> in<00:03:58.130> some

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190

free PBX administration site which is

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.400 
free PBX administration site which is
brilliant<00:04:40.730> because<00:04:41.240> if<00:04:41.480> I<00:04:41.600> was<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.930> now<00:04:42.080> click

raspberry PBX it's simple it's just
admin<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.300> admin<00:04:56.900> ok<00:04:57.220> now<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.250> would<00:04:58.550> strongly

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
admin and admin ok now I would strongly

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.960 
admin and admin ok now I would strongly
suggest<00:04:59.720> that<00:05:00.320> you<00:05:00.560> change<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.400> passwords

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
suggest that you change the passwords

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.760 
suggest that you change the passwords
once<00:05:02.600> you've<00:05:02.780> got<00:05:02.990> your<00:05:03.110> system<00:05:03.500> up<00:05:03.650> and

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
once you've got your system up and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.320 
once you've got your system up and
running<00:05:03.860> because<00:05:04.610> if<00:05:04.760> you're<00:05:04.880> going<00:05:05.030> to

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
running because if you're going to

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.090 
running because if you're going to
configure<00:05:05.870> it<00:05:06.110> in<00:05:06.200> a<00:05:06.320> way<00:05:06.440> that<00:05:06.680> people<00:05:06.830> can

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
configure it in a way that people can

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.880 
configure it in a way that people can
access<00:05:07.730> your<00:05:08.270> pile<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:08.960> can<00:05:08.990> access<00:05:09.470> your<00:05:09.650> PI

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
access your pile you can access your PI

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.730 
access your pile you can access your PI
over<00:05:10.550> the<00:05:10.580> Internet<00:05:11.210> people<00:05:11.660> will<00:05:12.170> try<00:05:12.710> and

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
over the Internet people will try and

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.920 
over the Internet people will try and
hack<00:05:13.280> your<00:05:13.490> system<00:05:14.060> and<00:05:14.240> it's<00:05:14.630> really

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
hack your system and it's really

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.540 
hack your system and it's really
important<00:05:15.440> that<00:05:15.470> you<00:05:15.680> scroll<00:05:16.010> down<00:05:16.040> and<00:05:16.490> you

you type this into your rum you type

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.880 
you type this into your rum you type
this<00:05:43.100> into<00:05:43.430> your<00:05:44.240> terminal<00:05:44.900> you<00:05:45.440> open<00:05:45.710> up<00:05:45.770> a

this into your terminal you open up a

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.250 
this into your terminal you open up a
terminal<00:05:46.130> package<00:05:46.730> and<00:05:46.940> you<00:05:47.360> can<00:05:47.510> see<00:05:47.720> that

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
terminal package and you can see that

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.990 
terminal package and you can see that

take<00:05:53.690> you<00:05:53.960> into<00:05:54.200> the<00:05:54.470> terminal<00:05:55.070> so<00:05:55.190> you<00:05:55.250> can

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
take you into the terminal so you can

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.660 
take you into the terminal so you can
start<00:05:55.850> writing<00:05:56.210> code<00:05:56.690> and<00:05:57.500> commands<00:05:58.160> that
