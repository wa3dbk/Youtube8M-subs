00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
a simple switch and then there are two

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.429 
a simple switch and then there are two
ear<00:01:22.640> intake<00:01:23.150> scoops<00:01:23.510> they<00:01:23.689> call<00:01:23.900> this<00:01:24.080> their

basically as you ride air is going to

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.469 
basically as you ride air is going to
basically<00:01:27.950> ram<00:01:28.520> right<00:01:28.820> into<00:01:29.119> those<00:01:29.240> air

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
basically ram right into those air

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.080 
basically ram right into those air
intake<00:01:29.810> scoops<00:01:30.250> flow<00:01:31.250> over<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.670> top<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:31.880> your

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.169 
intake scoops flow over the top of your
head<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:32.630> then<00:01:32.840> you'll<00:01:32.990> have<00:01:33.820> release<00:01:34.820> points

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
head and then you'll have release points

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.849 
head and then you'll have release points
at<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.359> back<00:01:35.539> for<00:01:35.869> that<00:01:35.899> warm<00:01:36.350> air<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.740> escape

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
at the back for that warm air to escape

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.830 
at the back for that warm air to escape
as<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.460> ride<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:37.939> air<00:01:38.060> comes<00:01:38.270> over<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.630> shell

as you ride and air comes over the shell

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.050 
as you ride and air comes over the shell
it'll<00:01:39.350> draw<00:01:39.560> warm<00:01:39.859> air<00:01:40.039> out<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.280> back<00:01:40.460> right

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
it'll draw warm air out the back right

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.910 
it'll draw warm air out the back right
at<00:01:41.179> this<00:01:41.299> built<00:01:41.600> in<00:01:41.780> kinda<00:01:42.049> aero<00:01:42.229> spoiler<00:01:42.740> and

then at the base of the helmet here
there<00:01:45.170> are<00:01:45.259> some<00:01:45.350> static<00:01:45.740> fences<00:01:46.070> well

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.249 
there are some static fences well

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:48.219 
there are some static fences well
that'll<00:01:46.549> really<00:01:47.060> help<00:01:47.270> get<00:01:47.509> that<00:01:47.630> higher<00:01:47.899> out

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
that'll really help get that higher out

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.639 
that'll really help get that higher out
of<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.649> helmet<00:01:49.810> as<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.960> said<00:01:51.109> these<00:01:51.259> vents<00:01:51.560> are

basically<00:02:07.130> it's<00:02:07.939> just<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.270> OneTouch<00:02:08.690> operation

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
basically it's just a OneTouch operation

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.070 
basically it's just a OneTouch operation
there's<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:10.330> button<00:02:11.330> at<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.720> front<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:12.020> the

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
there's a button at the front of the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.630 
there's a button at the front of the
chin<00:02:12.260> bar<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:12.890> just<00:02:13.130> pull<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.340> and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
chin bar that you just pull on and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.220 
chin bar that you just pull on and
that's<00:02:14.360> going<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.630> raise<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.860> chin<00:02:16.100> bar<00:02:16.280> up<00:02:17.230> so

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
that's going to raise the chin bar up so

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.050 
that's going to raise the chin bar up so
as<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.560> said<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:19.310> makes<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:19.730> really

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
as I said that makes it just really

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.430 
as I said that makes it just really
convenient<00:02:20.420> if<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:20.780> stopped<00:02:21.260> at<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.410> gas

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
convenient if you stopped at a gas

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.260 
convenient if you stopped at a gas
station<00:02:21.590> at<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.130> light<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.520> talked<00:02:22.910> somebody

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
station at a light you talked somebody

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.059 
station at a light you talked somebody
you<00:02:23.630> can<00:02:23.780> actually<00:02:23.930> open<00:02:24.410> your<00:02:24.440> helmet<00:02:24.860> shield

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
you can actually open your helmet shield

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.350 
you can actually open your helmet shield
up<00:02:25.250> or<00:02:25.700> your<00:02:25.910> actual<00:02:26.090> chin<00:02:26.420> bar<00:02:26.600> up

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
up or your actual chin bar up

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.970 
up or your actual chin bar up
have<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.390> conversation<00:02:28.569> with<00:02:29.050> somebody<00:02:29.350> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
have a conversation with somebody the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.160 
have a conversation with somebody the
latches<00:02:30.460> are<00:02:30.640> metal<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.510> metal<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:32.020> have

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
latches are metal to metal so you have

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.640 
latches are metal to metal so you have
metal<00:02:32.410> posts<00:02:32.890> on<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.840> base<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.319> helmet

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
metal posts on the base of the helmet

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.920 
metal posts on the base of the helmet
and<00:02:35.800> then<00:02:36.520> at<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.700> top<00:02:36.880> there<00:02:37.360> are<00:02:37.390> metal

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
and then at the top there are metal

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.380 
and then at the top there are metal
latches<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.860> securely<00:02:39.340> latch<00:02:39.670> when<00:02:40.300> you

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
latches that securely latch when you

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.870 
latches that securely latch when you
close<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.780> helmet<00:02:41.050> down<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:42.040> safety<00:02:42.819> is

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
close the helmet down so safety is

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.250 
close the helmet down so safety is
definitely<00:02:42.940> a<00:02:43.860> priority<00:02:44.860> with<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.459> helmet

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
definitely a priority with this helmet

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.949 
definitely a priority with this helmet
taking<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.350> look<00:02:47.530> at<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.770> shield<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:49.570> uses

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
taking a look at this shield it uses

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.710

internal Sun Visor and if you look at

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.560 
internal Sun Visor and if you look at
the<00:03:33.400> side<00:03:33.610> of<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.850> helmet<00:03:34.030> here<00:03:34.269> you'll<00:03:34.420> see

the side of the helmet here you'll see

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.180 
the side of the helmet here you'll see
there's<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.810> another<00:03:35.290> trigger<00:03:35.680> built<00:03:35.980> right

there's a another trigger built right

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.430 
there's a another trigger built right
into<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.549> base<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.000> helmet<00:03:37.329> so<00:03:37.480> this<00:03:38.290> is

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
with gloves on basically you push this

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.860 
with gloves on basically you push this
forward<00:03:42.459> and<00:03:42.790> you're<00:03:43.239> going<00:03:43.329> to<00:03:43.420> drop<00:03:43.630> down

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
or through tunnels under trees you can

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.289
