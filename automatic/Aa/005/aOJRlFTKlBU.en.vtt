then you go into the strobe mode now you
can<00:01:25.320> instead<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> making<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.189> little

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
can instead of making that little

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.710 
can instead of making that little
clicking<00:01:26.790> noise<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.180> also<00:01:27.299> rub<00:01:27.600> your

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
clicking noise you can also rub your

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.890 
clicking noise you can also rub your
finger<00:01:27.990> across<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.320> back<00:01:28.650> end<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.900> going

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
finger across the back end and going

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.179 
finger across the back end and going
through<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> different<00:01:31.439> modes<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.950> way<00:01:32.130> too

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
through the different modes that way too

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.940 
through the different modes that way too
so<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.540> works<00:01:33.780> well<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.829> nice
