00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.679
 the goal 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.789
 on August 15 in the case of the station 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.349
 naval of the black river in manaus occurred the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.419
 baptism show of armament and 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.119
 transfer to the operating sector of the 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.020
 water river warning and river 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.270
 black 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.980
 the event represents the incorporation of the 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.980
 armed navy ship of brazil 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:59.730
 placed there I see and not the floral fillet and a 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.739
 ship of china if the execution of 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.800
 hydroceanographic surveys in 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.080
 waters in the Amazon basin with 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.550
 the purpose of continuous updating of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.400
 cartography of the main 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.830
 waterways in the region being fundamentally 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.930
 importance the precise knowledge and 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.040
 the navigation channel of the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.900
 Amazonian rivers 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.259
 which will make it possible to improve 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.049
 navigation security is a vile 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.939
 designed by the navy of brazil 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.310
 built in the national shipyard were 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.280
 Consume 4 equal to this navy style 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.780
 joão to be here and if mainly that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.939
 We are talking about the black river. 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.039
 along with the river Solimões they will 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.009
 stay here hands and they will go 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.659
 hydrographic survey of this 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.869
 region for the letters to be 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.829
 reliable letters is synonymous with 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.869
 better navigation of fewer accidents and 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.609
 of fundamental importance the ship he 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.280
 has a characteristic by its ship 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:02:00.240
 small of small draft 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.679
 navigate on rivers and do street and it has 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.049
 an important characteristic that he 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.920
 has very sophisticated equipment 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.860
 hydrograph as double echo 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.110
 and a station 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.360
 automatic weather forecast that allows 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.060
 ship acquires environmental data with 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.200
 the tenente carolina de manaus
