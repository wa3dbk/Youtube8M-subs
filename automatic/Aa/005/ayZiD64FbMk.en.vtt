a little different at all feed dream is
made<00:00:48.510> from<00:00:48.690> more<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.140> plastic<00:00:49.590> type

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
made from more of a plastic type

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
internal skeleton however you can do the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.450 
internal skeleton however you can do the
face<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> same<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> will<00:01:10.710> take<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.220> little

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
face up the same it will take a little

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.760 
face up the same it will take a little
differently<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> same<00:01:13.320> concept

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
