00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.150
 for the team reserves the month of June do not 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.010
 not rhyme with laziness and relaxation what 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.030
 weekend the blues and racing have a 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.610
 crucial appointment 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.190
 a victory against sarre-union their 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.570
 would open the doors of the cfa2 one does not 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.390
 did not speak right away at the beginning of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
 season 1 we have left some 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.300
 matches settle to fill or 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.000
 are we in the mid-season 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.679
 we were on the lookout and is now and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.719
 we only have one goal in mind 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.180
 to go win against these meetings at 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.309
 we at home is able to access 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.629
 above at the beginning of next season 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.760
 it's true that so long it's fade 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.620
 and faced club reservations 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.850
 pros and where so it will be really a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.649
 good thing what and here we are all 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.649
 close so if we win Sunday we 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.969
 exceptional break for me 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.250
 19 years old and the average age of the team 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.960
 players mostly from the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.660
 training center and teams 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.590
 young people from the rcs to he inspires all to 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.570
 integrate the team a 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.190
 and for that they showed a 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.489
 great involvement that brought his 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.589
 fruits 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.909
 the characteristic of this team is 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.799
 that she managed to have a great 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.840
 cohesion that's not easy for a 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.159
 reserve team and especially they had 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.970
 a margin of progress in terms 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.500
 football 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.090
 tactically and technically very 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.090
 important because at the beginning 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.890
 we worried a little bit and then at 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.310
 as the work has been 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.220
 done he was very diligent is very much at 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.140
 listened to and ben years I found for 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.110
 the moment a team that has found its 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.030
 maturity 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.200
 it's important for the staff of 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.759
 the first team to have a team 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.140
 reserve in cfa2 to be able to donate 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.030
 playing time to the players they 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.350
 would come back injury years in team 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.610
 first while the dh is when 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.310
 even one happened not very rewarding 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.049
 then the second thing is that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.100
 actually for all the young people we 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.049
 would like to bring in post training 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.840
 in any case for all young people 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.030
 would like to make us play 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.740
 in cfa 2 it's alÃ¨s it leaves a lot 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.850
 more sports to express themselves and 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.740
 show his qualities 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.759
 while the others there archives 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.069
 National is nevertheless also offers 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.630
 facing the solid fellow of Team 2's 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.110
 his meeting who must win for their 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.840
 retention 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.730
 the racing reservists play big there 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.560
 will not have to tremble and if that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.510
 challenge is filled this season will have 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.220
 allowed these young people to progress and 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.349
 prove that they have strong shoulders 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.400
 another argument to seduce the 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.400
 staff of the team a
