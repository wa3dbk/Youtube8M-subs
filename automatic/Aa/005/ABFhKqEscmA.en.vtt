00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello how I'm the guille and this is 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.000
 easy cooking 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.360
 hello how welcome to the chapter 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.250
 easy cooking number two hopefully the 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.520
 First you liked it, I hope you have 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.900
 practiced I hope you have eaten it today 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.610
 day what we are going to do about some new 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.340
 keys with a sauce of three cheeses 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.599
 to occupy cheese edam chanco cheese that is 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.310
 my favorite cheese and parmesan the only thing 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.140
 important that we have to know when 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.790
 let's go to work a sauce with cheese 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.829
 are the temperatures at which 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.480
 that incorporate the cheese that is super 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.610
 important because they are harder than 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.710
 they are softer and the temperature that 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.900
 let's give the cream now let's show 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.579
 the ingredients let's start with 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.059
 some yogis 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.239
 and the new ones, what does bolus or lump mean and 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.909
 it's like a pasta of potatoes 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.789
 formerly it was stepped with a fork of 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:03.070
 fact is still stepped on with a fork but already 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.570
 there are not some that arrive and the little ball 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.399
 the most traditional that is so already 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.780
 These Yaquis are going to incorporate 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:11.560
 to the pot now what we are going to show 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.200
 are the Parmesan cheeses and here there 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.479
 age and chanco now what are we going to 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.119
 to do is incorporate the yucca into the pot 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.940
 and wait for the fresh pasta to rise 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.630
 as Estonian is here just 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.039
 you take it out and that's how the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.229
 texture that we look for in a paste 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.720
 remember the Italian cuisine is super 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.090
 easy but it has its times like all 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.220
 the kitchens have their time if you 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.830
 they give him the time that corresponds always 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.290
 it's good it's time and love and love 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.270
 what is 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.840
 food time good 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.210
 come on let's incorporate the salt we have 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.170
 a little bit of salt and now what are we going 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.700
 do is incorporate the pasta and we go with 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.049
 the yogis 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.439
 allowed us look for a teaspoon what 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.450
 come back come see then if you see 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.409
 there as it is of light but when the child 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.690
 here you go up you're floating 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.239
 there you have to take it out to the corrective shot 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.410
 the shot out we're going to go now the 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.410
 let's talk here 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.939
 how to leave there a little 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.230
 that children are ready means 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.120
 that we are going to start doing the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.769
 sauce now remember our sauce 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.590
 three cheeses with one of those cheeses that 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.920
 they are a little cream and not the cream that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.370
 I showed them 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.370
 there 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.070
 we have the cream there and we are going to put 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.530
 the quesitos is super important that 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.810
 we differentiate the resistance of 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.150
 each cheese and the resistance that there is 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.580
 that has high factors when it talks about 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.650
 resistance I mean the one which 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.550
 will melt first that we put another 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.550
 the cheese then 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.730
 we put the cheese that all the cheese falls 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.090
 parmesan and let's stir a little 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.480
 we put the cheese 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.769
 and here it starts to melt everything 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.760
 They fixed that those who are last will 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.189
 melted to the pull 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.189
 and this was delayed we go with the children 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.070
 and they see that the cheese yields 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.480
 following not 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.689
 let's count to save what they 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 he said ahead of the time of the love of the 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.310
 romantic wave they have has to do 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.620
 with this minute for me at least 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.280
 we finished the plate chiquillo hopefully 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.180
 I like to bring this here is this is what 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.440
 what we wanted to do today 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.710
 imagine it I know that it can be super 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.930
 rich and the goats there are going to do it 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:51.100
