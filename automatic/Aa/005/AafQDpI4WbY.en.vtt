00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
line let's go ahead and do this guys I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.800 
line let's go ahead and do this guys I
don't<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:41.909> where<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> Stig<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.780> guess

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
don't know where the Stig is but I guess

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.899

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
actually just a random room that you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.590 
actually just a random room that you
spawn<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.430> this<00:01:47.970> room<00:01:48.149> doesn't<00:01:48.450> really

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
spawn into and this room doesn't really

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.780 
spawn into and this room doesn't really
do<00:01:49.110> much<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> introduction

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
do much it's just like a introduction

green<00:01:54.840> room<00:01:55.079> Trevor<00:01:55.320> wonder<00:01:55.560> when<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.710> call<00:01:55.920> it

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
isn't that fast without going around a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.050 
isn't that fast without going around a
track<00:02:22.500> too<00:02:22.680> fast<00:02:22.920> here<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.700> probably<00:02:23.970> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
track too fast here this is probably the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.000 
track too fast here this is probably the
slowest<00:02:24.450> car<00:02:24.600> ever<00:02:24.840> tested<00:02:25.410> on<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> Top<00:02:25.800> Gear

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
slowest car ever tested on a Top Gear

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.130 
slowest car ever tested on a Top Gear
track<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.060> pretty<00:02:27.300> cool<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.690> roleplay

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
track but it's pretty cool to roleplay

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.930 
track but it's pretty cool to roleplay
with<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.530> guys<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:28.920> is<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.160> Ferrari<00:02:29.340> from

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
with the guys this is the Ferrari from

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.840 
with the guys this is the Ferrari from
the<00:02:30.570> cars<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.170> drives<00:02:31.500> mod<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:32.640> pretty

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
the cars and drives mod and it's pretty

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.490 
the cars and drives mod and it's pretty
chill<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.390> guess<00:02:33.720> if<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.960> want<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.170> go<00:02:34.260> around

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
chill I guess if you want to go around

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.980 
chill I guess if you want to go around
and<00:02:34.650> track<00:02:34.860> any<00:02:35.160> very<00:02:35.820> chill<00:02:36.180> format<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.750> guess

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
and track any very chill format I guess

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.810 
and track any very chill format I guess
this<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.410> reason<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.070> be<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> reasonably

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
this is a reason to be a reasonably

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.000 
this is a reason to be a reasonably
priced<00:02:39.180> car<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:40.080> as<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.500> guys<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.740> tell<00:02:40.800> it's

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
priced car but as you guys can tell it's

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.350 
priced car but as you guys can tell it's
way<00:02:41.160> too<00:02:41.220> slow<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:41.580> let's<00:02:41.790> go<00:02:41.850> ahead<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.150> fly

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
way too slow so let's go ahead and fly

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.850 
way too slow so let's go ahead and fly
around<00:02:42.450> our<00:02:42.660> track<00:02:42.840> as<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.080> could<00:02:43.170> see<00:02:43.350> we

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
around our track as you could see we

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.860 
around our track as you could see we
make<00:02:44.040> our<00:02:44.250> left<00:02:44.520> turn<00:02:44.700> here<00:02:45.030> then<00:02:45.300> we<00:02:45.420> go<00:02:45.570> ahead

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
make our left turn here then we go ahead

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.660 
make our left turn here then we go ahead
and<00:02:46.110> enter<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.560> Hammerhead<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.340> next

and enter the Hammerhead on the next

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.280 
and enter the Hammerhead on the next
turn<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.150> it's<00:02:48.690> good<00:02:48.810> seeing<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.020> hammerhead

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
turn and it's good seeing a hammerhead

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.660 
turn and it's good seeing a hammerhead
it's<00:02:49.590> actually<00:02:49.830> pretty<00:02:49.980> challenging<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.550> we

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
it's actually pretty challenging if we

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.370 
it's actually pretty challenging if we
do<00:02:50.820> have<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> fast<00:02:51.300> car<00:02:51.570> I'm<00:02:51.930> not<00:02:52.110> really<00:02:52.200> too

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
do have a fast car I'm not really too

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.720 
do have a fast car I'm not really too
sure<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:52.770> could<00:02:52.920> get<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.040> really<00:02:53.250> fast<00:02:53.459> car

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
sure if we could get a really fast car

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.240 
sure if we could get a really fast car
with<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.360> know<00:02:54.480> Minecraft<00:02:54.990> and<00:02:55.140> mods<00:02:55.380> but<00:02:56.070> um

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
with you know Minecraft and mods but um

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.040 
with you know Minecraft and mods but um
it'll<00:02:56.490> be<00:02:56.610> very<00:02:56.790> cool<00:02:57.000> indeed<00:02:57.540> there's<00:02:57.840> our

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
it'll be very cool indeed there's our

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.090 
it'll be very cool indeed there's our
hammerhead<00:02:58.590> then<00:02:58.770> we<00:02:58.830> could<00:02:58.950> turn<00:02:59.040> around

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
hammerhead then we could turn around

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.580 
hammerhead then we could turn around
here<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.790> wait<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.840> our<00:03:01.020> hammerhead<00:03:01.380> no

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
here and wait is that our hammerhead no

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.870 
here and wait is that our hammerhead no
that's<00:03:01.830> probably<00:03:02.100> just<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.280> regular<00:03:02.550> turn

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
that's probably just a regular turn

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.550 
that's probably just a regular turn
there's<00:03:03.060> our<00:03:03.209> hammerhead<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.780> then<00:03:04.260> we<00:03:04.380> turn

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
there's our hammerhead and then we turn

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.140 
there's our hammerhead and then we turn
around<00:03:04.890> then<00:03:05.190> we<00:03:05.280> go<00:03:05.400> through<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.850> track

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
around then we go through that track

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.850 
around then we go through that track
again<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.660> then<00:03:07.140> we<00:03:07.290> kind<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.530> fly<00:03:07.830> through

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
again and then we kind of fly through

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.980 
again and then we kind of fly through
out<00:03:08.250> here<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.760> then<00:03:08.940> we<00:03:09.120> go<00:03:09.270> around<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.840> we

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
out here and then we go around it and we

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.540 
out here and then we go around it and we
enter<00:03:10.260> back<00:03:10.470> into<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.860> Top<00:03:11.040> Gear<00:03:11.190> studio

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
which is the finish line and that's

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.180 
which is the finish line and that's
actually<00:03:13.380> pretty<00:03:13.620> interesting<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:14.130> course

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
actually pretty interesting of course

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.180 
actually pretty interesting of course
