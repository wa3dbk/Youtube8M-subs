 Hello my friends and welcome to Tuesday classes 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.140
 My name is Lenorardo Perezignato, and last week I told you that I wanted to translate the lessons 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:24.090
 To different languages ​​and asked for your help, but I did not expect this wonderful response 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.439
 Last week's video was translated into Arabic, Dutch, English, German and Lithuanian 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.879
 Polish, Romanian and Russian! 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:37.570
 Thank you very much, I am very pleased that I can present these lessons conceptually 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.840
 For artists all over the world who want to learn how to draw, thank you and let us continue this way 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.040
 Today I will draw lips with some pearls around 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.920
 In the beginning, draw the upper lips, then the teeth, and finally the lower lips 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.090
 Now I will draw pearls, draw circular shapes that will form pearl necklace 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.110
 I draw a hand, holding the pearl necklace 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.970
 In order to be able to shading this degree of blackness I use a charcoal pen 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.420
 Because, as you know, the graphite pen can not be shaded to this degree of blackness 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.470
 There will be a detailed list of the materials used for drawing in this video, I will leave it in the video information below 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.170
 I will scan the lines that I no longer need 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.019
 Then I do the shadow effect on the pearl beads, and of course it will have some gloss 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.900
 Using a soft brush I format graphite 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.630
 I can now effect the light using the scanner 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.500
 And continued shading and coordination brushing 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.750
 "Uh eh eh !!" 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.370
 Hate when it happens! 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.690
 I will now save this code using the loaded scanner before it becomes catastrophic 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.470
 No one will ever notice 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.640
 Except .... a few thousand people who will watch this video 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.930
 I forgot that I used coal for drawing, as you know, charcoal can not be repeated 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.090
 As is the case with Graphite 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.000
 Well, I'll complete the shading 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.800
 Use the brush to give a slight degree of shading 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.300
 Now I'm coordinating with the stump 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.240
 Draw a face shape and put some light effects 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.039
 I want these lips to look bigger in front of them 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.539
 Well, now I'm done, please tell me about you 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.319
 If you enjoy watching, please evaluate the video 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.849
 You know where you can find me, and where you can find the links 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.259
 And see you next Tuesday 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:56.059
