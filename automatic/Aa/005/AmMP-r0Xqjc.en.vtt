00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
don't get too serious but I don't think

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.030 
don't get too serious but I don't think
I'm<00:02:18.610> gonna<00:02:18.700> force<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.000> choose<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.650> mean<00:02:20.650> do<00:02:20.980> you

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
I'm gonna force to choose I mean do you

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.839 
I'm gonna force to choose I mean do you
feel<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:22.709> shoes<00:02:23.709> themselves<00:02:23.980> are<00:02:24.670> really

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
feel the the shoes themselves are really

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.199 
feel the the shoes themselves are really
clean<00:02:25.590> or<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:27.310> it<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.670> fact<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.970> they're<00:02:28.060> so

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
clean or is it the fact that they're so

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.870 
clean or is it the fact that they're so
rare<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:29.010> think<00:02:30.010> it's<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.190> combination<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:30.850> think

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
rare I think it's a combination I think

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.000 
rare I think it's a combination I think
it's<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.150> combination<00:02:31.330> okay<00:02:32.170> just<00:02:32.709> because<00:02:32.800> it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
it's a combination okay just because it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.680 
it's a combination okay just because it
was<00:02:33.100> such<00:02:33.250> an<00:02:33.370> eccentric<00:02:33.700> design<00:02:34.180> like<00:02:34.420> with

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
was such an eccentric design like with

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.240 
was such an eccentric design like with
Nike<00:02:35.080> what<00:02:35.200> he<00:02:35.290> was<00:02:35.410> doing<00:02:35.650> it<00:02:35.739> was<00:02:35.830> going<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.160> a

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
Nike what he was doing it was going in a

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.070 
Nike what he was doing it was going in a
dark<00:02:36.489> at<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.970> bumps<00:02:37.239> on<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.450> back<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.959> was

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
dark at the bumps on the back it was

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.470 
dark at the bumps on the back it was
just<00:02:38.260> all<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:39.010> different<00:02:39.340> textures<00:02:40.330> of

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
just all the different textures of

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.809 
just all the different textures of
fabric<00:02:40.870> so<00:02:41.019> on<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.530> think<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:42.519> was<00:02:42.640> just<00:02:42.760> a

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
fabric so on it I think it was just a

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:43.660 
fabric so on it I think it was just a
combination<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.269> both

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
combination of both

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.520 
combination of both
