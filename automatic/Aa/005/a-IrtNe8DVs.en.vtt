00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello and welcome once again to the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.640
 videos of pastor fact in the video of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.140
 Today I'm going to show you how to calibrate the 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.130
 proximity sensor 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.560
 this is useful because sometimes you can 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.289
 calibrate and can give problems when you 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.779
 make the calls for example 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.410
 to make the call to the screen s 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.070
 turn off and do not answer anything in touch this 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.599
 it's because the phone is uncalled 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.550
 and the information phone as if 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.880
 it was good next to the ear that 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.380
 is that everything is deactivated 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.210
 and well I'll show you next 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.210
 how to do it is very easy 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.150
 we activate the good phone this is 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.630
 our electronic samsung model 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.989
 galaxy s3 in this in this case is the 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.480
 gray version 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.070
 and we just turn on and we 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.059
 we would have to go to settings 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.620
 ok and in adjustments we would have to look for the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:12.280
 option of agreement screen 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:16.300
 we click on the screen and we get good 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.440
 various options and finally puts sensor 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.920
 settings 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.010
 sensor options adjustments for 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:30.310
 sensors and we apply in the last option 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.310
 to ls psd caliber and gel 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.740
 very well 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.970
 the good proximity sensor you can see 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 which it is now 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.700
 is flashing that is the sensor of 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.740
 proximity to this detects when we have 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.630
 the phone near the ear near 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.000
 the face and then deactivates all the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.480
 touch all the functions and it turns to 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.050
 activate when it moves away 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.830
 then what we are going to do is cover it 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.710
 according fingers do not need 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.440
 press very hard simply plug it 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.670
 and then we explain below that it puts 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.670
 cali break calibrate 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.320
 click 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.239
 the sensor is already calibrated 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.239
 keeps flashing but 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.410
 it's done 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.860
 let's do it again we will 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.220
 let's calibrate you can see the circle 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.220
 green 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.230
 ok ready 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.719
 you can see that nothing is ten seconds 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.209
 less and we already have our phone 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.830
 calibrated that would solve any 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.960
 problem with the call 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.960
 that the screen goes off 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.319
 Well hopefully you have been useful 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.239
