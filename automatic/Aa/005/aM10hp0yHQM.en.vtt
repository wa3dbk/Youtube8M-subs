00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.539
 percent 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.619
 I would also like to tell you literally 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.779
 few words he 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.339
 bye the world and ed he

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.230
 multitouch 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.369
 ohhhhhhhh and what's that 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.529
 outstanding 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.040
 here is quite a usual set 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.520
 turnovers 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.930
 total ooo 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.380
 new until we go mg item 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.129
 multitouch 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:41.640
 she as you can see works 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.140
 a little bit delayed and all my 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.850
 slows down but nonetheless multitouch 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.870
 there is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.860
 it is quite possible to use it 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.370
 and support 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.620
 can be considered implemented 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.740
 percent 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.720
 what else we have is interesting 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.140
 Here is a panoramic shot 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.140
 increases decreases 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.670
 still there is such a horizontal 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.560
 mode 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.770

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.940
 seeing carousel 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.480
 vertically 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.480
 he is a little different 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.630
 here she is cute and there is almost fast 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.060
 if we talk about the camera too 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.070
 its interface is already in principle 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.990
 plenty familiar 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.390
 according to this until the end of self 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.260
 This is how the camera switches to video modes 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.240
 a photo 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.760
 and on construction sites a lot 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.060
 it's very good and here too 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.780
 performed using such 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.689
 cute element which 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.330
 as far as I remember, the first one also appeared 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.350
 phone lg arena 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.220
 and we have a choice 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.340
 qualities 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.020
 many shooting modes 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.829
 let's just list at least 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.689
 means 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.749

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.509
 have a passport camera 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.209

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.319

 civilization players blue 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.329
 Is anyone using at all 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.359
 or not 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.039

 switch between camera 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:56.199
 can be used as a camera 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.489
 the second 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.379

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.739
 included in mecca 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.029
 all ska allow 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.549
 facilitate 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.889
 cropping frame when shooting 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.889
 well, actually 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:18.799
 there is a simplified access button 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.799
 macro mode 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.819
 no bodywork 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.769
 m and compensation 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.179
 exposure 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.569
 means but 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.369
 now he, too, has 3 workers 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.839
 only three screens 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.929
 and something interesting you can still two matches 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:43.889

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.489
 stopwatch calculator 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.819
 well everything is usually enough ceilings in 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.979
 tweet big 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.989
 m there is a mode 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.439
 in engineering forms according to 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.439
 occasionally japanese 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.539
 here is a stopwatch 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.259
 allowing whose day point 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.689
 making it simple yet cute 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:07.059
 world name converter 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:08.699
 there are words 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:12.149
 linga restored 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:13.750
 unfortunately a year 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.730
 application embedded no 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.009
 support 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.299

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.939
 it's not always 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.939
 he is much more precise to say it is uncomfortable 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.550
 in year 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.550
 such a Slovakia 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:42.050
 what else do we have 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.490
 it is interesting 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.360
 Dictaphone 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.900
 bread recording mode 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.100
 that often happens but the card which 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.340
 partially filled you can write down three 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.060
 o'clock 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.170
 with a half entry memory type internal 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.110
 and external it looks 206 hours record 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.639
 wonderful 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.930
 current I think that we have 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.360
 may still be of interest 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.360
 for you 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:10.339
 yes that's probably 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:13.089
 0 just and I still wanted to show 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:16.089
 external n as far as this screen 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.900
 reminds 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.520
 to science and not just rub it 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.020
 diagonal 3 2 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.999
 gilmore 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:26.169
 does 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.330
 these frames are identical 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.050
 that is, in size they are really not on 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.749
 whom 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:31.909
 percent 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:33.389
 but the points are here 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.239
 used by true technology 

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:35.690
 here 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.949
 and by the fire that is 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.669
 but the kenya system is not multitouch 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:39.710
 supports 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.120
 same day 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.639
 let it essentially now supports 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.430
 but this is probably 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.409
 deviated read our review further he 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.479
 read see it even such akims
