00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.059
 So my body is very rigid I 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.980
 I tried to dance but they tell me the same 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.350
 that my movements are clumsy and my 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.960
 body does not respond to music that I can 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 do to prove to myself that if 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.840
 you can adriana the dance the move 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.330
 the rhythm of music is something that is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.000
 inherent is natural to the human being and has 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.640

 here with me with the whole community of 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.270

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.250
 pleasure an honor to have you here at 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.110
 otherwise reading the honor is mine then 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.360
 tell us a little about how it is 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.369
 dance for everyone is this way this 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.140
 methodology technique that you have created 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.170
 so that all people can 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.900
 dance similar 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.370
 I'm about 13 years old 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.260
 giving dance lessons and then he has 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.479
 realized that a lot of people say that 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.060
 has two left feet that does not have 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.090
 rhythm and really we can all dance 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.670
 we all have a rhythm all alone 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.070
 we need to move trust in us 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.470
 and letting go we let it flow with a 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.920
 music or with your own music that you 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.660
 you are inside playing perfect and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 then of course we have prepared a 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.740
 dance class for everyone so you 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.600
 I leave Claudia to teach us to 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.610
 all how to recover that rhythm that 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.000
 music that dance - thank you very much 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.420
 it's a pleasure to dance is very simple 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.700
 it's very funny it's very healthy and I'm going to 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.130
 say what is the simple secret and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.810
 it's simply called balance what 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.740
 The only thing you have to do is pass your 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.640
 weight from one side to the other 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:22.400
 this is already a dance try not to do in 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.610
 your house wherever you are where you want 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.030
 put on a little music 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.180
 or simply and simply do this already 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.360
 it's a dance the second secret is the 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.760
 rhythm we all have a rhythm though 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.820
 you think you have two left feet you 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.030
 you have your own rhythm, trust him but 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.710
 all music has a rhythmic base 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:52.240
 you just have to look for all music 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:55.040
 has a basis that can be this is 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:02.750
 balance masses the weight from one side to 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:05.300
 another follows the rhythmic basis very well the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.860
 next step are displacements 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.160
 you can do it forward 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:19.960
 next 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:23.860
 and back and now you can add what 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.750
 you want you can add arms and we're going 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.470
 at speed we are going to do a little bit 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.470
 faster 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:46.930
 we are already dancing and you can put him 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:50.170
 the music you want or something very 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.650
 important is trust you trust your 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.680
 intuition feel the music and let yourself 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.480
 take if claudia loved me very many 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.340
