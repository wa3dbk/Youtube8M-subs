think that's because they know what it's

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.530 
think that's because they know what it's
like<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.340> fall<00:01:50.729> down<00:01:51.470> because<00:01:52.470> they're<00:01:52.680> so

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
really can't put it into words but it's

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.260 
really can't put it into words but it's
it's<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:02.220> emotional<00:03:03.220> connection<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:04.120> other

spiritual setting because that's what

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.690

what they depend on emotionally is this

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.180 
what they depend on emotionally is this
spiritual<00:03:18.970> connection<00:03:19.660> or<00:03:19.900> taking<00:03:20.860> care<00:03:20.890> of
