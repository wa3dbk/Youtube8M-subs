00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
helped in some ways but in many ways I'm

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.820 
helped in some ways but in many ways I'm
not<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.160> sure

I think as we became more independent
then<00:02:38.510> felt<00:02:38.870> less<00:02:39.110> needed<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:40.430> they<00:02:40.550> started

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
then felt less needed and they started

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.420 
then felt less needed and they started
to<00:02:41.060> walk<00:02:41.740> and<00:02:42.740> women<00:02:43.040> walked<00:02:43.250> away<00:02:43.400> -<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:46.250> now

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
to walk and women walked away - and now

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.760 
to walk and women walked away - and now
