00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
that the power rangers never existed and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.859 
that the power rangers never existed and
thus<00:00:17.220> appears<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> underworld<00:00:18.180> rule<00:00:18.539> over

died<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.699> Claire<00:00:26.910> didn't<00:00:27.240> even<00:00:27.359> recognize

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
died and Claire didn't even recognize

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019 
died and Claire didn't even recognize
them<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.949> Rangers<00:00:29.220> eventually<00:00:29.699> meet<00:00:29.880> with

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
them so the Rangers eventually meet with

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.150 
them so the Rangers eventually meet with
a<00:00:30.060> tribunal<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.750> magic<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.619> rangers<00:00:31.949> tell

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
a tribunal of magic the rangers tell

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.270 
a tribunal of magic the rangers tell
their<00:00:32.309> reasons<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.000> them<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.690> they<00:00:33.780> refused

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
their reasons to them but they refused

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.799 
their reasons to them but they refused
but<00:00:35.280> seeing<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> rangers<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.600> make<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
but seeing the rangers as they make a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.360 
but seeing the rangers as they make a
stand<00:00:37.140> even<00:00:37.320> without<00:00:37.649> their<00:00:37.829> magic

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
stand even without their magic

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.490 
stand even without their magic
I<00:00:38.399> think<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> tribunal<00:00:39.600> magic<00:00:39.930> then<00:00:40.110> changes

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
I think the tribunal magic then changes

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.020 
I think the tribunal magic then changes
their<00:00:40.649> minds<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:41.309> gives<00:00:41.520> them<00:00:41.670> legend

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
their minds and then gives them legend

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.030 
their minds and then gives them legend
magic<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.350> those<00:00:43.469> rare<00:00:43.680> kind<00:00:43.950> of

Megazords one Allah takes two sorts to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.569 
Megazords one Allah takes two sorts to
make<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.870> whole<00:00:46.079> Megazord<00:00:46.590> though<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.309> don't

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
onto this it also has a removable matin
now<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:12.860> can<00:02:13.040> also<00:02:13.160> take<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.580> out<00:02:13.790> and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
now you can also take this out and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:22.920 
now you can also take this out and
attach<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.750> other<00:02:14.870> mystic<00:02:15.320> 4<00:02:15.500> Zords

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.690 

had<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.080> try<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.350> find<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.190> place<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
had to try to find in the place for the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:37.060 
had to try to find in the place for the
pegs<00:02:25.910> going<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:28.360> y'all<00:02:29.360> can<00:02:29.600> open<00:02:35.680> on<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.860> side

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
pegs going to y'all can open on the side

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.560 
pegs going to y'all can open on the side
you<00:02:37.190> can<00:02:37.340> see<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.640> has<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.970> Ranger<00:02:38.239> colors

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
you can see that has the Ranger colors

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:48.400 
you can see that has the Ranger colors
on<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:46.580> right<00:02:47.120> here<00:02:47.360> these<00:02:47.540> magnets<00:02:48.110> is

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
on it and right here these magnets is

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.470 
on it and right here these magnets is
how<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.739> mystic<00:02:49.370> Firebird<00:02:49.820> holds<00:02:50.120> onto<00:02:50.270> it

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
how the mystic Firebird holds onto it

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.400 
how the mystic Firebird holds onto it
now<00:02:53.650> I've<00:02:54.650> gone<00:02:54.739> with<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.070> transformation

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
now I've gone with the transformation

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.870 
now I've gone with the transformation
but<00:02:57.410> before<00:02:57.770> we<00:02:57.860> transform<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.459> it<00:02:58.580> has<00:02:58.730> an

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
but before we transform it it has an

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.699 
but before we transform it it has an
on/off<00:02:59.209> switch<00:02:59.270> on<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.780> back<00:02:59.959> like<00:03:00.680> I

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
on/off switch on the back like I

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.050 
on/off switch on the back like I
mentioned<00:03:01.100> earlier<00:03:01.340> since<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.940> an

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
mentioned earlier since this is an

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.199 
mentioned earlier since this is an
electronic<00:03:02.660> toy<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.550> mean<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.730> if<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.060> have

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
electronic toy I mean that if you have

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.170 
electronic toy I mean that if you have
this<00:03:05.420> up<00:03:06.040> this<00:03:07.040> will<00:03:07.250> move<00:03:07.370> by<00:03:07.610> itself<00:03:07.640> whether

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
this up this will move by itself whether

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.090 
this up this will move by itself whether
it's<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.540> Megazord<00:03:08.989> mode<00:03:09.230> or<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.890> line

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
it's in Megazord mode or just the line

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.090 
it's in Megazord mode or just the line
but<00:03:10.580> if<00:03:10.670> you<00:03:10.760> have<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.090> down<00:03:11.300> oh<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.860> if<00:03:13.010> you

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
but if you have it down oh and if you

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.410 
but if you have it down oh and if you
have<00:03:13.220> something<00:03:13.430> pressing<00:03:13.790> against<00:03:14.120> this<00:03:14.269> it

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
have something pressing against this it

00:03:14.420 --> 00:05:22.790 
have something pressing against this it
will<00:03:14.480> transform

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.930 

now<00:05:23.800> then<00:05:24.010> on<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.250> readings<00:05:24.520> I'm<00:05:24.700> gonna<00:05:24.850> have

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
now then on to readings I'm gonna have

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.340 
now then on to readings I'm gonna have
to<00:05:25.030> give<00:05:25.150> this<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.450> four<00:05:25.660> and<00:05:25.720> a<00:05:25.780> quarter<00:05:26.080> out<00:05:26.200> of

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
to give this a four and a quarter out of

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.740 
to give this a four and a quarter out of
five<00:05:26.530> the<00:05:26.830> pros<00:05:27.340> are<00:05:27.550> is<00:05:27.730> that<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.330> has<00:05:28.510> its

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
five the pros are is that it has its

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.630 
five the pros are is that it has its
motorized<00:05:29.140> feature<00:05:29.410> it<00:05:29.860> can<00:05:30.070> transform<00:05:30.460> by

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
motorized feature it can transform by

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.790 
motorized feature it can transform by
itself<00:05:31.030> but<00:05:31.600> the<00:05:31.720> cons<00:05:31.930> are<00:05:32.110> that<00:05:32.410> you<00:05:32.530> can't

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
itself but the cons are that you can't

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.670 
itself but the cons are that you can't
transform<00:05:33.280> it<00:05:33.370> back<00:05:33.520> I<00:05:33.850> think<00:05:34.690> as<00:05:34.840> Li<00:05:35.080> at<00:05:35.350> least

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
transform it back I think as Li at least

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.320 
transform it back I think as Li at least
as<00:05:35.800> far<00:05:35.830> as<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.250> know<00:05:36.310> because<00:05:36.790> I<00:05:36.820> always<00:05:37.090> have

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
as far as I know because I always have

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.780 
as far as I know because I always have
to<00:05:37.450> manually<00:05:37.840> transform<00:05:38.500> it<00:05:38.620> back<00:05:38.740> so<00:05:39.640> my

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
to manually transform it back so my

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.130 
to manually transform it back so my
guess<00:05:39.970> is<00:05:40.000> that<00:05:40.270> it<00:05:40.420> doesn't<00:05:40.570> have<00:05:40.870> a<00:05:40.900> way<00:05:40.990> to

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
guess is that it doesn't have a way to

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.460 
guess is that it doesn't have a way to
transform<00:05:41.590> back<00:05:41.800> by<00:05:41.980> itself<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:44.050> that<00:05:44.200> it's

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
transform back by itself and that it's

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.130 
transform back by itself and that it's
just<00:05:44.980> a<00:05:45.070> bit<00:05:45.220> chunky<00:05:45.820> but<00:05:46.120> with<00:05:46.870> all<00:05:47.020> its

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
just a bit chunky but with all its

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.900 
just a bit chunky but with all its
motorized<00:05:47.500> features<00:05:47.950> it's<00:05:48.220> no<00:05:48.370> surprise<00:05:48.700> why

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
motorized features it's no surprise why

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.000 
motorized features it's no surprise why
it's<00:05:49.030> so<00:05:49.120> chunky<00:05:49.470> also<00:05:50.470> I'm<00:05:50.590> missing<00:05:50.920> the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
it's so chunky also I'm missing the

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.670 
it's so chunky also I'm missing the
piece<00:05:51.250> that<00:05:51.610> connects<00:05:52.570> from<00:05:52.630> its<00:05:52.900> hand<00:05:53.170> on<00:05:53.440> to

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
piece that connects from its hand on to

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.570 
piece that connects from its hand on to
this<00:05:53.860> it<00:05:54.430> broke<00:05:55.710> but<00:05:56.710> if<00:05:56.860> you<00:05:56.980> had<00:05:57.160> it<00:05:57.280> on<00:05:57.400> it

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
this it broke but if you had it on it

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:06.480 
this it broke but if you had it on it
would<00:05:57.640> look<00:05:57.820> something<00:05:57.940> like<00:05:58.120> this

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.580 

and<00:06:06.669> my<00:06:07.150> next<00:06:07.360> review<00:06:07.539> will<00:06:07.840> be<00:06:07.870> the<00:06:08.139> drive<00:06:08.319> max
