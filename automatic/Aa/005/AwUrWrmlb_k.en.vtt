00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.400
 Pretty You know the parable I happened to find at that time 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:14.830
 Because there was a person who said that it was useful or an interesting way of thinking 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.730
 I would like to talk about the color called test-drive theory of coaching that car 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.240
 In that I 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:26.329
 Nothing has been difficult to coach 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:31.640
 I don't have any problems anymore, so I do n't want to solve it if I use it 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:35.000
 I don't want to use anything ugly technique to make me notice something 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.750
 I want to do really in Once you say something is that either system have 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.740
 So here are two things you can do for that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.430

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.980
 Listen to really want to do in reality it is that it does not hear only want to do is to come 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.739
 What kind of feeling do you have when? 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:56.740
 The point is to have the past, the present, the future, and the experiences of other people.

 The in which together with the car test drive from really only have heard want to do body 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.790
 I will 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.430
 It's amazing I see it once again in the car I used to ride a long time ago 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.720
 so 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.100
 What kind of place Ya' is'll use to want to ride any car was good I or the future of this car 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.300

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.890
 Why get also riding in the car or become old it was so even killing 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.760
 I want a reason it is to hear what I can not stand because I was in such a real 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.490
 you know 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.479
 so 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:27.189
 The reason why you are getting on the Sea of ​​Japan you are riding now What about these days 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.320
 Specifically, let's get on very much What if you try stepping on that accelerator 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:32.570
 How is this feeling of acceleration 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.690
 Should I have something else already or should I be true? 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.470

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.100
 the reason 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.690
 Let's get on a little more concrete thing that people feel envy 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.690
 What kind of feeling is good 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.550
 I wondered if I was riding what I thought was good I wondered if something was a little different 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.750
 I hear that you were there 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.870
 I just ask you which car you want to ride 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.410
 In the future, for example, if you don't have it now, you won't get this in various ways like this one 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.490
