00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello to all i will introduce you to the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:35.399
 flute multi range the model ando flute to 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:50.000
 beak model endo flute model 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:01:04.129
 in recorder and models in re 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:09.510
 traversy we will go back to the model in C 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:14.510
 re fa fol la si do beak with a 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.510
 flat on the si 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:42.960
 flat on the loose on the floor 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.179
 flat on the mit 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.890
 flat on the re 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.400
 so of course we can put as many 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:36.969
 downside when we finally want 6 maximum 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:44.260
 because there are six holes or so by 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:47.650
 example we can remove the 6 and the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.239
 women what can we do a flat with 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.359
 the little hole but also condemned a 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.709
 hole so here we send the cinephages I 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:58.439
 find me with a pentatonic scale 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.439
 miners in the umma jon pram 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:30.020
 so that's pretty rational to have 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.630
 only 4 or 4 or clogged for a 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.140
 pentatonic scale that does not preclude 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.500
 for example to add some of the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.100
 additional blues notes with 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.100
 half troops 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.180
 a box is fake asses 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.150
 but so it's still easier 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.820
 to have on one side a the pro range has 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:23.910
 selected and the other side the notes 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:33.750
 eventually we add so there is the 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:37.380
 notice with each time the location 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:47.460
 rings the notes of the flute with 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:55.110
 their beauty and guitar chords there 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:58.140
 there are 64 pages so what if you 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.680
 interest you have in addition an internship 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.650
 free 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.700
 you have to come in turns it lasts a half 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.290
 day we learn to handle the rings 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.190
 improvised play without the play of words 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.140
 simple for those who sport 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.919
 so now here I am going to tell you 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.540
 goodbye 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.540
 I think I said everything
