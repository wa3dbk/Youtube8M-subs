00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.650
 cream of carrots with citrus and 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.470
 gnocchi for the cream we will need 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.829
 carrot leek then we will make a puree 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.460
 of potato then we need citrus 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:31.810
 that we have lemon lime grapefruit orange 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:35.100
 passion fruit butter cream 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.680
 milk and alginate 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.890
 Now let's make the alginate bath 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.649
 the alginate bath is the 25 grams of 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.769
 alginate here the heavy eye does not work 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.920
 and half a liter of water and this has to 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.469
 rest to stand for one hour a 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.120
 thing so that is the time it will take in 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.120
 make this recipe 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.190
 but let's start by making the cream 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.190
 of carrots 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 we give him the carrots we are going to use 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.100
 only the village white 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.979
 we already have the carrot cream now 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.409
 what we are going to add is a bit of 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.720
 milk cream so you have that 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.689
 texture that we want more from 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.340
 soup not now let's cut the 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.470
 citrus fruits we are going to cut them alive 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.750
 eating it 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.660
 we cut live because what we want 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.120
 is that I have that one that does not have skin that 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.120
 be just the flesh of citrus 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:57.200
 catch the skin of the lime is not very 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.840
 important that you have nothing nothing of 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.799
 white galindo 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.979
 and the passion fruit for passion fruit what 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.560
 we cut in half and then with a 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.860
 spoon let's take advantage 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.250

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.570
 skin that makes the alginate the alginate what 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.990
 it does is cook it costs because 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:03.380

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.750
 I'm going to cut and it's a liquid ravioli 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.150

 of potato and me 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.840
 and here we would have the base of the plate 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.470

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.210
 cream 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:42.090
 the boy that we will pepper 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.420

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.150
