00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.670
 gb software presents the console 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.370
 telematics with this tool 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.170
 we simplify your work 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.330
 performing all those operations that 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.190
 previously they had to be performed 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.590
 manually using the software 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.800
 entratel or on the agency's website 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.800
 revenue 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.039
 we now illustrate the main ones 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.369
 functionality of the console application 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.560
 online this additional form 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.619
 allows the authentication of telematic files 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.090
 already controlled by the gb software 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.800
 let's remember that gb offers the possibility 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.340
 to carry out the electronic control 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.170
 without opening entries, sending files 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.649
 telematic to the revenue agency 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.750
 without manually accessing the site 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.770
 discharge of receipts directly from 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.960
 site of the agency 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.300
 also in this case the software 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.940
 will complete the operation 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.820
 autonomy and the opening of receipts 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.710
 downloaded for this operation 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.989
 the software will simulate the use of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.619
 entratel without the need for intervention 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.479
 of the client as I could well understand with 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.140
 the telematic console will be able to 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.549
 simplify and speed up and better 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.439
 organize all the obligations 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.159
 by law for transmission 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.960
 Telematics of the files now we will illustrate the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.689
 main functions provided by 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.520
 authentic software of the telematic file 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.619
 as we previously remembered the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.840
 gb software offers the possibility of 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.290
 carry out the electronic control of the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.600
 file and then the user by accessing the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.420
 console will find all the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.579
 communications statements or models 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.939
 for which the file was generated 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.000
 telematic to carry out the operation 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.549
 of authentic just select the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.899
 supply concerned and subsequently 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.390
 select the authentic file button 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.159
 automatically the software using the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.549
 keys of entratel previously 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.329
 set for the current mediate 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.490
 will complete the required functionality at 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.910
 end of 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:15.319
 action will be noted in detail 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.900
 the user the date and time it was 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.840
 also authenticated by 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.650
 the open result button you can a 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.810
 view the result of the authentic transmission 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.840
 of the telematic file to the agency of 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.030
 previously entered this operation 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.550
 it had to be done by accessing the site 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.650
 of the agency and selecting the file 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.110
 previously authenticated telematics 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.850
 that it is easy to understand what they may be 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.340
 the problems arising from this 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.100
 operation such as file selection 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.150
 incorrect but above all time 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.440
 necessary for its completion 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.600
 now with the console 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.180
 the sending operation is extremely 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.019
 simple and with a click in the button 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.810
 send file will be possible to send a 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.330
 telematic file authenticated to the agency 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.760
 revenue software 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.769
 also in this case it will use the 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.390
 access credentials defined for 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.790
 the current broker as for the 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.670
 previous authentic operation yes 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.950
 can view in detail the 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.109
 function information 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.450
 unloading of receipts from the site 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.100
 of the revenue agency 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.530
 one of the potentials of the console 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.660
 telematics is to avoid access 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.730
 to the agency's website for the 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.489
 completion of sending operations 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.010
 and discharge for the latter in 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.410
 just select the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.390
 receipt you intend to download and 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.920
 if it was generated 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:54.170
 pick it up like all the operations you 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.380
 can be done with the software 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.500
 also in this case it will be necessary a 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.329
 click on the download button for 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.109
 download the receipt 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.109
 interested 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.519
 in detail by selecting the button 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.859
 open folder you can access 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.560
 directly to the files related to 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.100
 Telematic concerned as the txt file 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.830
 produced by the gb software or the ccf file 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.860
 authenticated or the r.cc file of the 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.470
 received as well as all the outcomes of the 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.750
 single operations 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.080
 in addition, the software will archive its own 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.030
 route all files neatly and 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.880
 accurate 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.660
 subdividing by supply year and code 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:51.230
 of the firm opening the receipt 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.450
 unloaded everyone knows how slow it is 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.370
 cumbersome opening operation 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:59.270
 of the receipt using the software 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:02.180
 enter with the console instead you won't have to 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.830
 do nothing you're comfortable and watch the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.990
 software take control of 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.900
 entratel and perform operations at 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.520
 your place 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:15.680
 after completing the function of 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:18.110
 unload select the open button e 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:30.190
 you will be able to see how the 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:32.140
 pdf file of the receipt is remembered 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.930
 that all the operations we are 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:37.150
 viewing right now are 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.490
 run automatically from the console 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:55.240
 telematics and without any intervention 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:58.120
 the user in the detail is the 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.580
 possibility to open the file in each 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.520
 moment so you can find e 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.490
 print receipts easily and 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.560
 immediate 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.430
 as you could see with four 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.350
 simple clicks 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.840
 could you complete all the 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.430
 operations necessary to fulfill the 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.340
 file transmission obligations 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.960
 telematics provided for by law 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.090
 all this without the operator 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.910
 interact directly with the software 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.250
 will go such and without having to access the site 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.130
 of the revenue agency 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.650
 you can also optimize all the 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.600
 operations and above all to speed them up 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.580
 considerably 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.500
 so what are you waiting for 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.620
 request the software and simplify yours 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.620
 work
