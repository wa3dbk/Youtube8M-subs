inches or another way you can do it is

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.920 
inches or another way you can do it is
just<00:01:22.590> line<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.390> ruler<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.690> you<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.870> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
just line up the ruler if you have a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.830 
just line up the ruler if you have a
ruler<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.530> line<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.800> up<00:01:25.980> right<00:01:26.450> angle<00:01:27.450> with

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
ruler and line it up right angle with

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.800 
ruler and line it up right angle with
the<00:01:28.530> chalk<00:01:29.010> that<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.630> did<00:01:30.630> right<00:01:30.750> there

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the chalk that you just did right there

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.220 
the chalk that you just did right there
and<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:32.700> really<00:01:33.150> literally<00:01:33.570> will<00:01:33.870> measure<00:01:34.050> up

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
and it really literally will measure up

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.010 
and it really literally will measure up
to<00:01:34.260> ten<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.800> half<00:01:34.920> m---eleven<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.960> yeah<00:01:36.960> it

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
to ten and a half m---eleven so yeah it

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.720 
to ten and a half m---eleven so yeah it
should<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.230> about<00:01:37.500> ten<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> half<00:01:37.980> to<00:01:38.190> eleven

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
should be about ten and a half to eleven

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.149 
should be about ten and a half to eleven
you<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.060> want<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.270> too<00:01:39.450> short<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.170> then

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you don't want it too short and then

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:51.260 
you don't want it too short and then
you're<00:01:41.340> going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.640> repeat<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.720> both<00:01:43.260> sides

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.240 

so<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.170> next<00:01:52.350> step<00:01:52.619> you're<00:01:52.920> going<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
so for the next step you're going to

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.399 
so for the next step you're going to
measure<00:01:53.670> from<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.240> first<00:01:54.659> chalk<00:01:55.049> mark

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
measure from that first chalk mark

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020 
measure from that first chalk mark
you're<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> go<00:01:56.399> down<00:01:56.640> about

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
you're going to go down about

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.929 
you're going to go down about
five-and-a-half<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.530> six<00:01:58.799> inches<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.640> would

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
five-and-a-half to six inches I would

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.719 
five-and-a-half to six inches I would
probably<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:00.659> around<00:02:00.899> five<00:02:01.380> inches<00:02:01.729> because

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
probably do around five inches because

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.490 
probably do around five inches because
you<00:02:02.820> don't<00:02:03.000> want<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.659> hole<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.930> be<00:02:04.080> too<00:02:04.320> big

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
you don't want the hole to be too big

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.529 
you don't want the hole to be too big
and<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.770> course<00:02:05.070> cotton<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> cotton

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
and of course cotton this is a cotton

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.109 
and of course cotton this is a cotton
blend<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.259> does<00:02:07.470> stretch<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:08.940> going

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
blend so it does stretch so it's going

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.910 
blend so it does stretch so it's going
to<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.750> bigger<00:02:10.110> hole<00:02:10.440> than<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.709> actually

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
to be a bigger hole than it actually

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.780 
to be a bigger hole than it actually
appears<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.420> I'd<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.470> around<00:02:13.680> four<00:02:14.519> to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
appears to be so I'd go around four to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.350 
appears to be so I'd go around four to
five<00:02:15.300> inches<00:02:16.640> that's<00:02:17.640> just<00:02:17.910> my<00:02:18.060> preference

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
five inches that's just my preference

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.759 
five inches that's just my preference
though<00:02:18.720> if<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.989> guys<00:02:19.110> want<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.380> big<00:02:19.560> gaping

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
though if you guys want a big gaping

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.229 
though if you guys want a big gaping
hold<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.430> that's<00:02:20.670> yours

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
hold and that's yours

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.120 
hold and that's yours
so<00:02:21.420> five<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.019> half<00:02:22.230> five<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.800> half<00:02:22.860> on

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
so five and a half five and a half on

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.870 
so five and a half five and a half on
both<00:02:23.280> sides<00:02:24.830> then<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.860> next<00:02:26.310> step<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.700> you're

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
both sides then the next step is you're

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.729 
both sides then the next step is you're
going<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.150> flip<00:02:27.540> those<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.410> you're<00:02:28.560> going<00:02:28.680> to

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
going to flip those and you're going to

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.920 
going to flip those and you're going to
match<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.250> two<00:02:29.430> markings<00:02:29.970> up<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.450> you're

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
match the two markings up and you're

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.780 
match the two markings up and you're
literally<00:02:31.230> going<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> find<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:32.040> center<00:02:32.280> of

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
literally going to find the center of

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.780 
literally going to find the center of
that<00:02:33.209> little<00:02:33.569> square<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:35.250> can<00:02:35.459> do<00:02:35.640> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
that little square and you can do it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.030 
that little square and you can do it
just<00:02:36.000> by<00:02:36.180> using<00:02:36.209> your<00:02:36.510> ruler<00:02:36.720> or<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:37.470> kind<00:02:37.950> of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
just by using your ruler or just kind of

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.460 
just by using your ruler or just kind of
free<00:02:38.190> handing<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.540> do<00:02:39.690> so

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
free handing it like I like to do so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.050 
free handing it like I like to do so
just<00:02:40.650> go<00:02:40.739> ahead<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:40.980> repeat<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.280> on<00:02:41.700> both

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
just go ahead and repeat that on both

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.220 
just go ahead and repeat that on both
sides<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.540> course<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:44.510> don't<00:02:45.510> forget<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.989> mark

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
sides of course and don't forget to mark

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.750 
sides of course and don't forget to mark
where<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.500> center<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:49.130> all<00:02:50.130> right<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.640> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
where the center is all right so the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.750 
where the center is all right so the
next<00:02:50.790> step<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:52.380> take<00:02:52.560> your<00:02:52.620> clips<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.489> what

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
next step is to take your clips and what

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.699 
next step is to take your clips and what
you're<00:02:53.849> going<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.000> do<00:02:54.180> with<00:02:54.330> those<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.959> place

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
you're going to do with those is place

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.580 
you're going to do with those is place
them<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.220> those<00:02:56.700> dots<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.260> made

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
them on those dots that you just made

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.140 
them on those dots that you just made
and<00:03:00.140> what<00:03:01.140> they're<00:03:01.290> going<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.440> do<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.400> be

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
and what they're going to do is just be

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.280 
and what they're going to do is just be
used<00:03:03.600> as<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:04.019> guide<00:03:04.620> so<00:03:05.609> when<00:03:05.820> you<00:03:05.970> do<00:03:06.239> grab<00:03:07.079> your

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
used as a guide so when you do grab your

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.750 
used as a guide so when you do grab your
chalk<00:03:07.590> you're<00:03:07.890> going<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.130> use<00:03:08.250> them<00:03:08.489> as<00:03:08.730> a

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
chalk you're going to use them as a

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.740 
chalk you're going to use them as a
guide<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.980> go<00:03:10.980> ahead<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.519> draw<00:03:12.030> your<00:03:12.450> little

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
guide so go ahead and draw your little

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.030 
guide so go ahead and draw your little
half<00:03:13.019> moons<00:03:14.329> they<00:03:15.329> could<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.630> pointy<00:03:16.290> they<00:03:16.859> can

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
half moons they could be pointy they can

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
half moons they could be pointy they can
be<00:03:17.690> just<00:03:18.690> half<00:03:18.930> moons<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.769> really<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.519> up<00:03:20.760> to

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
be just half moons it really is up to

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.990 
be just half moons it really is up to
you<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.660> your<00:03:22.230> design<00:03:23.220> really<00:03:23.640> it's<00:03:23.790> really

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
you and your design really it's really

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.420 
you and your design really it's really
up<00:03:24.569> to<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.170> go<00:03:25.709> ahead<00:03:25.799> and<00:03:25.920> do<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.220> on

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
up to you so go ahead and do that on

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:34.910 
up to you so go ahead and do that on
both<00:03:26.670> sides

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.250 

next<00:03:35.920> step<00:03:36.130> is<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.580> are<00:03:36.700> going<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.150> grab<00:03:38.110> your

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
next step is you are going to grab your

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.840 
next step is you are going to grab your
scissors<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.620> go<00:03:39.160> ahead<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.430> cut<00:03:39.580> them<00:03:39.730> out

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
scissors and go ahead and cut them out

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.460 
scissors and go ahead and cut them out
they<00:03:40.090> don't<00:03:40.240> really<00:03:40.540> have<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.870> be<00:03:40.960> too<00:03:41.230> perfect

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
they don't really have to be too perfect

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.790 
they don't really have to be too perfect
but<00:03:42.400> what<00:03:42.520> I<00:03:42.550> would<00:03:42.670> suggest<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.840> use<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.500> fabric

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
but what I would suggest is use a fabric

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.010 
but what I would suggest is use a fabric
scissor<00:03:45.280> because<00:03:45.850> these<00:03:46.510> scissors<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.960> I

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
scissor because these scissors that I

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.060 
scissor because these scissors that I
have<00:03:47.440> are<00:03:47.830> just<00:03:47.860> kind<00:03:48.370> of<00:03:48.990> cheap<00:03:49.990> and<00:03:50.470> they

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
have are just kind of cheap and they

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.440 
have are just kind of cheap and they
kind<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.370> make<00:03:51.520> it<00:03:51.550> look<00:03:51.910> jagged<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:53.850> anyway<00:03:54.850> go

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
kind of make it look jagged so anyway go

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:13.290 
kind of make it look jagged so anyway go
ahead<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:55.750> cut<00:03:56.080> those<00:03:56.260> out<00:03:56.530> on<00:03:56.800> all<00:03:57.250> sides

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.000 

so<00:04:14.300> we're<00:04:14.420> going<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.630> take<00:04:14.930> those<00:04:15.230> pieces<00:04:15.560> away

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
so we're going to take those pieces away

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.150 
so we're going to take those pieces away
and<00:04:16.750> that<00:04:17.750> dot<00:04:18.080> that<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.410> made<00:04:18.680> that<00:04:18.709> guide

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
and that dot that you made that guide

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.260 
and that dot that you made that guide
what<00:04:19.490> you're<00:04:19.580> going<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.730> do<00:04:19.940> is<00:04:20.120> you're<00:04:20.240> going

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.590 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:04:20.390> cut<00:04:20.780> across<00:04:21.110> that<00:04:21.560> guide<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:22.340> don't<00:04:22.970> cut

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
to cut across that guide and don't cut

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.300 
to cut across that guide and don't cut
through<00:04:23.870> both<00:04:24.140> layers<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.710> almost<00:04:24.860> did<00:04:25.130> that

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
through both layers I almost did that

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.260 
through both layers I almost did that
and<00:04:25.550> messed<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:25.940> up

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
and messed it up

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.770 
and messed it up
I'm<00:04:26.510> just<00:04:26.990> cut<00:04:27.170> through<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.470> front<00:04:27.710> layer

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
I'm just cut through the front layer

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.060 
I'm just cut through the front layer
next<00:04:29.780> you're<00:04:29.900> going<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.080> open<00:04:30.200> up<00:04:30.410> your<00:04:30.590> clips

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
next you're going to open up your clips

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.170 
next you're going to open up your clips
and<00:04:31.310> you're<00:04:31.790> going<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.270> clip<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:33.050> end<00:04:33.260> on<00:04:34.180> to

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
and you're going to clip the end on to

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.460 
and you're going to clip the end on to
the<00:04:35.330> piece<00:04:35.510> where<00:04:35.720> it's<00:04:35.840> going<00:04:35.960> to<00:04:36.020> grab<00:04:36.260> on<00:04:36.440> to

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
the piece where it's going to grab on to

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.090 
the piece where it's going to grab on to
which<00:04:36.770> is<00:04:36.920> the<00:04:37.100> bottom<00:04:37.490> half<00:04:37.730> of<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.330> leggings

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
which is the bottom half of the leggings

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.260 
which is the bottom half of the leggings
now<00:04:40.100> why<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.340> like<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.640> do<00:04:40.760> that<00:04:40.880> is<00:04:41.030> just<00:04:41.060> use

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
now why I like to do that is just use

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.920 
now why I like to do that is just use
that<00:04:41.690> as<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.900> guide<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.740> how<00:04:43.360> much<00:04:44.360> fabric<00:04:44.630> I'm

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
that as a guide to how much fabric I'm

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.960 
that as a guide to how much fabric I'm
going<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.110> use<00:04:45.200> up<00:04:45.380> top<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.980> slip<00:04:46.280> through<00:04:46.760> the

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
going to use up top to slip through the

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.620 
going to use up top to slip through the
clip<00:04:47.300> and<00:04:48.040> sew<00:04:49.040> the<00:04:49.220> clip<00:04:49.460> on<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:50.120> that<00:04:50.360> top

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
clip and sew the clip on to that top

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.970 
clip and sew the clip on to that top
piece

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.159 

next<00:04:58.730> you're<00:04:58.910> going<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.120> grab<00:04:59.360> two

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
next you're going to grab two

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.739 
next you're going to grab two
you<00:05:00.529> really<00:05:00.830> only<00:05:00.979> need<00:05:01.159> to<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:02.060> what<00:05:02.629> you're

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:02.749 
you really only need to and what you're

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:05.409 
you really only need to and what you're
going<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.900> do<00:05:03.110> is<00:05:03.490> pull<00:05:04.490> that<00:05:04.669> fabric<00:05:05.090> through

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
going to do is pull that fabric through

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.989 
going to do is pull that fabric through
the<00:05:05.599> loop<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.259> clip<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:06.919> on<00:05:07.699> the<00:05:07.849> back

00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:07.999 
the loop of the clip and on the back

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:12.129 
the loop of the clip and on the back
you're<00:05:08.180> going<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.449> pin<00:05:08.689> it<00:05:08.719> together<00:05:09.759> and<00:05:11.139> I

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
you're going to pin it together and I

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.869 
you're going to pin it together and I
would<00:05:12.319> really<00:05:12.499> suggest<00:05:12.680> using<00:05:13.129> pins<00:05:13.550> because

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:13.879 
would really suggest using pins because

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:16.749 
would really suggest using pins because
cotton<00:05:14.629> really<00:05:14.779> likes<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.289> move<00:05:15.439> around<00:05:15.759> so

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
cotton really likes to move around so

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.820 
cotton really likes to move around so
you<00:05:17.389> go<00:05:17.509> ahead<00:05:17.569> and<00:05:17.659> loop<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.080> through<00:05:18.110> and

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
you go ahead and loop it through and

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.450 
you go ahead and loop it through and
just<00:05:19.460> go<00:05:19.580> ahead<00:05:19.669> and<00:05:19.819> pin<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.860> just<00:05:21.860> to<00:05:22.069> secure

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
just go ahead and pin it just to secure

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.100 
just go ahead and pin it just to secure
it<00:05:22.520> you<00:05:22.789> just<00:05:22.969> want<00:05:23.180> to<00:05:23.240> make<00:05:23.360> sure<00:05:23.389> that<00:05:23.960> you

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
it you just want to make sure that you

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:31.810 
it you just want to make sure that you
do<00:05:24.259> that

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.800 

okay<00:05:32.820> so<00:05:32.880> go<00:05:33.060> ahead<00:05:33.120> and<00:05:33.300> grab<00:05:33.419> your<00:05:33.449> needle

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
and thread and the needle size really

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.240 
and thread and the needle size really
doesn't<00:05:36.570> matter<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.259> so<00:05:37.979> what<00:05:38.100> you're<00:05:38.190> going

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
doesn't matter and so what you're going

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.719 
and you're going to stitch it closed in
the<00:05:42.360> back<00:05:42.570> you<00:05:43.410> can<00:05:43.560> just<00:05:43.740> do<00:05:43.860> a<00:05:43.889> basic<00:05:44.310> stitch

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.159 
that you just double up on your thread
and<00:05:49.850> really<00:05:50.850> make<00:05:51.060> it<00:05:51.240> secure<00:05:51.720> you<00:05:51.870> don't<00:05:52.020> want

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169
