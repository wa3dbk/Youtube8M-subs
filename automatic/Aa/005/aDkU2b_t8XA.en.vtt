00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
didn't have the chance to test any of

didn't have the chance to test any of
the<00:00:56.010> switches<00:00:56.399> before<00:00:56.940> buying<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.449> took<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the switches before buying so I took a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.380 
the switches before buying so I took a
gamble<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.030> basically<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> had<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
gamble there and basically I had a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.319 
gamble there and basically I had a
design<00:01:01.129> in<00:01:02.129> mind<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:03.059> wanted<00:01:03.239> to
