okay<00:00:01.290> so<00:00:01.349> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.859> the<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.580> mock-up<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.180> my

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:03.630 
okay so this is the the mock-up of my

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.039 
okay so this is the the mock-up of my
new<00:00:04.500> saltwater<00:00:05.040> tank<00:00:05.370> filtration<00:00:06.090> system<00:00:06.390> it

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
new saltwater tank filtration system it

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.049 
new saltwater tank filtration system it
includes<00:00:07.620> double<00:00:08.189> flow<00:00:08.339> box<00:00:09.259> refugium<00:00:10.259> and

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
includes double flow box refugium and

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.839 
includes double flow box refugium and
the<00:00:12.059> protein<00:00:12.480> skimmer<00:00:12.599> some<00:00:13.610> kind<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.669> unique

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
the protein skimmer some kind of unique

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.179 
the protein skimmer some kind of unique
situation<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.629> had<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.989> fit<00:00:16.320> these<00:00:16.500> things<00:00:16.769> into

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
situation I had to fit these things into

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.480 
situation I had to fit these things into
a<00:00:17.220> very<00:00:17.670> small<00:00:17.789> space<00:00:18.179> so<00:00:19.050> I've<00:00:20.039> got<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> couple

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
a very small space so I've got a couple

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.099 
a very small space so I've got a couple
of<00:00:20.640> pipes<00:00:20.820> ago<00:00:21.150> each<00:00:21.420> way<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.960> is

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
of pipes ago each way and this is

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.839 
of pipes ago each way and this is
basically<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.560> drive<00:00:22.949> fit

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
basically just drive fit

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.460 
basically just drive fit
I<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.240> not<00:00:24.359> glued<00:00:24.630> anything<00:00:24.960> yet<00:00:25.320> so

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
I have not glued anything yet so

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.099 
I have not glued anything yet so
whatever<00:00:26.039> things<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.490> scale<00:00:26.759> in<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.839> proper

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
whatever things to scale in the proper

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.810 
whatever things to scale in the proper
position<00:00:28.560> measurements<00:00:29.249> are<00:00:29.339> correct<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.789> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
position measurements are correct so I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.970 
position measurements are correct so I
could<00:00:30.089> probably<00:00:30.240> glue<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.630> together<00:00:30.980> take

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
could probably glue this together take

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.800 
could probably glue this together take
it<00:00:32.099> back<00:00:32.280> apart<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.910> stick<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.330> into<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
it back apart and stick it into the

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.470 
it back apart and stick it into the
cabin<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.560> we<00:00:34.650> go<00:00:34.970> this<00:00:35.970> is<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.210> overflow

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
cabin so here we go this is the overflow

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.230 
cabin so here we go this is the overflow
900<00:00:37.320> gallons<00:00:37.410> per<00:00:37.770> hour

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.240 
900 gallons per hour

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.660 
900 gallons per hour
okay<00:00:39.240> come<00:00:39.450> down<00:00:39.660> here<00:00:40.490> and<00:00:41.490> it's<00:00:42.060> going<00:00:42.300> to

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
okay come down here and it's going to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.160 
okay come down here and it's going to
split<00:00:44.670> into<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.940> team<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.480> split<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.900> stream

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
split into a team and split the stream

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.200 
split into a team and split the stream
just<00:00:46.680> half<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> stream<00:00:47.520> goes<00:00:47.700> over<00:00:47.880> through

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
just half the stream goes over through

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.760 
just half the stream goes over through
Jim<00:00:48.500> which<00:00:49.500> comes<00:00:49.740> in<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.620> these<00:00:52.620> are

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
Jim which comes in here and these are

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.180 
Jim which comes in here and these are
accustomed<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.370> built<00:00:53.700> sumps<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.040> goes

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
accustomed to built sumps and it goes

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.330 
accustomed to built sumps and it goes
over<00:00:56.310> here<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.320> returns<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> water<00:00:58.710> just

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
over here and returns the water just

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.110 
over here and returns the water just
below<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:01.560> inlet<00:01:01.860> for<00:01:02.130> the<00:01:02.370> other<00:01:02.730> half<00:01:02.970> of

below the inlet for the other half of
the<00:01:03.180> street<00:01:03.420> from<00:01:04.230> the<00:01:04.350> tee<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:04.800> comes<00:01:05.550> down

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
the street from the tee then comes down

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.120 
the street from the tee then comes down
here<00:01:05.970> splits<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.630> dumps<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.650> there<00:01:07.860> this

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
here splits and dumps in there this

protein skimmer it'll sit right in there
nice<00:01:12.930> little<00:01:13.260> tight<00:01:13.470> fit<00:01:13.800> everything<00:01:14.400> will<00:01:14.520> be

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
nice little tight fit everything will be

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.290 
nice little tight fit everything will be
good<00:01:15.290> over<00:01:16.290> here

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
good over here

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.399 
good over here
the<00:01:18.300> water<00:01:18.480> comes<00:01:18.720> through<00:01:18.840> I've<00:01:19.230> got<00:01:19.260> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the water comes through I've got a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
the water comes through I've got a
couple<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.710> baffles<00:01:20.159> get<00:01:21.000> rid<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> most<00:01:21.510> of

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
couple of baffles get rid of the most of

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.180 
couple of baffles get rid of the most of
the<00:01:21.690> bubbles<00:01:22.050> and<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.620> do<00:01:22.740> something

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
the bubbles and I have to do something

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.520 
the bubbles and I have to do something
to<00:01:23.310> get<00:01:23.970> rid<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.180> more<00:01:24.360> bubbles<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:24.870> you<00:01:25.409> know

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
to get rid of more bubbles but you know

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
to get rid of more bubbles but you know
let's<00:01:25.830> go<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.130> goes<00:01:26.310> from<00:01:27.270> there<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.600> drains

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
let's go that goes from there it drains

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.260 
let's go that goes from there it drains
out<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.260> bottom<00:01:29.120> comes<00:01:30.120> over<00:01:30.360> here

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
out the bottom comes over here

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.210 
out the bottom comes over here
and<00:01:32.360> comes<00:01:32.960> here<00:01:33.290> it's<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.590> blue-eyed<00:01:33.890> pump

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
and comes here it's a blue-eyed pump

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.389 
and comes here it's a blue-eyed pump
it's<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.490> 1200<00:01:35.000> gallon<00:01:35.210> per<00:01:35.390> hour<00:01:35.479> pump<00:01:36.369> got<00:01:37.369> a

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
it's a 1200 gallon per hour pump got a

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:38.980 
it's a 1200 gallon per hour pump got a
throttle<00:01:37.610> way<00:01:37.880> back<00:01:38.090> right<00:01:38.119> now<00:01:38.450> just<00:01:38.720> part

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
throttle way back right now just part

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.130 
throttle way back right now just part
because<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.470> mock<00:01:39.950> up<00:01:40.159> tank<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:41.149> so<00:01:41.420> tiny<00:01:41.689> it

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
because the mock up tank is so tiny it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.170 
because the mock up tank is so tiny it
can't<00:01:42.350> handle<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.710> overflow<00:01:43.149> so<00:01:44.149> that's<00:01:45.110> it

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
can't handle the overflow so that's it

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.370 
can't handle the overflow so that's it
I'll<00:01:47.180> shoot<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:47.509> video<00:01:47.720> once<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.020> got<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.229> whole

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
I'll shoot it video once I got the whole

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.050 
I'll shoot it video once I got the whole
thing<00:01:48.409> taken<00:01:48.860> apart<00:01:49.220> showing<00:01:49.520> all<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.670> pieces

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
thing taken apart showing all the pieces

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.370 
thing taken apart showing all the pieces
and<00:01:50.240> parts<00:01:50.539> and<00:01:50.869> then<00:01:51.080> I'll<00:01:51.920> get<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.000> into<00:01:53.149> the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
and parts and then I'll get it into the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.880 
and parts and then I'll get it into the
cabinet<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.409> see<00:01:54.890> if<00:01:55.369> it<00:01:55.460> works<00:01:56.619> back<00:01:57.619> up<00:01:57.799> a

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
cabinet and see if it works back up a

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.450 
cabinet and see if it works back up a
little<00:01:57.979> bit<00:01:59.830> there<00:02:00.830> you<00:02:00.860> go<00:02:00.979> that's<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.340> whole

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
little bit there you go that's the whole

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.820 
little bit there you go that's the whole
system
