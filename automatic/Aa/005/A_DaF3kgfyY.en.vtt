00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:09.440
 The weather in Montenegro in the month of June is very 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:15.000
 unpredictable here today is June 30 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:18.630
 practically already tomorrow, July 1, and we 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.850
 were going to go sunbathe not 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 it will drizzle 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:31.760
 most likely judging by the forecast will be 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.760
 heavy rain possible thunder 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:42.989
 because we are going to think now 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.059
 something we will think up some very options 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.230
 Of course we looked at a lot of interesting 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.750
 here Montenegro is a wonderful country 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.100
 here is the weather in june 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.629
 it can be unpredictable 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.629
 take into account your trips 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.750
 you look great yawn 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.420
 and i will give 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.560
 well today i would like to talk on 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.850
 weather theme 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:43.250
 weather in montenegro in june 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.250
 today is June 30, 2014 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:54.080
 and the weather as you can see is not sunny 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:58.700
 overcast strong wind rainy on the beach 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:04.490
 we didn't manage to go today we 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:08.860
 go to the bar to look at the olive tree 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.860
 which is over 2000 years old 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:24.750
 so what can you not get 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:27.870
 the weather is very cool actually rain 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:33.150
 not yet so very fresh not hot 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.379
 in general, we like her because we 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.989
 travel a lot 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:42.000
 and the people who came to sunbathe here 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:44.359
 swim well I do not know is not very good 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.690
 then overcast 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.640
 surely fail but 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.640
 so easy to be on the beach to swim 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.040
 be able to sunbathe need to understand that 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.680
 from around the holidays about a third probably 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.530
 it will be quite possible this is the weather 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.269
 that is, it should be considered but Montenegro 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.080
 fine so what is that 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.629
 look 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.740
 where to go on various excursions 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:13.350
 you can rent a car by yourself 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.450
 book tours have something to see 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.030
 we traveled here looked very 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.230
 A beautiful country very many interesting 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.510
 places therefore recommend everyone despite 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.680
 sometimes rainy weather after all 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:34.480
 come to montenegro 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.480
 and relax here breathe fine brain 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.599
 Katyusha, what's our temperature here ? 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:46.489
 generally in the month of June at the end of June 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:49.969
 temperature somewhere 26 29 degrees can 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:53.389
 be with the sun and rises a little higher 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:54.480
 now we are going going 26 degrees 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.790
 principle 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.629
 no I think today we have less 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:05.420
 actually pretty hot summer 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:08.430
 water temperature and 22 23 degrees judging by 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.170
 the Internet because the thermometer 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.780
 naturally we are not there and trying not 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.500
 we can like me like that 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:22.850

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:25.700
 warmer despite this is the weather when we 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.520
 Something very hot and such some water she 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.840
 possesses 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.840
 almost all bathes here 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:42.230

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:44.780

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.080

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.080
 teaches above 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.880
 further here 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.129
 a first Morillo 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.580
 here 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.770
 backwards 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.590
 going in feed remember 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.590
 everything 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.710
 on the road beads 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.750
 and how the sea raged and so they decided 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.020
 make a small stop 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.290
 to photograph this beauty a 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.560
 Maurice the first time we see before this was 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.820
 very calm and quiet 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.820
 not even light 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.470
 ears device 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.280
 wide at the start 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.830
 Mario of course 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.370

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.849

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.470
 beach normal 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:12.520
 and now we go swimming 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.590
 so here you can stop somewhere only 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.250

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.250
