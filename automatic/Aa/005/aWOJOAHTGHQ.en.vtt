00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.220 

the<00:00:00.750> way<00:00:00.900> you<00:00:01.550> stopped<00:00:02.550> all<00:00:02.939> progress<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:06.230> by

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
the way you stopped all progress is by

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.589 
the way you stopped all progress is by
breaking<00:00:07.830> your<00:00:07.859> background<00:00:08.460> so<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.389> the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
breaking your background so this is the

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.740 
breaking your background so this is the
hydraulic<00:00:10.260> ram<00:00:10.820> that<00:00:11.820> swings<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.389> backhoe

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
hydraulic ram that swings the backhoe

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.330 
hydraulic ram that swings the backhoe
side-to-side<00:00:13.370> and<00:00:14.540> it<00:00:15.540> broke<00:00:15.980> every<00:00:16.980> single

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
side-to-side and it broke every single

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.109 
side-to-side and it broke every single
bolt<00:00:18.170> around<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.410> each<00:00:19.830> one<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.250> those<00:00:20.400> bolts

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
bolt around it each one of those bolts

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.929 
bolt around it each one of those bolts
is<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> have<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:22.020> removed<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.310> then

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
is going to have to be removed and then

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.340 
is going to have to be removed and then
I'm<00:00:24.060> probably<00:00:24.180> gonna<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.660> need<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> new

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
I'm probably gonna get need to get a new

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.410 
I'm probably gonna get need to get a new
o-rings<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.099> see<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.519> that's<00:00:26.670> torn<00:00:27.119> right

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
o-rings I see that that's torn right

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.509 
o-rings I see that that's torn right
there<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.080> then<00:00:28.289> I'm<00:00:28.439> gonna<00:00:28.710> need<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.099> put<00:00:29.400> it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
there and then I'm gonna need to put it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.859 
there and then I'm gonna need to put it
back<00:00:29.789> together<00:00:30.000> somehow

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
back together somehow

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:40.100 
back together somehow
and<00:00:36.200> either<00:00:37.200> way<00:00:37.610> I'm<00:00:38.610> done<00:00:39.090> digging<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.809> so

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and either way I'm done digging here so

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.139 
and either way I'm done digging here so
I've<00:00:40.350> got<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.620> come<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:41.070> an<00:00:41.640> alternative

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
I've got to come up with an alternative

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.380 
I've got to come up with an alternative
plan<00:00:42.420> here<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:46.680> really<00:00:46.950> sucks<00:00:48.110> so

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
plan here that really really sucks so

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.860 
plan here that really really sucks so
yeah<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:51.539> what's<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.370> we'll<00:00:53.370> see

yeah that's what's going on we'll see
all<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.649> is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
all right so here it is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
all right so here it is
I<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.270> attempt<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> fix<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.109> thing

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
I don't know attempt to fix this thing

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.709 
I don't know attempt to fix this thing
so<00:00:58.579> enjoy<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:01.520> it<00:01:02.520> started<00:01:02.910> by<00:01:03.120> removing<00:01:03.600> all

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
so enjoy so it started by removing all

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.789 
so enjoy so it started by removing all
the<00:01:03.840> bolts<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:05.540> ironically<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:07.320> not<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the bolts and ironically or not so

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.230 
the bolts and ironically or not so
ironically<00:01:08.159> after<00:01:08.310> driving<00:01:08.939> around<00:01:09.119> for

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
ironically after driving around for

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.719 
ironically after driving around for
three<00:01:09.689> hours<00:01:10.020> looking<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.500> screw<00:01:11.189> extractors

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
three hours looking for screw extractors

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.770 
three hours looking for screw extractors
and<00:01:11.760> drill<00:01:12.420> bits<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.990> were<00:01:13.110> sharp<00:01:14.299> all<00:01:15.299> of

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
and drill bits that were sharp all of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
and drill bits that were sharp all of
the<00:01:15.930> bolts<00:01:16.110> except<00:01:16.500> one<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.770> them<00:01:17.030> just<00:01:18.030> fell

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
the bolts except one of them just fell

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.440 
the bolts except one of them just fell
out<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> their<00:01:18.840> holes<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:19.979> ultimately

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
out of their holes it was ultimately

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.570 
out of their holes it was ultimately
frustrating<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> had<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.369> last

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
frustrating so I had to get that last

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.200 
frustrating so I had to get that last
bolt<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.619> tried<00:01:25.619> drilling<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.189> through<00:01:26.909> that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
bolt so I tried drilling in through that

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.990 
bolt so I tried drilling in through that
hydraulic<00:01:28.170> ram<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.640> too<00:01:29.820> hard

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
hydraulic ram but it was just too hard

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.550 
hydraulic ram but it was just too hard
to<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.210> me<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.570> pulled<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> RAM<00:01:31.079> off

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
to get me so I pulled the RAM off

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.260 
to get me so I pulled the RAM off
I<00:01:31.590> had<00:01:32.189> already<00:01:32.369> drilled<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.000> at<00:01:33.150> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
I had already drilled it out at this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.410 
I had already drilled it out at this
point<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:34.439> smaller<00:01:35.369> bit<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.030> was<00:01:36.150> stumbling

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
point a smaller bit and I was stumbling

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.960 
point a smaller bit and I was stumbling
up<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> larger<00:01:37.200> bit<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.130> wasn't<00:01:43.970> I

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
up to a larger bit but it just wasn't I

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.600 
up to a larger bit but it just wasn't I
tried<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> screw<00:01:46.170> extractor<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:47.280> wouldn't

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
tried the screw extractor just wouldn't

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.270 
tried the screw extractor just wouldn't
budge<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.000> bolt<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.500> I'd<00:01:49.500> never<00:01:49.740> used<00:01:50.040> screws

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
budge the bolt and I'd never used screws

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.649 
budge the bolt and I'd never used screws
structures<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.909> don't<00:01:51.090> even<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.390> if<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.540> was

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
structures so I don't even know if I was

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.469 
structures so I don't even know if I was
doing<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.909> then<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.939> decided<00:01:54.329> I'm<00:01:54.420> gonna

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
doing it right then I decided I'm gonna

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.200 
doing it right then I decided I'm gonna
cheat<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:55.140> bit<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:56.060> spin<00:01:57.060> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
cheat a little bit and just spin it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.300 
cheat a little bit and just spin it
inside<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> hole

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.160 

to<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.729> drill<00:02:01.970> bit<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:02.299> then<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.899> put<00:02:03.079> the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
to the drill bit and then I put the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.130 
to the drill bit and then I put the
drill<00:02:03.350> in<00:02:03.380> reverse<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:05.509> bolt<00:02:05.720> came<00:02:05.960> right

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
drill in reverse and the bolt came right

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.219 
drill in reverse and the bolt came right
out<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:06.560> was<00:02:07.040> somewhat<00:02:07.820> astonished<00:02:08.390> at<00:02:09.020> how

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
out I was somewhat astonished at how

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.589 
out I was somewhat astonished at how
well<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.500> worked<00:02:10.180> and<00:02:11.180> then<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.390> basically

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
well that worked and then I basically

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.540 
well that worked and then I basically
cleaned<00:02:12.080> up<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.319> ram<00:02:12.500> get<00:02:12.920> all<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.130> shavings

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
cleaned up the ram get all the shavings

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.240 
cleaned up the ram get all the shavings
out<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.880> way<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.920> slipped<00:02:16.489> it<00:02:16.610> back<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:16.940> I

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
out of the way and slipped it back on I

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.240 
out of the way and slipped it back on I
did<00:02:19.250> not<00:02:19.400> get<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.610> new<00:02:19.760> o-ring<00:02:19.970> it's<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:21.250> that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
did not get a new o-ring it's just that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.550 
did not get a new o-ring it's just that
the<00:02:22.640> cut<00:02:22.970> didn't<00:02:23.269> seem<00:02:23.450> too<00:02:23.660> bad<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.440> I

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
the cut didn't seem too bad in it and I

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.350 
the cut didn't seem too bad in it and I
also<00:02:25.040> couldn't<00:02:25.430> even<00:02:25.640> imagine<00:02:25.730> where<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.239> would

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
also couldn't even imagine where I would

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.140 
also couldn't even imagine where I would
get<00:02:26.930> one<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:29.319> put<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.410> RAM<00:02:30.590> back<00:02:30.800> on<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.370> put

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
get one so put the RAM back on and put

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.949 
get one so put the RAM back on and put
all<00:02:32.239> my<00:02:32.330> bolts<00:02:32.630> in

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
all my bolts in

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.390 
all my bolts in
however<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:34.160> bolts<00:02:34.810> happened<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.930> be<00:02:36.190> 1/16<00:02:37.190> of

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
however the bolts happened to be 1/16 of

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.910 
however the bolts happened to be 1/16 of
an<00:02:37.549> inch<00:02:37.670> too<00:02:37.940> long<00:02:38.209> for<00:02:38.660> these<00:02:38.840> holes<00:02:39.140> I'm<00:02:39.709> not

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
an inch too long for these holes I'm not

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.820 
an inch too long for these holes I'm not
entirely<00:02:40.220> sure<00:02:40.459> why<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:41.900> what<00:02:42.530> I'm<00:02:42.680> not

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
entirely sure why and so what I'm not

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.160 
entirely sure why and so what I'm not
showing<00:02:43.130> in<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.400> video<00:02:43.489> is<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:44.330> hour<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:45.140> I

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
showing in the video is the hour that I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.670 
showing in the video is the hour that I
spent<00:02:45.670> trying<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:47.030> modify<00:02:47.569> washers<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.650> I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
spent trying to modify washers that I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.509 
spent trying to modify washers that I
had<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.700> go<00:02:49.849> over<00:02:50.150> these<00:02:50.269> bolts<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:51.019> was<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.650> very

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
had to go over these bolts it was a very

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.940 
had to go over these bolts it was a very
long<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:53.030> tedious<00:02:53.180> process<00:02:53.599> but<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.349> finally

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
long and tedious process but I finally

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.009 
long and tedious process but I finally
got<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.250> so<00:02:55.549> I<00:02:55.580> had<00:02:55.819> flat<00:02:56.060> washers<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.750> lock

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
got it so I had flat washers and lock

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.350 
got it so I had flat washers and lock
washers<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.370> brought<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.819> bolt<00:02:59.030> out

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
washers and that brought the bolt out

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.509 
washers and that brought the bolt out
enough<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.769> didn't<00:03:01.010> bottom<00:03:01.190> out<00:03:01.430> in

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
enough so that it didn't bottom out in

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.530 
enough so that it didn't bottom out in
the<00:03:01.549> hole<00:03:01.790> so<00:03:02.420> oh<00:03:03.430> man<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.700> sure<00:03:04.880> was<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.060> process

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
the hole so oh man it sure was a process

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.380 
the hole so oh man it sure was a process
but<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.049> did<00:03:06.320> end<00:03:06.470> up<00:03:06.560> getting<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:07.390> back

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
but I did end up getting it back

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.300 
but I did end up getting it back
together<00:03:08.600> in<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:08.989> same<00:03:09.260> day<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.799> finish<00:03:10.130> all

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
together in that same day and finish all

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.580 
together in that same day and finish all
my<00:03:10.340> digging<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.989> was<00:03:12.140> pretty<00:03:12.350> much<00:03:12.470> my

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
my digging so that was pretty much my

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.759 
my digging so that was pretty much my
goal<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.720> basically<00:03:14.720> tighten<00:03:15.380> these<00:03:15.500> bolts

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
goal and basically tighten these bolts

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.580 
goal and basically tighten these bolts
up<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:17.180> had<00:03:17.600> one<00:03:17.750> hydraulic<00:03:18.200> line<00:03:18.380> that<00:03:18.560> I

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
up and I had one hydraulic line that I

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.130 
up and I had one hydraulic line that I
moved<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.790> I<00:03:19.910> said<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.480> had<00:03:20.630> to<00:03:20.660> loosen<00:03:21.049> that

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
moved and I said I had to loosen that

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.030 
moved and I said I had to loosen that
and<00:03:21.200> put<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.620> back<00:03:21.799> down<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:22.310> then<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.549> tested
