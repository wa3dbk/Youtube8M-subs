00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
there but actually a good flop when you

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.199 
there but actually a good flop when you
have<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.869> small<00:01:38.229> pair<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.670> only<00:01:39.880> way<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.060> can

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
have a small pair the only way you can

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:41.639 
have a small pair the only way you can
be<00:01:40.390> beat<00:01:40.599> here<00:01:40.810> essentially<00:01:41.170> as<00:01:41.380> if<00:01:41.500> your

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
be beat here essentially as if your

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.949 
be beat here essentially as if your
opponent's<00:01:42.009> got<00:01:42.130> a<00:01:42.160> bigger<00:01:42.429> pair<00:01:42.810> now<00:01:43.810> there

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
you only suspect your opponent could

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.050 
you only suspect your opponent could
