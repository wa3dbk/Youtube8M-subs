but what I do after all ported him my
shoving<00:00:56.399> back<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.109> sandblaster<00:00:58.109> blast

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
shoving back in the sandblaster blast

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.250 
shoving back in the sandblaster blast
them<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.039> blend<00:00:59.309> everything<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
them all just to blend everything in and

them all just to blend everything in and
then<00:01:01.260> give<00:01:01.620> him<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.980> exhaust<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> change

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
as it is so basically I've done is going

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.700 
as it is so basically I've done is going
out<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.610> around<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:13.200> gasket<00:01:13.439> line<00:01:14.360> here

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
out to around the gasket line here

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.160 
out to around the gasket line here
alright<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.150> then<00:01:18.150> what<00:01:18.509> I've<00:01:18.659> done<00:01:18.869> is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
alright and then what I've done is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.090 
alright and then what I've done is
shorten<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.880> radius<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.479> short<00:01:21.890> here<00:01:22.890> in

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
shorten the the radius the short here in

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.380 
shorten the the radius the short here in
your<00:01:23.220> middle<00:01:24.710> separator<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:26.090> to<00:01:27.090> give<00:01:27.270> you

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
your middle separator there to give you

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
your middle separator there to give you
more<00:01:28.100> or<00:01:29.100> less<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.790> radius<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.369> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
more or less of a radius and that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.160 
more or less of a radius and that
reduces<00:01:32.970> your<00:01:33.000> um<00:01:33.390> low-pressure<00:01:35.450> areas<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
reduces your um low-pressure areas of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.560 
reduces your um low-pressure areas of
flow<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.090> your<00:01:39.240> standard<00:01:39.450> ones<00:01:40.460> okay

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
flow so I know your standard ones okay

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.360 
flow so I know your standard ones okay
also<00:01:43.290> when<00:01:43.440> you're<00:01:43.560> standing<00:01:43.800> ones<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.220> can

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
also when you're standing ones you can

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.730 
also when you're standing ones you can
see<00:01:44.400> up<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:46.700> in<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.450> underneath<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> valve

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
see up here in the underneath the valve

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.650 
see up here in the underneath the valve
seat<00:01:50.040> there's<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> big<00:01:50.610> rip<00:01:50.880> under<00:01:51.210> there<00:01:51.390> for

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
seat there's a big rip under there for

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.420 
seat there's a big rip under there for
the<00:01:52.590> inserts<00:01:53.420> sign<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.690> inlet<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:56.270> there

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
the inserts sign on the inlet that there

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.810 
the inserts sign on the inlet that there
so<00:01:59.430> what<00:01:59.850> we<00:01:59.970> do<00:02:00.120> is<00:02:00.500> hold<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.740> with<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:01.980> Inlet

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so what we do is hold on with this Inlet

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.300 
so what we do is hold on with this Inlet
city<00:02:03.180> invites<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.890> it's<00:02:04.890> blended<00:02:05.220> over

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
city invites you it's blended over

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.840 
city invites you it's blended over
inserts<00:02:06.210> into<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> throats<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.610> bolting<00:02:09.330> out

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
inserts into the throats and bolting out

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.650 
inserts into the throats and bolting out
on<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:11.970> let's<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.940> not<00:02:15.120> much<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.450> come

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
on the let's it not much have to come

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.180 
on the let's it not much have to come
out<00:02:15.810> of<00:02:15.870> there<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.050> let's<00:02:16.200> say<00:02:16.410> same<00:02:16.830> again

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
out of there and let's say same again

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.220 
out of there and let's say same again
what<00:02:17.430> I've<00:02:17.520> done<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.790> concentrated<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.630> the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
what I've done is concentrated in the

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.720 
what I've done is concentrated in the
inside<00:02:19.760> radius<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:24.320> just<00:02:25.320> down<00:02:25.560> there<00:02:26.340> and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
inside radius it just down there and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.710 
inside radius it just down there and
they're<00:02:27.090> an<00:02:28.080> actual<00:02:28.650> fact<00:02:29.100> you've<00:02:29.640> got<00:02:29.880> your

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
they're an actual fact you've got your

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.420 
they're an actual fact you've got your
short<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.110> great<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.440> coming<00:02:31.770> around<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.280> then

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
short so great is coming around and then

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.970 
short so great is coming around and then
angle<00:02:32.550> like<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.850> if<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:34.020> take<00:02:34.290> some<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
angle like that if I take some of the

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.140 
angle like that if I take some of the
top<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:36.240> then<00:02:36.870> makes<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:37.980> radius<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.550> lot

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
top that then makes that radius a lot

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.750 
top that then makes that radius a lot
more<00:02:39.300> flutter<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.430> you're<00:02:41.430> going<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.640> get

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
more flutter and you're going to get

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.400 
more flutter and you're going to get
much<00:02:42.000> more<00:02:42.180> high<00:02:42.480> flow<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:45.330> basically<00:02:46.230> that's

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
much more high flow so basically that's

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.590 
much more high flow so basically that's
it<00:02:46.680> now<00:02:46.860> before<00:02:47.100> I'm<00:02:47.370> gonna<00:02:47.520> do<00:02:47.700> now<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.150> finish

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
it now before I'm gonna do now is finish

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.479 
it now before I'm gonna do now is finish
him<00:02:48.840> off<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.200> said<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.530> usually<00:02:50.100> when<00:02:50.340> you

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
him off like I said I usually when you

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.960 
him off like I said I usually when you
port<00:02:50.940> you're<00:02:51.570> better<00:02:51.720> off<00:02:51.810> doing<00:02:54.140> everything

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
port you're better off doing everything

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.449 
port you're better off doing everything
your<00:02:56.970> chambers<00:02:57.360> then<00:02:58.050> go<00:02:58.230> through<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.769> do<00:02:58.890> or

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
your chambers then go through and do or

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.640 
your chambers then go through and do or
your<00:02:59.640> exhaust<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.450> know<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> bottom<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.470> your

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
your exhaust you know the bottom of your

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.670 
your exhaust you know the bottom of your
ports<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.940> you're<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.180> in<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:04.290> know<00:03:04.410> in

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
ports so you're just in that you know in

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.479 
ports so you're just in that you know in
that<00:03:05.130> groove<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.630> can<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.560> know<00:03:07.680> it's<00:03:08.160> a

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
that groove so you can you know it's a

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.560 
that groove so you can you know it's a
lot<00:03:08.730> better<00:03:09.230> doing<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.440> way<00:03:10.650> because<00:03:11.570> you

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
lot better doing it that way because you

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.720 
lot better doing it that way because you
gonna<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.410> lot<00:03:13.530> more<00:03:13.560> even<00:03:14.070> from<00:03:14.400> court<00:03:14.610> to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
gonna be a lot more even from court to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.910 
gonna be a lot more even from court to
court<00:03:14.760> as<00:03:15.600> you're<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:16.019> doing<00:03:16.290> each<00:03:16.560> little

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
court as you're just doing each little

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.250 
court as you're just doing each little
bit<00:03:17.100> at<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.310> time<00:03:17.340> then<00:03:17.940> roll<00:03:18.150> over<00:03:18.180> do<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.050> bit

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
bit at a time then roll over do that bit

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.460 
bit at a time then roll over do that bit
toward<00:03:20.100> your<00:03:20.280> throats<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:21.630> then<00:03:22.230> do<00:03:22.320> your

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
toward your throats and then do your

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.830 
toward your throats and then do your
inner<00:03:22.739> plates<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.370> that's<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.970> way<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.570> go

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
inner plates and that's the way to go

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.140 
inner plates and that's the way to go
I've<00:03:25.050> only<00:03:25.200> just<00:03:25.290> done<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.910> just<00:03:26.910> so<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.090> can

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
see I've actually taken about glides

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.870 
see I've actually taken about glides
down<00:03:29.130> they<00:03:30.000> get<00:03:30.180> flow<00:03:31.040> right<00:03:32.040> three<00:03:32.519> develop

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
down they get flow right three develop

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.720 
down they get flow right three develop
Gordon<00:03:33.180> yeah<00:03:33.739> so<00:03:34.739> that's<00:03:34.920> basically<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.550> now

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
too like that when I'm roughing out I

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.870 
too like that when I'm roughing out I
get<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:21.829> in<00:04:21.980> the<00:04:22.040> dryer<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.580> give<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:22.850> a

get this in the dryer and give it a

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.270 
get this in the dryer and give it a
whack<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.330> puts<00:04:23.570> it<00:04:23.660> out<00:04:23.780> of<00:04:23.930> round<00:04:24.919> a<00:04:25.100> bit

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
whack so it puts it out of round a bit

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.600 
whack so it puts it out of round a bit
and<00:04:25.520> vibrates<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:27.230> cuts<00:04:27.500> more<00:04:27.830> material

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
and vibrates and that cuts more material

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.250 
and vibrates and that cuts more material
here<00:04:28.640> and<00:04:29.419> then<00:04:29.600> I'll<00:04:29.720> just<00:04:29.870> get<00:04:29.990> my<00:04:30.140> toy
