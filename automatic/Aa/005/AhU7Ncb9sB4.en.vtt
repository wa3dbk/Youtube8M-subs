animated Transformers movie from the 80s
and<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.860> don't<00:02:29.920> think<00:02:30.190> there<00:02:30.280> are<00:02:30.340> many<00:02:30.670> people

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790

and I don't think there are many people
like<00:02:31.300> that<00:02:31.630> out<00:02:31.690> there<00:02:31.900> most<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.800> think

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.940 
personally I think it leaves a lot to be
desired<00:02:38.320> but<00:02:38.800> that's<00:02:39.700> for<00:02:40.330> another<00:02:40.660> rant<00:02:41.530> then
