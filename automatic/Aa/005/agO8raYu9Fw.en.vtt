00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
is fine I just wanted it as a background

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.220 
is fine I just wanted it as a background
in<00:03:41.640> case<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:42.420> haven't<00:03:42.570> figured<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.990> out<00:03:43.170> yet

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
in case you haven't figured it out yet

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.890 
in case you haven't figured it out yet
I'm<00:03:43.680> doing<00:03:44.040> all<00:03:44.280> craft<00:03:44.700> cardstock<00:03:45.090> for<00:03:45.720> this

I'm doing all craft cardstock for this
Disney<00:03:46.230> trip<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.840> then<00:03:48.960> probably<00:03:49.320> when<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.720> do

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
Disney trip and then probably when I do

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.570 
Disney trip and then probably when I do
my<00:03:51.960> album<00:03:52.850> which<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> Mickey<00:03:54.480> album<00:03:55.580> I'm

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
my album which is a Mickey album I'm

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.000 
my album which is a Mickey album I'm
probably<00:03:56.970> gonna<00:03:57.360> put<00:03:57.720> previous<00:03:58.290> trips<00:03:58.650> in<00:03:58.860> it

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
probably gonna put previous trips in it

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.160 
probably gonna put previous trips in it
and<00:03:59.310> then<00:03:59.940> I'll<00:04:00.030> just<00:04:00.209> separate<00:04:00.660> them<00:04:00.780> out<00:04:00.930> by

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
and then I'll just separate them out by

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.430 
and then I'll just separate them out by
title<00:04:01.530> pages<00:04:01.740> and<00:04:02.040> ears<00:04:02.570> so<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:03.630> can<00:04:03.840> kind<00:04:04.410> of

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
title pages and ears so I can kind of

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.010 
title pages and ears so I can kind of
keep<00:04:04.620> track<00:04:04.920> of<00:04:05.070> everything<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:06.720> that's<00:04:06.840> what

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
keep track of everything so that's what

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.780 
keep track of everything so that's what
I<00:04:07.080> have<00:04:07.290> for<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.190> I'm<00:04:08.340> gonna<00:04:08.490> go<00:04:08.670> ahead

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
I have for that and I'm gonna go ahead

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.420 
I have for that and I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:04:09.330> get<00:04:10.260> that<00:04:10.410> adhered<00:04:10.860> down<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:14.160> you<00:04:14.250> have

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
and get that adhered down so you have

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.900 
and get that adhered down so you have
that<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.910> then<00:04:16.190> that<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.459> cut<00:04:17.700> from<00:04:17.850> the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910

it cut at two and a quarter inches and

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.540 
it cut at two and a quarter inches and
then<00:04:23.400> I'm<00:04:23.520> going<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:23.760> put<00:04:23.970> down<00:04:24.150> my<00:04:25.040> 2011<00:04:28.550> wait

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
then I'm going to put down my 2011 wait

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.860 
then I'm going to put down my 2011 wait
and<00:04:30.300> get<00:04:30.450> one<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.750> these<00:04:32.330> make<00:04:33.330> sure<00:04:33.510> I<00:04:33.600> give<00:04:33.780> it

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
and get one of these make sure I give it

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.100 
and get one of these make sure I give it
a<00:04:33.900> hair<00:04:34.140> so<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.560> fits<00:04:35.780> kind<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:36.900> go<00:04:37.020> it

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
a hair so it fits kind of go it

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.840 
a hair so it fits kind of go it
backwards

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.180 

and<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.510> will<00:04:42.600> probably<00:04:42.900> cut<00:04:43.670> car<00:04:44.670> most<00:04:45.000> of

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
and it will probably cut car most of

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.000 
and it will probably cut car most of
meaning<00:04:47.190> but<00:04:48.050> like<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:49.140> said<00:04:49.200> I<00:04:49.380> just<00:04:49.410> wanted<00:04:49.860> as

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
meaning but like I said I just wanted as

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.640 
meaning but like I said I just wanted as
a<00:04:50.070> background<00:04:50.580> it's<00:04:50.730> not<00:04:50.910> necessarily<00:04:51.650> I'm

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
a background it's not necessarily I'm

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.080 
a background it's not necessarily I'm
supposed<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.160> show<00:04:53.490> through<00:04:53.850> so<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:56.580> have<00:04:56.820> that
