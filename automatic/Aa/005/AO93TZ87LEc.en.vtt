00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.480
 hi youtube how are you today we will be 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.759
 making a video better said a mini 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.730
 tutorial in which you will learn how to 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.030
 root the samsung galaxy mini we go with 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.030
 the video 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.890
 ok let's start with this mini 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.570
 tutorial for those who do not know what 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.730
 That surrounds them 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.160
 surrounded means in general terms 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.610
 that had been in the range of android 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.070
 it's like unlocking and making the most 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.620
 benefit to these android devices 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.470
 with which we will obtain this 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.620
 icon that I do not know if you can see here you 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.260
 Superuser says that what is 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.839
 superuser is the icon in which everything 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.089
 must have at the time of blood ice and 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.700
 let's show a little bit in which 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.340
 these applications need routes or 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.340
 eventually 17 can see let's see 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.210
 for example this to move from 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.280
 applications of the sd card was the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.950
 fourth of the phones has many 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.439
 problems with them this to modify 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.750
 the frequency of the cpu better said to 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.030
 processor and that would be the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.860
 applications and there are many more before 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.080
 how is the tutorial then have in 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.470
 Of course, if you have this model 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.159
 you must have at least in this model 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.159
 the android version 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.980
 2.3 points 6 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.680
 this option you must have if you do not have it 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.570
 you can not make the group let's start 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.910
 with the video well before starting with 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.710
 this video in the description of this I'm going 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.990
 to leave a link in which they are going to 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.140
 download the file with which we are going to 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.000
 root this phone there you what 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.640
 they download and they want to do it we are going to 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.210
 go directly to the sd card and 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.150
 be via bluetooth card with a 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.190
 adapter or because to the usb of any 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.320
 of those three forms can serve what 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.990
 you pass the micro sd to a folder 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.330
 specific and point what we are going to do 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.790
 now 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.260
 but you can download the file and move 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.610
 back that makes you what we will do 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.610
 now let's turn off the phone 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.940
 we have to turn off 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.849
 Tell remembers spending the file phono 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.310
 on obviously a folder comes up 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.260
 specific that you remember the name and 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.409
 then the phone turns off 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.950
 well already the phone is turned off now let's go 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.810
 to enter the recovery mode we are going to bring 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.799
 that way how you can enter there are videos 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.079
 that on YouTube show us for example 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.090
 here they express this class is wrong this 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.250
 it does not work well I discovered the way 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.220
 which is simply pressing the home button 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.700
 what is this plus the power button 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.340
 we have lowered it has pressed loose and 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.540
 we are in mode I will pick up well we enter 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.250
 to run mode 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.609
 and what we're going to do now is look 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.510
 the second option that would be 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:22.099
 here 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.860
 you have to do iphones you should 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:30.520
 we choose the option by going down with the key 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:33.190
 to look for volume and press the home 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.960
 well it will not lead to this part and in 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.520
 this case as delhi people increase what 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.250
 I went to the sim folder 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.500
 we go down 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.500
 let's see again home 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.820
 and we chose the file to before before 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.460
 that this step does not unpack the 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.410
 file for no reason only going to 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.990
 do the sd card to a folder and 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.930
 nothing nothing more than that 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:06.740
 we chose the second would have being the 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:09.620
 rootear file for both home button 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.870
 and will begin to reuters 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.400
 that's all there is to do and we 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.600
 it says it's rooted we're going to focus 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.859
 a little 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.260
 country 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.450
 urrutia 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.000
 and what we're going to do now is give 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.750
 that option the first one that says robot 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.720
 system now 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.210
 will begin to restart the cell phone well 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.770
 once the phone has restarted following 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.470
 these previous steps that we have done 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.150
 let's verify that we have the 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.490
 superuser that is doing the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.830
 Program 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.680
 for those who have the phone already 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.689
 rooted well eventually we have the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.049
 superuser who is 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:54.510
 so you can see in the video that 

00:04:52.049 --> 00:04:57.060
 focus a little 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.250
 so they can see the icon so that 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.380
 be aware that they have to 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.340
 have this icon if I made superuser 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.830
 because the phone is blocked if 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.470
 well it is nowadays being very easy to 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.140
 show the phone is already installed some 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.620
 applications that we could do other 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.140
 next good tutorial can happen 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:22.290
 applications to the sd card since this 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.670
 phone has very little memory and 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:28.290
 we want to make the most of it 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:30.120
 obviously study I did it at the request of 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.380

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.390
