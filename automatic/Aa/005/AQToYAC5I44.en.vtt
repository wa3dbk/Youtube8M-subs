00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
about you saw him all the time when

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.369 
about you saw him all the time when
storm<00:01:00.180> two<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.600> was<00:01:00.690> even<00:01:00.840> worse<00:01:00.930> there

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
storm two and it was even worse there

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.270 
storm two and it was even worse there
you<00:01:02.340> had<00:01:02.489> no<00:01:02.789> no<00:01:03.390> no<00:01:03.930> substitution<00:01:04.860> gauge<00:01:05.070> on

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you had no no no substitution gauge on

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.770 
you had no no no substitution gauge on
that<00:01:05.430> thing<00:01:05.700> which<00:01:06.330> was<00:01:06.540> absolutely

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that thing which was absolutely

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.300 
that thing which was absolutely
horrifying<00:01:07.770> say<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> least<00:01:09.830> but<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.220> know

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
horrifying say the least but you know

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.770 
horrifying say the least but you know
probably<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.670> most<00:01:11.850> smartest<00:01:12.270> play<00:01:12.479> there<00:01:12.750> is

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
probably as most smartest play there is

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.210 
probably as most smartest play there is
going<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.320> back<00:01:13.530> dash<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.010> going

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
going for that back dash and then going

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.249 
going for that back dash and then going
into<00:01:14.369> his<00:01:14.549> weakening<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.090> pool<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:16.110> he<00:01:16.229> is

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
into his weakening in pool there he is

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
into his weakening in pool there he is
and<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.420> use

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and I don't really like to use

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.719 
and I don't really like to use
awakenings<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.439> i'll<00:01:19.560> use<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.310> i<00:01:20.490> have

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
awakenings but i'll use them if i have

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.420 
awakenings but i'll use them if i have
to<00:01:20.970> i<00:01:21.470> was<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> use<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.340> i

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
to i was going to use it there but i

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.980

I<00:01:47.729> could<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.149> pretty<00:01:48.509> much<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.840> throw<00:01:49.170> an

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
I could just pretty much just throw an

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.639 
I could just pretty much just throw an
and<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:49.979> led<00:01:50.340> me<00:01:50.520> into<00:01:50.670> my<00:01:50.909> awakening<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
and that's led me into my awakening and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.109 
and that's led me into my awakening and
from<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.950> well<00:01:53.340> from<00:01:53.490> here<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:53.850> yeah

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
it's pretty much easy for me because

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.819

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.300 
rockley's very close range in person
since<00:01:59.490> he's<00:01:59.670> only<00:01:59.820> got<00:02:00.000> his<00:02:00.119> taijutsu<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
since he's only got his taijutsu and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.660 
since he's only got his taijutsu and
Conan<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.840> medium-range<00:02:03.840> jutsu

her condo as a medium range so it's

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.500

particular matchup here and this was

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.809 
particular matchup here and this was
kinda<00:02:58.910> where<00:02:59.060> things<00:02:59.330> went<00:02:59.660> downhill<00:03:00.049> for<00:03:00.530> me

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
kinda where things went downhill for me

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.230 
feel no regret in doing this at all
because<00:04:39.380> this<00:04:40.380> was<00:04:40.740> pretty<00:04:41.010> much<00:04:41.250> rape<00:04:41.610> as<00:04:41.940> you

every time you get hit with him so that

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.370 
every time you get hit with him so that
means<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.030> can<00:04:48.180> pretty<00:04:48.330> much<00:04:48.419> just<00:04:48.750> cancel

out of your combo and start another one
it's<00:04:51.300> very<00:04:51.540> overpowered<00:04:52.110> but<00:04:52.380> with<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.220> right

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
it's very overpowered but with the right

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.430 
it's very overpowered but with the right
setup<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:54.090> right<00:04:54.540> supports<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.169> easily

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
setup and right supports just easily

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.440 
setup and right supports just easily
it's<00:04:55.800> easy<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.310> get<00:04:56.430> around<00:04:56.550> but<00:04:57.030> since<00:04:57.330> he

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
it's easy to get around but since he

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.840 
it's easy to get around but since he
just<00:04:57.660> used<00:04:57.900> his<00:04:58.080> support<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.590> whatnot<00:04:58.950> they

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
just used his support and whatnot they

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.909 
just used his support and whatnot they
