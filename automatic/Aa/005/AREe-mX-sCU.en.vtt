is tenor saxophone will be using it as
as<00:00:09.150> our<00:00:09.740> test<00:00:11.059> tool<00:00:13.130> it's<00:00:14.130> all<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.639> same<00:00:14.820> no

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
as our test tool it's all the same no

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.279 
as our test tool it's all the same no
matter<00:00:15.299> what<00:00:15.509> kind<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.719> saxophone<00:00:16.139> you're

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.820 
matter what kind of saxophone you're
playing<00:00:16.500> whether<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.980> very<00:00:17.160> sax<00:00:17.490> or<00:00:20.630> so

playing whether it's a very sax or so
overtones<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.490> great<00:00:24.090> way<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.330> build

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
overtones is a great way to build

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.570 
overtones is a great way to build
embouchure<00:00:26.070> strength<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:27.240> build<00:00:27.390> your<00:00:27.660> tone

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
embouchure strength to build your tone

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.430 
embouchure strength to build your tone
and<00:00:29.580> also<00:00:30.539> as<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:31.099> preliminary<00:00:32.099> exercises<00:00:33.059> for

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
and also as a preliminary exercises for

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
and also as a preliminary exercises for
autism<00:00:34.440> oh<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:38.180> I'm<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:40.489> some<00:00:41.489> Lodi

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
autism oh so I'm going to do some Lodi

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.160 
autism oh so I'm going to do some Lodi
and<00:00:43.219> I<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.430> my<00:00:44.670> own<00:00:44.700> subjective<00:00:45.300> reason<00:00:45.989> for

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and I have my own subjective reason for

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.650 
and I have my own subjective reason for
that<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:47.219> prefer<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.210> because<00:00:49.070> i<00:00:50.480> kind<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
that I I prefer this because i kind of

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.900 
that I I prefer this because i kind of
consider<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:52.469> part<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> horn<00:00:53.309> as

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.080 

superfluous<00:00:59.930> think<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.730> straight<00:01:02.730> part

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
superfluous think of this straight part

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.560 
superfluous think of this straight part
of<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.270> horn<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.750> main<00:01:05.270> producer<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
of the horn is the main producer of the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.070 
of the horn is the main producer of the
sound<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> do<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.720> start<00:01:09.960> my

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
sound so I do my like to start my

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.390 
sound so I do my like to start my
overtones<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:12.560> but<00:01:13.560> that's<00:01:13.740> not<00:01:13.920> important

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
overtones here but that's not important

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.940 
overtones here but that's not important
so<00:01:17.390> so<00:01:18.390> practicing<00:01:18.930> these<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.590> saxophone

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
so so practicing these on the saxophone

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.399 
so so practicing these on the saxophone
let's<00:01:20.820> start<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.509> low<00:01:21.689> key

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.929 

that's<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.530> fundamental<00:01:27.740> Tom<00:01:28.520> what<00:01:28.759> comes

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
that's the fundamental Tom what comes

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.170 
that's the fundamental Tom what comes
out<00:01:29.149> of<00:01:29.180> this<00:01:30.399> that's<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.520> lowest<00:01:31.729> time<00:01:32.030> you

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
out of this that's the lowest time you

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.440 
out of this that's the lowest time you
can<00:01:32.329> get<00:01:32.560> but<00:01:34.539> if<00:01:35.539> you<00:01:36.229> without<00:01:36.920> changing<00:01:37.670> in

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
can get but if you without changing in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.130 
can get but if you without changing in
the<00:01:38.750> fingering<00:01:39.289> you<00:01:39.979> can<00:01:40.159> get<00:01:43.240> hmm<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.570> that

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
the fingering you can get hmm and that

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.919 
the fingering you can get hmm and that
is<00:01:45.439> by<00:01:45.950> adjusting<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.549> cavity<00:01:47.360> in<00:01:47.600> your

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
is by adjusting the cavity in your

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.419 
is by adjusting the cavity in your
throat<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.470> your<00:01:48.679> mouth<00:01:48.829> and<00:01:49.869> you<00:01:50.950> really<00:01:51.950> kind

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
throat in your mouth and you really kind

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.190 
throat in your mouth and you really kind
of<00:01:52.520> have<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.880> fiddle<00:01:53.479> around<00:01:53.659> with<00:01:53.960> it

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
of have to fiddle around with it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.649 
of have to fiddle around with it
yourself<00:01:54.289> just<00:01:54.890> know<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:55.579> it's<00:01:56.390> possible

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
yourself just know that it's possible

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:31.870 
yourself just know that it's possible
it's<00:01:57.649> usually<00:01:58.690> going<00:01:59.690> on<00:02:30.040> again<00:02:31.040> the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
it's usually going on again the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.199 
it's usually going on again the
fingering<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.750> same<00:02:34.120> I'm<00:02:35.120> just<00:02:37.209> affecting

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
fingering is the same I'm just affecting

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.860 
fingering is the same I'm just affecting
the<00:02:38.530> velocity<00:02:39.530> of<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:40.340> air<00:02:43.660> my<00:02:44.660> top

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the velocity of the air my top

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.470 
the velocity of the air my top
cavity<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.799> my<00:02:46.830> throat<00:02:47.330> it's<00:02:48.330> a

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
cavity in my throat it's a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.070 
cavity in my throat it's a
trial-and-error<00:02:48.900> kind<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.620> thing<00:02:50.900> it's<00:02:51.900> not

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
trial-and-error kind of thing it's not

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.589 
trial-and-error kind of thing it's not
impossible<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:53.640> still<00:02:53.909> ultimately<00:02:54.120> a

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
impossible and it's still ultimately a

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.160 
impossible and it's still ultimately a
very<00:02:54.810> natural<00:02:55.080> thing<00:02:56.269> just<00:02:57.269> have<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.599> have<00:02:58.080> to

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
very natural thing just have to have to

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.720 
very natural thing just have to have to
experiment<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.830> find<00:02:59.129> yourself<00:02:59.489> you'll

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
experiment with and find yourself you'll

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:12.619 
experiment with and find yourself you'll
find<00:02:59.970> it<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.790> they're<00:03:12.000> not<00:03:12.180> going<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.420> be

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
find it so they're not going to be

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.380 
find it so they're not going to be
perfectly<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.799> tune<00:03:14.069> as<00:03:14.489> they<00:03:14.849> naturally

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
perfectly in tune as they naturally

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:27.580 
perfectly in tune as they naturally
happen<00:03:15.750> Oh<00:03:15.900> as<00:03:16.709> if<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.099> regard<00:03:17.400> was<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:17.700> play

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.009 

saxophone<00:03:28.590> has<00:03:28.859> its<00:03:29.099> idiosyncrasies<00:03:31.129> so<00:03:33.019> you

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
saxophone has its idiosyncrasies so you

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.020 
saxophone has its idiosyncrasies so you
can<00:03:34.170> make<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.470> choice<00:03:34.980> yourself<00:03:35.459> whether<00:03:35.700> to

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
can make the choice yourself whether to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.270 
can make the choice yourself whether to
use<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:37.049> tuner<00:03:37.409> and<00:03:37.680> try<00:03:37.859> to<00:03:37.920> get<00:03:38.129> these

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
use a tuner and try to get these

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.220 
use a tuner and try to get these
overtones<00:03:38.760> in<00:03:38.909> tune<00:03:39.150> which<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.569> really<00:03:40.049> hard

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
overtones in tune which is really hard

00:03:40.230 --> 00:04:27.750 
overtones in tune which is really hard
or<00:03:41.329> just<00:03:42.329> plan<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:53.930> can<00:03:54.930> try<00:03:55.139> to

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.790 

yeah<00:04:28.760> so<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:29.210> can<00:04:29.449> do<00:04:29.600> that<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:29.810> every<00:04:30.380> note<00:04:30.560> on

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
yeah so you can do that on every note on

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.520 
yeah so you can do that on every note on
the<00:04:30.949> horn<00:04:31.479> literally<00:04:32.479> every<00:04:32.750> note<00:04:32.930> has<00:04:33.260> its

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
the horn literally every note has its

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.240 
the horn literally every note has its
own<00:04:33.710> overtone<00:04:34.190> series<00:04:34.370> oh<00:04:34.990> I'll<00:04:35.990> do<00:04:36.320> get<00:04:37.010> to

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
own overtone series oh I'll do get to

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.400 
own overtone series oh I'll do get to
close<00:04:37.520> this<00:04:37.729> I'll<00:04:38.030> do<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.210> couple<00:04:38.570> quick<00:04:39.139> little

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410
