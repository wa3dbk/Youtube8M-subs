2.2 so the first thing we need to do is

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.350 
2.2 so the first thing we need to do is
make<00:00:32.650> sure<00:00:32.680> that<00:00:32.949> we<00:00:33.040> have<00:00:33.220> our<00:00:33.400> USB<00:00:33.850> cable

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
connected right there which we do is

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.640 
connected right there which we do is
connect<00:00:39.430> it<00:00:39.519> up<00:00:39.580> to<00:00:39.760> my<00:00:40.120> pc<00:00:41.110> which<00:00:41.290> is<00:00:41.409> running

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
beginning here go through and sometimes

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.530 
beginning here go through and sometimes

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
this happens when the name of an

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.990 
this happens when the name of an
application<00:03:41.170> turns<00:03:42.130> out<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.430> be<00:03:42.460> different

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
application turns out to be different

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.750 
application turns out to be different
then<00:03:43.990> what<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:46.450> what<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:46.990> downloaded<00:03:47.500> it<00:03:47.620> as

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.470
