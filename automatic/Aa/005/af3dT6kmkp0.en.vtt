00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:11.700
 so hello to everyone in this video I will tell 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.530
 How to quickly get a stone to quickly 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.119
 we need to get the stone first 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:22.949
 Turn wooden pickax do 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:26.789
 wooden pickaxe and start quickly 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.800
 dig under you and you immediately stumble 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.070
 on the block of stone we drip 2 blocks below i 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.270
 then explain why it was on 2 and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.820
 we dig around a square like this 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.430
 To start the game we have enough of this 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.530
 square well if you need 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.379
 more stone for example for production 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.949
 the ovens, respectively, can get 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 Immediately more some especially vines 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.770
 Ulyans and minkravt fans mined 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.629
 the stone will not break wooden 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:07.320
 pickaxe in this case we will get about 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:12.720
 30 blocks of stone I think to start the game 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 we naturally have enough first steps 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.000
 minecraft not banal those who have already played 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.830
 minecraft don't know how to do it but 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.619
 Newcomers to this video will be very 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:28.770
 it is useful to remember how I very much at one time 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.540
 It was very difficult for me to start playing 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.110
 minecraft since I didnâ€™t know what 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.729
 do and decided to make a similar video 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:44.220
 to ease another beginning since 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.950
 we see we mined cobble 31 blog or 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.290
 in a different way a stone is from it we 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.990
 start making tools for more 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.140
 productive work in the future for 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.420
 more productive further work 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.560
