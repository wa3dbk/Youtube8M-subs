00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
as it appears in real life now that's

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.510 
as it appears in real life now that's
once<00:01:41.880> I've<00:01:42.090> done<00:01:42.329> really<00:01:43.020> easy<00:01:43.259> I've<00:01:44.250> got<00:01:44.430> to

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.510 
close to the nose otherwise you'll look
a<00:02:00.400> bit<00:02:00.580> clownish<00:02:01.150> so<00:02:02.140> start<00:02:02.560> about<00:02:02.770> here<00:02:02.830> like

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
a bit clownish so start about here like

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.630 
a bit clownish so start about here like
an<00:02:03.640> inch<00:02:03.820> away<00:02:04.000> from<00:02:04.320> sides<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:05.470> your<00:02:05.530> nose<00:02:05.710> and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
an inch away from sides of your nose and

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.560 
an inch away from sides of your nose and
work<00:02:06.850> your<00:02:07.030> way<00:02:07.090> up<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:08.880> that's<00:02:09.880> basically<00:02:10.210> it

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
work your way up and that's basically it

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.130 
work your way up and that's basically it
I<00:02:12.180> guess<00:02:13.180> what<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.420> have<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.630> watch<00:02:13.840> out<00:02:14.080> for

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
I guess what you have to watch out for

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.750 
I guess what you have to watch out for
with<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.590> blush<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.220> your<00:02:15.340> hands<00:02:15.700> are

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
with this blush is that your hands are

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.400 
with this blush is that your hands are
completely<00:02:16.090> clean<00:02:16.600> before<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.050> start

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
completely clean before you start

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.440 
completely clean before you start
applying<00:02:17.710> otherwise<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:19.060> will<00:02:19.120> end<00:02:19.270> up

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
applying otherwise you will end up

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.480 
applying otherwise you will end up
getting<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.440> cream<00:02:20.710> blush<00:02:20.980> dirty<00:02:21.310> in

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
getting like the cream blush dirty in

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.300 
getting like the cream blush dirty in
the<00:02:21.640> pen<00:02:21.880> so<00:02:22.750> there<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:22.990> go<00:02:23.080> another<00:02:23.470> look<00:02:23.980> at

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
the pen so there you go another look at

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.050 
the pen so there you go another look at
the<00:02:24.910> color<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.480> pan<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
the color in the pan and that is the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.380 
the color in the pan and that is the
color<00:02:28.209> on<00:02:28.450> my<00:02:28.570> cheeks

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.600 

so<00:02:32.960> as<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.319> can<00:02:33.440> see<00:02:33.650> it's<00:02:33.890> really<00:02:34.160> really

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
so as you can see it's really really

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.440 
so as you can see it's really really
subtle<00:02:35.020> blush<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.850> there<00:02:37.850> are<00:02:37.970> no<00:02:38.120> harsh

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
subtle blush and there are no harsh

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.720 
subtle blush and there are no harsh
lines<00:02:38.560> whatsoever<00:02:40.630> blends<00:02:41.630> like<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.900> dream<00:02:42.350> and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
lines whatsoever blends like a dream and

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.040 
lines whatsoever blends like a dream and
it's<00:02:43.730> just<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.970> really<00:02:44.180> neutral<00:02:44.420> pink<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:45.020> I

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
it's just a really neutral pink that I

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.440 
it's just a really neutral pink that I
think<00:02:45.290> would<00:02:45.380> be<00:02:45.530> flattering<00:02:45.980> on<00:02:46.270> light<00:02:47.270> to

think would be flattering on light to

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.970 
think would be flattering on light to
medium<00:02:47.569> skin<00:02:48.050> tones<00:02:48.290> because<00:02:48.560> if<00:02:48.830> you're

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
medium skin tones because if you're

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.190 
medium skin tones because if you're
darker<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:49.760> just<00:02:50.240> might<00:02:50.390> not<00:02:50.420> show<00:02:50.780> up<00:02:50.810> on<00:02:51.050> you

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
fifty pounds I believe they're about

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.039 
fifty pounds I believe they're about
twenty-five<00:03:52.519> dollars<00:03:52.910> in<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.390> US<00:03:53.720> and

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
twenty-five dollars in the US and

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.710 
twenty-five dollars in the US and
they're<00:03:54.890> totally<00:03:55.340> worth<00:03:55.549> it<00:03:55.790> i<00:03:55.850> think<00:03:56.030> it

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720
