shed here's the tubing coming into the
shed<00:00:58.949> runs<00:00:59.730> up<00:01:00.530> out<00:01:01.530> through<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.399> we'll

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
shed runs up out through here and we'll

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.160 
shed runs up out through here and we'll
run<00:01:02.730> along<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.149> edge<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.640> way

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
run along the edge here and out this way

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.210 
run along the edge here and out this way
okay<00:01:07.170> I've<00:01:07.290> got<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> tubing<00:01:07.860> installed

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
okay I've got the tubing installed

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520 
okay I've got the tubing installed
running<00:01:08.490> along<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.670> back<00:01:08.909> wall<00:01:08.939> there<00:01:09.530> comes

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
running along the back wall there comes

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.130 
running along the back wall there comes
up<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> reason<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> coming

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
up here and the reason I have it coming

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.990 
up here and the reason I have it coming
up<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.830> can<00:01:14.100> control<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.790> flow

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
up here is so I can control the flow

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.910 
up here is so I can control the flow
with<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.270> valve<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> gate<00:01:16.470> valve<00:01:16.740> I

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
with this valve it's a gate valve I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.480 
with this valve it's a gate valve I
picked<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.280> from<00:01:17.430> mcmaster<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.090> $25<00:01:18.840> and

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
picked it up from mcmaster was $25 and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.770 
picked it up from mcmaster was $25 and
yesterday<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> bored<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.600> could

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
yesterday I bored it out so I could

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
yesterday I bored it out so I could
attach<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.290> motor<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.009> control<00:01:23.460> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
attach a motor to it and control it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.030 
attach a motor to it and control it
electronically<00:01:24.290> didn't<00:01:25.290> work<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.830> well<00:01:25.860> I

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
electronically didn't work out so well I

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
electronically didn't work out so well I
had<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.450> brush<00:01:27.450> motor<00:01:27.689> hooked<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> an<00:01:28.200> amplifier

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
had a brush motor hooked to an amplifier

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.230 
had a brush motor hooked to an amplifier
and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.430> trying<00:01:29.520> different<00:01:29.850> ways<00:01:30.090> of

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and I was trying different ways of

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.560 
and I was trying different ways of
controlling<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.380> without<00:01:32.090> encoder<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.360> it

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
controlling it but without encoder on it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.560 
controlling it but without encoder on it
to<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.110> servo<00:01:34.500> or<00:01:34.950> using<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.520> stepper<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
to make it a servo or using a stepper I

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.940 
to make it a servo or using a stepper I
didn't<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.320> whole<00:01:37.470> lot<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.619> control

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
didn't have a whole lot of control

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.789 
didn't have a whole lot of control
because<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:39.000> valve<00:01:39.210> has<00:01:39.420> diction<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.439> had

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
because the valve has diction so I had

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.560 
because the valve has diction so I had
to<00:01:40.829> turn<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.159> current<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.939> overcome<00:01:42.180> this

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
to turn the current up to overcome this

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
to turn the current up to overcome this
diction<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.140> then<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> valve<00:01:43.920> would<00:01:44.100> just

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
diction and then the valve would just

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.569 
diction and then the valve would just
move<00:01:45.000> way<00:01:45.270> too<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:47.280> prove<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
move way too much so to prove the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.550 
move way too much so to prove the
concept<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.119> actually<00:01:48.509> works<00:01:48.750> I'm<00:01:49.409> just

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
concept that actually works I'm just

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.719 
concept that actually works I'm just
going<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> up<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.369> manually

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
going to have it up here and manually

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.499 
going to have it up here and manually
control<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.270> later<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.930> if<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.649> all<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.159> works

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
control it later on if it all this works

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.460 
control it later on if it all this works
I'm<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> buy<00:01:54.869> some<00:01:55.079> smarter

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
I'm going to buy some smarter

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709 
I'm going to buy some smarter
electronics<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.280> I'll<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.270> computer

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
electronics and I'll have the computer

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.480 
electronics and I'll have the computer
actually<00:01:58.049> control<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.649> load<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.310> motor

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
actually control the load of the motor

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.330 
actually control the load of the motor
so<00:02:00.060> I'll<00:02:00.180> be<00:02:00.270> able<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> set<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.259> ramp<00:02:01.469> rate<00:02:01.740> or

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
so I'll be able to set the ramp rate or

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.190 
so I'll be able to set the ramp rate or
just<00:02:02.700> have<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> motor<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.329> sit<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> specific

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
just have the motor to sit a specific

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.300 
just have the motor to sit a specific
rpm<00:02:05.780> ok<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:07.049> everything<00:02:07.290> mocked<00:02:07.649> up<00:02:07.860> now<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
rpm ok I have everything mocked up now I

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339 
rpm ok I have everything mocked up now I
have<00:02:08.729> water<00:02:08.940> coming<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.720> from<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.140> load

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
have water coming to and from the load

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.290 
have water coming to and from the load
control<00:02:10.800> valve<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.580> going<00:02:11.849> back<00:02:12.000> into<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
control valve and going back into the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.540 
control valve and going back into the
cell

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
cell

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.920 
cell
comes<00:02:14.550> back<00:02:14.730> into<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.060> short<00:02:15.450> pipe<00:02:15.660> right

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
comes back into the short pipe right

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.420 
comes back into the short pipe right
here<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:18.440> need<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.500> cut<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.800> off<00:02:19.920> here<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.340> I'm

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
here I need to cut it off here and I'm

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.860 
here I need to cut it off here and I'm
going<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.610> cap<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.270> water<00:02:21.480> comes<00:02:21.780> through

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
going to cap it so water comes through

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.520 
going to cap it so water comes through
this<00:02:22.200> way<00:02:22.580> here<00:02:23.690> goes<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.990> valve<00:02:25.200> and

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
this way here goes to the valve and

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.230 
this way here goes to the valve and
comes<00:02:25.830> back<00:02:26.040> down<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.400> here<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:27.000> will<00:02:27.180> be

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
comes back down to here this will be

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.730 
comes back down to here this will be
capped<00:02:27.450> off<00:02:27.660> I'm<00:02:27.900> going<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.110> drill<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.410> tap<00:02:28.440> it

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
capped off I'm going to drill and tap it

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.280 
capped off I'm going to drill and tap it
for<00:02:29.640> some<00:02:29.790> npt<00:02:30.270> hose<00:02:30.510> barbs<00:02:30.960> that<00:02:31.110> I'm<00:02:31.200> going

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
for some npt hose barbs that I'm going

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.100 
for some npt hose barbs that I'm going
to<00:02:31.350> install<00:02:31.650> those<00:02:32.490> hose<00:02:32.730> barbs<00:02:33.090> left<00:02:33.930> hose

to install those hose barbs left hose

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.360 
to install those hose barbs left hose
hook<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.530> them<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.770> they'll<00:02:34.860> run<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
hook to them and they'll run to the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.620 
hook to them and they'll run to the
inlets<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.390> either<00:02:37.110> side<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:39.120> water<00:02:39.300> break

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
inlets on either side of the water break

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.080 
inlets on either side of the water break
I<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:40.500> 12<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.310> total<00:02:41.340> right<00:02:41.670> now<00:02:41.910> I'm<00:02:42.000> using

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
I have 12 in total right now I'm using

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.600 
I have 12 in total right now I'm using
four<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.630> them<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.860> water<00:02:44.010> goes<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.400> there

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
four of them so water goes in there

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.630 
four of them so water goes in there
water<00:02:44.940> comes<00:02:45.150> out<00:02:45.380> my<00:02:46.380> rotor<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.950> Siamese<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.610> I

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
water comes out my rotor is Siamese so I

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.520 
water comes out my rotor is Siamese so I
have<00:02:47.760> basically<00:02:48.090> two<00:02:48.360> water<00:02:48.870> breaks<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.350> one

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
have basically two water breaks in one

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.850 
have basically two water breaks in one
housing<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.640> have<00:02:51.060> two<00:02:51.630> chambers<00:02:52.080> so

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
housing so I have two chambers so

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.710 
housing so I have two chambers so
there's<00:02:53.130> water<00:02:53.400> coming<00:02:53.730> out<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.180> this<00:02:54.480> side

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
there's water coming out of this side

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.080 
there's water coming out of this side
order<00:02:55.620> coming<00:02:55.770> out<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.040> side<00:02:56.280> same<00:02:56.910> thing

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
order coming out of this side same thing

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.850 
order coming out of this side same thing
on<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.270> bottom<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:58.170> right<00:02:58.320> now<00:02:58.350> let's<00:02:58.650> plum

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
on the bottom so right now let's plum

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.320 
on the bottom so right now let's plum
with<00:02:59.010> four<00:02:59.250> inlets<00:02:59.520> and<00:02:59.640> four<00:02:59.880> outlets<00:03:00.000> of

with four inlets and four outlets of
half-inch<00:03:00.690> ID<00:03:00.900> hose<00:03:01.700> we'll<00:03:02.700> see<00:03:02.940> if<00:03:03.030> that's

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
half-inch ID hose we'll see if that's

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.420 
half-inch ID hose we'll see if that's
enough<00:03:03.680> here<00:03:04.680> are<00:03:04.770> all<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.950> fittings<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:05.400> the

they're all plugged and I have the
orange<00:03:43.950> show<00:03:44.099> is<00:03:44.220> running<00:03:44.519> out<00:03:44.579> here<00:03:44.879> just<00:03:45.780> to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
orange show is running out here just to

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.830 
orange show is running out here just to
see<00:03:45.959> if<00:03:46.409> my<00:03:47.040> valve<00:03:47.280> works<00:03:47.609> which<00:03:47.909> it<00:03:48.060> does<00:03:48.239> at

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
see if my valve works which it does at

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.349 
see if my valve works which it does at
idle<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.739> pump<00:03:49.980> with<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.700> pump<00:03:50.879> at<00:03:50.970> idle<00:03:51.239> I'm

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
idle the pump with the pump at idle I'm

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.819 
idle the pump with the pump at idle I'm
basically<00:03:51.720> getting<00:03:51.989> what<00:03:52.170> you'd<00:03:52.319> expect<00:03:52.439> out

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
basically getting what you'd expect out

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.339 
basically getting what you'd expect out
of<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:52.980> water<00:03:53.159> hose<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.700> ran<00:03:54.569> into<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.780> snag<00:03:54.840> back

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
of the water hose I ran into a snag back

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.380 
of the water hose I ran into a snag back
here<00:03:55.560> as<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.920> can<00:03:55.950> see<00:03:56.099> everything<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:56.879> wet<00:03:57.120> I

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
here as you can see everything is wet I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.080 
here as you can see everything is wet I
tried<00:03:58.349> turning<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.769> RPM<00:03:59.400> up<00:03:59.579> on<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.790> pump<00:04:00.000> a

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
tried turning the RPM up on the pump a

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.050 
tried turning the RPM up on the pump a
little<00:04:00.180> bit<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.599> this<00:04:01.849> connection<00:04:02.849> here

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
little bit and this connection here

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.479 
little bit and this connection here
which<00:04:03.209> is<00:04:03.329> a<00:04:03.359> low<00:04:03.569> pressure<00:04:03.840> coupling<00:04:04.590> came

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
which is a low pressure coupling came

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.030 
which is a low pressure coupling came
off<00:04:05.670> slid<00:04:06.180> off<00:04:06.299> of<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.510> PVC<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.139> I<00:04:07.680> had<00:04:07.859> water

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
off slid off of the PVC and I had water

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.069 
off slid off of the PVC and I had water
going<00:04:08.159> everywhere<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.970> basically<00:04:09.720> had<00:04:09.959> to

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
going everywhere and basically had to

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.949 
going everywhere and basically had to
climb<00:04:10.530> into<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:11.250> stream<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.239> water<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.750> shut

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
climb into the stream of water to shut

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.869 
climb into the stream of water to shut
the<00:04:13.079> pump<00:04:13.260> off<00:04:13.379> because<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.709> switches<00:04:14.129> back

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
the pump off because the switches back

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.000 
the pump off because the switches back
in<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.180> back<00:04:15.359> here<00:04:15.689> what<00:04:16.530> i<00:04:16.560> think<00:04:16.799> i'm<00:04:16.889> going

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
in the back here what i think i'm going

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.099 
in the back here what i think i'm going
to<00:04:17.070> try<00:04:17.190> doing<00:04:17.459> is<00:04:17.729> I'm<00:04:18.660> going<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:18.870> take<00:04:18.959> a

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
to try doing is I'm going to take a

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.990 
to try doing is I'm going to take a
coupling<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.650> cut<00:04:19.859> it<00:04:19.979> a<00:04:20.070> cut<00:04:20.489> part<00:04:20.699> of<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:20.880> off

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
coupling and cut it a cut part of it off

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.810 
coupling and cut it a cut part of it off
and<00:04:21.620> cement<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.830> onto<00:04:23.099> the<00:04:23.130> end<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.550> tube

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
and cement it onto the end of this tube

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.029 
and cement it onto the end of this tube
so<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:24.539> the<00:04:24.870> coupling<00:04:25.229> can't<00:04:25.440> slide<00:04:25.680> over

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
so that the coupling can't slide over

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.050 
so that the coupling can't slide over
and<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:27.810> saw<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.380> enough<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.919> coupling<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.400> see

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
and I saw the enough of coupling and see

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.060 
and I saw the enough of coupling and see
minuted<00:04:30.389> onto<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.660> tube<00:04:30.840> there<00:04:31.110> hopefully

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
minuted onto the tube there hopefully

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.320 
minuted onto the tube there hopefully
that'll<00:04:32.220> keep<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.520> adapter<00:04:32.880> from<00:04:32.970> sliding

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
that'll keep that adapter from sliding

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.920 
that'll keep that adapter from sliding
off<00:04:33.599> the<00:04:34.070> next<00:04:35.070> video<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.370> should<00:04:35.610> be<00:04:36.000> getting

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
off the next video I should be getting

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.159 
off the next video I should be getting
the<00:04:36.990> radiator<00:04:37.320> setup<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:37.979> until<00:04:38.940> then<00:04:39.169> thanks

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
the radiator setup and until then thanks

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.320 
the radiator setup and until then thanks
for<00:04:40.199> watching
