00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.800 
direct program now is the best way to
infuse<00:03:40.709> economic<00:03:41.430> growth<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.910> create<00:03:42.630> jobs

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
infuse economic growth and create jobs

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.380 
infuse economic growth and create jobs
the<00:03:43.680> question<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.459> are<00:03:44.730> you<00:03:44.790> going<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.090> create

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
the question is are you going to create

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.539 
the question is are you going to create
jobs<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:46.350> are<00:03:46.500> just<00:03:46.769> going<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.010> add<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.459> the

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
jobs that are just going to add to the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.550 
jobs that are just going to add to the
deficit<00:03:48.030> or<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.570> jobs<00:03:48.900> you're<00:03:49.140> creating

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
deficit or of the jobs you're creating

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.390 
deficit or of the jobs you're creating
you<00:03:49.620> know<00:03:49.650> they're<00:03:49.829> going<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.010> be<00:03:50.070> doing<00:03:50.190> a

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
you know they're going to be doing a

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.210 
you know they're going to be doing a
task<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.970> can<00:03:51.269> draw<00:03:51.780> down<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.620> deficit<00:03:53.070> and

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
task that can draw down the deficit and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.770 
task that can draw down the deficit and
out<00:03:53.340> yours<00:03:53.579> let<00:03:53.730> me<00:03:53.790> give<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.000> an<00:03:54.060> example<00:03:54.150> if

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
out yours let me give you an example if

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.920 
out yours let me give you an example if
we<00:03:55.530> were<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:56.100> put<00:03:56.730> all<00:03:56.970> medical<00:03:57.480> records<00:03:57.810> on

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
we were to put all medical records on

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.350 
we were to put all medical records on
electronic<00:03:58.560> be<00:03:59.070> able<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.579> be<00:03:59.730> electronically

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
electronic be able to be electronically

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.449 
electronic be able to be electronically
transferred<00:04:00.959> we<00:04:01.170> could<00:04:01.320> save<00:04:01.560> they<00:04:02.100> estimate

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
transferred we could save they estimate

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.520 
transferred we could save they estimate
i<00:04:02.519> think<00:04:02.760> it's<00:04:02.850> 78<00:04:03.329> billion<00:04:03.930> dollars<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.290> year

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
i think it's 78 billion dollars a year

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.490 
i think it's 78 billion dollars a year
but<00:04:04.829> it<00:04:04.950> costs<00:04:05.340> money<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.940> put<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.110> entire

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
but it costs money to put the entire

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.140 
but it costs money to put the entire
medical<00:04:08.040> industry<00:04:08.459> in<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.670> position<00:04:08.970> where

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
medical industry in a position where

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.960 
medical industry in a position where
they<00:04:09.480> can<00:04:09.709> put<00:04:10.709> all<00:04:10.920> those<00:04:11.220> records<00:04:11.760> on

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
they can put all those records on

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.150 
they can put all those records on
electronic<00:04:12.690> basis<00:04:13.140> so<00:04:13.739> we're<00:04:13.950> going<00:04:14.070> to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
electronic basis so we're going to

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.699 
electronic basis so we're going to
invest<00:04:14.579> money<00:04:14.880> in<00:04:15.120> what<00:04:15.239> they<00:04:15.360> call<00:04:15.600> IT<00:04:15.870> the

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
invest money in what they call IT the

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.099 
invest money in what they call IT the
this<00:04:17.310> this<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:17.910> this<00:04:18.299> new<00:04:18.660> technology

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
this this this this new technology

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.039 
this this this this new technology
that's<00:04:19.650> going<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.609> create<00:04:20.760> jobs<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.780> are

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
that's going to create jobs that are

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.250 
that's going to create jobs that are
needed<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.640> trent<00:04:23.640> make<00:04:23.850> this<00:04:24.060> transition<00:04:24.539> the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
needed to trent make this transition the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.779 
needed to trent make this transition the
end<00:04:25.470> result<00:04:25.919> though<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.340> money<00:04:26.550> we're

end result though the money we're

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.730 
end result though the money we're
spending<00:04:26.970> we're<00:04:27.539> going<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.750> get<00:04:27.900> back<00:04:28.169> three

spending we're going to get back three
and<00:04:28.890> four<00:04:29.100> fold<00:04:29.400> but<00:04:30.090> in<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.270> short<00:04:30.419> run<00:04:30.570> at

and four fold but in the short run at

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.170 
and four fold but in the short run at
what<00:04:30.990> point<00:04:31.320> there<00:04:31.590> is<00:04:31.680> no<00:04:31.710> short<00:04:32.190> run<00:04:32.430> other
