00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:08.959
 sword 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.249
 this is my first I had refrains tutorial handling what is the program 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.489
 of the tri max for that reason he handled the try of max 9 conserves pactos 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.900
 this 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.429
 while we are going to catch to create 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.880
 percent my text econ 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.319
 I have enough to look like glass 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:29.919
 more than anything 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.060
 for that we are going to 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.230
 percent extra first tab 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.269
 to create 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.270
 in what would be 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.620
 let's use a plane 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.250
 first before anything else for 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.860
 having the base said document 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.300
 Look ramón your plane and we will give 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.420
 the size is not 200 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.460
 for 200 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.620
 it is more one of this form yet the then d 1 equal one equal 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.990
 by the way let's go to or not on this tool to be able to move it and 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.030
 we press right click 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.770
 we voted for a window in that window we're going to 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.120
 align it to 0 all the speakers at zero 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.930
 for whom the soprano 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.390
 percent tracking in mind 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.810
 in position 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.960
 the star was created in zeros 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.580
 lie now what we're going to do is' let's both create 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.320
 what would be our text 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.250
 for that we are going to extensive traders tools of 6 Higuita we select 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.530
 a text 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.190
 the electic tico about 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.240
 santa and the top 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.930
 we have it here 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.500
 as we can see her well written glass 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.900
 per hundred to be able to modify the text we select it 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.500
 and we load the second staging the parameters our 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.180
 text 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.180
 here we can modify and put what we believe 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.460
 we can modify what will be our font by eliminating it to the center 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.789
 the size of this letter 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.849
 i 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.679
 and here we can p karl other 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:18.269
 as the radial the rectangular of the different options 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:23.340
 in tibú on loins to give right click on tita selecting ours 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:25.869
 text on the tool to move 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.869
 and let's align it just like the back 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.039
 all to 0 for whom 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.119
 Salim and in Vienna 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.119
 more or less 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.579
 what we are going to do 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.419
 it's the smoky 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.549
 it was our percent 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:46.869
 tool 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:50.929
 right here on the second tab by selecting the text 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:54.039
 let's go to the list of invitations 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.099
 and we are going to look for unification 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.909
 yamada bebel 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.670
 this tool is what makes that mental state and thickness of our text 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:04.900
 to do it 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.869
 more in 3d 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:12.839
 we live in delineating what it would be to increase level 1 until we get the 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.239
 height that we said 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.239
 the torso put the data of ten 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.979
 we believe less 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:26.409
 and now it's that we have this we're going to 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.529
 create another text blind 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:33.249
 that we can duplicate the pear again a text 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.909
 comfortable because it could well written the word crystal we carry 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.469
 to select others the same with our tool to move jeans right click 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:45.070
 milan - the zero for what 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.309
 this to the same face position 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.729
 our other 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.549
 what we are going to do is 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.799
 kiki the second text we're going to 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.799
 to go up 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.650
 in the act spoke a lot going up we were that the right on the income to move 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.149
 i on the z axis the poll shows 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.869
 be able to upload 

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:17.499
 2-2 a little higher than the other to be able 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:19.199
 visualize it well 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.629
 same think ramos 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:25.349
 pink our second tab and let's insert loyal mental narra of 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.080
 but we are going to reduce 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.219
 the height um 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.539
 little more percent make minimum what we have 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.469
 this thick 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:39.219
 more less 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:41.909
 can do this morning 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.879
 how are we seeing it 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.879
 we were going to increase it 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.279
 not yet 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.279
 now stay in 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.259
 more or less 73 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.559
 we raise to 

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:04.509
 go down 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.809
 so you can find the other text 

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.389
 we can do is an unstoppable though 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.389
 I got the square 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.919
 more or less 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.599
 Buenos Aires 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.599
 it should be highlighted 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:27.960
 now what we're going to do is let's go to no will be 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.520
 with these materials 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.360
 17 mac and the materials but let's see how we create ourselves 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.159
 we go to our first material 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:42.279
 percent this first material is going to be what would be the text above 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.300
 but he managed to put tex tone 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:48.340
 this 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.330
 let's see a diffuse color of undefeated in blue 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:54.699
 this strong 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.839
 to highlight 

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.349
 Moscow - 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.349
 he answers us form 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:05.830
 percent we're going to walk lion speculates acknowledged by lying speculating that 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.070
 would be like 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.759
 a reflection of light 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.460
 with we can seeing in vila 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.460
 is far from forecast preview 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.990
 and we're going to give a few years equaling me encouraging that it's like blurring what 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.279
 it would be the reflection 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:23.650
 how to leave it in 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.029
 30 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:29.619
 and speculate in about 40 more, not this way 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.110
 that we enable the option this crisis you know percent 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.370
 I felt comfortable double reflected that we could have our 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.799
 in our document was much more when we do it transparently 

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.309
 pass it down 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:49.309
 well it's just we leave it like that we select them 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:52.460
 and we select the first text 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.180
 and with the tools takeshi am assign matter the selection 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.039
 we consign click 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.080
 select selected aztec be our 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.449
 percent be our text 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:09.729
 this 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.669
 now let's go to our second material that would be the rest text 2 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.270
 I know we're going to eat this 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.559
 transparent 

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:20.800
 all right 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.550
 we are going to act, what is the spectacular, we are going to give peace
