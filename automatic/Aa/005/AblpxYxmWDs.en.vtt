yeah so the tone on the super overdrive
is<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:06.830> bit<00:05:06.980> more<00:05:07.270> robust<00:05:08.270> this<00:05:08.870> one's<00:05:09.110> very

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
is a bit more robust this one's very

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:17.920 
is a bit more robust this one's very
much<00:05:09.830> more<00:05:10.010> subtle<00:05:10.810> my<00:05:11.810> opinion<00:05:16.600> so<00:05:17.600> there<00:05:17.810> you

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
much more subtle my opinion so there you

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.270 
much more subtle my opinion so there you
have<00:05:17.990> a<00:05:18.340> super<00:05:19.340> overdrive<00:05:19.580> sd1<00:05:20.300> versus<00:05:20.780> the

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
have a super overdrive sd1 versus the

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.510 
have a super overdrive sd1 versus the

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
personally I like the OD three better it

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.530
