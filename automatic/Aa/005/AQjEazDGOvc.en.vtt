00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.850 
so he does so that means that the
computer<00:02:08.759> brought<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.690> Benfica<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
computer brought out Benfica as the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.860 
computer brought out Benfica as the
Europa<00:02:11.250> League<00:02:11.280> winners<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.480> hope<00:02:12.660> that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
Europa League winners and I hope that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.900 
Europa League winners and I hope that
will<00:02:13.080> be<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.380> case<00:02:13.410> in<00:02:14.190> real<00:02:14.430> life<00:02:14.640> but

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
will be the case in real life but

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.090 
will be the case in real life but
hopefully<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.810> will<00:02:15.990> be<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> cracking<00:02:16.710> final

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
hopefully it will be a cracking final

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.850 
hopefully it will be a cracking final
with<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> lot<00:02:17.460> of<00:02:17.610> goals
