00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.430 
reason why we use pumpkin it's because
it<00:01:58.440> softens<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.220> skin<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.910> helps<00:02:00.270> reduce<00:02:01.080> fine

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
it softens the skin it helps reduce fine

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.800 
it softens the skin it helps reduce fine
lines<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:02.040> wrinkles<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.580> also<00:02:02.940> resurfaces

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
lines and wrinkles and also resurfaces

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.910 
lines and wrinkles and also resurfaces
the<00:02:04.020> skin<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.890> pumpkin<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> really<00:02:05.880> great

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
the skin so pumpkin is a really great

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.560 
the skin so pumpkin is a really great
vitamin<00:02:07.920> rich<00:02:08.149> ingredient<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.390> can<00:02:09.540> use

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
vitamin rich ingredient that we can use

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.020 
vitamin rich ingredient that we can use
in<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.110> type<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.410> mask<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:11.640> I'm<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.910> going

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
in this type of mask so I'm just going

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.490 
in this type of mask so I'm just going
to<00:02:12.090> put<00:02:12.240> this<00:02:12.480> whole<00:02:12.720> thing<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.320> bowl

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.060 

now<00:02:18.280> we're<00:02:18.490> going<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.640> add<00:02:18.700> 4<00:02:19.590> tablespoons<00:02:20.590> of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
and now we're going to need four

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.920 
and now we're going to need four
tablespoons<00:02:29.799> of<00:02:29.980> honey<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:33.670> if<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.659> honey's

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
tablespoons of honey and if the honey's

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.780 
tablespoons of honey and if the honey's
to<00:02:35.319> step<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.040> put<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.670> microwave

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
to step you can put it in the microwave

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.449 
to step you can put it in the microwave
for<00:02:37.180> like<00:02:37.540> 10<00:02:37.840> seconds<00:02:38.319> that<00:02:38.950> kind<00:02:39.159> of<00:02:39.189> helps

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
for like 10 seconds that kind of helps

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.130 
for like 10 seconds that kind of helps
move<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.849> along<00:02:39.939> the<00:02:40.450> reason<00:02:40.720> why<00:02:40.810> we<00:02:41.019> use

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
move it along the reason why we use

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.839 
move it along the reason why we use
honey<00:02:41.319> it's<00:02:41.500> because<00:02:41.829> it's<00:02:42.220> also<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.459> binding

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
honey it's because it's also a binding

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.869 
honey it's because it's also a binding
agent<00:02:42.970> then<00:02:43.299> also<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.750> as<00:02:44.140> moisturizer<00:02:44.879> we're

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
agent then also to as moisturizer we're

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.869 
agent then also to as moisturizer we're
going<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.030> do<00:02:46.239> 1<00:02:46.690> tablespoon<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.879> pumpkin
