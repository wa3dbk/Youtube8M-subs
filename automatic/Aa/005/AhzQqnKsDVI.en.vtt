00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
pull out a calculator here I think you

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.209 
pull out a calculator here I think you
can<00:00:50.879> actually<00:00:51.210> access<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.170> iOS<00:00:52.680> now<00:00:52.920> there

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
can actually access one on iOS now there

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:00.369 
can actually access one on iOS now there
we<00:00:53.399> go<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.660> I'll<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:57.020> 76.5<00:00:58.020> plus
