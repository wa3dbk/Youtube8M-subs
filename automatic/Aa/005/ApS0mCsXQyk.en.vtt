00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.429
 2015 is a bit for Mercedes-Benz 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.200
 years of the suv that is how we learned yesterday 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.059
 during a press conference 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.830
 there will actually be a new line-up 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.199
 all names are changed a bit 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.830
 so everything is then starts with a g 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.510
 you know the g-class we have the glk know 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.080
 him all that becomes glc 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.340
 so this is new to the gl one 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.900
 maybe you will say he is not yet 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.360
 completely new he looks like the ml de 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.160
 that's right in fact in upgraded ml 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.110
 the engine programs are adjusted 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000
 made some changes at the latest and 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.210
 for the netherlands this is a whole 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.690
 major version the plug-in hybrid 14% 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.420
 addition so the gl500 one performs 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.190
 actually almost flush with the GL500 with 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.219
 she v8 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.489
 only this press than 400 42 hp system 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.590
 power from a gasoline engine v6 and a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.149
 electric motor and it results in 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.149
 nice consumption figures 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.150
 this 501 with its plug-in hybrid 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.430
 powertrain and joy then difficult 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.030
 recommend that you do not have the performance 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.970
 lack the with a system capability of 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.280
 442 hp you just go from 0 to 100 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.490
 just as fast as one 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.860
 500 with the v8 engine with a much lower 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.630
 Consumption you can from different 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.040
 choose power 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.300
 including a sporty position but move 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.940
 you can sport it at the stand then you can 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.950
 at the same time no more electric driving 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.600
 so if you opt for electric 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.420
 You can also drive with it differently 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.910
 choose hybrid mode from the fully electric 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.070
 to charge while driving that costs 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.800
 u the extra fuel 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.440
 best is you can put his car then 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.590
 Electronics controls everything and then you drive 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.690
 as optimally as possible to the electrical 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.910
 do not reach so very large me get 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.310
 the 25 kilometers this morning and then 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.110
 is it fun after all? 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.119
 that is, the assistance remains 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.140
 Ã¼ber eine stays with it when loading 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.640
 brake 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.300
 but fully electric driving is there 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.300
 then no longer 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.810
 as said you also have one 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.730
 have comfortable mode now as in 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.360
 then it is just wonderfully soft 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.010
 maybe a bit too soft 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.780
 for some but it's just one 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.850
 very nice trip car that way 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.980
 you choose the sport mode is it 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.500
 immediately sent some punishments 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.180
 1420 a bit harder still not 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.680
 plan map of remains a mercedes benz 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.940
 it is a ml 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.130
 see should also just nice to be able to 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.600
 yeah drive and sport mode is simply 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.760
 some nicer mills less 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.610
 economically because then he no longer 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.080
 fully electric but everywhere 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.299
 you can say yes by choosing 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.790
 this 501 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.320
 actually clean in terms of driving 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.880
 nowhere 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.350
 there are some more motorization there is too 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.080
 a four-cylinder diesel that was 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.670
 of course also less ml 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.050
 basic model is even just one 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.790
 four-cylinder diesel with only 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.220
 rear-wheel drive 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.930
 as that term applies to the Glenn g of the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.610
 not entirely because you can 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.630
 of course the terrain in me in but 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.670
 all other versions just have 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.790
 four-wheel drive and with the diesel 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.890
 even spear the option for one 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.450
 so choose to block the middle lock 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.410
 then you can really do serious off-road driving 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.410
 if you want that 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.480
 and the most interesting version piece 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.940
 this ipad with about 14 percent addition 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.290
 so not too cheap sint range but 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.360
 price-wise just ran the most 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.830
 interesting car all the way for the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.050
 business drive and there he goes anyway 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.850
 because it still has 14 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.680
 percent addition and with that scissors 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.350
 joined a different number of others 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.360
 plug-in hybrid SUVs currently available 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.550
 are very much wanted in us of course 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.900
 a huge help because of the 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.900
 tax rules that are about to change 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.470
 what are you completely into when you are in 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.360
 instead of the g500 this 500th buys as 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.760
 you eat this you d wait outside then see 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.520
 people the difference almost not one 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.470
 price difference piece enormously the ordinary g500 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.350
 costs more than 120,000 euros and this 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.940
 plug-in hybrid brush 79 half plus then 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.170
 that much lower addition 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.170
 where you do supply a little pin 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.830
 is on the trunk 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.139
 because it is just a little small 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.699
 because that fleury you just a lot higher 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.590
 lies then stand on the one good for the 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.009
 rest and drive and send just as well 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.009
 those others
