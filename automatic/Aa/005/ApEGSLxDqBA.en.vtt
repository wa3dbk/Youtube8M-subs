and<00:03:10.230> sweet<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.950> make<00:03:11.100> sure<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.549> these<00:03:11.730> foods

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
and sweet to make sure that these foods

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.090 
and sweet to make sure that these foods
get<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.420> right<00:03:12.660> signal<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.350> brain<00:03:13.500> three

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
get the right signal to the brain three

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.920 
get the right signal to the brain three
major<00:03:14.310> nerves<00:03:14.670> are<00:03:15.000> used<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.329> send<00:03:15.569> taste

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
major nerves are used to send taste

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.490

sensation<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.069> brain<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.810> now<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.049> know

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
sensation to the brain so now you know

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.340 
sensation to the brain so now you know
more<00:03:19.889> about<00:03:20.040> your<00:03:20.220> taste<00:03:20.790> buds<00:03:21.120> yeah<00:03:21.450> not

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
more about your taste buds yeah not

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.129 
more about your taste buds yeah not
tasting<00:03:22.950> broccoli<00:03:23.519> is<00:03:23.790> my<00:03:24.120> science<00:03:27.139> there's

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
tasting broccoli is my science there's

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.950 
tasting broccoli is my science there's
no<00:03:28.470> cool<00:03:29.209> and<00:03:30.209> I'm<00:03:30.329> not<00:03:30.660> lying<00:03:31.019> broccoli
