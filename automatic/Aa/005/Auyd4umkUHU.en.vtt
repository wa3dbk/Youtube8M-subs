00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
my plan was to slip these back tree and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.080 
my plan was to slip these back tree and
light<00:02:22.320> horse<00:02:22.590> through<00:02:22.920> each<00:02:23.070> flank<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.970> to

get<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.330> skirmishers<00:02:24.870> there<00:02:25.440> was<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> perfect

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
get to skirmishers there was a perfect

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.980 
get to skirmishers there was a perfect
hole<00:02:26.250> right<00:02:26.520> here<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:27.030> didn't<00:02:27.570> use<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.870> though

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
hole right here I didn't use it though

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.840 
hole right here I didn't use it though
my<00:02:28.230> opponent<00:02:28.590> comes<00:02:28.709> chasing<00:02:29.190> my<00:02:29.280> cavalry<00:02:29.610> off

on this flank so he kind of gets a nice
deal<00:02:32.190> over<00:02:32.459> here<00:02:32.640> because<00:02:32.880> he<00:02:32.970> distracts<00:02:33.480> all

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
fight for a long time while my infantry

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.080 
fight for a long time while my infantry
did<00:05:19.889> win<00:05:20.010> immediate<00:05:20.280> he<00:05:20.370> really<00:05:20.610> needed<00:05:20.789> rear

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
did win immediate he really needed rear

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.510

charges<00:05:21.539> from<00:05:21.990> his<00:05:22.139> men<00:05:22.320> I<00:05:22.530> think<00:05:23.130> he<00:05:23.220> planned

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
charges from his men I think he planned

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.969 
charges from his men I think he planned
well<00:05:23.820> in<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.510> sense<00:05:24.750> that<00:05:24.840> my<00:05:25.560> swordsman

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
well in the sense that my swordsman

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.330 
well in the sense that my swordsman
weren't<00:05:26.130> gonna<00:05:26.250> instantly<00:05:26.820> kill<00:05:27.060> his<00:05:28.340> his

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
weren't gonna instantly kill his his

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.760 
weren't gonna instantly kill his his
hoplites<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.330> he<00:05:30.720> had<00:05:30.840> a<00:05:30.870> lot<00:05:31.050> of<00:05:31.080> archers<00:05:31.500> to

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
hoplites and he had a lot of archers to

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.680 
hoplites and he had a lot of archers to
take<00:05:31.949> down<00:05:32.190> my<00:05:32.370> elephants<00:05:32.849> definitely<00:05:33.510> need

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
take down my elephants definitely need

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.300 
take down my elephants definitely need
to<00:05:33.780> be<00:05:33.870> ready<00:05:34.139> for<00:05:34.229> armored<00:05:34.680> elephants<00:05:35.130> with

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
to be ready for armored elephants with

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.189 
to be ready for armored elephants with
with<00:05:35.970> bacteria<00:05:36.389> coming<00:05:36.660> against<00:05:36.930> you<00:05:37.020> so<00:05:37.169> I

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
with bacteria coming against you so I

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.560 
with bacteria coming against you so I
think<00:05:37.320> that<00:05:37.560> was<00:05:37.680> good<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:38.090> the<00:05:39.090> slingers<00:05:39.419> I'm

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
think that was good to the slingers I'm

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.700 
think that was good to the slingers I'm
not<00:05:39.690> really<00:05:39.780> sure<00:05:39.960> what<00:05:40.169> the<00:05:40.260> purpose<00:05:40.590> of

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
not really sure what the purpose of

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.469 
not really sure what the purpose of
those<00:05:40.770> guys<00:05:40.979> was<00:05:41.190> maybe<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.849> try<00:05:42.060> and<00:05:42.180> fend<00:05:42.330> off

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
those guys was maybe to try and fend off

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.659 
those guys was maybe to try and fend off
horse<00:05:42.750> archers<00:05:43.110> which<00:05:43.260> I<00:05:43.380> did<00:05:43.590> have<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.160> they

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
horse archers which I did have and they

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.189 
horse archers which I did have and they
did<00:05:44.849> get<00:05:45.030> a<00:05:45.060> lot<00:05:45.270> of<00:05:45.449> kills<00:05:45.660> because<00:05:45.870> they<00:05:46.110> got

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
did get a lot of kills because they got

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.770 
did get a lot of kills because they got
a<00:05:46.260> little<00:05:46.349> of<00:05:46.560> skirmishers<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:48.240> then<00:05:48.570> you<00:05:48.660> can

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
a little of skirmishers and then you can

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.360 
a little of skirmishers and then you can
see<00:05:48.900> my<00:05:48.990> swordsman<00:05:49.410> did<00:05:49.530> pretty<00:05:49.680> well<00:05:49.770> too<00:05:50.130> so

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
see my swordsman did pretty well too so

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.909 
see my swordsman did pretty well too so
I<00:05:51.300> think<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.050> biggest<00:05:52.229> problem<00:05:52.409> here<00:05:52.680> from<00:05:52.830> my

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
I think the biggest problem here from my

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.140 
I think the biggest problem here from my
opponent<00:05:53.280> is<00:05:53.340> that<00:05:53.460> he<00:05:53.550> paid<00:05:53.699> a<00:05:53.729> lot<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.030> money

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
opponent is that he paid a lot of money

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.550 
opponent is that he paid a lot of money
for<00:05:54.510> that<00:05:54.570> camp<00:05:54.810> Pawnee<00:05:54.990> and<00:05:55.139> cat<00:05:55.260> it's<00:05:55.440> like

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
for that camp Pawnee and cat it's like

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.730 
for that camp Pawnee and cat it's like
almost<00:05:56.190> five<00:05:56.849> thousand<00:05:57.389> talents<00:05:57.750> and<00:05:58.139> then

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
almost five thousand talents and then

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.200 
almost five thousand talents and then
his<00:05:58.949> general<00:05:59.370> you<00:05:59.490> had<00:05:59.580> that<00:05:59.789> in<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.120> it's

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
his general you had that in and it's

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.670 
his general you had that in and it's
almost<00:06:00.449> six<00:06:00.659> thousand<00:06:01.050> talents<00:06:01.320> just<00:06:01.470> in<00:06:01.560> that

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
almost six thousand talents just in that

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.040 
almost six thousand talents just in that
one<00:06:01.830> group<00:06:02.099> the<00:06:02.820> general<00:06:03.180> did<00:06:03.479> manage<00:06:03.900> to<00:06:03.930> get

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
one group the general did manage to get

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.719 
one group the general did manage to get
a<00:06:04.139> fair<00:06:04.320> number<00:06:04.470> of<00:06:04.680> kills<00:06:04.889> versus<00:06:05.280> swordsmen

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
a fair number of kills versus swordsmen

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.159 
a fair number of kills versus swordsmen
but<00:06:05.909> eventually<00:06:06.150> you<00:06:06.389> know<00:06:06.510> he<00:06:06.659> got<00:06:06.810> knocked

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
but eventually you know he got knocked

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.730 
but eventually you know he got knocked
out<00:06:07.380> by<00:06:08.090> units<00:06:09.090> being<00:06:09.270> behind<00:06:09.659> him<00:06:09.840> I<00:06:10.020> think

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
out by units being behind him I think

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.370 
out by units being behind him I think
this<00:06:11.099> just<00:06:11.220> goes<00:06:11.430> to<00:06:11.610> show<00:06:12.380> bacteria

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
this just goes to show bacteria

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.110 
this just goes to show bacteria
definitely<00:06:13.919> has<00:06:14.070> a<00:06:14.099> tool<00:06:14.400> with<00:06:14.760> them<00:06:14.909> and<00:06:15.030> that

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
definitely has a tool with them and that

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.610 
definitely has a tool with them and that
is<00:06:15.240> good<00:06:15.389> cavalry<00:06:15.900> and<00:06:16.169> that<00:06:16.320> that's<00:06:16.530> gonna

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
is good cavalry and that that's gonna

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.959 
is good cavalry and that that's gonna
make<00:06:16.860> winning<00:06:17.250> against<00:06:17.520> bacteria<00:06:17.880> with

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:17.969 
make winning against bacteria with

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:20.870 
make winning against bacteria with
Syracuse<00:06:18.300> a<00:06:18.780> very<00:06:19.200> difficult<00:06:19.710> task

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
Syracuse a very difficult task

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.760 
Syracuse a very difficult task
if<00:06:21.060> you<00:06:21.210> bring<00:06:21.389> thorax<00:06:21.840> swordsmen<00:06:22.320> to<00:06:22.530> meet

the bactrian thorax swordsman
at<00:06:25.260> least<00:06:25.440> you'd<00:06:25.620> be<00:06:25.650> equal<00:06:26.220> and<00:06:26.460> that<00:06:26.670> mindset

played better here and picked a stronger

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.950 
played better here and picked a stronger
army<00:06:53.130> but<00:06:53.340> not<00:06:53.760> necessarily<00:06:54.270> indicative<00:06:54.540> of

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
army but not necessarily indicative of

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.840 
army but not necessarily indicative of
just<00:06:55.320> me<00:06:55.680> being<00:06:55.950> a<00:06:56.040> better<00:06:56.160> player<00:06:56.520> here

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
because bacteria really does have a lot

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.710 
because bacteria really does have a lot
more<00:06:58.470> tools<00:06:58.680> so<00:06:59.669> kudos<00:06:59.940> to<00:07:00.030> my<00:07:00.180> opponent<00:07:00.600> for

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
most of the time but like I said in

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.120 
most of the time but like I said in
these<00:07:04.140> battles<00:07:04.320> that<00:07:04.620> was<00:07:04.710> just<00:07:04.890> kind<00:07:05.040> of

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
these battles that was just kind of

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.940 
these battles that was just kind of
going<00:07:05.490> for<00:07:05.790> the<00:07:06.140> going<00:07:07.140> for<00:07:07.320> the<00:07:07.410> some<00:07:07.800> of<00:07:07.830> the

going for the going for the some of the

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.320 
going for the going for the some of the
powerful<00:07:08.190> units<00:07:08.610> just<00:07:08.700> trying<00:07:08.910> to<00:07:08.970> get<00:07:09.060> a<00:07:09.120> feel

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
powerful units just trying to get a feel

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.900 
powerful units just trying to get a feel
for<00:07:09.540> how<00:07:09.660> they<00:07:09.810> work<00:07:10.220> obviously<00:07:11.220> my<00:07:11.729> biggest

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 
for how they work obviously my biggest

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.550 
for how they work obviously my biggest
problem<00:07:12.300> is<00:07:12.390> execution<00:07:12.930> I<00:07:13.140> just<00:07:13.290> need<00:07:13.380> to<00:07:13.440> get

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
problem is execution I just need to get

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.430 
problem is execution I just need to get
better<00:07:13.710> at<00:07:14.160> the<00:07:14.310> way<00:07:14.400> that<00:07:14.550> I<00:07:14.720> the<00:07:15.720> armies<00:07:16.410> that

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 
better at the way that I the armies that

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.379 
better at the way that I the armies that
I<00:07:16.650> bring<00:07:16.890> and<00:07:17.280> it'll<00:07:17.970> make<00:07:18.090> me<00:07:18.210> a<00:07:18.240> better

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:18.389 
I bring and it'll make me a better

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:19.909 
I bring and it'll make me a better
player<00:07:18.690> in<00:07:18.900> the<00:07:18.990> end<00:07:19.110> so<00:07:19.290> that's<00:07:19.680> probably

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 
player in the end so that's probably

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:21.830 
player in the end so that's probably
something<00:07:20.250> I<00:07:20.280> should<00:07:20.310> push<00:07:20.610> myself<00:07:20.790> on<00:07:21.150> in<00:07:21.660> any

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 
something I should push myself on in any

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.180 
something I should push myself on in any
case<00:07:22.020> I<00:07:22.229> hope<00:07:22.410> you<00:07:22.500> all<00:07:22.560> enjoyed<00:07:22.830> it<00:07:22.860> Arif
