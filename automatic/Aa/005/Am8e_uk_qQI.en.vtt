00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.550
 quality 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.860
 no not really good, I'm wit 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.320
 watch a real morning muffle therefore 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.900
 I also something accordingly batty 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.279
 and one he must still somehow 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.500
 That's why I'm tormenting myself first 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.359
 a bit but then it starts 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.460
 in the day and the first thing I do 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.369
 is I reach for my first 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.529
 coconut oil from alnatura of it can feel me 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.510
 get a spoonful out and take that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.510
 just in the mouth and let it first 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.700
 melt and then it starts with the 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.440
 The goal is yes so all the time 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.670
 and between the toes and me 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.010
 still appreciate that 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.809
 really white teeth will give then 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.820
 I take my ipad and look once 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.219
 on instagram for if there is anything 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.899
 something new is nice to others 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.640
 or have a look 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.360
 you over and unfortunately a few 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.579
 Pictures that I really liked then 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.620
 it starts I get up and finally 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.559
 He hatches in my bush first 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.239
 Slippers I love you and her in the bathroom 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.189
 and the first thing I do is google 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.080
 a little more my coconut oil and 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.729
 jewelry is then out then I expect 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.680
 me directly the teeth with mine 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.350
 favorite toothpaste that's just the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.420
 module with three original and then goes 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.430
 get rid of the facial and for that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.320
 I know first with the rose water 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.000
 I have now had the relatively new 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.930
 I saw him with her so much 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.820
 was satisfied 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.950
 but it must be this very specific 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.170
 original rose water I link 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.799
 that once down so you do it once 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.799
 can watch 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.610
 then I 'll mention that 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.200
 thermal water and spray that once into 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.610
 face in that he speaks fresh 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.460
 not good and I think that's the way it is 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.470
 a good effect for a pure skin 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.000
 that has to move in first and me 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.130
 wait, I'll be a bit 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.039
 Then I continue with the bio 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.780
 dermapro called the test at the moment 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.729
 and wear it once in the whole face 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.100
 but of course the eye area 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.229
 once off and above all things on 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.520
 the nose and in the cheek area I wear 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.159
 that more on when it is fed 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.799
 then I take my two booster 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.239
 Whether that's the whole face on me 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.980
 so that the eye area is not 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:19.040
 Saving because I need of course 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.709
 also a lot of moisture where it goes 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.400
 with the clinic all about ice in richmond 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.470
 I always wear them everywhere and 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.480
 then for the face a bit 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.829
 So what about the clinic rescue solution? 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.329
 I think that I am here throughout 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.310
 face up but really just there 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.989
 where I have because the red spots so 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.519
 at the banks and at the nose and 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.680
 spread that out a bit 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.540
 and if that is fed then comes 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.850
 the last cream on the face is that 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.400
 namely currently a sunscreen and 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.750
 i use this at the moment every day because 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.630
 I always sit in the evening 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.739
 make chemical peeling and there it is 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.930
 then always very important that you 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.299
 really used sunscreen every day 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.190
 That's why I have that in synonymous 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.100
 face lubricated then I am finally 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.269
 finished with the face there now 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.609
 felt a thousand products in the face 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.019
 but it is unfortunately necessary at the moment 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.489
 the hair will go through again 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.560
 brushed and then I look for something 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.959
 what I want to wear today is nothing 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.340
 special therefore actually what whole 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.190
 namely, a jeans and is done 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.230
 a white pullover with flowers in front 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.210
 on that I think that's really pretty and 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.190
 then it goes off in my room 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.210
 in the morning when it has to go fast then 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.370
 I do not really taste that much 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.160
 I first take mainz often victims of 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.510
 mac and you once me too song 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.490
 on it with that a bit 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.140
 looks and looks even 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.270
 even the eyelashes are bent up and 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.000
 showered today I use this new one 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.980
 from l'oreal the butterflies intensa 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.980
 I'm testing mascara for the first time today 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.990
 for the skin to cover I take 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.680
 today no foundation but use 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.390
 only there my eyes determined and 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.160
 just give it to me all over 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.520
 bumps and blinds one 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.900
 with the beauty blender for the 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.730
 eyebrows I use just like that 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.400
 brother of artdeco that's this 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.410
 darkest color and this includes 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.580
 black a bit greedy and for 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.160
 I use the face again 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.750
 brother namely this - kind finish of 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.730
 Merck and we distribute that first 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.110
 as well as to compete because the powder 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.760
 actually a bit too dark for me 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.500
 and after that I distribute that but 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.510
 then again in the entire face so 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.950
 a bit to put concealer and 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.920
 Finally , to check 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.660

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.000
 as well as make-up now 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.980
 That's why I use the moment 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.720
 very hardworking and I wear them 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.170
 Just compete again 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.170

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.080
 finished with the make-up that's enough 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.510
 also for the everyday after that if I
