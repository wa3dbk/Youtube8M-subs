00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.099
 good afternoon winter has come and leaving for 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.200
 fishing in the kingdom of ice and snow want 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.650
 bring along something to keep warm 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.680
 but not too why the basement will be about 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.850
 such a very high- calorie product as 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.490
 pork fat 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.010
 salted pork fat can of course be bought 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.910
 salted bacon in the store but I'm not looking 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.269
 easy ways 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.949
 so i will salt it myself and unusual 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.560
 way when just a piece of bacon 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.750
 rubbed with salt and in a different way very 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.090
 tricky recipe that I last 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.950
 really like we take sliced 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.930
 lard 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.829
 suitable glass or enamelled 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.050
 water capacity the amount of water you need is 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.510
 so that our lard closes with us 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.270
 riding but for my volume somewhere 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.219
 about a liter 200 liters of salt 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.930
 no matter what the main thing is 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.719
 so that the salt was neiodated 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.149
 and such an interesting thing as raw 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.199
 potato 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:08.520
 cooking pickle put the potato 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:12.049
 into the container and begin to dissolve so until 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.189
 until our potatoes pop up 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:20.330
 steamy tablespoons right now we will 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.330
 add and stir 1 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.939
 I have now stirred a strong spoon 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.130
 tablespoon of salt and see our 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.729
 the potato is already floating on the surface 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.100
 so our pickle is ready 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.909
 potatoes need to pull out as we 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.950
 the tallest piece is probably this one 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:47.360
 pour the fat brine 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.360
 she now we have pieces will float 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.409
 look at the highest here we have it 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.700
 completely at the villain in at fuel 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:04.649
 position here and so with racial i 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:07.530
 almost guessed everything when we 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.390
 Solza salted but we in brine too 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.210
 fall covered fat 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.490
 cover or wrap and remove the top 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.709
 refrigerator compartment for three days 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.550
 potatoes not many thanks she 's gosh 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.620
 It does not need to have passed all three days 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.709
 time nassal was sweeping through the refrigerator 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.390
 can somewhere on the second day once 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.420
 turn it over so it is salted 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.750
 more evenly now we got him 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.040
 from the fridge and will continue 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.989
 modifying us for this 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.970
 need a mixture of peppers 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.610
 head of garlic and strictly speaking 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.050
 the capacity in which we will store our 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.630
 we take a couple of garlic cloves 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.940
 we crush the garlic press on our piece 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.390
 bacon 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:04.230
 now we rub our piece from all sides 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:08.170
 and at the end from all sides 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.190
 ground pepper managed to mix 5 peppers 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:18.989
 well, just black chop 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:23.980
 pepper and plate and just now here 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.920
 dip but this pepper and the remaining 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.200
 parties 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.450
 processed in such a way pieces 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.829
 unfolding suitable capacity 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.670
 preferably with enamelled lid too 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.070
 or glass 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.680
 and for a couple of days we remove the top 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.700
 refrigerator chamber after which the whole 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:47.260
 you need to eat you can freeze and 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.540
 store it further as not always 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.380
 I manage to buy a very tasty homemade 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.530
 lard lard happens and we must be wiry 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.290
 for when going fishing make it out 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.500
 pate now I will show what it is 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.739
 to better mince i 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.180
 our salad froze slightly 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:12.489
 found it cut better and 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:16.380
 scrolls better now cut into 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:19.299
 suitable pieces that will pass 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:26.979
 meat grinder but squares ice and 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:29.289
 And the little bars are irrelevantly possible 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.050
 do already with lard which was 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:36.370
 processed pepper me oud she was not 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.800
 processed so I right now its exactly the same 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.229
 pepper sprinkle in the amount of pepper 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.449
 depends only on personal preference and 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.539
 on how much this allows 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:49.000
 sprinkle everything hard pepper now 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.979
 mince somewhere in 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.979
 in the middle a couple more cloves of garlic 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.420
 mix and cranked lard with 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.920
 garlic until smooth and 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.660
 we shift the suitable glass 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.410
 wide-mouth capacity 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.000
 I usually use either checkboxes to find 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:23.980
 such come from under capelin caviar 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.570
 or here are such types will continue 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:32.230
 why wide throat because 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:35.680
 keep it in the freezer from packed 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:39.800
 closed with a wrap or lid and removed 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.980
 But after not so much effort 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.260
 our beautiful homemade lard is ready 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.080
 we cut into pieces we coat the paste 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.930
 on bread and take the most on fishing 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.620
 frosty is now not terrible pleasant 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.620
 appetite
