00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.430
 you can not buy for money in the store 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.140

 I know what to say right now 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:50.210
 but microsoft really wants to join us again 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.210
 try the pc as a game platform 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.130

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.680

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.570
 really serious and not so against 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.100
 drive the wall as with the 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.800
