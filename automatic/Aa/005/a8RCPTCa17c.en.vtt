yeah yeah what about the knitting needle
is<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:08.130> sure<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.119> net<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.390> be

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
is there I'm sure that my net will be

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.590 
is there I'm sure that my net will be
too<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.640> it's<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:11.820> two<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> half<00:01:12.270> months

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
too so it's about two and a half months

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.240 
too so it's about two and a half months
to<00:01:12.630> make<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> movement<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.130> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
to make this one of the movement and it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.160 
to make this one of the movement and it
does<00:01:14.400> more<00:01:14.610> accurately<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:15.630> knit<00:01:15.840> when

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
does more accurately actually knit when

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
does more accurately actually knit when
you<00:01:16.259> want<00:01:16.409> area<00:01:16.619> where<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.070> has<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.850> tense

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
you want area where it has to be tense

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.910 
you want area where it has to be tense
in<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:18.509> sure<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> draw<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.470> front<00:01:19.680> but

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
in there sure I draw this in front but

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.460 
in there sure I draw this in front but
you<00:01:20.070> could<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.460> think<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.909> could<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> from

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
you could I think you could get it from

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.240 
you could I think you could get it from
take<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> bit<00:01:23.490> more<00:01:23.520> time<00:01:23.730> yeah<00:01:24.440> yeah<00:01:25.440> I<00:01:25.680> thought

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
take a bit more time yeah yeah I thought

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.070 
take a bit more time yeah yeah I thought
