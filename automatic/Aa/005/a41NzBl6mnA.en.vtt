put in place they will actually stop his
heart<00:03:22.230> from<00:03:22.440> beating<00:03:22.620> we<00:03:23.580> make<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.030> heart<00:03:24.270> go

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
heart from beating we make the heart go

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.260 
heart from beating we make the heart go
very<00:03:24.870> very<00:03:25.110> rapidly<00:03:25.710> and<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:26.640> basically<00:03:27.060> the

very very rapidly and so basically the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
heart stops pumping we kind of create a

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.920 
heart stops pumping we kind of create a
cardiac<00:03:29.790> arrest<00:03:30.210> and<00:03:31.700> then<00:03:32.700> we<00:03:33.090> put<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.600> the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
cardiac arrest and then we put the the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.770 
cardiac arrest and then we put the the
new<00:03:34.530> valve<00:03:34.830> in<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.400> pull<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.330> balloon<00:03:36.480> out

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
new valve in and pull the balloon out

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.600 
new valve in and pull the balloon out
all<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.320> over<00:03:37.590> about<00:03:37.740> a<00:03:37.800> 15-second

period of time and we have to have a

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
everything goes in sequence if we don't

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.860 
everything goes in sequence if we don't
do<00:03:47.490> things<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.000> sequence<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.480> something

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
do things in the sequence and something

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.620 
do things in the sequence and something
catastrophic<00:03:49.170> could<00:03:49.709> happen<00:03:50.360> they<00:03:51.360> have<00:03:51.480> to

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
catastrophic could happen they have to

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.720 
catastrophic could happen they have to
make<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.840> cut<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.620> vessel<00:03:53.130> there's<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.459> big

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
make a cut in the vessel there's a big

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.420 
make a cut in the vessel there's a big
big<00:03:54.209> artery<00:03:54.720> we're<00:03:55.410> going<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.590> put<00:03:55.770> a<00:03:55.800> big<00:03:56.070> tube

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
big artery we're going to put a big tube

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.949 
big artery we're going to put a big tube
inside<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.550> doctor<00:04:00.360> Velasquez<00:04:00.930> is

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
inside and so the doctor Velasquez is

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.470 
inside and so the doctor Velasquez is
cutting<00:04:01.440> down<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.670> that<00:04:02.820> we<00:04:02.910> can<00:04:03.090> actually

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
cutting down so that we can actually

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.110 
cutting down so that we can actually
look<00:04:03.660> at<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> vessel<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.590> then

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
look at the vessel and then

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.089 
look at the vessel and then
when<00:04:05.360> there's<00:04:05.870> going<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.080> be<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.230> big<00:04:06.440> hole<00:04:06.709> so

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
when there's going to be a big hole so

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.009 
when there's going to be a big hole so
she's<00:04:07.280> going<00:04:07.459> to<00:04:07.519> have<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.670> close<00:04:08.569> it<00:04:08.840> with

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
she's going to have to close it with

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.070 
she's going to have to close it with
surgery<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:10.370> won't<00:04:10.519> bleed<00:04:10.879> this<00:04:11.840> is

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
surgery so that it won't bleed this is

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.770 
surgery so that it won't bleed this is
some<00:04:12.319> very<00:04:12.530> sophisticated<00:04:13.150> procedure<00:04:14.150> my

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
some very sophisticated procedure my

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.170 
some very sophisticated procedure my
role<00:04:15.050> is<00:04:15.319> to<00:04:15.349> assist<00:04:15.739> with<00:04:16.220> exposing<00:04:16.639> the

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
role is to assist with exposing the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.840 
role is to assist with exposing the
access<00:04:17.840> artery<00:04:18.320> and<00:04:18.530> with<00:04:19.190> getting<00:04:19.699> the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
access artery and with getting the

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
delivery system up into the aorta so

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.310 
delivery system up into the aorta so
that<00:04:22.639> dr.<00:04:22.940> O'Neill<00:04:23.090> can<00:04:23.449> then<00:04:23.660> use<00:04:24.290> that

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
that dr. O'Neill can then use that

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.980 
that dr. O'Neill can then use that
delivery<00:04:25.070> system<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.520> place<00:04:26.449> the<00:04:26.660> aortic

we're ready for the valve you press T
right<00:04:56.740> we<00:04:57.740> have<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.979> put<00:04:58.160> the<00:04:58.280> pacer<00:04:58.669> water<00:04:58.850> in

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
right we have to put the pacer water in

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.969 
right we have to put the pacer water in
so<00:04:59.660> we're<00:04:59.810> gonna<00:04:59.900> get<00:05:00.110> ready<00:05:00.289> to<00:05:00.500> test<00:05:00.830> the

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
so we're gonna get ready to test the

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.909 
so we're gonna get ready to test the
pacer<00:05:01.490> in<00:05:01.729> just<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:02.090> minute<00:05:02.240> okay<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:03.530> pacer

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
pacer in just a minute okay the pacer

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.830 
pacer in just a minute okay the pacer
wire<00:05:04.100> sends<00:05:04.610> an<00:05:04.699> electrical<00:05:05.180> charge<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.750> the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
wire sends an electrical charge to the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.500 
wire sends an electrical charge to the
heart<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.320> speeds<00:05:07.070> up<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.400> heartbeat<00:05:07.729> this

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
heart and speeds up the heartbeat this

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.110 
heart and speeds up the heartbeat this
pacer<00:05:09.080> wire<00:05:09.289> will<00:05:09.800> actually<00:05:10.280> cause<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.820> cardiac

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
pacer wire will actually cause a cardiac

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.870 
pacer wire will actually cause a cardiac
arrest<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:12.050> stop<00:05:12.620> his<00:05:12.770> heart<00:05:12.919> long<00:05:13.400> enough<00:05:13.669> to

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
arrest to stop his heart long enough to

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.150 
arrest to stop his heart long enough to
place<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.389> new<00:05:14.510> valve<00:05:14.720> when<00:05:15.229> we're<00:05:15.770> doing<00:05:15.919> the

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
place the new valve when we're doing the

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.670 
place the new valve when we're doing the
pacing<00:05:16.639> I<00:05:16.760> want<00:05:16.940> everybody<00:05:17.389> really<00:05:18.020> quiet<00:05:18.380> in

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
pacing I want everybody really quiet in

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.440 
pacing I want everybody really quiet in
