00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.850
 equipped with the staff of www.exprivia.it 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.220
 lin facebook page of our site in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.099
 description and here we are with the player 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.049
 zlatan ibrahimovic iv because we have 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.809
 made this insane player view 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.160
 spending 2,400,000 credits to take 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 a player because we have it 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.050
 promised and since you have been more 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.590
 of 200 to participate in our last 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.750
 giveaway 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.420
 here is this beast and we review it 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.920
 for you I hope that some of you will be able 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.539
 approve it in otherwise because it is 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.489
 truly a mystical experience because it is 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.370
 a player with 77 speed vi 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.380
 it may seem like little more withdrawal 3 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.989
 compared to the non -fit version and is 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.360
 the best ultimate shooter in 80's 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.520
 pass to 90 dribbling and 84 to 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.760
 test a player so it's awesome 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.410
 mind tona and very strong curse then 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.850
 five-star style something 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.190
 impressive 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.320
 then as usual pros and cons of 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 this player we start with the cons 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.710
 ok we have already finished cary against why 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.969
 against there are none 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.809
 this player is the attacker 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.369
 definitive is the player par excellence 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.320
 otherwise it will be that I never have 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.690
 found in the messi in the ronaldo but they were 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.979
 neither rebels but this in my opinion 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.020
 however he beats them because he is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.430
 awesome me it's great to play 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.039
 own site 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.770
 then the profs we start from the shot that I 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:23.069
 92 which are reflected in 99 of power 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.630
 shooting 98 of finalizing 96 of shooting 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.440
 on the fly, then turn them over 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.429
 it is a pleasure 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.590
 93 of long shot and 86 of effect with him 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.539
 I practically never turn around 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.220
 facts even if they too have entered 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.759
 always because with this player he makes the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.640
 9.8 many on bikes don with him think of 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.110
 having made ten games but I did 25 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.789
 goal something like that 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.590
 I really had to work for 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.600
 be wrong because you owe it to him 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.789
 commit to making mistakes but said 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.549
 let's move on to another thing that knows me 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.079
 that I really liked the steps i 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.180
 these players pass me 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.850
 really liked a lot because at 88 of 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.070
 short passages on 70 such passages of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.130
 this means that he is not only good at doing 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.469
 goal and also useful for throwing wings 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.590
 make the banks I made several banks 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.750
 of head it makes the sides to make the one two and 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.739
 so you can play department alone or 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.329
 he can play as a couple because he really is 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.100
 strong also paired with another 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:23.400
 player for example if you have a leigh 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.590
 anne lee alongside cavani and you are a 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.470
 place 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.070
 then we said shooting and passing 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.410
 let's move on to dribbling and dribbling now 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.450
 that is of phenomenal rho 50 times in 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.609
 this video is really beautiful is beautiful 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.459
 driblare to play with him I'm not a 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.680
 lover of skills but 5 star schily 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.170
 with this player over 94 in the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.739
 dribbling 92 control ball and 4 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.000
 stars weak foot and 95 of strength le 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.370
 five stars are the sky 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.109
 icing on the player's cake more 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.930
 strong in my opinion that we can exist 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.400
 being on high put an expectation 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.389
 it's something really monstrous e 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.219
 beautiful well dribbling with the 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.620
 dribbling you can receive the ball 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.629
 get ball in midfield and wait 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.790
 let the team go up thanks to the 90 centers 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.340
 of physical strength or weld immediately 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.959
 player thanks to his dribbling because 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.129
 any kind of touches do it 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.989
 very well 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.530
 it's beautiful, it's really nice to play with him 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.560
 who wanted ok shooting pass 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.280
 dribbling header header 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.870
 this player at 73 bis high and 77 of 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.510
 header therefore not statistics 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.349
 excellent in game among other things 195 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.030
 so already alone without jumping is like 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.969
 if he was young he would jump three times 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.489
 get other like him and also the shots 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:49.840
 of head are easy to do with him and 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:52.569
 therefore stars the shots of head throws that is 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.199
 you in action can do everything and do 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.419
 also goals 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.980
 here or I think it was the first time in 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.530
 fennel an opponent making them 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.780
 in pretending so truly putting it 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.900
 inside it is beautiful because it is beautiful it is beautiful it is 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.000
 nice then it is also good beats 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.009
 punishment so he can do everything he can 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.769
 do everything because at 86 the punishment 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:13.299
 98 of penalties in that 99 of boosted 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.759
 20 allows punishment to be beaten by 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:20.769
 everywhere in the field both from afar and from 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:22.720
 near and therefore in attack is to do 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.340
 the defy player is the attacker 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.990
 definitive this at least for now 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.030
 waiting to come out even a version 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.300
 stronger maybe its super version e 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:35.349
 and seconds in four pardons then at 96 and 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.810
 aggressiveness and 95 of physical strength and me 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.940
 attacked here talking about the 81 speed 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.370
 because you say 70 sacred speeds on 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.199
 paper is not so much c is a bit slow 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.840
 but not because I like speed 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.360
 meanwhile it seemed much more than 77 e 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.240
 also much more than 81 which is the 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.039
 statistic in game for one click this 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.919
 player even if he is filmed 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.250
 defenders thanks to that damned one 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:02.139
 95 of physical strength holds head 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.729
 prepared like nothing if you have 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.830
 Looked at the clips well the kids in 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.569
 many actions I threw away the 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.139
 defender then I managed to create me 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.599
 crazy for shooting and a range of 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:16.270
 solutions with these players that 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.159
 the energy is really beautiful 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.629
 you can do yourself and enjoy the first one 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.649
 game I made for example had to 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.659
 play my brother and told him 

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:24.819
 look let me do an action face a 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:28.569
 shot and then I leave you first shot first 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:30.159
 goal because I left ok I did 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.249
 a series of passages went around 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:34.869
 ball then I used his skills is me 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.759
 the defender law launched on him 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:38.080
 then I pulled into an action ho 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:41.409
 exploited all its features 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.419
 because with him you can do everything you can 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.399
 really make you all enjoy it 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.869
 I will repeat endlessly 

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:48.939
 having said that I thank you for giving me 

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:50.439

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:52.270
