00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.380
 in this case 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.390
 I'm Leonid Bystrov 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.020
 and today 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.120
 the first day 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.120
 we are defined what is sal 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.669
 everything is really hello 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:17.890
 completed 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.999
 what he says 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.079
 just search engine optimization 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.079
 so for example 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.699
 the best example 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.910
 the fact that your site is optimized 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.830
 this is such a situation prime 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.240
 fast food was already there 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.510
 we go out 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.370
 sheer search engine favorites 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.760
 Wikipedia Optimization 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.760
 oao wikipedia itself 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.020
 query as a whole 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.800
 optimized 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860
 perfect she is now on 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.470
 first place 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.620
 and 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.360
 in that 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.020
 who will fight 30 days 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.980
 and maybe polish 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.550
 yes and we will actually 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.630
 surprisingly sites 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.240
 that's closer 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.130
 first lines 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.960
 but at least in the top 100 we will need 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.030
 get there 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.800
 yes by example 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.800
 my request 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.660
 prim 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.660
 grishin 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.070
 we do it 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.040
 great stuff 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.260
 now 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.900
 ohh my site 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.100
 is in the top 10 in August I don't even 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.030
 knew how it was he was in the top 60 so 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.230
 requests 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.960
 so cool 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.880
 we indexed the page 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.040
 Yandex means I will do everything right 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.160
 by the way redid three weeks 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.440
 and here's how to get there 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.310
 in top 10 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.600
 get to the fourth line 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.640
 requests for a specific 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.179
 category d 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.179
 I'll teach you Sasha Borisov by the way 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.179
 hi, I overtook you hara 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.059
 In general, this is all and not all so 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.279
 I have a few more balls 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.879
 search engine optimization there 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:25.619
 white 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.619
 yes it is search engine optimization which 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.530
 not prohibited in principle 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.929
 search rules 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.009
 army about this year 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.829
 we will talk more specifically 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.519
 further lessons 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.629
 we will deal white 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.669
 search engine optimization 

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.669
 optimization is all this kind of stuff 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.649
 not prohibited by undesirable precisely 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.849
 for search engine bots and so on 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.680
 fokin rival course Yandex can bottoms 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.949
 things just your site 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.529
 and after all the bank forever it was he who did not even 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.899
 as much website as domain 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:08.429
 and in principle will not index where 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:10.539
 something there robots send n 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.969
 we will not take risks 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:15.599
 Anna also has a black Kim and the sun 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.599
 it is basically forbidden but not 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.029
 at the most optimistic 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:25.689
 such methods short-term sites such 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.689
 who want to cut the dough now 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.509
 in principle, it lasts there for three four months 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.049
 black guys just to the bank too 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.389
 generally 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:42.839
 in every way 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.099
 he gave the first information 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.899
 I know that you have 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:48.449
 next inscription 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.129
 smile catch 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.589
