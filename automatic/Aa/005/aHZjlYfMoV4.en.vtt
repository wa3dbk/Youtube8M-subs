00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.920
 hola que tal today we will talk about how 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.450
 slaughter the bottle of fire with the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.970
 red terraces 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.759
 for this we will need some pincers that 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.759
 have red alive 'cold water some of the 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:26.400
 sponge dating or if you're a 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.410
 specialist with a rhyme 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 when a bottle of wine is very old 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
 possibly the car is damaged and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.650
 You can use any type of car 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.870
 special was a beautiful ceremony 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.570
 additional grateful is the opening to 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.699
 fire then we will remove the best 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.410
 way in the capsule if it's not too old 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.720
 as they were since it's only for 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.000
 try for this exhibition the ordinary 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.230
 faster way but we will use the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.420
 sancocho oranges we will clean with 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.590
 care for possible 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.570
 we will use a hope is the red 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:04.130
 I live that the first thing we want is to turn off 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:07.070
 the fire apply below the cork and 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.550
 above clear it is of the wine to procure 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.890
 that like no bottle is round 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.860
 all glass parts or the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.720
 bottle are oval and possibly from 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.140
 the areas that do not touch the steel 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.730
 hold a few seconds and then 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.400
 of heating the glass without it 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.450
 hot the wine apply the cold and it 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.140
 will break in a clean and safe way 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.420
 in my case I would use a feather and 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.700
 as you see a perfect cut there is no 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.370
 No danger of splinters despite everything 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.130
 this kind of old wines are due to 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.800
 transfer to a decanter if it is a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.140
 better strainer and only decanting 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.140
 the weight of glass will make it impossible for 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.619
 no piece or possible splinter reaches 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.619
 your cup
