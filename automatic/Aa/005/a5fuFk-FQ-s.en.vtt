00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
I want to bend this G up to the route to

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.639 
I want to bend this G up to the route to
the<00:01:05.299> eighth<00:01:05.449> would<00:01:05.600> have<00:01:05.750> been<00:01:05.840> that<00:01:05.990> flat

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
the eighth would have been that flat

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.789 
the eighth would have been that flat
seven<00:01:07.070> up<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.399> root<00:01:08.470> hear<00:01:09.470> that<00:01:09.619> little

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
seven up to the root hear that little

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.130 
seven up to the root hear that little
mute<00:01:10.610> I<00:01:10.880> put<00:01:11.149> in<00:01:11.240> front<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.509> it<00:01:11.659> I'll<00:01:11.810> try<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.020> do

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
mute I put in front of it I'll try to do

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.250 
mute I put in front of it I'll try to do
it<00:01:12.229> slow

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.840 

again<00:01:18.260> I'm<00:01:18.410> hitting<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.770> D<00:01:18.980> and<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.310> G<00:01:19.370> string

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
again I'm hitting the D and the G string

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.640 
again I'm hitting the D and the G string
before<00:01:20.840> hits<00:01:21.230> get<00:01:21.410> to<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.650> be<00:01:23.410> that's<00:01:24.410> what

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
before hits get to that be that's what

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.290 
before hits get to that be that's what
you<00:01:24.740> want<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:24.980> practice<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.900> then<00:01:27.290> Ben<00:01:28.300> and

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
you want to practice and then Ben and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.910 
you want to practice and then Ben and
it's<00:01:29.450> just<00:01:29.570> a<00:01:29.630> matter

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.859 

it's<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.130> matter<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.520> practice<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.569> far<00:01:39.749> as

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
it's just a matter of practice as far as

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.419 
it's just a matter of practice as far as
timing<00:01:40.289> it<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.710> where<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.069> hit<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
timing it to where you can hit it and

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.090 
timing it to where you can hit it and
you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.789> that<00:01:42.409> even<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.649> you're<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.890> not

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you can do that even if you're just not

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.679 
you can do that even if you're just not
even<00:01:44.280> bending<00:01:44.609> like<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:44.969> sounding<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.539> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
even bending like if I'm sounding this a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.830 
even bending like if I'm sounding this a
note<00:01:49.670> you're<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.750> know<00:01:52.280> and<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.630> such

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
note you're a you know and that is such

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.330 
note you're a you know and that is such
a<00:01:54.869> cool<00:01:55.109> thing<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.709> it<00:01:55.920> gives<00:01:56.099> up

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
a cool thing to do because it gives up

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.910 
a cool thing to do because it gives up
