listen to me on a personal note I feel
that<00:00:29.099> drinking<00:00:29.730> coffee<00:00:30.169> is<00:00:31.489> better<00:00:32.570> than

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that drinking coffee is better than

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.290 
that drinking coffee is better than
drinking<00:00:33.930> decaf<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.640> don't<00:00:35.850> think<00:00:36.210> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
drinking decaf now I don't think you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.430 
drinking decaf now I don't think you
should<00:00:36.329> drink<00:00:36.630> coffee<00:00:36.900> at<00:00:37.230> all<00:00:37.730> but

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
should drink coffee at all but

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.050 
should drink coffee at all but
decaffeination<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.070> art<00:00:41.310> or<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> act

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
decaffeination is the art or the act

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.040 
decaffeination is the art or the act
rather<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.960> chemical<00:00:43.590> act<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.160> removing<00:00:45.050> some

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
rather the chemical act of removing some

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.690 
rather the chemical act of removing some
not<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:47.180> caffeine<00:00:48.180> from<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.720> coffee<00:00:48.990> bean<00:00:49.700> we

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
not all caffeine from the coffee bean we

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.300 
not all caffeine from the coffee bean we
walk<00:00:51.030> away<00:00:51.240> feeling<00:00:51.810> like<00:00:52.110> oh<00:00:52.470> it's<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.220> so

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
walk away feeling like oh it's just so

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.830 
walk away feeling like oh it's just so
much<00:00:53.400> healthy<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.880> Sud<00:00:54.150> like<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.600> things

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
much healthy like Sud like the things

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.530 
much healthy like Sud like the things
that<00:00:55.050> are<00:00:55.140> bad<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.860> coffee<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.790> only<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
that are bad with coffee is only the

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.540 
that are bad with coffee is only the
caffeine<00:00:57.990> see<00:00:58.560> that's<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.950> first<00:00:59.160> assumption

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
caffeine see that's the first assumption

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.430 
caffeine see that's the first assumption
people<00:00:59.850> make<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.810> problem<00:01:01.200> with<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
people make that the problem with the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
people make that the problem with the
coffee<00:01:01.650> is<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.220> caffeine<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.450> take

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
coffee is the caffeine so if we take

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.830 
coffee is the caffeine so if we take
some<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.729> then<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.119> got<00:01:06.420> less

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
some of it out then it's got less

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.370 
some of it out then it's got less
problems<00:01:07.850> that's<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.180> true<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
problems that's not true that is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.520 
problems that's not true that is
absolutely<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.430> true<00:01:11.490> whatsoever<00:01:12.240> coffee<00:01:13.170> in

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
absolutely not true whatsoever coffee in

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.070 
absolutely not true whatsoever coffee in
and<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.800> itself<00:01:14.130> has<00:01:14.460> over<00:01:14.760> 400<00:01:15.240> chemicals

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and of itself has over 400 chemicals

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.560 
and of itself has over 400 chemicals
that<00:01:16.260> are<00:01:16.350> all<00:01:17.000> instrumental<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.180> giving<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
that are all instrumental in giving you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.350 
that are all instrumental in giving you
the<00:01:18.720> aroma<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.409> final<00:01:19.920> taste<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.670> coffee

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the aroma and the final taste of coffee

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.890 
the aroma and the final taste of coffee
when<00:01:22.260> you<00:01:22.500> take<00:01:22.800> out<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.550> caffeine<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
when you take out just the caffeine you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.510 
when you take out just the caffeine you
still<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:25.440> stuck<00:01:25.680> with<00:01:25.890> all<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.159> rest<00:01:26.370> of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
still are stuck with all the rest of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.790 
still are stuck with all the rest of
them<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.510> caffeine<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.140> removed<00:01:28.590> by

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
them but the caffeine is removed by

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.520 
them but the caffeine is removed by
different<00:01:29.250> solvents<00:01:30.020> different<00:01:31.020> chemicals

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
different solvents different chemicals

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.130 
different solvents different chemicals
so<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.310> really<00:01:32.970> think<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.360> when<00:01:33.600> people<00:01:33.810> drink

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
so I really think that when people drink

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.790 
so I really think that when people drink
decaf<00:01:34.890> Duke<00:01:35.360> they<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:36.810> Norma<00:01:37.290> does<00:01:37.470> and

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
decaf Duke they do what Norma does and

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.280 
decaf Duke they do what Norma does and
Norma's<00:01:38.299> cardiologist<00:01:39.299> does<00:01:39.510> is<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:40.229> think

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
Norma's cardiologist does is they think

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.800 
Norma's cardiologist does is they think
that<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.070> vindicates<00:01:41.729> coffee<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.690> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
that that vindicates coffee and that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.990 
that that vindicates coffee and that
it's<00:01:42.960> okay<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.460> start<00:01:44.760> drinking

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it's okay and then they start drinking

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
it's okay and then they start drinking
notice<00:01:45.390> her<00:01:45.479> husband<00:01:45.930> drinks<00:01:46.200> two<00:01:46.440> to<00:01:46.950> three

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
notice her husband drinks two to three

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.730 
notice her husband drinks two to three
cups<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.880> they're<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.870> top<00:01:48.900> of<00:01:49.200> your<00:01:49.409> mugs

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
cups and they're not on top of your mugs

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.580 
cups and they're not on top of your mugs
that's<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.760> so<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.320> thought

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
that's right so that so the the thought

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.109 
that's right so that so the the thought
is<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> same<00:01:53.159> way<00:01:53.310> when<00:01:53.490> they<00:01:53.610> first<00:01:53.820> came<00:01:54.060> out

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
is the same way when they first came out

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.690 
is the same way when they first came out
with<00:01:54.330> fat<00:01:55.170> free<00:01:55.470> yogurt<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.159> America<00:01:56.549> got

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
with fat free yogurt and America got

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.760 
with fat free yogurt and America got
fatter<00:01:57.030> because<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.049> are<00:01:58.170> fat<00:01:58.409> free<00:01:58.619> ice

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
fatter because they are fat free ice

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.350 
fatter because they are fat free ice
cream<00:01:58.799> rather<00:01:59.250> because<00:01:59.850> people<00:02:00.150> said<00:02:00.270> all

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
cream rather because people said all

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.850 
cream rather because people said all
this<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.540> fat-free<00:02:00.990> I'll<00:02:01.170> eat<00:02:01.350> plenty<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.740> it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
this is fat-free I'll eat plenty of it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.469 
this is fat-free I'll eat plenty of it
but<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.070> still<00:02:02.430> had<00:02:02.640> tons<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.060> sugar<00:02:03.360> in

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
but it still had tons of sugar in

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.080 
but it still had tons of sugar in
calories<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.770> ate<00:02:05.040> more<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:05.970> you

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
calories so so you ate more because you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.479 
calories so so you ate more because you
felt<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> was<00:02:06.479> healthier<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.799> people<00:02:08.220> fall
