00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
squads if you're on something like that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.050

something<00:01:10.440> that's<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.770> demanding<00:01:11.580> that's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
something that's very demanding that's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.730 
something that's very demanding that's
only<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.600> done<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.049> set<00:01:13.380> period<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:14.190> time

only to be done for a set period of time

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
only to be done for a set period of time
then<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.280> can't<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:17.760> use<00:01:18.030> clean<00:01:18.420> bulking

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
then you can't really use clean bulking

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.899 
then you can't really use clean bulking
strategies<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:20.250> conflict<00:01:20.790> with

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
strategies because they conflict with

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.160 
strategies because they conflict with
each<00:01:21.150> other<00:01:21.439> the<00:01:22.439> short-term<00:01:23.010> programs<00:01:24.170> like

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
each other the short-term programs like

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.609 
each other the short-term programs like

that<00:01:31.979> you're<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.729> giving<00:01:33.360> yourself

that you're going to be giving yourself

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.789 
that you're going to be giving yourself
enough<00:01:35.270> nutrients<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> sustain<00:01:37.020> yourself<00:01:37.619> on

enough nutrients to sustain yourself on

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.880 
enough nutrients to sustain yourself on
that<00:01:38.100> program<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.750> programs<00:01:40.290> are<00:01:40.590> much

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
that program so the programs are much

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.090 
that program so the programs are much
more<00:01:41.520> intense<00:01:42.180> they're<00:01:42.570> much<00:01:42.750> more<00:01:43.170> difficult

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
more intense they're much more difficult

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.080 
more intense they're much more difficult
and<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.450> don't<00:01:45.810> match<00:01:46.229> your<00:01:47.090> nutrition

going<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.500> go<00:02:22.650> haywire<00:02:23.130> next<00:02:23.550> thing<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.730> know

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
going to go haywire next thing you know

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.460 
going to go haywire next thing you know
you<00:02:23.940> hate<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.390> program<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.020> mass<00:02:25.230> made

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
you hate the program that mass made

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.470 
you hate the program that mass made
simple<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.010> had<00:02:26.220> such<00:02:26.460> stupid<00:02:26.820> program<00:02:27.060> all<00:02:27.450> I

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
simple I had such stupid program all I

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.930 
simple I had such stupid program all I
did<00:02:27.690> was<00:02:27.720> get<00:02:27.930> injured<00:02:28.200> by<00:02:28.320> all<00:02:28.530> along<00:02:29.630> no<00:02:31.940> you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
did was get injured by all along no you

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.840 
did was get injured by all along no you
didn't<00:02:33.330> match<00:02:33.600> your<00:02:34.380> training<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.190> your

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
didn't match your training in your

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.590 
didn't match your training in your
nutrition<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:37.020> use<00:02:38.010> eight<00:02:38.280> exercises<00:02:38.600> that

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
nutrition I use eight exercises that

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.720 
nutrition I use eight exercises that
gauge<00:02:40.050> my<00:02:40.290> progress<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:41.070> know<00:02:41.130> if<00:02:41.340> those<00:02:41.460> eight

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
gauge my progress I know if those eight

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.550 
gauge my progress I know if those eight
exercises<00:02:42.000> are<00:02:42.480> doing<00:02:42.720> well<00:02:42.900> then<00:02:43.140> I'm<00:02:43.230> doing

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
exercises are doing well then I'm doing

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.650 
exercises are doing well then I'm doing
well<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.010> if<00:02:44.340> my<00:02:44.460> nutrition<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.180> matching

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
well and if my nutrition is matching

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.260 
well and if my nutrition is matching
those<00:02:45.780> at<00:02:45.960> exercises<00:02:46.740> then<00:02:47.220> I'm<00:02:47.880> going<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.150> be

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
those at exercises then I'm going to be

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.780 
those at exercises then I'm going to be
do<00:02:48.510> be<00:02:48.780> doing<00:02:49.170> even<00:02:49.380> better<00:02:49.410> because<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.370> don't

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
do be doing even better because I don't

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.180 
do be doing even better because I don't
train<00:02:51.210> those<00:02:51.450> exercises<00:02:52.050> through<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.980> roof

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
train those exercises through the roof

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.760 
train those exercises through the roof
like<00:02:53.550> those<00:02:53.790> short<00:02:54.300> 16-week<00:02:54.960> programs<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.620> try

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
like those short 16-week programs is try

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.680 
like those short 16-week programs is try
to<00:02:55.830> jam<00:02:56.250> all<00:02:56.490> of<00:02:56.700> your<00:02:56.850> progress<00:02:57.300> in<00:02:57.510> such<00:02:57.660> a

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
to jam all of your progress in such a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.590 
to jam all of your progress in such a
limited<00:02:57.990> window<00:02:58.860> whenever<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.910> jam<00:03:00.300> your

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
limited window whenever you jam your

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.200 
limited window whenever you jam your

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
progress in a limited window like that

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.240 
progress in a limited window like that
you're<00:03:03.720> going<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.230> assume<00:03:04.500> some<00:03:04.950> kind

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
you're going to have to assume some kind

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.670 
you're going to have to assume some kind
of<00:03:05.400> linear<00:03:05.790> behavior<00:03:06.090> with<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.840> body<00:03:07.110> you're

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
of linear behavior with the body you're

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.570 
of linear behavior with the body you're
going<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.860> assume<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.220> you're<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.520> to

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
going to assume that you're going to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.490 
going to assume that you're going to
make<00:03:08.730> progress<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.330> such<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> short<00:03:10.020> time<00:03:10.140> span

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
make progress in such a short time span

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.520 
make progress in such a short time span
and<00:03:10.920> then<00:03:11.310> your<00:03:11.460> nutrition<00:03:12.090> needs<00:03:12.330> have<00:03:12.960> to

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
and then your nutrition needs have to

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.550 
and then your nutrition needs have to
match<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:13.880> with<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.300> clean<00:03:15.540> bulk<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.410> my

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
match that with the clean bulk and my

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.860 
match that with the clean bulk and my
personal<00:03:17.160> ethos<00:03:18.560> linear<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.800> not<00:03:20.190> good<00:03:20.870> you

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
personal ethos linear is not good you

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.870 
personal ethos linear is not good you
have<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.290> be<00:03:22.410> chaotic<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.130> have<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.370> wave<00:03:23.580> up

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
have to be chaotic you have to wave up

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.020 
have to be chaotic you have to wave up
and<00:03:24.180> down<00:03:24.360> with<00:03:25.200> your<00:03:25.740> body's<00:03:26.130> physiology<00:03:26.550> as

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
and down with your body's physiology as

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.680 
and down with your body's physiology as
you<00:03:27.810> detect<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.650> on<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.800> day-to-day<00:03:29.070> basis<00:03:29.760> so

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
you detect it on a day-to-day basis so

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.480 
you detect it on a day-to-day basis so
back<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.870> those<00:03:31.110> eight<00:03:31.290> exercises<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.190> use

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
back to those eight exercises that I use

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.120 
back to those eight exercises that I use
I<00:03:32.700> know<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.030> could<00:03:33.270> take<00:03:33.480> my<00:03:33.510> time<00:03:34.130> progressing

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
I know I could take my time progressing

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.720 
I know I could take my time progressing
on<00:03:35.280> those<00:03:35.520> because<00:03:36.410> all<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:38.010> matters<00:03:38.490> is

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
on those because all that matters is

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.150 
on those because all that matters is
really<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.510> progress<00:03:40.050> over<00:03:40.440> time<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:40.950> can

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
really the progress over time so I can

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.270 
really the progress over time so I can
chip<00:03:41.430> away<00:03:41.460> at<00:03:41.910> them<00:03:42.470> match<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.890> with<00:03:44.100> my

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
chip away at them match that with my

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.190 
chip away at them match that with my
nutrition<00:03:44.610> needs<00:03:44.970> not<00:03:45.300> really<00:03:45.630> training<00:03:45.900> to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
nutrition needs not really training to

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.070 
nutrition needs not really training to
intensively<00:03:46.880> which<00:03:47.880> also<00:03:48.300> means<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.870> I'm

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
intensively which also means that I'm

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.270 
intensively which also means that I'm
less<00:03:49.500> prone<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.760> injury<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.950> could<00:03:53.100> sustain

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
less prone to injury and I could sustain

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.010 
less prone to injury and I could sustain
that<00:03:53.610> progress<00:03:54.060> over<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> long<00:03:54.570> period<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.930> time

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
that progress over a long period of time

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.310 
that progress over a long period of time
match<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.160> with<00:03:56.250> my<00:03:56.430> nutrition<00:03:56.870> all<00:03:57.870> that

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
match it with my nutrition all that

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.750 
match it with my nutrition all that
chaos<00:03:58.620> wonderful<00:03:59.580> stuff<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.410> over<00:04:01.410> time<00:04:01.760> the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
chaos wonderful stuff and over time the

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.580 
chaos wonderful stuff and over time the
magic<00:04:03.150> happens<00:04:03.920> so<00:04:05.000> just<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.120> conclude<00:04:06.330> if<00:04:06.900> you

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
magic happens so just to conclude if you

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.610 
magic happens so just to conclude if you
go<00:04:07.740> on<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:07.920> short-term<00:04:08.280> program<00:04:09.170> very<00:04:10.170> intense

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
go on a short-term program very intense

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.030 
go on a short-term program very intense
short-term<00:04:11.250> program<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:12.570> sort<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.350> forces

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
short-term program that sort of forces

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.180 
short-term program that sort of forces
you<00:04:14.280> into<00:04:14.420> linear<00:04:15.420> physiology<00:04:16.290> forces<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.010> to

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
you into linear physiology forces you to

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.460 
you into linear physiology forces you to
assume<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.580> you're<00:04:17.850> going<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.030> progress<00:04:18.989> X

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
assume that you're going to progress X

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.990 
assume that you're going to progress X
amount<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.310> why<00:04:20.730> amount<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.210> time<00:04:22.130> then<00:04:23.130> the

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
amount and why amount of time then the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.310 
amount and why amount of time then the
chaotic<00:04:24.660> nature<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:25.290> any<00:04:25.530> kind<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.860> clean

chaotic nature of any kind of clean

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.400 
chaotic nature of any kind of clean
ball<00:04:26.500> really<00:04:26.950> isn't<00:04:27.340> for<00:04:27.670> you<00:04:28.080> so<00:04:29.080> that's<00:04:29.290> a

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
ball really isn't for you so that's a
