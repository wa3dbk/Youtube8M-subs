hello<00:00:01.140> I<00:00:01.319> wanted<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.220> talk<00:00:02.429> about<00:00:02.460> minecraft

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
hello I wanted to talk about minecraft

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.650 
hello I wanted to talk about minecraft
worlds<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.319> is<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.730> easy<00:00:05.730> prototype<00:00:06.450> that

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
worlds and this is a easy prototype that

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.680 
worlds and this is a easy prototype that
I<00:00:06.690> built<00:00:07.020> on<00:00:07.259> YouTube<00:00:07.910> kind<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:08.970> publicly<00:00:09.360> as<00:00:09.660> I

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
I built on YouTube kind of publicly as I

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.259 
I built on YouTube kind of publicly as I
were<00:00:09.990> at<00:00:10.950> about<00:00:11.160> four<00:00:11.370> hours<00:00:11.519> so<00:00:11.940> it's<00:00:12.090> not<00:00:12.179> a

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
were at about four hours so it's not a

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.539 
were at about four hours so it's not a
very<00:00:12.420> complicated<00:00:12.809> engine<00:00:13.440> but<00:00:14.309> I'm

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
very complicated engine but I'm

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.820 
very complicated engine but I'm
recording<00:00:14.820> in<00:00:15.059> fraps<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:16.230> i'm<00:00:16.379> using<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.680> is

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
recording in fraps and i'm using this is

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.410 
recording in fraps and i'm using this is
kind<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.310> benchmark<00:00:18.470> to<00:00:19.470> show<00:00:20.270> where<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
kind of a benchmark to show where the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.029 
kind of a benchmark to show where the
project<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.930> at<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> current<00:00:22.470> moment<00:00:22.650> and

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
project is at the current moment and

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.589 
project is at the current moment and
also<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.910> talk<00:00:24.210> about<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:25.470> nature<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:26.599> worlds

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
also to talk about the nature of worlds

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.950 
also to talk about the nature of worlds
that<00:00:28.230> get<00:00:28.410> generated<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:29.720> Minecraft<00:00:30.720> like

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that get generated in Minecraft like

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.470 
that get generated in Minecraft like
games<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.219> there's<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.550> impulse<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.210> always

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
games so there's this impulse as always

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.810 
games so there's this impulse as always
an<00:00:33.630> impulse<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.500> try<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.250> create<00:00:35.489> very

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
an impulse to try and create very

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.380 
an impulse to try and create very
complex<00:00:37.700> scenarios<00:00:38.700> where<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.180> know<00:00:39.270> you'll

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
complex scenarios where you know you'll

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.569 
complex scenarios where you know you'll
be<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.629> well<00:00:39.899> maybe<00:00:40.050> we<00:00:40.320> should<00:00:40.350> dig<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.489> out

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
be like well maybe we should dig it out

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.369 
be like well maybe we should dig it out
in<00:00:41.820> such<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> certain<00:00:42.480> way<00:00:42.690> or<00:00:42.719> maybe<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.200> should

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
in such a certain way or maybe we should

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.819 
in such a certain way or maybe we should
do<00:00:43.530> x<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.129> y<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.289> complicated

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
do x and y and have this complicated

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.420 
do x and y and have this complicated
brush<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.460> works<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> specific<00:00:48.660> pattern

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
brush that works in a specific pattern

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.590 
brush that works in a specific pattern
and<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.000> overthinking<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:53.600> these

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and I think that's overthinking it these

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.709 
and I think that's overthinking it these
sorts<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.020> games<00:00:55.230> do<00:00:55.530> very<00:00:55.860> very<00:00:56.010> well<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.850> just

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
sorts of games do very very well at just

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.319 
sorts of games do very very well at just
random<00:00:58.350> noise<00:00:58.699> these<00:00:59.699> worlds<00:01:00.059> build

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
random noise these worlds build

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.900 
random noise these worlds build
themselves<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> random<00:01:01.320> noise<00:01:01.699> you<00:01:02.699> don't

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
themselves out of random noise you don't

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.230 
themselves out of random noise you don't
need<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:04.159> now<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.189> mean<00:01:05.580> obviously<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
need to think now I mean obviously you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.760 
need to think now I mean obviously you
need<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> put<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> correct<00:01:07.049> kinds<00:01:07.650> of

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
need to put in the correct kinds of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.020 
need to put in the correct kinds of
brushes<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> stuff<00:01:08.580> you're<00:01:08.700> trying<00:01:08.909> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
brushes for the stuff you're trying to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.560 
brushes for the stuff you're trying to
do<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:10.170> for<00:01:10.530> example<00:01:10.909> if<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.150> wanted<00:01:12.330> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
do so for example if you wanted to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.050 
do so for example if you wanted to
create<00:01:13.220> ruins<00:01:14.220> you'd<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.640> put<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.030> some

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
create ruins you'd have to put in some

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.219 
create ruins you'd have to put in some
brushes<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.689> are<00:01:16.430> basically<00:01:17.430> ruins<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
brushes that are basically ruins I you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.109 
brushes that are basically ruins I you
know<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> generated<00:01:19.830> walls<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.490> rooms<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
know the generated walls and rooms and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.060 
know the generated walls and rooms and
such<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.320> don't<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:25.470> link<00:01:25.860> them

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
such but you don't have to to link them

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.149 
such but you don't have to to link them
together<00:01:26.220> very<00:01:26.580> carefully<00:01:27.829> there<00:01:28.829> are<00:01:28.950> some

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
together very carefully there are some

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100 
together very carefully there are some
times<00:01:29.430> when<00:01:29.790> physics<00:01:30.360> will<00:01:30.540> come<00:01:30.689> into<00:01:30.840> play

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
times when physics will come into play

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.200 
times when physics will come into play
for<00:01:31.799> example<00:01:32.159> if<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> want<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.670> put<00:01:32.820> beaches

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
for example if you want to put beaches

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.630 
for example if you want to put beaches
next<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> water<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.290> unsure<00:01:34.520> sure<00:01:35.520> that's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
next to water and so unsure sure that's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.069 
next to water and so unsure sure that's
not<00:01:35.820> really<00:01:36.060> what<00:01:36.150> I'm<00:01:36.240> talking<00:01:36.600> about<00:01:36.689> what

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
not really what I'm talking about what

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.399 
not really what I'm talking about what
I'm<00:01:37.170> talking<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:39.090> fact<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.810> these

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
I'm talking about is the fact that these

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.740 
I'm talking about is the fact that these
worlds<00:01:40.920> will<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.159> very<00:01:41.430> interesting<00:01:42.030> even

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
worlds will be very interesting even

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
worlds will be very interesting even
with<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> most<00:01:43.380> basic<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:44.009> brushes<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> mean

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
with the most basic of brushes I mean

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.600 
with the most basic of brushes I mean
I've<00:01:44.970> only<00:01:45.000> got<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:46.290> four<00:01:46.680> brush<00:01:46.979> type<00:01:47.280> three

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I've only got like four brush type three

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.359 
I've only got like four brush type three
brush<00:01:47.850> types<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.890> they're<00:01:49.890> not<00:01:50.070> at<00:01:50.220> all

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
brush types and they're not at all

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.359 
brush types and they're not at all
intelligent<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:51.240> randomly<00:01:52.369> choose

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
intelligent they just randomly choose

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.740 
intelligent they just randomly choose
which<00:01:53.610> brush<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.970> play<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.450> they<00:01:54.600> get<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
which brush to play and they get a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.969 
which brush to play and they get a
moment<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:57.360> world<00:01:57.540> works<00:01:58.049> fine<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.740> looks

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
moment and the world works fine it looks

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.219 
moment and the world works fine it looks
interesting<00:01:59.540> and<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.960> know<00:02:01.049> it's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
interesting and you know it's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.770 
interesting and you know it's
interesting<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.860> explore<00:02:02.360> it's<00:02:03.360> got<00:02:03.509> vast

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
interesting to explore it's got vast

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.990 
interesting to explore it's got vast
underground<00:02:04.200> caves<00:02:04.770> even<00:02:05.189> though<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.640> only

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
underground caves even though it's only

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.050 
underground caves even though it's only
20<00:02:06.360> units<00:02:06.659> high

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.080 

and<00:02:09.209> even<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> above-ground<00:02:10.649> area<00:02:11.190> well<00:02:11.489> it's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
and even the above-ground area well it's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.250 
and even the above-ground area well it's
not<00:02:12.270> very<00:02:12.450> interesting<00:02:12.569> because<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
not very interesting because the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.979 
not very interesting because the
above-ground<00:02:13.440> really<00:02:13.860> relies<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.989> height

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
above-ground really relies on height

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.860 
above-ground really relies on height
more<00:02:16.890> than<00:02:17.069> more<00:02:17.610> than<00:02:17.640> underground<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:18.690> even

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
more than more than underground but even

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.089 
more than more than underground but even
the<00:02:18.930> above-ground<00:02:19.140> area<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.680> relatively

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
the above-ground area is relatively

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.970 
the above-ground area is relatively
interesting<00:02:20.550> already<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:22.319> don't<00:02:22.530> worry<00:02:22.650> too

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
interesting already so don't worry too

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.530 
interesting already so don't worry too
much<00:02:23.010> about<00:02:24.319> coming<00:02:25.319> up<00:02:25.380> with<00:02:25.440> cleverness<00:02:26.540> in

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
much about coming up with cleverness in

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.020 
much about coming up with cleverness in
and<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.930> yourself<00:02:28.319> sheer<00:02:29.190> randomness<00:02:29.700> will

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
and of yourself sheer randomness will

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.250 
and of yourself sheer randomness will
always<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:31.680> bid<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:33.150> it'll<00:02:33.720> always<00:02:33.900> work

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
always I bid you it'll always work

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.830 
always I bid you it'll always work
faster<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:34.920> harder<00:02:35.040> than<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.400> will<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.390> try

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
faster and harder than you will so try

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.630 
faster and harder than you will so try
and<00:02:36.989> take<00:02:37.140> advantage<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.590> randomness<00:02:37.980> instead

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
and take advantage of randomness instead

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:49.110 
and take advantage of randomness instead
of<00:02:38.760> trying<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.090> set<00:02:39.360> up<00:02:39.480> your<00:02:39.630> own<00:02:40.040> best<00:02:41.150> ideals

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.089 

that's<00:02:50.080> basically<00:02:50.200> what<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.560> wanted<00:02:50.799> to<00:02:50.860> say

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
that's basically what I wanted to say

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.130 
that's basically what I wanted to say
and<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.340> also<00:02:51.459> wanted<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.790> get<00:02:51.909> a<00:02:51.970> video<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:53.080> it

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
and I also wanted to get a video of it

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.839 
and I also wanted to get a video of it
on<00:02:53.260> fraps<00:02:53.620> so<00:02:53.980> that<00:02:54.129> you<00:02:54.310> know<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.519> can<00:02:54.700> see

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
on fraps so that you know you can see

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.949 
on fraps so that you know you can see
that<00:02:54.970> it<00:02:55.090> runs<00:02:55.269> fine<00:02:55.659> and<00:02:57.659> this<00:02:58.659> is<00:02:58.810> really

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
that it runs fine and this is really

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.490 
that it runs fine and this is really
easy<00:02:59.170> this<00:02:59.379> is<00:02:59.440> for<00:02:59.560> hours<00:02:59.980> work<00:03:01.230> spend<00:03:02.230> longer

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
easy this is for hours work spend longer

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.090 
easy this is for hours work spend longer
uploading<00:03:03.010> videos<00:03:03.280> then<00:03:03.580> taking<00:03:03.940> them
