00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.760
 to the bar 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.890
 in terms of programs, the 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.819
 typical windows with the browser 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.920

 I have tried so far I have practiced 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.310
 practically a day and a half trying the 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.959

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.100
 very good performance and battery 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.280

 especially something very important for 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.640
 all those who are going to install it 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.210
 let's go here to the screen where 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.210
 We can see 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.370

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.930

 etcetera I warn you that here 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.490
 comes another launcher that does not come with 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.680
 this version is to say this corresponds to 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.660
 some previous version this was tried 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.740
 from the next launcher then this launcher 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.540
 does not come with this new version ok 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.610
 you can install it likewise 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.650
 you download the next launcher a good 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.269
 launcher 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.879
 for those who like things 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.590
 so very moved and with a lot of graphics 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.269

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.280
 everything that takes et cetera etcetera and 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.720

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.329

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:16.409
 install it and put how to install the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.409
 steps to follow 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.510
 and we would have to go where he puts 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.100
 download peace for all those who do not 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.740
 you have no previous version of 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.060
 Victor 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.750
 we would have to download version 4 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.750
 that we have it here 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.289
 there we have the download concretely 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.729
 here it comes in parts and here it comes in a 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.780
 only file I downloaded it from 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.780
 here of this first link 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.370
 and this is the first one that there is 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.900
 flash receive we download this and the 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.789
 we copy inside our memory 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.830
 internal of the terminal then we would go 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:56.120
 to version 4.7 which is the last one that is 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.969
 this here we download this file the 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.560
 4.7 final that comes here and equally what 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:03.539
 we copy inside the terminal and then 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.909
 we can now restart the recovery mode 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:10.139
 make the corresponding whites and 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:13.439
 install the 4.0 here first and 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.930
 then the 4.7 without restarting is to say 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:17.610
 first flash let's be a zip and then 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.710
 we plan others without restarting the 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.789
 terminal ok 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.349
 this is the only way that is going to 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.259
 work because if you download the 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:27.210
 version 4.7 that you 'll see right away that 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.879
 it only occupies 80 megabytes and can not be a 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.219
 rom obviously completes the rom 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:35.610
 complete comes here in version 4.0 and 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:37.379
 then this would be the update worth 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.990
 well this is important that you do it 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:43.110
 If you are going to install it, I have done it 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.240
 and it works great here 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.349
 we have the truth that it works very 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.349
 but that very well this branch 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.629
 it has an appearance as I say so in 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.489
 very cool blue tones and other good 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:57.549
 Well here I leave the news of this rom 

00:05:54.489 --> 00:06:01.089
 for those who do not know her, tell her that 

00:05:57.549 --> 00:06:02.709

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:05.169
 right now in x de a de belo but well 

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:06.579
 how good I leave you here is this rom so 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.589
