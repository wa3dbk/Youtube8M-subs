00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.650 
luxr so go with if it's a chicken like
so<00:03:37.220> then<00:03:37.400> use<00:03:37.550> old<00:03:37.790> chicken<00:03:38.060> stock<00:03:38.300> but<00:03:38.450> it's<00:03:38.600> a

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
so then use old chicken stock but it's a

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.180 
so then use old chicken stock but it's a
combination<00:03:39.170> so<00:03:39.320> it's<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.500> total<00:03:39.740> of<00:03:39.770> one<00:03:40.010> liter

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
combination so it's a total of one liter

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.300 
combination so it's a total of one liter
so<00:03:40.940> I'm<00:03:41.000> going<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.180> add<00:03:41.300> them<00:03:41.420> in<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:45.890> once<00:03:46.130> it

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
so I'm going to add them in so once it

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.710 
so I'm going to add them in so once it
starts<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.700> come<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:47.030> boil<00:03:47.240> you<00:03:47.450> can<00:03:47.480> actually

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
starts to come to boil you can actually

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.510 
starts to come to boil you can actually
add<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.200> coconut<00:03:48.380> cream<00:03:48.740> so<00:03:48.950> we'll<00:03:49.100> do<00:03:49.280> that

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.820 

now<00:03:52.520> this<00:03:52.760> variations<00:03:53.600> of<00:03:53.780> lotsa<00:03:54.350> so<00:03:54.590> that's

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
now this variations of lotsa so that's

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.000 
now this variations of lotsa so that's
like<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:56.620> health-conscious<00:03:57.620> latter

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
like the the health-conscious latter

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.550 
like the the health-conscious latter
which<00:03:58.400> everyone<00:03:58.850> uses<00:03:59.270> you<00:03:59.420> know<00:03:59.540> light<00:03:59.900> cream

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
which everyone uses you know light cream

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.470 
which everyone uses you know light cream
you<00:04:01.460> know<00:04:01.580> like<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:02.290> 70%<00:04:03.290> less<00:04:03.530> fat<00:04:03.610> yeah<00:04:04.610> like

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
you know like the 70% less fat yeah like

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.380 
you know like the 70% less fat yeah like
I<00:04:05.660> I<00:04:06.140> love<00:04:06.680> like<00:04:07.130> what's<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.550> point<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:08.090> having

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
I I love like what's the point of having

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.180 
I I love like what's the point of having
lotsa<00:04:09.020> when<00:04:09.320> it's<00:04:09.440> going<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.620> be<00:04:09.680> fat-free

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
lotsa when it's going to be fat-free

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.890 
lotsa when it's going to be fat-free
you're<00:04:10.790> not<00:04:10.910> going<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.090> eat<00:04:11.180> this<00:04:11.330> every<00:04:11.750> day

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
you're not going to eat this every day

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.690 
you're not going to eat this every day
unless<00:04:12.140> you're<00:04:12.410> in<00:04:12.530> Malaysia<00:04:12.800> trust<00:04:13.340> me<00:04:13.550> we

unless you're in Malaysia trust me we
eat<00:04:13.910> this<00:04:14.090> for<00:04:14.300> breakfast<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:17.720> we're<00:04:17.870> going<00:04:17.989> to

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
eat this for breakfast so we're going to

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.510 
eat this for breakfast so we're going to
bring<00:04:18.230> that<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.440> boil<00:04:18.739> as<00:04:18.890> well<00:04:19.070> and<00:04:19.250> then<00:04:19.340> once

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
bring that to boil as well and then once

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.070 
bring that to boil as well and then once
that<00:04:19.670> comes<00:04:19.850> to<00:04:20.030> boil<00:04:20.299> we'll<00:04:20.630> start<00:04:20.900> adding

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
that comes to boil we'll start adding

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.960 
that comes to boil we'll start adding
all<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.590> other<00:04:21.739> ingredients<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.460> prawns

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
all the other ingredients so the prawns

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.020 
all the other ingredients so the prawns
the<00:04:23.330> fish<00:04:23.570> balls<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.290> tofu<00:04:24.650> paths<00:04:24.920> but<00:04:25.520> now<00:04:25.730> is

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
the fish balls the tofu paths but now is

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.240 
the fish balls the tofu paths but now is
when<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.420> balancing<00:04:26.900> sort<00:04:27.140> of<00:04:27.200> starts<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:27.710> you

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
when the balancing sort of starts so you

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.680 
when the balancing sort of starts so you
want<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.520> taste<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:28.940> now<00:04:29.120> if<00:04:29.210> you<00:04:29.300> taste<00:04:29.570> it

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
want to taste it now if you taste it

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.350 
want to taste it now if you taste it
right<00:04:29.810> now<00:04:30.020> it's<00:04:30.200> going<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.470> be<00:04:30.560> fairly<00:04:31.360> it's

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
right now it's going to be fairly it's

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.120 
right now it's going to be fairly it's
going<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.660> be<00:04:32.720> fairly<00:04:32.840> creamy<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:33.710> it's<00:04:33.980> going

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
going to be fairly creamy and it's going

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.060 
going to be fairly creamy and it's going
to<00:04:34.190> be<00:04:34.280> fairly<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.760> know<00:04:34.790> kind<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.680> raw<00:04:36.680> so

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
to be fairly you know kind of raw so

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.500 
to be fairly you know kind of raw so
it's<00:04:37.190> not<00:04:37.280> ready<00:04:37.520> yet<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:38.090> is<00:04:38.240> when<00:04:38.420> you

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
it's not ready yet so this is when you

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.000 
it's not ready yet so this is when you
start<00:04:38.570> adding<00:04:38.990> little<00:04:39.350> bits<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.620> pieces<00:04:39.680> so

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
start adding little bits and pieces so

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.920 
start adding little bits and pieces so
you<00:04:40.100> add<00:04:40.280> by<00:04:40.520> splashing<00:04:41.180> a<00:04:41.300> couple<00:04:41.600> of<00:04:41.690> drops

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
you add by splashing a couple of drops

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.330 
you add by splashing a couple of drops
of<00:04:42.190> fish<00:04:43.190> sauce<00:04:44.230> when<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:45.260> couple<00:04:45.770> I<00:04:45.920> mean<00:04:46.100> you

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
of fish sauce when a couple I mean you

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.760 
of fish sauce when a couple I mean you
know<00:04:47.050> about<00:04:48.050> a<00:04:48.110> minute

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
know about a minute

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.580 
know about a minute
of<00:04:49.730> splashing<00:04:50.390> so<00:04:50.990> we<00:04:51.080> can<00:04:51.200> add<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.380> bit<00:04:51.530> of

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
of splashing so we can add a bit of

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.330 
of splashing so we can add a bit of
sugar<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.160> flavor<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.950> then<00:04:55.160> we're

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
sugar to flavor that and then we're

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.210 
sugar to flavor that and then we're
going<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.580> squeeze<00:04:55.970> some<00:04:56.030> lime<00:04:56.419> juice<00:04:56.480> in<00:04:57.220> just

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
going to squeeze some lime juice in just

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.720 
going to squeeze some lime juice in just
be<00:04:58.340> sitting<00:04:58.669> there

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
be sitting there

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
be sitting there
so<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.630> idea<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.170> you<00:05:02.350> want<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:04.330> find<00:05:04.600> a

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
so the idea is you want to find a

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.090 
so the idea is you want to find a
balance<00:05:05.140> so<00:05:05.680> when<00:05:05.830> you're<00:05:05.980> actually

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
balance so when you're actually

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.860 
balance so when you're actually
flavoring<00:05:06.850> you<00:05:06.970> kind<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.300> need<00:05:07.450> to<00:05:07.480> sort<00:05:07.720> of<00:05:07.780> go

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
flavoring you kind of need to sort of go

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.980 
flavoring you kind of need to sort of go
okay<00:05:08.260> that<00:05:08.820> needs<00:05:09.820> a<00:05:09.970> bit<00:05:10.150> more<00:05:10.180> fish<00:05:10.600> sauce<00:05:10.630> so

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
okay that needs a bit more fish sauce so

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.840 
okay that needs a bit more fish sauce so
that<00:05:11.020> needs<00:05:11.290> a<00:05:11.380> bit<00:05:11.470> more<00:05:11.530> salt<00:05:11.680> now<00:05:12.610> then

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
that needs a bit more salt now then

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.710 
that needs a bit more salt now then
we're<00:05:13.030> going<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.270> add<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.660> prawns<00:05:13.960> in<00:05:15.720> righto

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
we're going to add the prawns in righto

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.690 
we're going to add the prawns in righto
so<00:05:17.170> once<00:05:17.530> that's<00:05:17.770> in<00:05:17.980> we're<00:05:18.160> going<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.340> add<00:05:18.460> the

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
so once that's in we're going to add the

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.260 
so once that's in we're going to add the
balls<00:05:18.940> fish<00:05:19.840> balls<00:05:20.170> and<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:21.520> tofu<00:05:21.880> puffs<00:05:22.090> as

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
balls fish balls and the tofu puffs as

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.890 
balls fish balls and the tofu puffs as
well<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:24.490> we're<00:05:24.790> ready<00:05:24.940> to<00:05:25.060> play<00:05:25.360> it<00:05:25.480> up<00:05:25.600> that's

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
well so we're ready to play it up that's
