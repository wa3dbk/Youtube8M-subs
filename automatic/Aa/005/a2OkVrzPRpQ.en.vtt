you

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.020 

thinking<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.289> I<00:01:49.439> think<00:01:49.499> the<00:01:49.890> importance<00:01:50.789> of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
thinking of it I think the importance of

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.410 
thinking of it I think the importance of
time<00:01:51.350> learners<00:01:52.350> taking<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.829> whole<00:01:53.149> series<00:01:54.149> of

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
time learners taking a whole series of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.749 
time learners taking a whole series of
photographs<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.429> selection

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
photographs and this is just a selection

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.859 
photographs and this is just a selection
of<00:01:57.270> them<00:01:57.600> are<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.560> instead<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.869> hundred

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
of them are the instead of a hundred

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.199 
of them are the instead of a hundred
photographs<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.280> they<00:02:02.459> were<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.999> his

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
photographs and they were of his

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.440 
photographs and they were of his
daughter<00:02:03.569> from<00:02:04.380> her<00:02:05.039> birth<00:02:05.310> could<00:02:05.789> cut<00:02:06.030> until

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
daughter from her birth could cut until

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.589 
daughter from her birth could cut until
she<00:02:06.689> was<00:02:06.840> 18<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.849> just<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.239> selection

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599

she was 18 and this is just a selection
of<00:02:09.899> those<00:02:10.110> photographs<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.430> idea

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
of those photographs but it is this idea

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.240 
of those photographs but it is this idea
of<00:02:11.910> again<00:02:12.599> time<00:02:12.989> passing<00:02:13.530> somebody<00:02:13.980> growing

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
of again time passing somebody growing

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.509 
of again time passing somebody growing
up<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:15.150> sense<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.989> time<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:16.650> as<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.160> look<00:02:17.370> at

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
up and sense of time but as you look at

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.190 
up and sense of time but as you look at
them<00:02:17.760> they<00:02:17.910> could<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.299> have<00:02:18.480> been<00:02:18.660> taken

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
them they could have all have been taken

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.550 
them they could have all have been taken
on<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.860> same<00:02:20.040> day<00:02:20.099> in<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.670> way<00:02:20.879> they<00:02:21.239> don't<00:02:21.560> even

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
on the same day in a way they don't even

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.759 
on the same day in a way they don't even
though<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.950> child<00:02:23.489> has<00:02:23.670> got<00:02:23.849> older<00:02:24.329> that<00:02:24.510> they

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
though the child has got older that they

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.699 
though the child has got older that they
have<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.799> similar<00:02:26.519> sense<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.239> them<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.840> again

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
have a similar sense to them and again

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.500 
have a similar sense to them and again
there's<00:02:28.920> lots<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:30.030> know<00:02:30.150> obviously

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
there's lots of you know obviously

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.140 
there's lots of you know obviously
places<00:02:31.049> like<00:02:31.230> Delhi<00:02:31.650> where<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.310> Buddha<00:02:32.700> came

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
places like Delhi where the Buddha came

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.630 
places like Delhi where the Buddha came
from<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.709> then<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.459> lovely

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
from and so on and then this lovely

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.240 
from and so on and then this lovely
series<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.019> daughter<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.620> front<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
series of the daughter in front of the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.240 
series of the daughter in front of the
artwork<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.910> think<00:02:39.120> which<00:02:39.739> with<00:02:40.739> these<00:02:40.920> works

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
artwork I think which with these works

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.619 
artwork I think which with these works
that<00:02:41.519> are<00:02:41.910> taken<00:02:42.450> from<00:02:42.629> Pollock<00:02:44.629> again

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
that are taken from Pollock again

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.309 
that are taken from Pollock again
showing<00:02:45.989> us<00:02:46.200> how<00:02:46.730> it's<00:02:47.730> it's<00:02:48.629> all<00:02:48.810> about<00:02:48.989> art

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
showing us how it's it's all about art

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.160 
showing us how it's it's all about art
and<00:02:49.680> as<00:02:49.980> well<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.370> about<00:02:50.609> life<00:02:50.849> so<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.900> sense

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
and as well as about life so the sense

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.990 
and as well as about life so the sense
of<00:02:52.260> these<00:02:52.410> doors<00:02:52.680> over<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.250> artwork<00:02:53.639> just

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
of these doors over the artwork just

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.009 
of these doors over the artwork just
sort<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.359> takes<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:54.870> back<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.920> background

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
sort of takes it back in the background

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.000 
sort of takes it back in the background
so

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
so

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.610 
so
it's<00:02:59.670> really<00:03:00.480> interesting<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:01.080> me<00:03:01.230> with<00:03:01.379> Dan's

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
