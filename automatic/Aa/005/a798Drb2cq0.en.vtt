00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.060
 what's up my friends from youtube 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.220
 I bring you four games that they tried 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.440
 mimic the style of mortal kombat but 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.120
 failed if there are more games that I did not put 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.930
 in the video you can leave it in the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.690
 comments 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.030
 let's start the first game is eternal 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.980
 champions for sega saturn the only 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.570
 strength that had the game is 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.030
 that had no flaws with the gameplay 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.280
 what was terrible about the game this 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.890
 has an exaggerated loading time and what 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.080
 important the fatalities in the way 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.879
 more educated that I can say is that no 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.190
 they are striking, none of them are going to 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.800
 surprise in a few words are not so 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.810
 bloody nor violent in my opinion 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.850
 I do not recommend them but if you do not 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.210
 you want to listen and you want to try it 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.000
 well forward 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.430
 the second game I think is the most 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.799
 known kasumi ninja to tie the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.320
 jaguar in what we would most notice in the 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.659
 game is that it's similar graphics 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.330
 I mean the characters look like 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.790
 real people but we know what the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.920
 command form of atari jaguar very 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.740
 uncomfortable and so they wanted their 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.409
 Gameplay is complex just as it is 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.750
 difficult to do fatalities what is 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.180
 very bad without anything advisable or for 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.580
 emulate it is that your voice performances 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.520
 they are very bad including that of the narrator 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.350
 the characters nothing attractive nor for 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.539
 not remember their names and 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.960
 soundtracks are worse than archena and in 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.960
 alive 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.369
 the third game times later for pc for 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.679
 me is the worst game on this list would be 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.170
 one of the most striking gore games 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.780
 for the pc he wanted his ways 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.940
 bloody are more explicit than the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.340
 mortal kombat but as they just wanted 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.530
 doing that would make the graphics the 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.200
 game are the worst so your 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.840
 violence would not be so showy so many 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.000
 they say that all pc games have 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.160
 better graphics then here the 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.590
 characters look as if they were facts 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.450
 in paint but reluctantly so it's 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.110
 another game attempt for evil 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.110
 tried 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.849
 and the fourth game wey this neighborhood in the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.040
 democracy that this could win 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.170
 mortal kombat but in its final version 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.360
 he changed the graphics his soundtrack 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.819
 his difficulty would be stupidly 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.680
 excessive the characters look like 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.930
 evil horror movie characters 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.940
 It was better to say that they looked like suits 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.800
 halloween but this one of the games that 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.959
 we have spoken they say that this is a 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.030
 wrong copy of mortal kombat if the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.160
 game was well worked as it looked 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.590
 in the demo they decided to make it worse 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.569
 in every aspect and you will know that this game 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.569
 It is a laughingstock for lovers of 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.160
 gore this was all I hope you have 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.160
 liked bai and see you next time
