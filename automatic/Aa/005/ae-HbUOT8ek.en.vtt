00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.880
 and we came to another version of 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.309
 football simulator 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.769
 planet and this time the game for several 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.839
 improvements in all aspects 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.760
 so we created a topic to stay 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.390
 easier to understand everything that is 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.520
 come over 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.760
 let's talk about the emotions of this version 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.289
 the game players are more 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.019
 certain moments of the match 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.510
 and your players will react in ways 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.160
 different according to the result of the match 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.649
 for example your team is losing you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.719
 will easily realize the despair in the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.329
 look of your players and if the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.719
 victory had some smiles and more 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.649
 Smiles I'll take the lawn on the side of the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.320
 your team 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.550
 another thing is the intelligence you already 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.950
 must have cursed much of his 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.050
 players when for no reason they 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.750
 resolve to overthrow their opponents and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.489
 end up being expelled in relation to this 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.960
 We can rest easy with a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.109
 new artificial intelligence 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.410
 players will only make some decisions 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.960
 alone 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.170
 then something else is the most 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.830
 living now 3d will really support your 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.659
 team 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.970
 if the team is winning the fans will 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.920
 act differently than when your 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.110
 team is losing but will never leave 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.939
 to support your team will only 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.700
 be surprised if the crowd simply 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.070
 shut up before the defeat of good lawns 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.650
 now will also be involved with 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 all this evolution and pieces of grass 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.380
 They will fly on each chute carts and even 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.659
 the water pools will interfere with the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.210
 plays and the good graphic that for sure 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.880
 is the best part of the game with graphics 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.310
 worthy of the new generation players all 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.070
 fully refurbished and much more 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.299
 beautiful inside the possible is has player 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.070
 that does not look good 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.860
 goalkeepers are smarter than 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.259
 It's never a new sports video 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.600
 shown in games with 2014 showed the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.909
 that the company has prepared for the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.770
 shirt or virtual soccer 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.049
 beyond the most intelligent positioning 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.049
 the goalkeepers will still have a series of 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.540
 new animations speak of physics in the ball 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.550
 then virtual athletes will have to 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.730
 adapt their movements according to the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.000
 situation where're the ball as it 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.790
 will have more variety 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.030
 passes dribbling and shots on goal the such 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.640
 fifa has world-wide launch on the 23rd of 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:27.010
 September 2014 for the record there look only the 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.060
 3ds and if you need 3 need the room and 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.240
 closed vita wii xbox 360 and xbox one
