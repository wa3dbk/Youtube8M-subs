00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.849
 hello to all of all it's the enemy and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.230
 today we do not find ourselves in 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.759
 know a little bit about history and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.859
 so the epic of the grand theft series 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.289
 self in ten key dates and a few 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.270
 anecdotes so started in 1988 when 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.710
 the creation of the studio dma design that is 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.509
 at the origin of the first episode of the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.189
 gta series after several games created at 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.809
 their assets they knew a pretty big 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.670
 success with their game crime mix in the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.680
 90s it will nevertheless be necessary to wait 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.510
 more than nine years old as the first gran 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.670
 theft auto in france and robbery 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.379
 of good cars we are rock everything from 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.899
 later it's less classy finally come out 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.730
 so it's in 1997 more precisely in 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.590
 october as the first pixels of the game 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.239
 we were starting to be alive when we 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.220
 could see it we are still pretty 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.290
 away from today's gta with a game in 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.290
 2d in top view and with a band 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.970
 its pretty rudimentary better late 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.640
 than ever how 10,1 in 20 exits 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.339
 extensions london 1969 gives 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 1961 for gta first of the name rockstar 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.759
 games is finally founded by both 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.960
 brothers sam and dan hauser and that's 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.670
 by the way they who edited his 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.079
 extensions so far not much to 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.750
 to say but it will come with the arrival of 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.420
 gta of November 2, 1999 who will do 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.549
 pass the game from the 2d to the 2.5 for 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.530
 information at 2.5 17 halfway between 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.689
 3d and 2d as we could see 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.369
 right now but also you have to know 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.170
 that this is the only episode of the series in 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.639
 his story that lies in the future 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.319
 near 2013 by the way to be more 

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.979
 accurate is fourteen years after the exit 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.749
 of his game 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.920
 and yes all gt1 if you notice it 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.869
 well have a story going on at 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.219
 the year of their release see in the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.560
 passed as for the extensions of 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.029
 london never again have no gta had 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 the story set in future 

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.759
 by the way in gta of themselves the city 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.619
 in which the story goes 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.579
 did not have a short name it will take 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.079
 waiting a little longer 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.719
 two years later to be able to 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.700
 finally see appears from the 3d in gta and 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.829
 so everything changes so this is the 22 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.139
 october 2001 that gta know big 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.669
 change with green tech auto iii the 

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:01.079
 passage of the 3d brings then there 

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:03.179
 a lot for the news series 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.099
 gameplay possibilities a game a lot 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.779
 more beautiful a more open world of 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.880
 new weapons new vehicles and 

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:10.890
 finally the first air vehicle there 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.390
 is the sleep yes you know him 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.340
 well it's since reappeared in 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.480
 many other gta and in the last 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.440
 besides in the form of hydra 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.060
 but before seeing the first 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.920
 helicopter it will have to wait for a 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.360
 little for the little anecdote a lot 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.950
 items of the day have been removed as 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.209
 missions or even the colors of 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.950
 police vehicles following 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.500
 attacks that occurred a few days before 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.150
 the release of the game on September 11, 2001 and 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.519
 so to avoid any controversy the game 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.049
 was delayed and corrected now 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.489
 remember at the beginning of the video there is 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.650
 few seconds I told you about 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.569
 the creation of the studio dma design and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.280
 that of rockstar games and that's where 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.650
 gta will take a decisive turn 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.750
 it's in 1999 that rockstar 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.940
 games are elected buying dozens 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.250
 change the name in 2002 for rockstar 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.900
 let us lead vice city lives day 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.680
 some time later developed by 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.109
 rockstar 9 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.640
 but why dwell on this gt in 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.500
 particular will you ask me well 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.299
 simply because it's the first gta 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.940
 to introduce the motorbikes the holy grail 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.989
 stunters but also helicopters 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.599
 as you can see 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.859
 we really start having gta 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.260
 as we know it today 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.090
 but beware his epic is far away 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.170
 to be finished we end up 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.879
 now in 2000 she more 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.799
 precisely on October 24 for the exit 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.329
 of one of the greatest successes of gta I 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.560
 obviously talking about grand theft 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.030
 self san andreas 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.709
 many of them are going to know 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.269
 the series with this episode 6 because everything 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.069
 it's simply the best-selling game of 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.440
 ps2 at that time it was also the 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.359
 first biggest hit of the saga at this 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.859
 success is also added in this sense 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.349
 tenderness the mythical and legendary 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.910
 jetpack coveted sought by 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.530
 today's 5 gta players 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.060
 and finally we find ourselves facing 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.180
 also to the largest open worlds 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.500
 created at the time third bourget brief of 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.150
 game had both well except 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.280
 maybe its visual quality since 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.959
 the gta are still not buying 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.180
 at this time to resell and gta 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.519
 in HD it will be necessary to wait for the release on the 29th 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.220
 April 2008 of its fourth installment be 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.489
 gta iv to have some and we come 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.739
 finally the output of the famous GTA5 the 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.200
 young gtr release in 2013 more 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.209
 precisely on September 17, 2013 this gta 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.129
 tries to innovate by its side already 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.180
 history with for the first time the 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.459
 possibility to play several 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.650
 characters related to the same story and 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.290
 of the lot by its multiplayer with of course 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.940
 I was online 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.049
 it's worth innovation it does not stop there 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.789
 apart from all small 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.380
 novelties at the level of fauna and 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.840
 the flora the weapons the vehicles and 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.669
 other sealed November 18 , 2014 only for 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.520
 the first time a gta happens in sight 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.960
 in the first person a real fps 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.370
 it is obviously thanks to the passage 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.840
 on the next-gen consoles that this 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.639
 can unfortunately produce for 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.840
 other versions old gen the view to the 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.000
 first person is still not 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.139
 available and never will be and that's 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.520
 as well as we arrive on time 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.990
 of today and I do not have any more 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.570
 only one thing and ask you now 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.639
 according to you do gta dolls 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.759
 is finished or will it continue to 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.759
 more beautiful 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:00.580
 2 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:05:03.519
 which allows the little ones to cover the 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.959
 territory pat also called taboos 

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:06.999
 breaks the balls of six children too 

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:09.330
 cute that the fox want to rape to 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:09.330
 Christmas
