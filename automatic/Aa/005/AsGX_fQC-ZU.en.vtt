earth of toxic electricity now here to

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.790 
earth of toxic electricity now here to
test<00:00:06.299> some<00:00:06.899> light<00:00:07.319> bulbs<00:00:07.529> with<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.910> standard

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
test some light bulbs with a standard

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.070 
test some light bulbs with a standard
radar<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.070> laser<00:00:11.639> detector<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.870> you'll

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
radar and laser detector that you'll

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.150 
radar and laser detector that you'll
find<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.920> car<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.089> an<00:00:15.330> all<00:00:15.480> band

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
find in a car and this is an all band

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.880 
find in a car and this is an all band
laser<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.609> radar<00:00:17.760> detector<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.869> we're<00:00:19.740> going

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
laser and radar detector and we're going

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.640 
laser and radar detector and we're going
to<00:00:20.010> start<00:00:20.670> with<00:00:21.090> our<00:00:21.150> first<00:00:21.960> light<00:00:22.289> bulb<00:00:22.500> which

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
to start with our first light bulb which

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.099 
to start with our first light bulb which
is<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.920> conventional<00:00:23.220> filament<00:00:24.000> label<00:00:24.359> so

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
is the conventional filament label so

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.500 
is the conventional filament label so
let's<00:00:25.260> see<00:00:25.470> what<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.769> does<00:00:28.580> so<00:00:29.580> Restless

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
let's see what this one does so Restless

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.179 
let's see what this one does so Restless
not<00:00:30.810> again<00:00:30.990> getting<00:00:31.619> anything<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.130> this

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
not again getting anything with this

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
not again getting anything with this
light<00:00:32.399> bulb<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.020> let's<00:00:34.020> move<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.350> our<00:00:34.500> next

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
light bulb so let's move on to our next

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.860 
light bulb so let's move on to our next
one<00:00:36.260> so<00:00:37.260> next<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.000> standard<00:00:39.000> compact

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
one so next is the standard compact

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.470 
one so next is the standard compact
fluorescent<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.010> curly<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.489> AC<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
fluorescent the curly one AC on the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.430 
fluorescent the curly one AC on the
shops<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.809> activated<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
shops so we can see it's activated the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.500 
shops so we can see it's activated the
laser<00:00:49.620> function<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.579> there's<00:00:50.879> something

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
laser function so there's something

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.139 
laser function so there's something
about<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.170> frequency<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> light<00:00:52.770> that

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
about the frequency of light that

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.080 
about the frequency of light that
conservatives<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.949> the<00:00:55.949> same<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.550> what

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
conservatives that is the same as what

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.619 
conservatives that is the same as what
this<00:00:57.300> laser<00:00:57.780> detector<00:00:58.649> detects<00:01:02.270> let's<00:01:03.270> test

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
this laser detector detects let's test

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.820 
this laser detector detects let's test
another<00:01:04.379> compact<00:01:05.280> fluorescent<00:01:06.090> light<00:01:06.830> so

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
another compact fluorescent light so

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.830 
another compact fluorescent light so
this<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.100> slightly<00:01:08.460> larger<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> this

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
this is a slightly larger one so this

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.780 
this is a slightly larger one so this
one<00:01:16.020> does<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> too<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:19.250> notice<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.430> when<00:01:20.670> they

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
one does it too I notice that when they

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
one does it too I notice that when they
warm<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.960> trigger<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.680> function

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
warm up they can trigger the function

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.120 
warm up they can trigger the function
indefinitely<00:01:24.080> so<00:01:25.080> there's<00:01:25.350> something<00:01:25.830> about

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
indefinitely so there's something about

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.780 
indefinitely so there's something about
the<00:01:26.430> light<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.950> that<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the light can I get it is that is the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.850 
the light can I get it is that is the
same<00:01:30.060> wavelength<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.770> police<00:01:32.329> laser<00:01:33.329> guns

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.280 

so<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.280> one<00:01:38.490> does<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.790> turn<00:01:42.290> so

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so you see this one does it turn so

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.499 
so you see this one does it turn so
something<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.770> worried<00:01:43.979> or<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.700> compact

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
something to be worried or with compact

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
something to be worried or with compact
fluorescent<00:01:46.439> lights<00:01:46.680> was<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.310> do

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
fluorescent lights was that they do

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.899 
fluorescent lights was that they do
actually<00:01:47.600> give<00:01:48.600> out<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.680> same<00:01:49.950> wavelength<00:01:50.729> as

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
actually give out the same wavelength as

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.590 
actually give out the same wavelength as
police<00:01:51.860> laser<00:01:52.860> guns<00:01:53.189> since<00:01:53.970> our<00:01:54.149> final

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
police laser guns since our final

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.010 
police laser guns since our final
hypothesis<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.619> LED<00:01:56.369> light<00:01:57.299> bulb<00:01:57.509> let's<00:01:57.840> see

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
hypothesis a LED light bulb let's see

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.910 
hypothesis a LED light bulb let's see
what<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.320> does

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.410 

so<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:02.980> can<00:02:03.100> see<00:02:03.220> though<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.490> has<00:02:04.060> no

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
so you can see though this has no

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.040 
so you can see though this has no
reaction<00:02:04.990> with<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.160> detector<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.960> was

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
reaction with the detector and that was

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.650 
reaction with the detector and that was
our<00:02:08.140> final<00:02:08.410> one<00:02:09.040> bulb<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.550> hope<00:02:10.210> you<00:02:10.390> enjoyed

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
our final one bulb I hope you enjoyed

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.530 
our final one bulb I hope you enjoyed
this<00:02:10.810> presentation<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.980> I<00:02:12.820> wish<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
this presentation and I wish you the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.640 
this presentation and I wish you the
