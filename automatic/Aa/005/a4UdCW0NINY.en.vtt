really<00:00:36.860> up<00:00:36.920> to<00:00:37.070> you<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:37.520> what<00:00:38.210> we're<00:00:38.329> going<00:00:38.420> to

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
really up to you so what we're going to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.280 
really up to you so what we're going to
do<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:38.719> we're<00:00:38.840> going<00:00:38.930> to<00:00:39.020> have<00:00:39.140> them

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
do is we're going to have them

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.020 
do is we're going to have them
directional<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.160> we're<00:00:40.370> going<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.579> position

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
directional and we're going to position

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.750 
directional and we're going to position
them<00:00:41.210> center<00:00:41.899> of<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.110> drum<00:00:42.230> kit<00:00:42.559> but<00:00:43.190> facing

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
them center of the drum kit but facing

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.150 
them center of the drum kit but facing
outwards<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.290> hopefully<00:00:45.620> that<00:00:45.770> she<00:00:45.890> gives<00:00:46.010> a

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
outwards the hopefully that she gives a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.069 
outwards the hopefully that she gives a
nice<00:00:46.280> consistent<00:00:47.180> stereo<00:00:47.600> in<00:00:47.750> which<00:00:47.899> one

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
nice consistent stereo in which one

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.130 
nice consistent stereo in which one
we're<00:00:48.230> talking<00:00:48.260> left<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:48.890> right<00:00:49.039> but<00:00:49.219> wrong

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
we're talking left and right but wrong

00:00:50.140 --> 00:01:29.490 
we're talking left and right but wrong
right

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.340 

but<00:01:30.130> again<00:01:31.090> one<00:01:31.540> of<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.690> things<00:01:31.870> you<00:01:31.990> have<00:01:32.020> to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
but again one of the things you have to

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.050 
but again one of the things you have to
remember<00:01:32.380> about<00:01:32.860> these<00:01:33.070> two<00:01:33.280> mics<00:01:33.550> is<00:01:33.730> to<00:01:33.850> get

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
remember about these two mics is to get

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.400 
remember about these two mics is to get
them<00:01:34.240> as<00:01:34.390> close<00:01:34.450> together<00:01:34.990> as<00:01:35.260> possible

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
them as close together as possible

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.680 
them as close together as possible
without<00:01:35.920> touching<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:36.940> obviously<00:01:37.270> make<00:01:37.510> sure

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
to mix because what is currently my

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.310 
to mix because what is currently my
overhead<00:02:09.160> left<00:02:09.429> is<00:02:10.030> not<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.720> overhead<00:02:11.080> left

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
overhead left is not the overhead left

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.310 
overhead left is not the overhead left
in<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> control<00:02:12.040> room<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:13.540> similarly<00:02:14.110> if

in the control room and similarly if
someone's<00:02:14.590> used<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.920> mixing<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.430> drums<00:02:15.640> from

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
someone's used to mixing the drums from

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.930 
someone's used to mixing the drums from
a<00:02:15.940> stage<00:02:16.180> perspective<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.580> looking<00:02:18.580> at<00:02:18.730> the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
a stage perspective I looking at the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.550 
a stage perspective I looking at the
drummer<00:02:19.239> as<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.660> drumming<00:02:20.050> they're<00:02:20.380> not

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
drummer as the drumming they're not

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.920 
drummer as the drumming they're not
going<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.920> know<00:02:21.130> that<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.880> recorded<00:02:22.239> it<00:02:22.570> from

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
going to know that you recorded it from

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.920 
going to know that you recorded it from
a<00:02:23.260> drummer's<00:02:24.070> perspective<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.420> best<00:02:25.630> way

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
a drummer's perspective so the best way

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.010 
a drummer's perspective so the best way
to<00:02:26.820> label<00:02:27.820> these<00:02:28.120> things<00:02:28.420> is<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.840> obviously

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
to label these things is to obviously

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.160 
to label these things is to obviously
call<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.590> one<00:02:29.830> here<00:02:30.239> overhead<00:02:31.239> crash<00:02:31.959> and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
call this one here overhead crash and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.880 
call this one here overhead crash and

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.179 

right<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.219> that's<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:30.590> join<00:03:31.590> me<00:03:31.799> on<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.010> other

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
right and that's it join me on the other

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.069 
right and that's it join me on the other
side<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.609> glass<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:33.209> little<00:03:33.540> bit<00:03:33.629> later<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
side of the glass a little bit later and

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.839 
side of the glass a little bit later and
what<00:03:34.260> we'll<00:03:34.409> do<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.769> basically<00:03:35.280> see<00:03:35.640> how<00:03:35.700> this

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
what we'll do is basically see how this

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.220 
what we'll do is basically see how this
drunkard<00:03:36.209> sounds<00:03:36.569> might<00:03:36.750> look<00:03:36.900> like<00:03:36.959> this

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
drunkard sounds might look like this

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.349 
drunkard sounds might look like this
don't<00:03:37.920> forget<00:03:38.189> that<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.519> isn't<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.180> be-all

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
don't forget that this isn't the be-all
