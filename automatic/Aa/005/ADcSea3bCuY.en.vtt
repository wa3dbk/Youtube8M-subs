00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
really seems to be more of a brotherhood

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.570

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
we saw in guro really interacting with

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.910 
we saw in guro really interacting with
Berto<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:11.070> Khan<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.790> andre<00:00:12.660> ward<00:00:12.870> who's<00:00:13.500> he

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
Berto and Khan and andre ward who's he

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.890 
Berto and Khan and andre ward who's he
the<00:00:14.040> most<00:00:14.250> closest<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.179> think<00:00:15.450> out<00:00:15.719> of

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
the most closest to do you think out of

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.599 
the most closest to do you think out of
that<00:00:15.990> whole<00:00:16.199> group<00:00:16.440> who<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:16.920> he<00:00:17.130> bonded<00:00:17.580> with

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
that whole group who is he bonded with

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.880 
that whole group who is he bonded with
the<00:00:17.730> most<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:23.869> bond<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.380> think<00:00:25.680> he's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the most in bond and I think he's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.290 
the most in bond and I think he's
genuine

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
genuine

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.580 
genuine
enough<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.910> recognize<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.210> equality<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
enough to recognize the equality and the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.220 
enough to recognize the equality and the
importance<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.369> each<00:00:32.610> one<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> don't<00:00:34.050> think

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
importance of each one so I don't think

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.020 
importance of each one so I don't think
there's<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.530> pecking<00:00:34.770> order<00:00:34.949> this<00:00:35.430> bonding

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there's a pecking order this bonding

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.780 
there's a pecking order this bonding
process<00:00:36.270> at<00:00:36.809> all<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.320> think<00:00:38.040> everything<00:00:38.519> is<00:00:38.640> on

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
process at all I think everything is on

outside<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.720> box

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
outside the box

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.050 
outside the box
you<00:01:07.509> know<00:01:07.600> young<00:01:07.869> men<00:01:08.140> tend<00:01:08.499> to<00:01:08.619> identify

you know young men tend to identify
mature<00:01:11.659> man<00:01:11.990> like<00:01:12.229> myself<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.979> somebody

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.350 

gravitate<00:01:17.040> towards<00:01:17.550> when<00:01:17.760> it<00:01:17.850> comes<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
gravitate towards when it comes to

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.680 
gravitate towards when it comes to
issues<00:01:18.920> outside<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.400> box<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.480> that

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
issues outside of box and I think that

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.500 
issues outside of box and I think that
he<00:01:22.130> scents<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
he scents that

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.070 
he scents that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
test those waters and feel I can receive

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.870 
test those waters and feel I can receive
sound<00:01:28.440> eyes<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.630> understood<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.170> some

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
sound eyes and understood there be some

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.160 
sound eyes and understood there be some
problems<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.150> are<00:01:33.360> facing<00:01:33.570> down<00:01:34.290> today

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
problems that are facing down today

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.500 
problems that are facing down today
that<00:01:36.530> I've<00:01:36.680> been<00:01:36.979> to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.050 

navigate<00:01:41.170> those<00:01:41.410> waters<00:01:41.470> I<00:01:42.220> think<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.760> it

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
navigate those waters I think that it

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.150 
navigate those waters I think that it
started<00:01:43.570> from<00:01:43.720> there<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.380> confidence

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160
