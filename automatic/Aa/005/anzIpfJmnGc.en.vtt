00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello how about prize friends on channel 3 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.720
 I do not expect that well enough and well 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.129
 today I bring you the boxing of 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.110
 this group that is the living and good model 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:18.550
 maybe they are asking why not 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.289
 this time, it's because the 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.840
 today I'm trying I'm recording 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.439
 in 4k then if you have a screen of 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.680
 4 here then go to put him here in 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.349
 youtube that can see it in 4k 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.559
 so that they take advantage of the quality we do not 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.129
 I'm testing then well this is it 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.510
 is the goal and vo as I said and here 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.510
 next says 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.340
 who has 2 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.880
 positions you could say is against 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:55.720
 water float is transparent from above 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.720
 of this part and says it's against 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.839
 action ok 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.320
 he says he includes a 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:07.040
 little screw of these those that go here 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.040
 for 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.100
 fix the go pro brings one of those but from 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.480
 high torque or know that they have as a 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.550
 different handle leave it in focus in a 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.120
 different handle so you can 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.050
 tighten it more and have a connection 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.010
 go pro direct the body is 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.960
 transparent and good can be done 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.100
 up to here as you can lengthen the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.550
 double 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:41.120
 It has a compartment for 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:45.010
 the remote control of the go pro and also 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.470
 has the grip of here supposed to be very 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:53.680
 forward to your hand and well nothing else 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.680
 that here a photo of the stick itself 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.910
 you say it includes a 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.910
 and you to the stick 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.510
 Dr. screw the band is 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.679
 so you do not drop it you put it here 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.810
 Y 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.540
 the clip for the remote control that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.780
 I want it to be then let's open it 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.780
 one 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.140
 they are the scissors of a pollero 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.030
 I do not want to break anything 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.069
 they do all this to us 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.489
 leave it behind to the side 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.439
 and well here is the bandita this 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.000
 I told them that they are not dropped it 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:00.020
 put in the common arm 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.620
 fixator here 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:08.240
 and says go pool in green is very father 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.180
 the truth and it gets stuck like with an enter 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.880
 or with a tripod entrance that also 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.370
 have down I forgot to say this is 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.700
 the thing that is fixed here on the stick for 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.470
 The remote control of the go pro 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.470
 and here is the stick 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:37.099
 and that stick then 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.099
 Well, here is the group and here he is 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.270
 the high torque screw 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.210
 I'll see 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.210
 remove it I will bring the go pro from here 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.519
 I will try to put it to see what happens 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.430
 I'm going to arrange it like that so that it's my 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.430
 i 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.540
 so it's my way so it's going to 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:12.180
 put very nice so mail 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.180
 and well it was like that 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.530
 happens I do not know if they gave an account but this 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:29.100
 been this is like the original 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.770
 the original screw ok and this is the 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.280
 the high torque as you can see has 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.000
 like another type of hip to squeeze 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.430
 plus 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.050
 I have no idea is louis or not like that if 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.300
 then it feels like you can squeeze it 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.940
 plus 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.560
 and well it's left to open it more 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.560
 they have to give it as a spin 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.060
 that 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:59.470
 this is for if you get the most ok 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.470
 they give it like a spin like that 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.440
 it comes out and this thing goes down to fix it 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.460
 again 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:15.289
 and with that would be 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:18.580
 all this coupon and the d 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.580
 the remote control 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.240
 A) Yes 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.699
 and so 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.050
 and then there they put the remote control of 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.050
 you can download it a little more 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.260
 and then nothing else 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:40.160
 this is jammed down here jasper is that 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.160
 no longer fits in the grave 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.960
 the quality 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.340
 and so it is and down here you can not see 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:56.050
 has the triple entry but nothing 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.050
 more is Cordoba for me 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:19.140
 and once ready 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.850
 we have our group set up and so 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:25.230
 well I hope you liked this video
