00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.840
 Liberian but white as snow a 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.860
 killer by nature even from 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.360

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.320
 and that we had our own 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.750
 civil war in the 90s you see 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.890

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.880
 to the murderers of my family there was 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.799
 when I realized that it also came out 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.799
 a killer and very good 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.060
 afghanistan I found my vocation very 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.090
 proud of it true 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.670
 What happened happened 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.050
 To be honest, I thought it was pretty 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.450
 pretty 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.950
 my enemies fell like dominoes 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.729
 After another 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.789
 I never felt threatened I was at 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.939
 drift without a challenge without a purpose to 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.310
 sometimes I envied my victims at least 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.950
 they had a cause why 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.950
 and then I met him 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.280
 To who 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.400
 and I knew what I had missed 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.580
 his ideals that gave meaning to my life 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.200
 ideals 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.860
 jacques which are yours I protect 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.860
 to the weak 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.500
 remains 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.440
 very naive 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.680
 and if I must kill to protect them that way 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.680
 be 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.480
 it seems that we have less in common than 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.879
 what I thought I'll take it as a compliment 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.190
 if you are willing to kill for your 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.909
 ideals you will also be ready to die 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.909
 for them 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.780
