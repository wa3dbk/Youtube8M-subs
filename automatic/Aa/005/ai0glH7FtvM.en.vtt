00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
I take and I know it speeded up and but

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.400 
I take and I know it speeded up and but
if<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.580> do<00:00:15.179> want<00:00:15.420> more<00:00:15.599> in-depth<00:00:15.990> detailed

if you do want more in-depth detailed

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.540 
if you do want more in-depth detailed
best<00:00:16.650> thing<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.830> do<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.160> check<00:00:17.340> out<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
best thing to do is check out the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.980 
best thing to do is check out the
propagator<00:00:18.119> which<00:00:18.270> I'll<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.660> link<00:00:18.750> in

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
propagator which I'll have a link in

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.810 
propagator which I'll have a link in
description<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.500> well<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:19.920> screen<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.699> go

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
description as well as on screen so go

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.970 
description as well as on screen so go
check<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.529> reason<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:22.949> doing

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
check that out and the reason I'm doing

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.800 
check that out and the reason I'm doing
this<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.550> sort<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.029> clean<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.390> some<00:00:24.600> stuff

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
this is to sort of clean up some stuff

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.640 
this is to sort of clean up some stuff
as<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.869> what<00:00:27.869> will<00:00:27.990> happened<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> Easter

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
what I'm struggling to understand is how

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.010 
what I'm struggling to understand is how
I<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.649> get<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> achievement<00:00:38.570> but<00:00:39.570> still<00:00:39.870> do

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
I can get the achievement but still do

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.630 
I can get the achievement but still do
the<00:00:40.110> Easter<00:00:40.260> Egg<00:00:40.469> wrong<00:00:40.649> if<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.309> know<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> mean

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the Easter Egg wrong if you know I mean

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.639 
the Easter Egg wrong if you know I mean
and<00:00:41.850> yes<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.050> step<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.469> Buddha

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and yes I know this step in the Buddha

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.080 
and yes I know this step in the Buddha
when<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> shot<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> Buddhist<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.850> not

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
when I shot the Buddhist was not

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.810 
when I shot the Buddhist was not
necessarily<00:00:45.780> needed<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.200> shoot<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> Buddhas

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
necessarily needed to shoot the Buddhas

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.190 
necessarily needed to shoot the Buddhas
but<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.059> worked<00:00:48.420> that's<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.870> point

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
but it worked that's the point

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.979 
but it worked that's the point
I<00:00:49.289> am<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.940> correct<00:00:51.239> step<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.570> need<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.840> shoot

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
I am the correct step is need to shoot

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.479 
I am the correct step is need to shoot
something<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.469> or<00:00:52.620> anything<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> room

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
something it or anything in the room

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.950 
something it or anything in the room
with<00:00:53.640> backlash<00:00:54.059> butter<00:00:54.329> knife<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:54.690> whether<00:00:54.840> it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
with backlash butter knife so whether it

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.410 
with backlash butter knife so whether it
be<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> wall<00:00:55.410> pillars<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.699> Buddha's<00:00:57.090> it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
be the wall pillars the Buddha's it

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.770 
be the wall pillars the Buddha's it
works<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.730> my<00:00:59.730> step<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.180> correct<00:01:00.480> my

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
works so my step was correct my

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
works so my step was correct my
explanation<00:01:01.410> was<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> bit<00:01:01.920> off<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> tip

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
explanation was a bit off but the tip

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.060 
explanation was a bit off but the tip
the<00:01:03.000> step<00:01:03.239> works<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:03.899> mainly<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.860> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
the step works so that's mainly what you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.640 
the step works so that's mainly what you
take<00:01:05.250> from<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.640> stet<00:01:05.880> works<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:07.470> was

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
take from the stet works not that it was

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.260 
take from the stet works not that it was
wrong<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.640> anyway<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:08.939> sort<00:01:09.240> of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
wrong and but anyway I'm sort of

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.929 
wrong and but anyway I'm sort of
rambling<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.280> we<00:01:11.280> actually<00:01:11.549> did<00:01:11.670> this<00:01:11.790> by

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
rambling on and we actually did this by

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.270 
rambling on and we actually did this by
Rome<00:01:12.180> 7<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.900> compressed<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.590> think<00:01:14.070> most

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
Rome 7 which was compressed I think most

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.249 
Rome 7 which was compressed I think most
of<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> rooms<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.850> spent<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.240> Rome<00:01:15.600> 4<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
of the rooms are spent on Rome 4 and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.510 
of the rooms are spent on Rome 4 and
then<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.470> had<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> do<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.900> 5<00:01:18.900> 5<00:01:19.710> was<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> stupid

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
then we had to do a 5 5 was the stupid

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.149 
then we had to do a 5 5 was the stupid
jumpy<00:01:21.270> thing<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.780> had<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.049> 6<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.560> 70<00:01:22.950> enough

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
jumpy thing we had to do 6 and 70 enough

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.420 
jumpy thing we had to do 6 and 70 enough
points<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:23.759> back<00:01:24.030> punch<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.710> also<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
points to get back punch and and also to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.190 
points to get back punch and and also to
get<00:01:26.640> Galvan<00:01:26.939> our<00:01:27.030> course<00:01:27.210> which<00:01:27.360> was<00:01:27.509> that's

get Galvan our course which was that's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200 
get Galvan our course which was that's
the<00:01:28.350> hardest<00:01:28.650> stage<00:01:28.799> we're<00:01:29.100> really<00:01:29.579> lucky<00:01:29.880> in

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
the hardest stage we're really lucky in

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.940
