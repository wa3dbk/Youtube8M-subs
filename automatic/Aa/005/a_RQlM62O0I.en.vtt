00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
they have a perfectly even base and what

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.860 
they have a perfectly even base and what
I<00:05:36.150> like<00:05:36.389> to<00:05:36.539> do<00:05:36.690> is<00:05:37.320> 1<00:05:37.889> 2<00:05:38.580> 3<00:05:38.610> go<00:05:38.969> 3<00:05:39.330> blocks<00:05:39.360> and

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
I like to do is 1 2 3 go 3 blocks and

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.170 
I like to do is 1 2 3 go 3 blocks and
take<00:05:40.380> out<00:05:40.560> 3<00:05:41.009> and<00:05:41.190> then<00:05:41.699> that'll<00:05:41.969> be<00:05:42.000> the

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
take out 3 and then that'll be the

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.560 
take out 3 and then that'll be the
entrance<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:43.880> there's<00:05:44.880> still<00:05:45.150> 3<00:05:45.419> on<00:05:45.509> each

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
entrance and there's still 3 on each

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.589 
entrance and there's still 3 on each
side<00:05:45.690> so<00:05:45.960> it's<00:05:46.380> a<00:05:46.500> perfectly<00:05:47.159> even<00:05:47.520> thing<00:05:48.389> so

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
side so it's a perfectly even thing so

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:50.240 
side so it's a perfectly even thing so
you<00:05:48.690> can<00:05:48.780> make<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.050> entrance<00:05:49.440> like<00:05:49.680> that<00:05:49.919> or

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250
