00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.860 
despite all the negative comments that
we<00:04:49.650> get<00:04:49.860> sometimes<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.960> guess<00:04:51.960> that's<00:04:52.230> business

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.380 

while<00:04:55.530> like<00:04:55.680> Katt<00:04:55.920> Williams<00:04:55.950> Dave<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.730> got<00:04:56.880> 16

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
while like Katt Williams Dave you got 16

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.290 
while like Katt Williams Dave you got 16
haters<00:04:58.130> need<00:04:59.130> to<00:04:59.250> have<00:04:59.370> 20<00:04:59.760> before<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.120> day<00:05:00.270> is

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300

over

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.210 

so<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:03.690> think<00:05:03.840> this<00:05:04.230> video<00:05:04.380> might<00:05:04.740> have<00:05:05.070> about

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
so I think this video might have about

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.270 
so I think this video might have about
ten<00:05:05.490> more<00:05:05.930> which<00:05:06.930> is<00:05:07.080> cool<00:05:07.320> with<00:05:07.500> me<00:05:07.530> because<00:05:08.160> I

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
ten more which is cool with me because I

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.490 
ten more which is cool with me because I
read<00:05:08.490> all<00:05:08.639> the<00:05:08.669> comments<00:05:08.970> and<00:05:09.540> I<00:05:09.750> take<00:05:09.990> he<00:05:10.230> to

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300
