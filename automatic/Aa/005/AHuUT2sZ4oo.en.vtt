00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 We did the same thing that he did nice with 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.059
 your mix to mix well trying 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:15.250
 to break everything we remember and four 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:17.320
 eggs 400 flour 40 100 soda 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.900
 salt pepper the snacks if you want 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.550
 it can be 200 milk or 200 is now 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.550
 only handled very fat comes 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.529
 comes a little more than comes well 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.289
 Ideally, leave it half an hour 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.710
 hydrate well the subject of flour and 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:44.829
 then cook them just like we are 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:46.900
 risky but I have it as in a 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.400
 strainer and drop droplets that are going to 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.809
 to be tiny we have already done it here 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.370
 I've seen that it's good but for 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.500
 make it bigger more forceful what 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.360
 do you or the tablet to the tablet 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.980
 cut or to a dish they put it directly 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.820
 they're bigger than you 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.109
 you talk next a little bit of oil 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.059
 then on set on set on set 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.810
 when you make below to slide 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.179
 well the mixture you grabbed this mixture and 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.160
 you're going to put a little bit up here were from 

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:15.039
 sergio de leche there is the one that 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.880
 simple put it here says the dish 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:20.320
 oiled and quite chili the matter 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.079
 regarding the amount that you have left 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.820
 perfect then in the following water 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.399
 boiling as for any one passes a 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.409
 little salt at the last minute so that 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.110
 evaporates and the salt is concentrated 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.620
 as with that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.620
 in the back 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.700
 not with style but with singing 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.690
 you let this go down there it goes 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.850
 falling down 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.880
 and you're going to wet it first I had 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.240
 forgotten this wet part and you're going to 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.240
 cut there 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.030
 yes 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.030
 looking for life 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.849
 that you break in the cooking 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.170
 he is lacking rest or a little 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.580
 of flour in this case is not 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.390
 happening so let's go with this 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.390
 I'm not going to come back 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.609
 open the curtain good 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.609
 7 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.630
 many things 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.629
 let's review 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.520
 when it is falling and how long it 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.520
 kitchen nothing rise to the surface 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.160
 in one minute a minute is enough 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.920
 nothing else then has the recipe the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.160
 air goes arming these are the 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.730
 spaces my hungarians 4 eggs 100 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.680
 milk 100 of water with gas 400 would give 40 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.440
 pepper salt nutmeg to taste 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.510
 Mix well all that leaves half an hour 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.510
 this we did not let it work like that 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.640
 reporting as the mixture falls 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.780
 it's only on a plate 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.810
 that has a little oil so that 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.700
 run here I have ice because this 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.290
 let's do it a while before and you 're not 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.450
 running at the time I recommend it 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.190
 to you also in your house then water 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.390
 with ice I come here now we go over 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.390
 to put home 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.650
 you armed the cabin like that in the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.579
 Palau 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.579
 j 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.930
 we cut the cooking this is very 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.910
 important of it reserved this now you 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.800
 cut the cooking I take it out I put a 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.240
 trickle of oil and I reserve it for 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.730
 last moment when I have a stew 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.930
 all you have to do is hit him 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.230
 a salt warns you 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.230
 in butter if there is there he cut the option 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.370
 fast 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.570
 ah 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.220
 life itself will not return to life itself 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.440
 because it tells us 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.280
 5 as everything says I'm not in this 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.860
 different 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.180
 this idea is a couple of turns 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.370
 and you have 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.240
 ready to serve comes after a 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.509
 hour and a half 2 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.789
 the tremendous stew gave his comedy and 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.960
 I think it's going to happen the same thing put down 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:47.889
 the pasta have my love so forcefulness 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.880
 and above put this 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.139
 it breaks is perfect any 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.210
 Little girl tell me why I love I'm 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.210
 good warm for the winter 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.390
 It is a very good quality quality of life 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:11.520
 enough 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:13.500
 when there is one thing that we go with this 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.420
 up here, although expected 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.420
 mosques mousse would be the minibar advocate
