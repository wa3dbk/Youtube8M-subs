game console so you can actually do this
on<00:01:23.960> all<00:01:24.530> consoles<00:01:24.980> I<00:01:25.250> know<00:01:25.430> for<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.000> fact<00:01:26.090> you

definitely<00:01:26.540> on<00:01:26.630> next-gen<00:01:26.930> because<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.170> believe

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
definitely on next-gen because I believe

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.080 
definitely on next-gen because I believe
this<00:01:27.410> one<00:01:27.560> next-gen<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:28.400> still<00:01:28.640> works<00:01:28.880> as

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
this one next-gen and it still works as

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.240 
this one next-gen and it still works as
right<00:01:29.930> now<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.590> it's<00:01:30.710> definitely<00:01:30.950> one<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.100> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.270 
will be back with the final actual
glitch<00:03:03.990> which<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.650> actually<00:03:04.950> using<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
glitch which is actually using the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.400 
glitch which is actually using the
teleportation<00:03:05.910> grenade<00:03:06.510> it's<00:03:06.870> really<00:03:07.230> really

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
teleportation grenade it's really really

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.010 
teleportation grenade it's really really
cool<00:03:07.560> really<00:03:07.920> easy<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.940> would<00:03:09.330> one<00:03:09.720> say<00:03:09.750> it's

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
cool really easy I would one say it's

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.720 
cool really easy I would one say it's
probably<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.410> best<00:03:10.740> other<00:03:11.100> site<00:03:11.430> it's<00:03:11.580> just

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
probably the best other site it's just

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.460 
probably the best other site it's just
cool<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.240> into<00:03:12.660> because<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.260> thing<00:03:13.440> is

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
cool to get into because the thing is

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.590 
cool to get into because the thing is
the<00:03:13.709> zombies<00:03:14.100> will<00:03:14.550> make<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> port<00:03:15.090> but<00:03:15.240> you<00:03:15.420> can

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
the zombies will make a port but you can

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.570 
the zombies will make a port but you can
actually<00:03:15.750> shoot<00:03:16.200> them<00:03:16.440> with<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.100> last<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
actually shoot them with the last and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.430 
actually shoot them with the last and
final<00:03:18.030> glitch<00:03:18.240> but<00:03:18.480> part<00:03:18.720> from<00:03:18.900> there<00:03:19.110> it's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
final glitch but part from there it's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.050 
final glitch but part from there it's
just<00:03:19.680> cool<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:19.890> do<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.430> good<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.670> troll<00:03:20.880> your

the glitch you'll just find a little

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.830 
the glitch you'll just find a little
barrier<00:03:47.310> I'll<00:03:48.150> just<00:03:48.330> tell<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.630> a<00:03:48.660> secret

made a mistake when I first did this
glitch<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.280> was<00:03:53.370> kind<00:03:53.550> of<00:03:53.610> funny<00:03:53.820> because<00:03:53.970> I

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
glitch it was kind of funny because I

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.420 
glitch it was kind of funny because I
saw<00:03:54.690> someone<00:03:54.959> post<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:55.769> was<00:03:55.950> like<00:03:56.130> you

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
know I've got to get some force so I got

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.229 
know I've got to get some force so I got
in<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.410> I<00:03:58.470> was<00:03:58.560> thinking<00:03:58.680> okay<00:03:59.010> okay<00:03:59.610> so<00:04:00.030> I<00:04:00.060> got

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
in and I was thinking okay okay so I got

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.040 
in and I was thinking okay okay so I got
into<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.450> corner

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
into the corner

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.100 
into the corner
a<00:04:01.080> double<00:04:01.769> jumped<00:04:02.130> off<00:04:02.340> lucky<00:04:03.239> dumb<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.930> I

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
a double jumped off lucky dumb and I

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.330 
a double jumped off lucky dumb and I
landed<00:04:04.260> on<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.530> little<00:04:04.739> ledge<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.070> I<00:04:05.130> had<00:04:05.250> to

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
landed on this little ledge and I had to

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.830 
landed on this little ledge and I had to
push<00:04:05.519> forward<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.910> was<00:04:06.030> fingering<00:04:06.330> me<00:04:06.570> why

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
push forward I was fingering me why

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.600 
push forward I was fingering me why
don't<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.080> drop<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.560> boy<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.250> while<00:04:08.370> dropping

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
don't I drop it boy and while dropping

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.340 
don't I drop it boy and while dropping
and<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.030> thought<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:09.690> first<00:04:09.840> thing<00:04:10.050> got<00:04:10.170> four

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
and I thought the first thing got four

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.720 
and I thought the first thing got four
was<00:04:10.500> basically<00:04:10.769> she's<00:04:10.980> got<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.280> be<00:04:11.310> passed<00:04:11.550> to

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
was basically she's got to be passed to

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
was basically she's got to be passed to
probably<00:04:11.970> quite<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.120> big<00:04:12.239> barrier<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.660> it

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
probably quite a big barrier and it

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.300 
probably quite a big barrier and it
click<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.380> feels<00:04:13.680> like<00:04:13.920> there's<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:14.130> big

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
click it feels like there's a big

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.210 
click it feels like there's a big
barrier<00:04:14.610> but<00:04:15.480> no<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.620> not<00:04:16.739> patch<00:04:16.919> scores

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
barrier but no this is not patch scores

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.789 
barrier but no this is not patch scores

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
is just a barrier this it's really

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.000 
is just a barrier this it's really
really<00:05:33.730> easy<00:05:34.390> to<00:05:35.080> do<00:05:35.260> but<00:05:35.470> I<00:05:35.530> wouldn't<00:05:35.860> say

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
really easy to do but I wouldn't say

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.040 
really easy to do but I wouldn't say
it's<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.250> best<00:05:36.520> like<00:05:36.820> I<00:05:36.850> said<00:05:37.180> as<00:05:37.540> you<00:05:37.600> can<00:05:37.870> see

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
it's the best like I said as you can see

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.600 
it's the best like I said as you can see
here<00:05:38.260> you<00:05:38.350> see<00:05:38.380> all<00:05:38.590> the<00:05:38.710> zombies<00:05:39.100> all<00:05:39.250> running

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
here you see all the zombies all running

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.070 
here you see all the zombies all running
and<00:05:39.910> they<00:05:40.090> were<00:05:40.150> all<00:05:40.210> gonna<00:05:40.360> pull<00:05:40.660> up<00:05:40.810> nicely

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
and they were all gonna pull up nicely

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.600 
and they were all gonna pull up nicely
but<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.530> problem<00:05:41.770> is<00:05:41.830> you<00:05:41.920> can't<00:05:42.070> show<00:05:42.250> them<00:05:42.430> I

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
but the problem is you can't show them I

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.850 
but the problem is you can't show them I
think<00:05:43.000> he<00:05:43.180> can't<00:05:43.450> here<00:05:43.810> so<00:05:44.140> this<00:05:44.260> is<00:05:44.440> kind<00:05:44.680> of<00:05:44.770> a

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
think he can't here so this is kind of a

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.340 
think he can't here so this is kind of a
worthless<00:05:45.160> glitch<00:05:45.730> so<00:05:45.910> it's<00:05:46.060> a<00:05:46.300> really<00:05:47.050> really

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
worthless glitch so it's a really really

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.170 
worthless glitch so it's a really really
pointless<00:05:47.770> I<00:05:48.040> mean<00:05:48.190> unless<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.640> zombies<00:05:48.970> die

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
pointless I mean unless the zombies die

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.180 
pointless I mean unless the zombies die
off<00:05:49.390> I<00:05:49.600> mean<00:05:49.900> the<00:05:50.080> only<00:05:50.200> good<00:05:50.350> thing<00:05:50.590> is<00:05:50.800> if<00:05:51.010> the

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
off I mean the only good thing is if the

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.100 
off I mean the only good thing is if the
vines<00:05:51.370> do<00:05:51.640> actually<00:05:51.940> eat<00:05:52.270> well<00:05:52.720> being<00:05:52.930> in

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
vines do actually eat well being in

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.320 
vines do actually eat well being in
there<00:05:53.260> you<00:05:53.620> can<00:05:53.770> easily<00:05:53.920> just<00:05:54.220> stand<00:05:54.520> here<00:05:54.610> go

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
there you can easily just stand here go

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.270 
there you can easily just stand here go
downstairs<00:05:56.230> get<00:05:56.380> some<00:05:56.560> food<00:05:56.770> do<00:05:56.980> what<00:05:57.100> you<00:05:57.160> got
