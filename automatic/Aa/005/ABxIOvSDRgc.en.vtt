00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello very good as all of them here 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.430
 is about to comment on gameplay 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.890
 white 2 and I'm playing with the scale h 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.450
 in domain in a kind of game 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.950
 competitive this there is in the black ops 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.220
 2 if I do not remember to unfold the pit 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.110
 or pit league or something like that 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.610
 I'm playing this game mode because 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.360
 the public servants were not going to this 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.100
 day 14 well I'm commenting day 15 in 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.050
 day 14 the servers and it was one thing that 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.180
 It bothered me a lot because I could barely 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.029
 play only go up one level and good 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.340
 it's something you have to wait for 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.200
 little of the new friends games with 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.570
 so many players that crowd together 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.310
 hit just the start of the game is 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.750
 well, it's something that I dislike a little but 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.970
 If I'm not mistaken, they're fixed 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.070
 things have this game so I play 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.830
 with the scale that already in this game already 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.270
 I say body in this type of game that is 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.710
 of the competitive 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.790
 you have all the streaks you have all the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.460
 weapons you have all the advantages what 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.490
 you have everything unlocked then so 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.230
 I did a class with the scale to 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.060
 try and how I got a very good 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.370
 split so this weapon was one of the 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.040
 assaults that I like the most or the one that 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.740
 possibly it seems very good to me already you see 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.110
 that kills us with very few bullets and I have 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.880
 three low gusts that are the v the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.500
 black see I'll call you like that, not because 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.150
 he does not remember what it's called here in 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.530
 the blog in banks two then of the 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.240
 kind of radars that shows you 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.310
 constantly from the enemies of minimum 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.979
 for 15 the total that is winning me 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.290
 peels 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.770
 fallen down the ravine I thought that of 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.740
 I will suddenly cross a ravine that 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.270
 would be two dogs as much gave me 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.490
 a lot of anger but anyway I 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.549
 I'm going to take the dogs twice once 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.080
 shortly and the other literally 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.670
 two hours before the game ends 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.189
 I get to take out the dogs or I do not 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.479
 they kill not one but well I think it 's a 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:50.259
 good game also I leave the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:51.579
 blackbird this 3 3 or 4 times and it's a 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.470
 game that if I'm not wrong we win 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.229
 I was playing with some friends so 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.560
 I send a greeting to all 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.560
 companions 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:07.000
 letters and numbers a greeting to all and that 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.679
 I'm going to comment on how I thought that 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.780
 it seemed like a good way to put 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.400
 gusts in the faces that I do not 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.319
 had played no other gameplay like this or 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.120
 be any other game but good 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.030
 friends works very well you know that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.030
 It has taken me dogs over it is a 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.030
 competitive 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.620
 well it's the kitchen had the face 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.620
 I always like very much 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.120
 accessories alarm one of them always 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.290
 It is a necessary silencer so that 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.000
 do not see in him minimum for when 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:48.460
 you shoot thing that is constantly 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.620
 you're shooting because the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.590
 silencer and then things like 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.670
 grip that if I'm not wrong it reduces 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.810
 in the recoil of the weapon while 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.790
 shoot or points or do not I do not remember 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.239
 what else had he put that was 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.859
 which points faster to the hour d 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.719
 and when you aim it points faster 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.219
 literally that is just that is me 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.079
 I always or almost always put those three 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.359
 things here for the first time I get my 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.000
 beloved unit well white dogs and 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.640
 juan are incredible they kill a lot 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.549
 few points like any streak 77 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.950
 kill you give me 15 points just for 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.629
 kill us that is not a big thing but good 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.939
 I still get a lot of casualties 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.290
 have achieved between 10 20 casualties or 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.480
 be that the truth is that they are a streak 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.829
 very good even I still have not got 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.329
 the swarm of the swarm because it has not 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.889
 had time to try it nor am I level 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.069
 50-odd to unlock it or anything 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:47.079
 but it may be better than the swarm 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:48.250
 because I do not know if the swarm you send him 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.760
 and people realize that you 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.980
 they start to kill the drones these 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.689
 automatic people are going to get into a 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.549
 building then within the 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.620
 principles that I know can not be 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.329
 put the robots these flying 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.189
 On the other hand, dogs are in the forum 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.959
 outdoors they get into the buildings 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.000
 you need to climb stairs to the dogs 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.049
 they are like multipurpose they do not go they go for 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.269
 everywhere while the drones 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.220
 they only work if people are at 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.819
 outdoors, maybe he gets in 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.370
 magically by a wall 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.199
 but well so maybe it's better 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.710
 dogs and I think and they are even 100 points 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:29.139
 less or 100 points minus a couple of 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.550
 times so they do not get too long and 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.930
 not the most interesting parts is a 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.990
 pretty good part a fifty-something 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.340
 ten-odd or something like that I can fit in this 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.139
 part because I started very well then the 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.000
 make it worse for us and again for 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.550
 some kind of ravine here I stay 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.639
 again close to blackbird if I do not 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.639
 mistaken 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.600
 and at the end of the last 30 seconds 45 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.770
 seconds of departure is when when I 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.480
 jump 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.250
 the other canine unit is right now 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.260
 look how much are left in this streak 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.960
 one minute is when I get it 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.790
 get everything good I think it's a 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.980
 good gameplay explained a little bit what 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.600
 what are the gusts what I have this 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.340
 weapon and good the advantages that I carry 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.960
 I have a ghost so they do not see me 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.190
 egg once but the truth that ghost does not 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.200
 it seems to me hand if you stay resigned 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.370
 other than if you stay 7 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.370
 bibs to ghost we are missing 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.400
 detect but I have ghost the line 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.050
 hard that then nothing more dots if I do not 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.720
 wrong nest minus dots to get 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.210
 to the gusts and then I have that spelling 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.200
 because that's the way they do not point me to any 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.450
 tip with peepholes so on and apart 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.580
 finally I have I do not know if it was skill or 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.410
 hardness I think the one of extreme you aim 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.740
 faster after painting so 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:48.139
 those I think is a kind of class 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.370
 that works very well for me you see 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.540
 that this was the first second part to 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.450
 I play the character 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.940
 it worked out for me, it's very good for me and the 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.130
 true that I recommend it and nothing I 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.300
 I think that has been more or less am 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.070
 point to take out the dogs I hope that 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.240
 have you enjoyed the gameplay please 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.530
 please it costs you nothing 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.150
 I like a favorite for this 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.790
 information by these dogs that 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.680
 they finish in very little time they have played 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.080
 if you just met me then normally 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.780
 I subscribe to you that we enjoy very much 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.250
 of the content of my channel and nothing yet 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.210
 just two kids that you have a good day 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.810
 See you later 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.810
 goodbye
