00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
grow and when they go through a process

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.430 
grow and when they go through a process
of<00:00:40.129> growing<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.600> they<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> water<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
ground until the fifth year okay but

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.229 
ground until the fifth year okay but
once<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.579> breaks<00:00:56.730> through<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.210> ground<00:00:57.920> within

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
once it breaks through the ground within

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.040 
once it breaks through the ground within
five<00:01:00.239> weeks

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
five weeks

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.410 
five weeks
it<00:01:01.500> grows<00:01:02.399> 90<00:01:02.969> feet<00:01:03.180> tall<00:01:04.880> now<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> question

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it grows 90 feet tall now the question

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.050 
it grows 90 feet tall now the question
is<00:01:06.510> does<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.840> grow<00:01:07.200> 90<00:01:07.560> feet<00:01:07.740> tall<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.369> five

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
is does it grow 90 feet tall in five

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.609 
is does it grow 90 feet tall in five
weeks<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:10.400> five<00:01:11.400> years<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:13.170> answer<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
weeks or five years the answer is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.050 
weeks or five years the answer is
obvious<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:15.000> grows<00:01:15.299> 90<00:01:15.810> feet<00:01:16.020> tall<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:17.060> five

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
obvious it grows 90 feet tall in five

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.350 
obvious it grows 90 feet tall in five
years<00:01:19.040> because<00:01:20.040> at<00:01:20.250> any<00:01:20.490> time<00:01:20.850> had<00:01:21.210> that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
years because at any time had that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.899 
years because at any time had that
person<00:01:21.810> stopped<00:01:22.140> watering<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.280> nurturing

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
person stopped watering and nurturing

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.410 
person stopped watering and nurturing
and<00:01:24.030> fertilizing<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.990> dream<00:01:26.030> that<00:01:27.030> bamboo

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and fertilizing that dream that bamboo

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.800 
and fertilizing that dream that bamboo
tree<00:01:27.900> would<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.229> died<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> ground<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.810> can

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
tree would have died in the ground I can

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.230 
tree would have died in the ground I can
see<00:01:31.140> people<00:01:31.740> coming<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.369> talking<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> guy
