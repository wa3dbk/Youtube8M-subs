scissors<00:00:38.480> okay<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:41.340> fold<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:01:12.600 

put<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:50.960> in<00:00:50.989> half<00:00:51.260> in<00:00:58.809> 67<00:00:59.809> here<00:01:00.140> I<00:01:07.119> come<00:01:08.119> in<00:01:08.390> here

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.510 

for<00:01:13.610> it<00:01:13.880> fly<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:17.810> it's<00:01:17.960> like<00:01:18.050> this<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:20.060> want<00:01:20.390> to

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
for it fly so it's like this you want to

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:30.840 
for it fly so it's like this you want to
fold<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:22.670> like<00:01:22.820> this

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.030 

so<00:01:31.850> looks<00:01:32.090> like<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.799> open<00:01:33.799> part

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
so looks like this is the open part

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:54.320 
so looks like this is the open part
facing<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.790> bottom

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.100 

all<00:01:54.840> sides<00:01:56.330> once<00:01:57.330> you're<00:01:57.510> done<00:01:57.660> with<00:01:57.720> that<00:02:00.110> and

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
all sides once you're done with that and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.860 
all sides once you're done with that and
fold<00:02:01.590> these<00:02:02.480> and<00:02:03.480> what's<00:02:03.990> easier<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.800> fold

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
fold these and what's easier is to fold

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.380 
fold these and what's easier is to fold
open<00:02:06.870> sides<00:02:07.710> down<00:02:08.300> at<00:02:09.300> first<00:02:11.210> so<00:02:12.210> it<00:02:12.330> looks

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
open sides down at first so it looks

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.820 
open sides down at first so it looks
more<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.140> drop<00:02:13.500> pod<00:02:15.320> make<00:02:16.320> sure<00:02:16.590> they're

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
more like a drop pod make sure they're

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:37.170 
more like a drop pod make sure they're
all<00:02:17.100> even<00:02:17.730> in

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:46.110 

hello

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
so it should look like this ring 14 and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.490 
so it should look like this ring 14 and
so<00:02:55.659> should<00:02:55.840> be<00:02:56.049> looking<00:02:56.260> like<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:57.239> now<00:02:58.500> what

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
you want to do this is a bit tricky you

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.160 
you want to do this is a bit tricky you
want<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.739> push<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.190> in<00:03:04.860> corner<00:03:05.860> of<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:07.750> a
