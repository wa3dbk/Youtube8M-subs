00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
this is back to where I started from the

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.940 
this is back to where I started from the
windows<00:00:03.389> tutorials<00:00:04.080> and<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.400> how<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.670> an

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
windows tutorials and this is how to an

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.759 
windows tutorials and this is how to an
adjustment<00:00:07.950> prompt<00:00:08.870> thing<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.200> example<00:00:10.559> if

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
adjustment prompt thing for example if

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.410 
adjustment prompt thing for example if
you<00:00:10.950> are<00:00:10.980> at<00:00:11.280> school<00:00:12.830> and<00:00:13.830> it's<00:00:14.009> blocked<00:00:14.460> say

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
you are at school and it's blocked say

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.560 
you are at school and it's blocked say
you<00:00:15.480> can't<00:00:15.929> get<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:17.510> you<00:00:18.510> can't<00:00:18.810> get<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:20.570> just

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you can't get it you can't get it just

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.439 
you can't get it you can't get it just
by<00:00:21.810> searching<00:00:23.390> one<00:00:24.390> point<00:00:25.939> there<00:00:26.939> are<00:00:27.119> two

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
by searching one point there are two

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.050 
by searching one point there are two
ways<00:00:27.720> which<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.380> access<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.980> one<00:00:29.939> of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
ways which you can access it one of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.440 
ways which you can access it one of
which<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:32.360> create<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.980> text<00:00:34.980> document<00:00:35.450> you're

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
which is create a text document you're

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.729 
which is create a text document you're
gonna<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.899> have<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> extensions

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
gonna have to have the extensions

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.040 
gonna have to have the extensions
enabled<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:40.399> don't<00:00:41.399> know<00:00:41.579> whether

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
enabled for this so I don't know whether

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.250 
enabled for this so I don't know whether
this<00:00:43.050> will<00:00:43.230> work<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.649> some<00:00:43.829> computers<00:00:45.260> second

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
this will work on some computers second

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.910 
this will work on some computers second
one's<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:47.539> bit<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> an<00:00:48.780> easier<00:00:49.079> way<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.649> you

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
one's a bit of an easier way if you

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.410 
one's a bit of an easier way if you
don't<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.940> extensions<00:00:51.539> enabled<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.420> for

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
don't have the extensions enabled so for

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
don't have the extensions enabled so for
example<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.340> name<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.920> CMD<00:00:58.920> dot

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
example I'm going to name this CMD dot

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that close and change the extension to
