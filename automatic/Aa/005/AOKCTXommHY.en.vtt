00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
let's just target I got let's this

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.620 
let's just target I got let's this
diagram<00:04:46.669> which<00:04:46.819> pick<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.090> up<00:04:47.150> put<00:04:47.539> your

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
finger so you ever find it wouldn't be

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.640 
finger so you ever find it wouldn't be
good<00:04:57.229> if<00:04:57.289> you<00:04:57.409> could<00:04:57.530> bend<00:04:57.770> yeah<00:04:59.530> it's<00:05:00.530> not

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
good if you could bend yeah it's not

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.559 
good if you could bend yeah it's not
gonna<00:05:00.830> be<00:05:01.009> or<00:05:01.220> not<00:05:01.430> you<00:05:01.789> just<00:05:02.030> cover<00:05:02.270> my<00:05:02.419> life

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
gonna be or not you just cover my life

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.960 
gonna be or not you just cover my life
well<00:05:03.050> I<00:05:03.080> think<00:05:03.229> about<00:05:03.560> it<00:05:03.800> is<00:05:04.220> that<00:05:04.550> when<00:05:04.940> you

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
well I think about it is that when you

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.600 
well I think about it is that when you
stare<00:05:05.389> everything's<00:05:06.080> a<00:05:06.229> circle<00:05:06.680> it's<00:05:07.430> so

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
stare everything's a circle it's so

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.600 
stare everything's a circle it's so
simple<00:05:07.940> because<00:05:08.330> it's<00:05:08.599> only<00:05:08.780> three<00:05:09.080> days<00:05:09.610> it's

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
simple because it's only three days it's

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.899 
simple because it's only three days it's
not<00:05:10.759> much<00:05:10.940> so<00:05:11.150> follow<00:05:11.389> because<00:05:11.659> the<00:05:11.840> honesty

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
not much so follow because the honesty

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.460 
not much so follow because the honesty
it's<00:05:13.909> like<00:05:14.270> this<00:05:14.449> it'd<00:05:14.659> probably<00:05:14.840> be<00:05:15.020> so<00:05:15.289> much

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
it's like this it'd probably be so much

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.969 
it's like this it'd probably be so much
easier

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
easier

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.129 
easier
this<00:05:16.789> isn't<00:05:17.090> like<00:05:17.210> well<00:05:17.539> you<00:05:17.630> take<00:05:17.900> you've

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
this isn't like well you take you've

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.279 
this isn't like well you take you've
picked<00:05:18.409> a<00:05:18.530> G<00:05:18.770> that's<00:05:18.979> literally<00:05:19.639> a<00:05:19.759> circle<00:05:20.289> and

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
picked a G that's literally a circle and

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.290 
picked a G that's literally a circle and
there<00:05:21.889> is<00:05:21.979> no<00:05:22.130> the<00:05:22.250> letters<00:05:22.520> in<00:05:22.639> here<00:05:22.880> either

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
there is no the letters in here either

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.890 
there is no the letters in here either
no<00:05:24.849> if<00:05:25.849> I<00:05:26.000> was<00:05:26.090> Christian<00:05:26.539> I<00:05:26.599> could<00:05:26.720> probably

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
no if I was Christian I could probably

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.749 
no if I was Christian I could probably
find<00:05:27.199> God<00:05:27.409> straight<00:05:27.740> away<00:05:27.949> and<00:05:28.280> then<00:05:28.520> I'd<00:05:28.639> have

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
find God straight away and then I'd have
