00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
that's why the support package doesn't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.430 
that's why the support package doesn't
reset<00:00:38.670> upon<00:00:38.940> death<00:00:39.180> because<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.290> guy

I you know what makes this different
from<00:05:35.780> modern<00:05:35.930> warfare<00:05:36.229> two<00:05:36.470> makes<00:05:36.889> us

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
from modern warfare two makes us

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.529 
from modern warfare two makes us
different<00:05:37.159> from<00:05:37.370> what<00:05:37.550> reward<00:05:37.820> for<00:05:37.970> one<00:05:38.150> yeah

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
different from what reward for one yeah

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.839 
different from what reward for one yeah
you<00:05:38.780> know<00:05:38.870> and<00:05:39.050> so<00:05:39.229> it's<00:05:39.710> things<00:05:40.010> like<00:05:40.159> strike

you know and so it's things like strike

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.129 
you know and so it's things like strike
packages<00:05:41.210> and<00:05:41.389> stuff<00:05:41.449> which<00:05:41.690> may<00:05:41.840> be<00:05:41.870> to

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
packages and stuff which may be to

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.540 
packages and stuff which may be to
someone<00:05:42.500> who<00:05:42.620> only<00:05:42.830> casually<00:05:43.280> knows<00:05:43.430> the

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
someone who only casually knows the

building out their levels of stuff there

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.330 
building out their levels of stuff there
they're<00:07:41.900> making<00:07:42.020> little<00:07:42.350> mental<00:07:42.950> notes<00:07:43.130> like
