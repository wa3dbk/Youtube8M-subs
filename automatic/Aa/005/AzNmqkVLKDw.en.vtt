00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.790
Hello everybody! I am at Barcelona, to test
Seat&nbsp;Leon&nbsp;SC, which stands for "Sport Coupe".

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.420
This is the third generation of Seat Leon and
it is the first time when this model gets a 3-door version.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.760
This car is not ONLY a 3-door version of
Leon, is more than that.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.370
The windshield is more inclined than the one of the 5-door version,
the rooftop is a little lower,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.940
and the rear window is 19 degrees more inclined.
The wheelbase is 35 mm shorter,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.630
and the total length of the car is also reduced by 27 mm.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.670
Thanks to these small size and wheelbase
differences, and also to the different settings,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.270
Leon SC can notably differentiate itself from the
5-door version, and also from Leon estate

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.000
which will be launched in the fall of 2013.  

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.550
This 3-door version is more nimble, Seat says,
and I can only confirm that!

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.790
A huge contribution to the way Seat Leon
can be driven goes to the Seat Drive Profile technology.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.920
Through a button you can choose between
Eco, Normal and Sport modes,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.540
and the Individual profile allows you to combine
the sport and eco settings.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.870
For example, you can choose the sport steering
and the eco air conditioning.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.410
The steering of the car, in Sport mode,
behaves much, much more pleasant than in other operating modes.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.300
So it's a must have! On the Sport mode the steering acts

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.490
very, very promptly, it is a little heavier,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.540
and the car becomes a real pleasure.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.690
This Seat Drive Profile button is only
available in FR sport versions. So, if you opt

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.950
for a lower spec version - Reference and Style â€“
you will get a steering a little too soft that

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.740
works pretty artificial. Exactly the same way
behaves the direction at FR if you drive in Normal or Eco modes.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.300
But when you switch to the Sport mode,
the steering reactions

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.740
noticeably change in a better way. 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.500
An interesting detail is that Leon received full
LED headlights for the FR versions.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.600
It is the only non-premium car
that can have such headlights. 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.400
In Spain I drove a 2-liter TDI version, 150 PS/HP,
as well as a gasoline one, 1.8 TSI with 180 PS/HP.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:17.310
This last one sounds great and it reaches 100 km/in 7.2 seconds,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.080
combined with the super-fast DSG double clutch gearbox.
Here's how it accelerates!

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.560
As a conclusion, Seat Leon SC proved to be a
very pleasant car to drive.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:46.580
It is lightweight, dynamic and very nimble. Now, models like
Opel/Vauxhall GTC Astra, Volkswagen Scirocco,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:56.660
Renault Megane Coupe, and even 3-door Golf,
have a strong rival in this Leon Sport Coupe!
