00:00:03.518 --> 00:00:15.938
 This video is the Soviet 9th Tier Medium Tank, T-54's 10-head ace play video. 

00:00:15.938 --> 00:00:24.183
 The main street on the left is the main line, and you need to check it out because it is easy to get back on the other side of the straight road. 

00:00:24.183 --> 00:00:33.000
 It is better to have one or two mid-size tanks with good maneuverability and adequate engagement. 

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:57.823
 Two medium sized tanks and two light trains will move to your area. 

00:01:13.076 --> 00:01:31.477
 You can see that you are trying to cover up between buildings as soon as you arrive at the target point. 

00:01:31.477 --> 00:02:00.512
 Since there has never been a straight road, the lead lighthorse goes to check the spotted enemy. 

00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:13.408
 All of the positions of the enemy self-propelled guns were revealed across the base of the enemy Bashatijon enemy base. 

00:02:13.408 --> 00:02:26.389
 If the position can be checked, the enemy's self-propelled weapon will be eliminated. 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:39.442
 Most of your friendly heavy vehicles are located in urban areas, but you can see that the enemy heavy vehicles have not yet completed their deployment. 

00:02:39.442 --> 00:03:05.136
 It is effective to accumulate as much damage as possible before putting into the wire. 

00:03:05.136 --> 00:03:15.443
 It is better if you can catch the enemy directly. Outside of the city area, I find the enemy moving and go to suppress it. 

00:03:15.443 --> 00:03:26.513
 Moving to the diagonal when approaching the enemy is effective in blocking the aim. I have avoided the first attack. 

00:03:26.513 --> 00:03:30.000
 The closer you are to the situation, the more likely it is to stay calm and try to be as weak as possible. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 One mid-sized tank immediately raided and suffered a catastrophe breakdown and minor damage, but it caught with a frontal confrontation. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:54.632
 If the enemy was in close proximity to the side, it could have been difficult due to the turret failure. 

00:03:54.632 --> 00:04:00.096
 Main line of central city area seems to be advantageous for friend. Move to deal the remaining enemies near enemy base. 

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:21.564
 The enemy is T-29, but the car is covered and it enters the confrontation state in the teatime state. 

00:04:21.564 --> 00:04:28.657
 Without being able to harm each other, they succeeded in capturing the enemy with the support of friendly forces. 

00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:43.463
 You can see that the StugIII can easily be defeated, but also aiming at the observation window next to the gunner. 

00:04:57.948 --> 00:05:05.464
 All that's left is just four of them in front of the city. Move to the back of the enemy. 

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:37.302
 Breaking a mouse with little durability in the rear 

00:06:07.436 --> 00:06:15.723
 The artillery is closed by the self-propelled gun. 

00:06:15.723 --> 00:06:24.735
 The last remaining T-110E5 is dealt. There are nine remaining durabilities, but you can see the hatching of the turret, which is the weakness of the enemy. 

00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:31.217
 In this close proximity, you can avoid weakness with controls such as moving back and forth or turning the turret. 

00:06:31.217 --> 00:06:39.233
 The enemy first attempted to evade the sideways, but the rotation of the turret was slow and eventually destroyed by the support of the friendly. 

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:43.141
 Strategies to quickly identify enemy positions and properly dismiss enemies before they are deployed 

00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:47.623
 It was a battle in which the advantage of unique Soviet tanks strong against the melee was encouraged to induce close combat. 

00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:55.623
 I will end the explanation of the ace play video of T-54. Thank you.
