00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:02.509
 hello friends now i want 

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:04.870
 to show you 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.420
 according to him complexity is easy 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.350
 is that it is still only 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.749
 technical we will demonstrate 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:16.009
 possibilities of buckwheat 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.829
 and all put together the level of kc years all smoke 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.829
 a small area chikola convenient 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.699
 Lots Mug Who 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:28.410
 produce 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.670
 some operation so far this is not 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.670
 for now we can just watch 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.750
 with assessment 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.900
 the life of this area 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.900
 speed up or slow down 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.770
 i.e. little kids 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.490
 such a square hemp cardboard 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.690
 live their own life 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.590
 not knocked down 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.590
 they go to the shops 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.530
 going to work walking in the park 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.180
 return home 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.320
 graphic style is very interesting 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.010
 in this is called macro photography 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.260
 then a picture of real life 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.630
 removed 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.990
 in such a tricky way 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.159
 it turns out that the photos look 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.020
 garden 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.020
 shooting was carried out on the bottom of the object a little 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.790
 that's what went little soldier 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.660
 human plastic object 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.760
 power station 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.590
 it seems like you can touch 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.590
 when the game will come out 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.030
 day and night, respectively 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.030
 PC 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.690
 maybe even fight 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.240
 finishes until it waits nothing 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.260
 thousand 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.380
 of what we have them 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.670
 we make the cursor more expensive 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.010
 we choose these people step 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.730
 but 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.899
 it's just technical 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.629
 no and somehow there is no 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.510
 nevertheless nevertheless to us here 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.279
 demonstrate how this word 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.279
 on the example of one small 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.429
 hid where soon 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.039
 significant after all 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.549
 races 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.549
 skyscrapers 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.039
 modern 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:52.849
 we will plant a big anthill 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.849
 for example also joined 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.309
 night life 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.209
 built-in counters with 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.139
 naturally because 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.129
 nothing is optimized 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.129
 girl betrays no 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:31.589
 opportunities 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.039
 let's follow somebody 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.479
 the fact that he disappears 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.199
 Well, I think on it 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.489
 so now that 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.489
 see status as much as possible 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.819
 in this arena 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:03.609
 demonstration technical problem 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.609
 the project 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.879
 I will follow him I'm interested 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.879
 your what is it eventually outgrow 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.930
