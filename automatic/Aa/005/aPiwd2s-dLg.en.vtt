00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.140
 peter tomorrow evening to leeuwarden 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.490
 cambuur 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.529
 I think that is a very difficult one 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.730
 match on the artificial grass for small one 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.380
 stadium you have to be everyone 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.150
 fanatic and also a team that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.330
 can safely play axes the points 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.980
 grab yes so a great one 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.029
 competition to play because 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.760
 much is at stake for both 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.410
 plowing I also found it is indeed on 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.670
 artificial grass we are not used to 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.990
 play are but with the technical 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.160
 I see skillful players that we have 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.570
 it more like an advantage that we have on it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.920
 can play 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.300
 and that people are close to the field 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.349
 is great ambience in every one 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.700
 football player dreams of being in such a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.530
 ambiance 'can play football 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.680
 yes no sure art was always difficult 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.930
 when that way that we must win and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.850
 that we too be armed against that 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.500
 and yes again this season 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.539
 is a tricky game for everyone 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.190
 opponent if you get it right now 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.520
 difficult opponents so yes me 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.320
 consider myself vitesse 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.180
 a difficult opponent so I think 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.359
 that she met 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.399
 yes with a lot of fires with a lot of passion from the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.960
 dressing room to come and dance us 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.610
 become as hard as possible to make 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.110
 you have played a lot of stadiums i think 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.040
 in the Netherlands such as the Cambuur Stadium 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.260
 played 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.909
 no, I still have lying stuff so too 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.290
 another nice new challenge from that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.600
 we play leukemia new language stadiums 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.860
 but should be allowed in new ones 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.229
 win and 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 likes to do in a new stadium some 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.420
 takes job teams what you take out 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.560
 that fantastic first half against ajax 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.049
 then I am also right in the second half 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.310
 with the fact that the decay is large and we 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.570
 have shown that having and when it 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.280
 show that we do much more often this season 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.810
 excellent that we can play football 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.759
 even a very good opponent like 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.950
 ajax the the probably the coming 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.270
 champion that we are under those 45 minutes 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.280
 have put no pressure against 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.979
 and I myself have counted them ten 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.850
 opportunities created in a half piece 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.369
 a lot 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.890
 yes you only score once so that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.229
 we did not do well but yes it 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.689
 It is now great that you think you are 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.549
 good team that can fix thinking 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.040
 which is important for ourselves as 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.600
 team are the that the that line 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.159
 continue and be able to hold on longer 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.899
 because yes to 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.060
 all respect for cambuur against cambuur 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.220
 from another site as opposed to ajax ajax itself 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.140
 more quality and can be a match 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.519
 decide earlier but take it 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.230
 thereby there 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.580
 we follow focus must be on cambuur 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.780
 because Cambuur again is a tricky one 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.860
 opponent for us too 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.450
 and just sat over that first half 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.209
 a measure that the level it you 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.459
 pursues is to what you are aiming 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.230
 the benchmark is perhaps a little bit quite 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.849
 high-pitched but that was softer 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.290
 very good looking but we still have that 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.150
 also show more often this season 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.950
 especially for the winter break that we often do 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.330
 played dominant and the opponent with 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.590
 put the back against the wall 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.970
 advantage of course was that you now have one 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.200
 opponent he had wanted himself 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.120
 we play soccer very often 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.400
 against those of backwards just the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.200
 gamble and play long ball on the counter 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.250
 today you go or last Sunday 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 did you have a team that also wanted to 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.239
 playing football is another reason for you 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.319
 can imagine you tested well 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.849
 I've seen the first half that it's that 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.459
 you start with the same eleven or are you still 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.950
 too early 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.470
 well no that that is not 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.420
 I think automatically because we had it there 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.799
 two players who were injured were we 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.940
 know and lucas 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.319
 two boys that man also in the base 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.030
 can start so they are now one again 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.620
 week later are now what 40 so that gives 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.230
 some extra options 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.799
 and how are the rest of you 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.200
 selections everyone 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.160
 fat yes so want is the only one left 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.450
 does not train 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.859
 frank has trained again this week 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.120
 comes that contest the early home 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.200
 doubloon out and certainly with a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.900
 hamstring injury should be careful 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.260
 but we are ankles that are good 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.260
 restored
