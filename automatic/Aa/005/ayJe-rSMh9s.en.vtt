00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.569
 Tintin moonves then solved the first two layers another agent starting 

00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:13.909
 to work on the last walk down the back points added last month is 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.019
 a bit more complex 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.990
 more 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.730
 bush centered sequence of movements is a region of much love 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.539
 so edwards we did here week started with tom cruise 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.039
 We'll arrive with the yellow cross, too. 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.210
 but rather explore 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.620
 start in a good position here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.620
 - looking forward to the course you get a part in the direction here 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.190
 and a 10-kilo double bike successfully made the price of 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.540
 time to leave at 12 hours 9 hours 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.080
 but 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.140
 here as I do not have this corporation yet 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.560
 maicon tries to find a side here 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.800
 already with the right point 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.650
 still puts 1% with a line that improves 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.980
 since it is a centerpiece 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.130
 only now a sequence of movements 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.740
 We can get there. 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.049
 yellow males the mique quique sequence several times then 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.760
 But we have to do it, learn from it. 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.120
 people are hungry from the front 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.290
 who entered your body 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.410
 here o 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.340
 by my side 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.480
 right 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.020
 so we start 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.020
 clockwise 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.240
 I play 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.850
 in the sense 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.850
 the time 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.060
 there will have 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.910
 in the sense 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.660
 then this time 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.020
 we'll grab you later 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.330
 the double meaning 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.320
 employee 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.750
 we grab you 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.640
 she will have a sense 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.960
 counter-clockwise 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.420
 my people he turned forward 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.690
 in the sense 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.660
 but renato 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.770
 now we still can not charge the marina but we got that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.440
 corporation and happy 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.440
 which was a piece turned upside-down of a promotion 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.929
 require the piece that you will find again 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:13.529
 it was correct to charge 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.679
 It's good, it always leaves the fields correct. 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:17.059
 aligned 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.869
 and now we do not have a familiar setup, it's really 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:21.779
 Aimed at a board 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.429
 to go 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:25.379
 the clockwise partners 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.389
 in this configuration then our front that will be to the south 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.110
 we make the same move forward then make sense 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.110
 schedule 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:39.029
 clockwise 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.079
 there will be clockwise 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.729
 now we get the tupi meaning the official 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.999
 of course no night time 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.619
 anticlockwise 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.499
 here we were already 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.329
 We already arrived swimming jogging. 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.370
 in the bladder 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.019
 cruise yellow 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.469
 this was the goal of this space that was to make a slow curve 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.159
 so we already left gil ball 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.599
 all point to next Sunday 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:22.989
 murici has now made the solution of the curuzu manuel antÃ³nio jacinto now 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.819
 some absolute complete strains 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:28.450
 yellow 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.849
 dream still does not care about 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.979
 to the trainees by miniseries or personal novels 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.349
 All through the night but the movements are not known 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.859
 we have chick's neck up here yet be 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:44.759
 concluded then 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.799
 but you have to know the time 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.019
 the make moves that he was basically drawn perception 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.939
 I consider that what we face 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.679
 the people who are here 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:55.639
 the page 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.409
 bring these two 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:59.309
 and this piece 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:03.249
 so much and we can get these three pieces here effectively 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.969
 the secrecy of monuments 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.180
 of the Brazilian to take it as we do not have three feet to make a 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.739
 first move 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.849
 77 of the accident happened in the field 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:14.969
 I wanted to put 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.599
 the two incomplete weak response that was not changed here 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.789
 the intention is to become these two pieces three pieces here 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:24.169
 as the external movement 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.529
 in choucha show 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.699
 the right-back 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.099
 the only 23-hour fifa movies 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.699
 the right-back 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.370
 sense 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.139
 in relation to the field 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.120
 clockwise 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.120
 the lateral-steering wheel anti-clockwise 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:46.340
 clockwise 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.809
 plateau 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:49.919
 the clockwise direction 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:51.129
 I agree 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.229
 counter-clockwise 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.620
 twice 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.620
 bilateral squid counterclockwise because the white mantle 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.809
 so the team celebrates 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:01.960
 we have all three prey 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.839
 in no way 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.999
 who places these three pieces in this position of the day 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:10.479
 and now all three will be reversed the political trend accumulated in the year 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.789
 everything with plants repeats the same moment 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.300
 only one side 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.610
 right epd 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:17.999
 on the right side 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:19.099
 schedule 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.449
 I'm cured 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.639
 on the right side 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.599
 counter-clockwise 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.039
 schedule 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:27.050
 I took everything time 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.789
 little during the time of two times 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:30.879
 they hit you 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.300
 let's pray 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.320
 it was not this time we changed the configuration of the pieces 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.870
 revolting 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.780
 but we take advantage of this side here in a position that it will already goose after 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.050
 the occurrence 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.050
 let's go again 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.050
 schedule 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.960
 counter-clockwise 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.439
 the time 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:02.960
 but the rush hour 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.409
 but the time 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.129
 this time, with us, we were able to conclude 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:09.779
 every corner is yellow 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:12.229
 all fought with her husband then 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.830
 along with the holder 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.610
 in the last stages that really solve 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.479
 the last auction
