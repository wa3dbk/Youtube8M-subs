00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.899
 and ended with 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.170
 with the happiness of truth 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 to all the excellent players that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.410

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.360
 triumph 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.100
 I think that part of all of us is 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.140
 it's a reunion with the fans 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.960
 it's a re -believing of all the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.570
 americanism so 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.579
 today what remains is to thank them for the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.850
 support in a week that was not easy 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.010
 thank all the players for the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.719
 delivery because they played like lions 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.789
 because they ran every meter of the court 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.079
 because today America has a victory 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.579
 thanks to the effort that the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.440
 players with the attitude that they showed 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.950
 the players with the game I think that 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.820
 america is very close to 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.680
 to look like what we all want 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:59.250
 especially that the players have done 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.450
 a very intense week 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.280
 where there have been very good talks and 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.260
 where the team is aiming for the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.150
 same place to assess fatigue 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.990
 let's wait for the morning and until the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.150
 Monday there were also players who 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.730
 they returned from their elections some of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.210
 they who made trips 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.110
 18 10 hours of waiting at airports 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.090
 as jugares selection 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.520
 Paraguayan 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.200
 highlight the effort of the three today 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.509
 because they did a lot of hours of 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.790
 trip the same one of dread or the one of 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.370
 adventure that comes from 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.010
 from the other side of the sea 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.720
 so let's wait to evaluate how 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.340
 they are in fatigue tomorrow that's why 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.800
 we train to do a regenerative and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.240
 a quicker recovery and so that 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.650
 those who did not play have minutes of 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.930
 football to get all ready to the 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.330
 Wednesday and surely on Tuesday or the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.980
 Wednesday morning I'll see how it 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.480
 find each one to participate in the 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.480
