00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
back and I've taken those out already

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.410 
back and I've taken those out already
and<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.960> flip<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:51.530> this<00:00:52.530> hose<00:00:53.420> goes

and you just flip this up this hose goes
to<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:56.570> mouth<00:00:57.570> selection<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:58.530> size

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
to your mouth selection for what size

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.260 
to your mouth selection for what size
load<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.239> want<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.579> on<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.850> unit

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
load you want to do and on this unit

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.410 
load you want to do and on this unit
it's<00:01:03.539> disconnected<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.519> sometimes<00:01:06.270> it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
it's disconnected here and sometimes it

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.289 
it's disconnected here and sometimes it
just<00:01:06.570> gets<00:01:06.900> jiggled<00:01:07.439> off<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.090> stick

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
just gets jiggled off so you just stick

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.710 
just gets jiggled off so you just stick
that<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.880> don't<00:01:12.030> clamp<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.600> or

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
that on so you don't clamp it or

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.810 
that on so you don't clamp it or
anything<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.320> could<00:01:13.560> probably<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> small

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
anything you could probably get a small

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.520 
anything you could probably get a small
clamp<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.049> hardware<00:01:16.500> store<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:18.200> if<00:01:19.200> your

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
clamp at the hardware store and if your

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.560 
clamp at the hardware store and if your
washing<00:01:19.799> machine<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.310> disconnected<00:01:20.970> here

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
washing machine is not disconnected here

and no needs call repair them okay this

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.220 
and no needs call repair them okay this
is<00:01:36.520> disconnected<00:01:37.120> here<00:01:37.390> this<00:01:37.720> is<00:01:37.900> your
