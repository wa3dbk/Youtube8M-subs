00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.650
 hello that such friends my name is Jorge 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.750
 you are in your channel act of review 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.310
 You are going to see right now is a top 5 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.769
 the best tweets I found that I've 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.630
 seen or that I liked the first thing 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.490
 let's see is this tweet called 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.099
 sweet spring that will allow us to 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.080
 replace the latter to facilitate 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.960
 much life since May 7 we have a 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.649
 style of apps or in multitasking with 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.770
 double click on the start button icon 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.329
 at the beginning we will appear this and to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.280
 remove all applications because a 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.590
 Sometimes there are more than 10 that sometimes we 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.539
 can give too much laziness we're going to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.579
 grabbing is great that is this and we're going 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.250
 to use up we're going to 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.770
 allow to make a loan leave the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.199
 apps or cancel if I give cancel for not 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.120
 it's going to be nothing but exit the apps 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.129
 will close all the apps you have 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.320
 Open people, I 'm going to find you 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.840
 it's called paint lander and that's going to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.850
 allow access as 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.250
 I do not know what will allow us is to be able to 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.409
 download the bytes directly from 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.750
 the application without installing anything without 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.969
 pay nothing very simple simply for 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.329
 download the video hey I liked it I'm going 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.950
 to give him a backhand maybe I like it and 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.360
 what I'm going to do is save the video 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.890
 I'm going so I'll be able to share with 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.840
 any of my friends who do not have 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.729
 the application or just to be able 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.590
 keep the next I'll 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.880
 show is called my name which is what 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.039
 you see what is going to allow us 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.259
 do this you see me carrier that says my 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.789
 name instead of saying telcel for this 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.399
 he does it we just have to 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.979
 activate it in this part and we 're going to go 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.020
 to general information and where it says 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.709
 name you are going to put whatever you want 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.310
 example if I put 12345 I give in accept 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:54.349
 and I'm going to have to make a spring 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.719
 you just know with the click that 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:58.369
 we have previously installed 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.860
 we're just going to restart here and you 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.619
 we're going to give subtract immediately we're going 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.959
 to appear the manzanita the telephone goes to 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.660
 take 5 to 10 seconds to react 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.130
 finish making the respect and ready 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.340
 how can you see now 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.500
 it's called 1 2 3 4 5 next you that you 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.910
 I'm going to show it's called a celebrated and it's a 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.740
 very simple trick but it will help us 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.330
 in many things what it does is that 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.460
 phone animations are much more 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.680
 fast is not going to be faster than your 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.760
 device but yes visually achieving 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.230
 to get faster in the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.000
 animations you can feel that you 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.530
 device moves in a way 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.260
 much faster the only thing that we have 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.210
 what to do is enter the click and we will 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.760
 give in activate and where it says it reads 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.090
 let's control the speed and this 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.060
 we will be able to choose between several 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.720
 types of speed we have another more 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.760
 superman ferrari and normal how can you 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.860
 see my animations move very fast 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.270
 that you do not even notice the change by 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.210
 example if I put it back in normal 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.230
 it's going to be a much slower change but 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.400
 we can still put it much slower 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.349
 to one 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.400
 as you can see here I know he bit 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.560
 with all the laziness 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.590
 it's more until my arrival there will be a 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.340
 little because I can not go back in 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.950
 we go once I already charge 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.170
 let's go back in with that 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.500
 slow speed 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.980
 now let's put it in ultraman ivÃ¡n 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.330
 the speed radically changes the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.769
 next twitt has to do with the 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.920
 music that is what will allow us 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.410
 download videos and music and pass it 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.379
 directly to the music the only thing that 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.739
 we have to do is enter the tweet that 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.269
 it's called music for me and have to 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.980
 download a song to search is 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.010
 erase very easy you are simply going to have 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.510
 to press here if you want song of 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.120
 any artist 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.640
 here you will appear this too many 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.170
 very organized very broad artists there are 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.120
 songs in English and Spanish and that 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.470
 I was surprised good to care 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.910
 you are simply going to have to make a 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.829
 click and you will press import 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.780
 song to produce edit the 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.700
 information add as tone 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.129
 if you add it as everything as everything not 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.470
 they're just going to sound 30 seconds to sound 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.150
 the whole song when you are called and 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.610
 that's a very easy way to save 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.440
 money since it costs you 15 pesos 15 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.370
 weights approximately every tone in 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.959
 iTunes 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.269
 to import song just you 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.860
 let's associate import song and how 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.139
 you can see start import the dimension 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.510
 it makes a very fast bonus so it's not going 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.639
 to take so long for example already 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.880
 finished we are going to check a part of 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.130
 music 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.680
 and we're going to enter the music and now we're going 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.030
 to look for simple plan as you can see us 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.700
 simple plan appears 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.540
 and the song welcome to my life that was 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.930
 the one that matters 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.460
