00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.580 
for you Heather I know that's like one
simple<00:04:42.130> answer<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:43.660> complex<00:04:43.900> question<00:04:44.320> but

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
simple answer to a complex question but

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.380 
simple answer to a complex question but
I<00:04:44.620> think<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.890> lot<00:04:44.920> of<00:04:45.070> it<00:04:45.250> will<00:04:45.340> sort<00:04:45.670> like

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
I think a lot of it will sort like

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.270 
I think a lot of it will sort like
you'll<00:04:46.780> start<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.110> feel<00:04:47.200> closer<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.800> him<00:04:48.040> if

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
you'll start to feel closer to him if

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.360 
you'll start to feel closer to him if
you<00:04:48.580> set<00:04:49.300> aside<00:04:49.480> time<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.500> be<00:04:51.040> better<00:04:51.220> because

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
you set aside time to be better because

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.880 
you set aside time to be better because
life<00:04:51.610> it's<00:04:51.880> crazy<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.750> busy<00:04:53.140> and<00:04:53.500> it's<00:04:53.650> only

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
life it's crazy and busy and it's only

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.710 
life it's crazy and busy and it's only
going<00:04:54.280> to<00:04:54.400> get<00:04:54.520> crazier<00:04:54.970> nazir<00:04:55.360> when<00:04:55.570> you're

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
going to get crazier nazir when you're

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.090 
going to get crazier nazir when you're
at<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:55.840> point<00:04:56.020> where<00:04:56.230> like<00:04:56.260> you<00:04:56.590> have<00:04:56.740> kids<00:04:56.950> I

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
at the point where like you have kids I

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.140 
at the point where like you have kids I
don't<00:04:57.220> know<00:04:57.310> if<00:04:57.400> you<00:04:57.460> do<00:04:57.610> or<00:04:57.760> not<00:04:57.790> I<00:04:58.060> don't

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
don't know if you do or not I don't

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.030 
don't know if you do or not I don't
think<00:04:58.480> so<00:04:58.660> we<00:04:58.810> didn't<00:04:59.050> seem<00:04:59.200> doing<00:04:59.950> this

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
think so we didn't seem doing this

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.980 
think so we didn't seem doing this
anyway<00:05:00.280> that<00:05:00.520> thing<00:05:00.550> but<00:05:01.000> when<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.480> kids<00:05:01.750> when

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
anyway that thing but when you kids when

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.300 
anyway that thing but when you kids when
you<00:05:02.080> have<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.260> mortgage<00:05:02.650> payment<00:05:02.800> when<00:05:03.250> you

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
you have a mortgage payment when you

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.560 
you have a mortgage payment when you
have<00:05:03.400> all<00:05:03.550> these<00:05:03.700> things<00:05:04.000> but<00:05:04.180> ultimately

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
have all these things but ultimately

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.630 
have all these things but ultimately
none<00:05:04.780> of<00:05:04.870> those<00:05:04.960> are<00:05:05.170> as<00:05:05.320> important<00:05:05.920> as<00:05:06.100> you

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
none of those are as important as you

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.790 
none of those are as important as you
and<00:05:06.820> him<00:05:07.030> anyways<00:05:07.480> so<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.080> have<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.590> set<00:05:08.770> aside

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
and him anyways so you have to set aside

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.430 
and him anyways so you have to set aside
the<00:05:09.040> time<00:05:09.190> as<00:05:09.370> hard<00:05:09.640> as<00:05:09.790> that<00:05:09.820> is<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.600> you<00:05:11.200> have
