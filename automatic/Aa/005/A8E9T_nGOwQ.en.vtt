probably downgrade under not downgrade

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.069

but be careful with their money on the
spendings<00:01:02.530> we<00:01:03.280> have<00:01:03.489> seen<00:01:03.730> a<00:01:04.229> phenomenal

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
spendings we have seen a phenomenal

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.020 
spendings we have seen a phenomenal
growth<00:01:05.470> we<00:01:05.800> ended<00:01:06.160> this<00:01:06.310> year<00:01:06.369> with<00:01:06.759> about<00:01:07.000> a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
growth we ended this year with about a

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.469 
growth we ended this year with about a
22<00:01:07.420> percent<00:01:07.660> growth<00:01:08.170> in<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:09.160> recessionary<00:01:09.729> and

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
22 percent growth in a recessionary and

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.620 
22 percent growth in a recessionary and
a<00:01:10.570> like-for-like<00:01:10.810> 11<00:01:11.530> percent<00:01:11.950> so<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.880> would<00:01:13.360> I

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
a like-for-like 11 percent so I would I

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.330 
a like-for-like 11 percent so I would I
would<00:01:13.780> say<00:01:13.810> that<00:01:14.229> we<00:01:14.799> have<00:01:14.890> done<00:01:15.070> very<00:01:15.100> well

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
would say that we have done very well

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.730 
would say that we have done very well
during<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.970> recession<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:16.600> because<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:17.560> this

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
during the recession and because of this

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.950 
during the recession and because of this
now<00:01:17.920> I<00:01:18.220> believe<00:01:18.580> that<00:01:18.970> it's<00:01:19.479> only<00:01:19.659> going<00:01:19.869> to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
now I believe that it's only going to

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.050 
now I believe that it's only going to
get<00:01:20.080> better<00:01:20.229> so<00:01:20.830> what<00:01:20.979> kind<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.310> revenues<00:01:21.880> have

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
get better so what kind of revenues have

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.429 
get better so what kind of revenues have
you<00:01:22.180> witnessed<00:01:22.390> since<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.900> launch<00:01:23.110> of<00:01:23.350> the

iconic store earlier this year they have
been<00:01:27.840> probably<00:01:28.840> better<00:01:29.530> than<00:01:29.770> I'd<00:01:29.890> expected

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

so i from whatever the initial stages we
have<00:01:52.180> seen<00:01:52.509> we<00:01:53.229> anticipate<00:01:54.070> some<00:01:54.280> good<00:01:54.490> growth

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729

going<00:01:55.210> forward<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.920> are<00:01:57.009> your<00:01:57.100> sort<00:01:57.340> of

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
going forward what are your sort of

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.969 
going forward what are your sort of
future<00:01:57.759> projections<00:01:58.420> for<00:01:58.750> iconic<00:01:59.200> for<00:01:59.860> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
next yellow saying iconic for me I think

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.249

is of a huge size a format like this

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.059 
is of a huge size a format like this
would<00:02:33.340> work<00:02:33.700> definitely<00:02:34.599> in<00:02:35.049> something<00:02:35.500> so

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069

Saudi is very good to build the brand
form<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:39.040> course<00:02:39.280> as<00:02:39.430> we<00:02:39.549> go<00:02:39.700> forward

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
form and of course as we go forward

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.479

we'll take it into Kuwait as a group we

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.550 
we'll take it into Kuwait as a group we
are<00:02:42.519> very<00:02:42.790> we<00:02:43.269> are<00:02:43.299> very<00:02:43.569> well<00:02:43.780> positioned<00:02:43.989> in

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
are very we are very well positioned in

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.949 
are very we are very well positioned in
the<00:02:44.709> region<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.640> growing<00:02:46.329> into<00:02:46.599> new<00:02:46.750> markets

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
the region so growing into new markets

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.170 
the region so growing into new markets
move<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.739> not<00:02:48.190> going<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.519> be<00:02:48.609> a<00:02:48.640> challenge<00:02:49.120> for

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
move is not going to be a challenge for

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.410 
move is not going to be a challenge for
us<00:02:49.329> but<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.530> think<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.129> we<00:02:51.760> should<00:02:52.000> be<00:02:52.150> opening

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
us but I think so we should be opening

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
us but I think so we should be opening
at<00:02:52.540> least<00:02:52.720> five<00:02:52.989> stores<00:02:53.409> in<00:02:53.909> 2011

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
at least five stores in 2011

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
kind of woman on man so I think so

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.479

brother<00:03:43.389> than<00:03:43.660> taking<00:03:43.930> smash<00:03:44.379> or<00:03:44.680> iconic<00:03:45.160> into

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
brother than taking smash or iconic into

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.479 
brother than taking smash or iconic into
your<00:03:45.639> up<00:03:45.819> today<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.449> believe<00:03:47.379> will<00:03:48.010> be<00:03:48.160> taking

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
your up today I believe will be taking

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.360 
your up today I believe will be taking
brands<00:03:49.019> between<00:03:50.019> brands<00:03:50.470> like<00:03:50.829> smash<00:03:51.160> and

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
brands between brands like smash and

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.460 
brands between brands like smash and
iconic<00:03:51.669> I<00:03:51.849> think<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.120> iconic<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.750> easier<00:03:53.290> to

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
iconic I think so iconic is easier to

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.770 
iconic I think so iconic is easier to
