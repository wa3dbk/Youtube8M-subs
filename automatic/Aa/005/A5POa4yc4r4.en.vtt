00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
it's got some pretty good I actually

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.310 
it's got some pretty good I actually
have<00:01:14.310> never<00:01:14.580> seen<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.060> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.420> substrate

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
have never seen this kind of substrate

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.719

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
sold in any kind of shops yet so I

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.249 
sold in any kind of shops yet so I
thought<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> might<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:21.180> nice<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.509> try<00:01:21.930> using

thought it might be nice to try using

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.200 
thought it might be nice to try using
this<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.299> hopefully<00:01:24.299> he'd<00:01:24.750> use<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.640> that's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this and hopefully he'd use it so that's

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.210 
this and hopefully he'd use it so that's
