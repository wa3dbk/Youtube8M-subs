00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hi folks I'm just going to show you this

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.610 
hi folks I'm just going to show you this
video<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.130> link<00:00:05.430> in<00:00:05.690> 2005<00:00:06.690> navigator

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
video this is a link in 2005 navigator

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.860 
video this is a link in 2005 navigator
and<00:00:08.220> there<00:00:09.179> are<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.300> lot<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.450> people<00:00:09.750> out<00:00:09.840> there

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
and there are a lot of people out there

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.749 
and there are a lot of people out there
that<00:00:10.170> don't<00:00:10.260> actually<00:00:10.530> do<00:00:10.889> mechanical<00:00:11.309> stuff

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
that don't actually do mechanical stuff

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.520 
that don't actually do mechanical stuff
so<00:00:12.000> they<00:00:12.150> won't<00:00:12.300> know<00:00:12.420> where<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.809> fluids<00:00:13.320> go

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
so they won't know where the fluids go

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.039 
so they won't know where the fluids go
in<00:00:13.769> their<00:00:13.950> car

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
in their car

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.990 
in their car
so<00:00:16.049> I'm<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.440> going<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> show<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:17.000> straight

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
so I'm just going to show you straight

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.890 
so I'm just going to show you straight
forward<00:00:18.420> where<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.779> put<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> fluids<00:00:20.449> so<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
forward where to put the fluids so the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.060 
forward where to put the fluids so the
power<00:00:22.199> steering<00:00:22.710> fluid<00:00:24.140> if<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.740> go<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:25.980> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
power steering fluid if you go in the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.830 
power steering fluid if you go in the
driver<00:00:26.340> side<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.789> car<00:00:27.000> you'll<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.420> three

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
driver side the car you'll see three

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.350 
driver side the car you'll see three
three<00:00:28.590> tanks<00:00:29.269> this<00:00:30.269> one<00:00:30.539> here<00:00:30.929> right<00:00:31.410> here

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
three tanks this one here right here

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.810 
three tanks this one here right here
closest<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.309> front<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> car

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
closest to the to the front of the car

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.500 
closest to the to the front of the car
is<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:37.829> power<00:00:38.040> steering<00:00:38.399> fluid<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:39.000> my

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
is the power steering fluid in my

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.360 
is the power steering fluid in my
navigator<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.739> actually<00:00:40.829> see<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> little

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
navigator you can actually see a little

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.490 
navigator you can actually see a little
picture<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.879> steering<00:00:42.660> wheel<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
picture of a steering wheel on it so you

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.639 
picture of a steering wheel on it so you
know<00:00:43.620> now<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:45.660> engine<00:00:45.989> coolant<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
know now the engine coolant or the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.150 
know now the engine coolant or the
radiator<00:00:47.180> yes<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.390> radiator<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.649> front<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
radiator yes the radiator is up front to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.670 
radiator yes the radiator is up front to
the<00:00:50.190> car<00:00:50.489> however<00:00:51.480> there's<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> reservoir<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the car however there's a reservoir and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.490 
the car however there's a reservoir and
overflow<00:00:53.039> reservoir<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.289> is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
overflow reservoir for it and that is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.010 
overflow reservoir for it and that is
this<00:00:55.770> tank<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> take<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
this tank right here so you take that

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.369 
this tank right here so you take that
lid<00:00:58.289> off<00:00:58.340> again<00:00:59.340> never<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.730> when<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.030> hot<00:01:00.379> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
lid off again never do when it's hot and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.359 
lid off again never do when it's hot and
then<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:02.039> fill<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.730> radiator<00:01:03.059> fluid

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
then you can fill up the radiator fluid

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.280 
then you can fill up the radiator fluid
the<00:01:05.369> power<00:01:06.060> brake<00:01:06.630> fluid<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.650> right<00:01:08.520> here<00:01:08.909> that

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
the power brake fluid is right here that

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.820 
the power brake fluid is right here that
tank<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.380> there

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
tank right there

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.690 
tank right there
is<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> power<00:01:11.670> brakes<00:01:13.189> that's<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.520> brake

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
is for the power brakes that's the brake

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.160 
is for the power brakes that's the brake
fluid<00:01:14.960> now<00:01:16.070> that's<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.310> dipstick

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
fluid now that's the dipstick

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.590 
fluid now that's the dipstick
for<00:01:19.170> measuring<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.850> amount<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.909> oil<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
for measuring the amount of oil that is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
for measuring the amount of oil that is
in<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.810> car<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.130> other<00:01:23.159> fluid<00:01:23.720> is<00:01:25.880> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
in the car and the other fluid is the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.969 
in the car and the other fluid is the
oil<00:01:27.119> which<00:01:27.900> goes<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:28.680> on<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
oil which goes this is now on the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.960 
oil which goes this is now on the
passenger<00:01:29.579> side<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.280> simply<00:01:32.729> take
