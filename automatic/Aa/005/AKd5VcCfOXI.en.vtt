us one of the inventors of the state aid
mr.<00:00:47.320> Starrett<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.960> is<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.559> staring<00:00:50.980> we<00:00:51.670> use

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
mr. Starrett this is the staring we use

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.549 
mr. Starrett this is the staring we use
a<00:00:51.850> three<00:00:52.120> wheel<00:00:52.329> cluster<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:53.020> roll<00:00:53.170> up<00:00:53.410> and

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
a three wheel cluster to roll up and

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.670 
a three wheel cluster to roll up and
down<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.829> stairs

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
down the stairs

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.770 
down the stairs
you<00:00:56.680> can<00:00:56.829> see<00:00:57.040> how<00:00:57.219> much<00:00:57.280> much<00:00:57.910> easier<00:00:58.149> to<00:00:58.570> get

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
you can see how much much easier to get

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.190 
you can see how much much easier to get
up<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.260> stairs<00:00:59.700> using<00:01:00.700> this<00:01:01.000> then<00:01:01.750> using<00:01:02.110> a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
up the stairs using this then using a

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.740 
up the stairs using this then using a
regular<00:01:02.410> rolling<00:01:02.739> backpack<00:01:03.250> also<00:01:04.239> each

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
regular rolling backpack also each

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.320 
regular rolling backpack also each
individual<00:01:05.440> wheel<00:01:05.710> rolls<00:01:06.190> separately<00:01:06.700> so<00:01:07.300> you

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
individual wheel rolls separately so you

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.100 
individual wheel rolls separately so you
can<00:01:07.509> take<00:01:07.660> it<00:01:07.750> up<00:01:07.869> stairs<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.310> on<00:01:12.520> flat<00:01:12.759> ground

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
can take it up stairs and on flat ground

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.240 
can take it up stairs and on flat ground
into<00:01:14.110> easy<00:01:14.289> our<00:01:14.770> descent<00:01:15.310> down<00:01:16.090> stairs<00:01:17.250> we

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
into easy our descent down stairs we

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.740 
into easy our descent down stairs we
added<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:19.140> disc<00:01:20.140> brake<00:01:20.440> system<00:01:20.470> right<00:01:21.369> here<00:01:21.750> so

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
added a disc brake system right here so

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.719 
added a disc brake system right here so
all<00:01:22.899> you<00:01:23.020> have<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:23.200> do<00:01:23.440> is<00:01:23.709> squeeze<00:01:24.099> the<00:01:24.340> handle

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
all you have to do is squeeze the handle

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.370 
all you have to do is squeeze the handle
and<00:01:24.910> it<00:01:25.390> locks<00:01:25.599> up<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.959> cluster<00:01:26.140> from

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
and it locks up the cluster from

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.219 
and it locks up the cluster from
spinning<00:01:26.830> but<00:01:27.789> notice<00:01:28.090> how<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.990> wheels

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
spinning but notice how the wheels

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.419 
spinning but notice how the wheels
themselves<00:01:29.759> are<00:01:30.759> still<00:01:31.030> rotated<00:01:31.509> so

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
themselves are still rotated so

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.380 
themselves are still rotated so
basically<00:01:33.429> you<00:01:33.610> can<00:01:33.789> take<00:01:33.910> it<00:01:34.030> anywhere<00:01:34.270> you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
basically you can take it anywhere you
