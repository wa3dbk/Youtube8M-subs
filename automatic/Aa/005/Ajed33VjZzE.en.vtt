like<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.890> know<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.250> double<00:01:03.090> check<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> make

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
like you know I double check to make

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.719 
like you know I double check to make
sure<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.780> was<00:01:03.960> all<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.920> was<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.489> good

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
sure it was all good and it was all good

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.730 
sure it was all good and it was all good
then<00:01:06.450> when<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> doubt<00:01:06.869> bloated<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.560> was

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
then when I doubt bloated it was

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.520 
then when I doubt bloated it was
apparently<00:01:08.040> decent<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:08.670> hell<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.530> checked

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
apparently decent all hell so I checked

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.350 
apparently decent all hell so I checked
this<00:01:10.680> again<00:01:10.979> sure<00:01:11.250> enough<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.670> synced<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.180> in

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
this again sure enough it synced up in

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.030 
this again sure enough it synced up in
the<00:01:12.450> final<00:01:12.780> video<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> uploaded<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:13.860> for

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
god quality sauce what the hell happened
it's<00:01:38.189> because<00:01:38.460> YouTube<00:01:38.880> has<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> process<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it's because YouTube has to process it

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.539 
it's because YouTube has to process it
that's<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.409> reason<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> happens<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.340> no

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that's the reason that happens I have no

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.310 
that's the reason that happens I have no
control<00:01:41.729> over<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.090> unless<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.990> want<00:01:43.140> me<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
control over that unless you want me to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.840 
control over that unless you want me to
make<00:01:43.439> every<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.009> my<00:01:44.070> videos<00:01:44.220> private<00:01:44.790> in

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
make every one of my videos private in

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.010 
make every one of my videos private in
which<00:01:44.970> case<00:01:45.210> stuff's<00:01:45.509> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> get<00:01:45.840> uploaded

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
which case stuff's going to get uploaded

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.510 
which case stuff's going to get uploaded
you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.380> slower<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.159> don't<00:01:47.310> think<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you can slower and I don't think you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.389 
you can slower and I don't think you
want<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.530> bad<00:01:49.530> quality<00:01:49.890> videos<00:01:50.189> is

want that so bad quality videos is

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.340 
want that so bad quality videos is
because<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.729> YouTube<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.350> processes

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
because of YouTube that processes

the<00:02:38.030> assassins<00:02:38.510> creed<00:02:38.750> thing<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.310> people

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
the assassins creed thing that people

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.520 
the assassins creed thing that people
were<00:02:40.819> saying<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.510> I<00:02:41.959> don't<00:02:42.109> even<00:02:42.200> know<00:02:42.349> if<00:02:42.439> it

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
were saying and I don't even know if it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.410 
were saying and I don't even know if it
was<00:02:42.620> me<00:02:42.769> now<00:02:42.920> might've<00:02:43.250> been<00:02:43.310> YouTube<00:02:43.700> but

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.270 
was me now might've been YouTube but
hopefully<00:02:45.379> that<00:02:45.560> recording<00:02:46.099> of<00:02:46.190> the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
hopefully that recording of the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.670 
hopefully that recording of the
recording<00:02:46.760> proves<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.269> it<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:47.930> synced<00:02:48.319> up<00:02:48.409> or

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
recording proves that it is synced up or

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.440 
recording proves that it is synced up or
was<00:02:48.920> synced<00:02:49.280> up<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.700> if<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:49.970> wasn't<00:02:50.150> then<00:02:50.389> you

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450
