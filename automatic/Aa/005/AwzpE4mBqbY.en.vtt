00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
about my opinion of the wheels so I got

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.860 
about my opinion of the wheels so I got
these<00:01:02.390> wheels<00:01:02.859> five<00:01:03.859> days<00:01:04.129> ago<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.940> they're

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
these wheels five days ago and they're

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.570 
these wheels five days ago and they're
cord<00:01:06.650> all<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.550> way<00:01:07.640> around<00:01:07.760> and<00:01:09.160> that<00:01:10.160> kind<00:01:10.490> of

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
cord all the way around and that kind of

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.730 
cord all the way around and that kind of
 tells<00:01:11.300> you<00:01:11.480> about<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.960> longevity<00:01:12.290> of

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
 tells you about the longevity of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.350 
 tells you about the longevity of
this<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.970> these<00:01:14.210> wheels<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:16.430> they<00:01:17.180> don't

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
this of these wheels that they don't

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.000 
this of these wheels that they don't
last<00:01:17.480> that<00:01:17.660> long<00:01:18.190> even<00:01:19.190> at<00:01:19.490> 86<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.200> if<00:01:21.770> you're

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
last that long even at 86 a so if you're

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.440 
last that long even at 86 a so if you're
going<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.160> get<00:01:22.310> these<00:01:22.550> they<00:01:22.790> definitely<00:01:23.060> don't

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
going to get these they definitely don't

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.830 
going to get these they definitely don't
last<00:01:23.690> that<00:01:23.840> long<00:01:24.070> for<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.160> slide<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:26.030> would<00:01:26.630> say

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
last that long for the slide I would say

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.410 
last that long for the slide I would say
it's<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.470> it's<00:01:27.770> kind<00:01:28.070> of<00:01:28.130> an<00:01:28.250> icy<00:01:28.640> sly<00:01:28.940> kind<00:01:29.360> of

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
it's a it's kind of an icy sly kind of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.350 
it's a it's kind of an icy sly kind of
icy<00:01:29.780> chalky<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:30.980> very<00:01:31.250> controllable<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:32.090> see

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
icy chalky but very controllable I see

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.880 
icy chalky but very controllable I see
so<00:01:32.630> they're<00:01:32.780> not<00:01:32.900> going<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.140> ice<00:01:33.260> out<00:01:33.500> on<00:01:33.680> you

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
so they're not going to ice out on you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.010 
so they're not going to ice out on you
then<00:01:34.070> I<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.340> high<00:01:34.490> side<00:01:34.730> Michael<00:01:34.910> low<00:01:35.180> side<00:01:35.450> so

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
then I can high side Michael low side so

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.200 
then I can high side Michael low side so
very<00:01:36.470> controllable<00:01:36.950> I'd<00:01:37.100> say<00:01:37.340> for<00:01:37.700> quite<00:01:38.180> a

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
very controllable I'd say for quite a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.940 
very controllable I'd say for quite a
sliding<00:01:38.660> wheel<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.080> another<00:01:39.350> thing<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.740> they

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
sliding wheel and another thing is they

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.990 
sliding wheel and another thing is they
feign<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.790> ton<00:01:41.540> first<00:01:42.110> slide<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:43.370> they<00:01:43.730> think

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
feign a ton first slide it they think

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.120 
feign a ton first slide it they think
thing<00:01:44.450> right<00:01:44.690> away<00:01:44.900> staying<00:01:45.500> every<00:01:45.920> single

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
thing right away staying every single

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.330 
thing right away staying every single
time<00:01:46.400> after<00:01:46.760> that<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.590> they<00:01:48.590> were<00:01:48.680> good<00:01:49.040> all

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
time after that and they were good all

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.880 
time after that and they were good all
the<00:01:49.370> way<00:01:49.520> down<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.940> core<00:01:50.210> not<00:01:51.200> any<00:01:51.590> flat

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
the way down to the core not any flat

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.460 
the way down to the core not any flat
spotting<00:01:52.370> a<00:01:52.910> little<00:01:53.450> bit<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:53.900> oval<00:01:54.140> ization

spotting a little bit of oval ization
especially<00:01:55.070> in<00:01:55.160> this<00:01:55.250> wheel<00:01:55.490> but<00:01:56.060> not

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
especially in this wheel but not
