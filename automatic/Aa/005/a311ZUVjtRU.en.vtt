00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
lined up in the middle it's going to

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.810 
lined up in the middle it's going to
come<00:03:00.850> up<00:03:01.060> come<00:03:01.390> down<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.070> need<00:03:03.220> it<00:03:03.430> bounces

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
a look at this comes up comes down

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.080 
a look at this comes up comes down
bounces<00:03:14.350> up<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.620> floor<00:03:14.920> bounces<00:03:15.910> off<00:03:16.060> the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
bounces up the floor bounces off the

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.390 
bounces up the floor bounces off the
bomb<00:03:16.530> bounces<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.680> get<00:03:17.860> some

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 
okay now on to the other map what is it

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.459 
okay now on to the other map what is it
I<00:03:30.650> think<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.189> is<00:03:31.219> Stadium<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:33.230> I'm<00:03:33.290> just
