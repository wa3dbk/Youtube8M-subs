00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
was really hard I ended up having to use

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.050 
was really hard I ended up having to use
melons<00:00:22.560> because<00:00:22.859> they<00:00:23.010> fit<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.460> perfect

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060

color<00:00:24.240> from<00:00:24.449> far<00:00:24.689> away<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.260> he<00:00:25.920> ended<00:00:26.070> up

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
color from far away and he ended up

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.099 
color from far away and he ended up
being<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.730> big<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.570> barely<00:00:27.750> fit<00:00:27.990> him

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109
