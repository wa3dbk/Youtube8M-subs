00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.240
 it will be very good that the secretary of 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.379
 communications and transports gerardo 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.540
 Ruiz-Esparza will expand his statement in 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.169
 around the international airport 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.759
 Mexico City a great pleasure 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:22.519
 first I can only see in this 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.650
 program for the recognition that the 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.990
 airport of the city of mexico is 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.880
 saturated that does not work that the 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.880
 margins of security have narrowed 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.309
 to a degree since it starts to be 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.230
 dangerous and that has become a 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.019
 bottleneck for the development not 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.860
 only from the city ​​of mexico and the valley 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.210
 but for the whole country this situation 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.400
 from the international airport of 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.260
 Mexico City was administered from the 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.790
 government of the marihuanero vicente fox- 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.949
 that he had a secretary that talked to 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.580
 the ducks and we understand why or what 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.439
 we imagine why but the fact is that 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.869
 details of the extension are needed 

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:01.760
 the very optimists say that we are going to 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:04.129
 have an airport like the john f 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.700
 Kennedy of New York that Enlargement 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.130
 does not need new land that good 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.090
 we are in the best of all worlds and that 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.500
 a 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.030
 the runway and a new terminal will make 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.549
 the problems are cleared good there are up 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.619
 who speak of the great arrival and of 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.009
 the companies that could benefit 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.289
 however this is the point again of the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.479
 NWC that it says 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.119
 does not come from building the airport in 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.490
 that area by the operation of the vessel 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.289
 texcoco regulator and it's in this 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.149
 context that secrete communications from 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.219
 the strong ones have to say yes already 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.310
 we did the study if we already took the 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:46.630
 decision or failing to say is a 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.630
 idea in which we are working
