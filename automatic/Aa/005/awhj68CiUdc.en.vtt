00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.640
 although this one time so I do not have 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.390
 was with numbers here they didn't stop at 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.579

 and what do we have here here we go from 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.439
 boy's faces this is post-apocalyptic 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.290
 the future is there some kind of virus 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.400
 there is something for women somewhere not all 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.119
 men disappeared 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.180
 finds each other's thoughts and he understands that 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.390
 hiding something from him 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.700
 he himself flee the city with his dog here 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.940
 In general, I like this fantasy 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.760
 love post apocalyptic that's all in 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.740
 such a thing i found it after how 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.520
 I read 5 grandchildren and said something 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.470
 similar so in general then this 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.050
 I will definitely make a separate video when 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.840
 I'll read the entire trilogy of the song organs and 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.700
 and the hundred were the book shot of the same name 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.979
 series her just adore if you don't 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.990
 looked then be sure to look and here 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.050
 I decided to read the book although you can hear that 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.060
 the book seems to be worse than the show 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.880
 I know 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.300
 I will read, and here the essence was 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.030
 that an atomic explosion occurred and people are you 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.060
 were supervised into space by ships from them 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.030
 there is a whole giant station where 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.220
 they live for about a hundred years but promises 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.160
 run out of air and so on 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.450
 they decide to send hundreds to the ground 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.280
 children and teenagers under 18 so that they 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.530
 checked how there is life on earth 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.850
 or not because their type is not so pitiful 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.860
 prisoners don't care 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.900
 and actually have to tell how they are 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.780
 surviving there on this earth we learn that 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.670
 there generally happened in a hundred years while there 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.549
 there was no humane after atomic 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.890
 explosion in general, I have high hopes 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.590
 it will be full there too three books 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.959
 let's see but the reviews honestly 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.090
 I heard bad and some classics 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.459
 zila and jane austin feel it 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.650
 sensitivity and ma but because i 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.320
 read your prejudices to me 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.620
 liked it so easy to read 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.950
 well written old england don't let 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.380
 always some peace of life charters 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.620
 old england but no matter what i decided 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.680
 take a closer look at this author i 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.920
 of course not very 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.810
 blue novels especially so for such 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.480
 here are frivolous like grids 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.599
 there used to be such girls a little bit judging 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.790
 by book more frivolous and long 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.010
 than now 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.560
 yes because he is in two weeks again 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.489
 all he is my destined ryazheny here but 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.719
 it doesn't matter, but generally I read now 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.760
 sensitivity is somewhere I am pages 100 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:31.099
 so far just passed up to 20 nothing 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.739
 ok quite 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.579
 I will continue on the program so 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.310
 little classics little book and 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.379
 tagirbekova save us maria montana and me 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.669
 compare king over the precipice in the rye 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.010
 Yu.A. 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.359
 and I really love this great work 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.180
 that i should read this book 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.430
 look compare design this is not 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.159

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.599
 how to love on the sides painted and book 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.500
 so here is the overall design 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.629
 cool but 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.180
 what's inside affect young 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.849
 people who go to school marina 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.190
 tannels but this is a reference to montessori all 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.039
 it happens something as i understand it 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.959
 functional author there that is it 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:22.229
 not american not english there author 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.810
 and it was interesting enough for me too 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:31.310
 read some author and another 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:36.090
 countries this kid talk about how 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.789
 a certain segment of his life about 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.169
 relationships with parents about relationships in 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:46.740
 school and really like there but events with 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:50.699
 one idiot boy cheated 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:55.740
 somehow here is his life as a collection of yasaka 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:59.190
 it generally is 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.900
 and not over the abyss in the rye and such know 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:07.080
 booklet read about the train can be 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.270
 here is 150 pages on the way to the cottage not 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.000

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.940

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.430
 video review of the rikaz vodka book series 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.479
 selection so here from this author of the big man 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.060
 selenium book 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:24.500
 because her description attracted me 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.210
 so that it is very very similar to 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.800
 destroy me trilogy is not it 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.680

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.780
 I leave the bottom of the same girl weapon 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.190
 beautiful weapon you could not hear 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.050
 must commit an act that may 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:43.349
 buy our secret tie the relationship with 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.060
 people and all sorts of things to me 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.699
 honestly just wondering 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.699

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.500

 I found out you most likely I will do later 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.039
 necessarily video I think that the book 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.710
 will be read easily and just as well 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:01.380

 12 year old boy of all his some 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.280
 experiences of events at the opening in general 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.590

 Fahrenheit degree 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.689
 and I really like the design exactly 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:44.899
 so their buildings 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:47.299

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:50.199

 video came out not quite its kerchief 

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:59.659
 uninteresting and incomprehensible because it 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:02.119
 my 1 this kind of video I don't know what 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:04.279

 friends for a long time I do not know anything 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:08.869
 I hope that there is at least something sensible 

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:10.879
 I hope that you did not really hear the rain for 

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:18.919
