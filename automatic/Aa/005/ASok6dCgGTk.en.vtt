00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
a kind of a quick review and then I use

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
a kind of a quick review and then I use
them<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.540> video<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.770> made<00:01:43.950> by

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
loved it loved it and this is Ichigo

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.039 
loved it loved it and this is Ichigo
with<00:01:47.369> strawberry<00:01:47.880> flavor<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:48.810> kind<00:01:49.020> of

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
with strawberry flavor and it's kind of

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.880 
with strawberry flavor and it's kind of
like<00:01:49.229> an<00:01:49.350> inside-out<00:01:51.079> pokey<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.710> you've

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
like an inside-out pokey so if you've

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.289 
like an inside-out pokey so if you've
never<00:01:53.100> had<00:01:53.340> these<00:01:53.430> before<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.970> thought<00:01:54.180> you

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
never had these before so I thought you

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.770 
never had these before so I thought you
a<00:01:54.360> quick<00:01:54.600> taste<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:56.130> she's<00:01:56.689> um<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.369> then

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
a quick taste and then she's um and then

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.050 
a quick taste and then she's um and then
make<00:02:00.780> them<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.590> looks<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.579> they<00:02:02.700> come<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
make them so looks like they come in a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.709 
make them so looks like they come in a
pair<00:02:03.740> they're<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:04.950> bit<00:02:05.159> fatter<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:06.240> in

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
pair they're a little bit fatter then in

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.520 
pair they're a little bit fatter then in
diameter<00:02:07.560> than<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.450> pokey<00:02:09.450> which<00:02:10.140> makes<00:02:10.410> sense

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
diameter than a pokey which makes sense

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.220 
diameter than a pokey which makes sense
because<00:02:10.709> they're<00:02:11.250> filled<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.420> let's<00:02:12.750> try

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
because they're filled so let's try

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.339 
because they're filled so let's try

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
like it's just like a strawberry Pocky

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.289 
like it's just like a strawberry Pocky
but<00:02:24.599> it's<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.200> little<00:02:25.379> bit<00:02:25.610> too<00:02:26.610> the--our<00:02:26.909> like

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
but it's a little bit too the--our like

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.850 
but it's a little bit too the--our like
it's<00:02:27.450> got<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.659> little<00:02:27.900> bit<00:02:28.080> firmer<00:02:28.650> bite

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
it's got a little bit firmer bite

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.289 
it's got a little bit firmer bite
because<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:32.340> more<00:02:32.489> substantial<00:02:33.150> and

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
because it's just more substantial and

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.920 
because it's just more substantial and
solid<00:02:34.700> it's<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:36.030> kind<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.269> light<00:02:36.629> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
solid it's not as kind of light and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.619 
solid it's not as kind of light and
crisp<00:02:37.200> as<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> pokey<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:39.030> flavor<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.450> quite

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
crisp as a pokey the flavor is quite

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.140

to<00:02:45.299> confess<00:02:45.599> between<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.140> two<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:46.560> think<00:02:47.310> that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
to confess between the two I think that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.630

I Pope you better pokey answers just a
little<00:02:50.849> bit<00:02:51.349> it's<00:02:52.349> got<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.530> more<00:02:52.680> delicate<00:02:52.950> kind

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519

of<00:02:53.640> texture<00:02:54.629> this<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:55.410> little<00:02:55.709> heavier<00:02:56.840> but

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
of texture this is a little heavier but

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.750 
of texture this is a little heavier but
in<00:02:57.930> terms<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.290> flavor<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:59.220> essentially<00:02:59.640> the

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
mine i nuked for about a total of I

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.319 
mine i nuked for about a total of I
think<00:03:54.840> about<00:03:55.019> 90<00:03:55.500> seconds<00:03:55.889> so<00:03:56.519> here's<00:03:57.120> my

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
think about 90 seconds so here's my

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.080 
think about 90 seconds so here's my
chocolate<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.169> here's<00:03:58.739> my<00:03:58.919> mold<00:03:59.160> so<00:03:59.579> all<00:03:59.970> we

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
chocolate and here's my mold so all we

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:14.220 
chocolate and here's my mold so all we
gotta<00:04:00.239> do<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:01.700> fill<00:04:02.700> our<00:04:02.910> mold<00:04:05.569> with<00:04:06.569> chocolate

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.190 

so<00:04:15.230> I'm<00:04:15.380> filling<00:04:15.650> it<00:04:15.770> to<00:04:15.920> about<00:04:16.870> 3/4<00:04:17.870> of<00:04:17.900> the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
so I'm filling it to about 3/4 of the

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:27.910 
so I'm filling it to about 3/4 of the
way<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:21.970> then<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.000> just<00:04:23.300> take<00:04:23.510> your<00:04:26.830> skip<00:04:27.830> the

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
way and then you just take your skip the

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.590 
way and then you just take your skip the
taps<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.700> chocolate<00:04:29.060> will<00:04:29.180> settle<00:04:29.360> into

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
taps and the chocolate will settle into

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.980 
taps and the chocolate will settle into
all<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.900> cracks<00:04:30.050> then<00:04:30.950> just<00:04:31.160> take<00:04:31.340> your

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
all the cracks then just take your

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.260 
all the cracks then just take your
cookie<00:04:32.990> stick<00:04:33.260> or<00:04:33.410> your<00:04:33.500> topo<00:04:33.860> stick<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.340> drop

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
it into the little channel and it fits
