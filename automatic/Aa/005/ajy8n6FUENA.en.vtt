00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello, I'm an angel and I'm going to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.499
 explain in a simpler way that 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.280
 the previous one to record xbox 360 games 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:19.010
 of type xgd3 all this with the xbox 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.020
 updated to 3.0 lithium 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:27.480
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.750
 is to go here to the page of the bird gx and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.610
 get off this some of you will already have it 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.710
 It is important 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:42.490
 then discovered a new program that 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:45.160
 it's called this xbox 360 and they are hackers 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.830
 is a new application the truth is that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.870
 It's pretty good because it does everything to you 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:54.310
 You can easily find it by 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:58.960
 internet you put our 66 hacker and there 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:04.120
 you look for it is very simple first we 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:07.040
 we go to the oldness x 360 that you see and 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.790
 here we look for the iso 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.100
 in this case we have it here is the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.100
 great of the fsb the smooth 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.969
 this is going to start patching the sun 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:26.450
 it will take 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:29.140
 of 5 minutes no less I'm going to stick it and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.140
 then we go back 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.990
 good as you see once the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.030
 process that will take us to 5 minutes 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.000
 we will see what we have left that many 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.790
 they were familiar here we see that it is the 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.180
 game comes out the achievements of what we 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.490
 it matters what we care about 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.750
 that we must check that everything is verified if 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.670
 I recommend that if any yellow or 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.500
 something in red that you pass again 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.929
 because sometimes he does not catch it and this is 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.899
 xgd3 confirmed then once 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.490
 confirmed that we go to this part 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.620
 xgd3 hack 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.660
 and this what we are going to do is hack 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.460
 what in theory this does is that a 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.810
 the time to record do not record it truncates 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.310
 tri but to record it as it were to the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.310
 one hundred percent although I do not know if 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.960
 that's really reliable because you already know 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.480
 than to record one hundred percent 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.680
 you need the recorder this special from 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.819
 litronas but good here we select 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.329
 the iso we open 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.629
 and we give star and this is going to make a 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:46.439
 another process because 5 or 6 minutes does not take 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:49.760
 a lot so now when I finish the 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.760
 process with new 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.140
 good continuing once you're done 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.990
 all that 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.140
 we are going to the same folder will create us 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:06.000
 another iso created difference 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.730
 check then select 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.159
 we open it 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.989
 we put the virgin double- layer DVD and it's 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.590
 highly recommended that it be of the brand 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:23.540
 verb here or many times does not work 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.519
 or there are problems and the main thing is that the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.350
 people use another brand and it has to be 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.650
 just this one 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.440
 good this process that is going to give now 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.040
 it's going to take quite a long time 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.040
 why 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.610
 has as it say it first record it 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.160
 and then he goes to verify and recommend 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.400
 that during this process you do not use the 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.140
 computer because it will go very slow ian 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.060
 hore harm when recording 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:58.500
 but good the wait is worth it 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:03.360
 then we give you to be 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:07.080
 and here it is important that we will leave 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:10.380
 dais here marc is the speed 2.4 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.340
 because if not then there are problems is 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.790
 same and we give it to burn 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.519
 and this process starts only as I say 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.610
 It seems that it will take a lot but not 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.340
 worry because it makes everything perfect 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.139
 I'm recording the new one right now 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.820
 uniform spirit most wanted that has 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.520
 left today 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.100
 and say that at the moment the new games 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.440
 does not command speak a single problem except the 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.600
 fifa 13 that I think is giving 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.370
 problems and you can not record it just 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.220
 you can record with the recorder that I'm 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.600
 saying but I repeat you test it 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.640
 who because who knows 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.680
 well then when the process is finished 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.490
 I come back to finish 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.490
 and it is 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.969
 good for you to see that there is no cheating 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.870
 I have finished here 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.710
 to record it 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.710
 let's take the cd 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.780
 we will see 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.580
 we wait for it to load 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.129
 we see that you have read it already 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.440
 there we have it 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.300
 and it is already 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.730
 and ready
