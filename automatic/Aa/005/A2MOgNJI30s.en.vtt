 replay 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.869
 mass guests but lost to everyone else 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.030
 teams over the past two weeks and 120 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.399
 champions were piquant or calling for 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.899
 47 while comparing to the first week 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.570
 from the draft completely from the gearbox 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.399
 me rat dmaa and Zion is gaining 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.680
 the popularity of bart appeared on starserii 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.290
 but physics is no higher than a hut 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.869
 also 3 week pleased with forest choke 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.650
 there we make and and nocturne them and she returned 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.170
 doesn't know zero the area syndrome 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.670
 the most sought-after champions were 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.920
 gragas rip simon okay 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.510
 alistar hekarim and either on the last 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.880
 week win rate ricks and materiality 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.950
 weight a and for almost 5 10 steel teams 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.330
 less often and 5 baths of Sejujan which was 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.550
 popular in the first week 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.230
 In addition, with the new patch came rice 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.060
 but in the only game where its not 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.730
 banned he did not show himself 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.520
 however as one topliner used to say 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.010
 the pirate is not to blame for the dream team 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.990
 last week irelia nunu cassiopeia 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.270
 eat and morgan each of these champions 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.190
 fed or feared at least five times and 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.380
 has the highest wins on 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.150
 its role is interesting that almost so 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.280
 in the same way they opened up the series of victories 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.620
 trend reporter is true instead but they 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.200
 used graco with the best players 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.020
 at each of the positions steel paris zan 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.940
 zara baby and miracle and lemongrass all players 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.420
 performed well over the past two 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.160
 of the week 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.470
 but especially it should be noted gragasa 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.480
 zanzarah played on this champion without 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.480
 deaths and a total of when two games 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.700
 amounted to 42 units without deaths played and 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.160
 miracle whose sheet so no one 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.590
 could stop the most ramirez of the 20th 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.970
 season put poker big baby poker on 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.190
 46 seconds 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.019
 typical shoulder like arkady could go into 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.400
 a long fight but maokai was too 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.300
 far to somehow support 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.550
 the team 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.980
 play on the turn also did not work 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.470
 on this record for the earliest fb 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.110
 belonged to the tour well who used to play 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.480
 in should tell highest souls 3 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.010
 participation successfully support the team 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.080
 dolphin with which is the third time 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.360
 turns out to be the champion of this category 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.130
 always ready to give a helping hand even 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.840
 in the wildest mules of his team 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.590
 somehow has time to save 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.570
 teammates 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.580
 or letting it live enough debt 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.530
 to fit into the period I'm not talking 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.530
 about his ability to call the opponent 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.630
 This skill does not take away his record by 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.820
 the number of view again got Lex 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.160
 which in two weeks made exactly two 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.739
 times more kilo beyond that to him 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.630
 belongs and 1 pint of summer split under 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.820
 end of the match against the building 1 lex 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.100
 initiated the last fight which quickly 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.420
 outgrown the massacre 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.370
 considering the advantage of harville and on that 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.980
 moment and smoothly play all the teams 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.140
 he got this pint more easily than on 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.150
 Minsk last week gave us 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.459
 also a few squares of match 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.680

 nashora JUST initiated by Nautilus in 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.310
 and quickly dealt with him 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.110
 but then switched to tape and so 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.240
 leaving the enemy on a dakar without 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.979
 supervision is not enough for the account of a member of 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.360
 survival hole and well and you and us 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.430

 Timfight Zinja Could Kill Seller 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.770
 taking advantage of the retreat of Vladimir and 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.630
 teleport arch karim focusing on 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.580
 one goal at a time a year a hole on could 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.000
 make pen tool but kill breaks 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.440
 got salt and finally the last quad 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.539
 was made flash in the night 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.699
 remember the dream sims cassiopeia which 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.440

 in the year of the lex just pulled him closer to 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.500
 his team so flash survived 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.630
