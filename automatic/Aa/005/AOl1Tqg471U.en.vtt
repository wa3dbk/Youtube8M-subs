a yearbook you also have to pay that for
my<00:00:44.730> school<00:00:45.120> um<00:00:45.829> it's<00:00:46.829> 30<00:00:47.129> dot<00:00:47.399> thirty<00:00:48.120> dollars

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
my school um it's 30 dot thirty dollars

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.799 
my school um it's 30 dot thirty dollars
