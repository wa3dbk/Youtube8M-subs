00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
field was still blocked off so he

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.310

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
the dogs which being large breeds would

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.830 
the dogs which being large breeds would
probably<00:04:39.650> not<00:04:39.860> happen<00:04:40.340> and<00:04:40.490> do<00:04:41.120> that<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.539> then

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
probably not happen and do that and then

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.719 
probably not happen and do that and then
get<00:04:41.960> back<00:04:42.110> out<00:04:42.320> without<00:04:43.130> me<00:04:43.430> hearing<00:04:43.699> about<00:04:43.970> it

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
get back out without me hearing about it

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.510 
get back out without me hearing about it
because<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.449> barn<00:04:46.659> was<00:04:46.840> from<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.680> 1800s<00:04:48.340> we

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520
