00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.420
 just show a little s10 lt booth 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:18.820
 simple the attack this tire more than tr 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.820
 it's a good visual appeal for her 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.640
 not even flex fuel 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:43.150
 the fagot bucket looks like a pool of 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.150
 so big 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.810
 this one is measured 245 75 ring 16 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:26.120
 I gave her a very aggressive look. 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:28.010
 It was pretty well the same as 245 75 rim 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.960
 16 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.570
 but you can see what's left over in the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.850
 wheel box from within gives to put 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.850
 a much larger measure still 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:58.550
 this is the very dark lt version here 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.680
 but it is a well complete car system 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:06.050
 anti-overhead has already shown 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:09.490
 about this case my other videos the 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.490
 cool finish 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.950
 the pope 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:29.140
 the staff asks a lot about f10 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:33.790
 diesel cabin fib people s10 diesel 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:38.080
 simple cabin only has in option ls that the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:42.070
 input option a more targeted option 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.190
 for work is much less equipped in the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.800
 interior is for three people not 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:52.060
 for two people as in lt 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:55.720
 the S-10 single diesel cabin 4 for two 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:03.460
 I think 75 thousand 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:06.310
 the version 4 by 4 80 thousand to a cannon 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.810
 car goes too far s-10 single cabin 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:15.130
 deviation to a monster walks too many drives 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.230
 once a very difficult car to 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.090
 We pick up and shoot some text. 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.050
 It is because it is very rare and usually for 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.360
 For those who buy already leads direct 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.970
 for work for farm work 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.959
 It's hard to see an S-10 cabin 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:36.340
 simple urban diesel 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.870
 they do not have a version yet 10 and 10 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.590
 single diesel cabin 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.970
 I believe that soon they should launch 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.130
 but for now who wants to buy a 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:51.250
 s10 diesel 4 for 4 single cab 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.220
 for now it only has in version ls that the 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.350
 version of the s10 a version of 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.739
 simpler finish more focused 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.739
 for work
