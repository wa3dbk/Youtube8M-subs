00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.279
 youtube 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.869
 we are here again I am here from 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.970
 new 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:28.119
 today we will give you a tutorial of 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.919
 how to make a house in the maya 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.910
 So how are you guys going to do this? 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:37.129
 They'll have your the bobs program here then. 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.430
 I chose the photo of my house because 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.230
 she's beautiful but the idea is always the same 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.190
 You can create any photo but I can 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.710
 I have posted in the video description the 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.539
 this image here at home is beautiful 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.850
 wonderful has even the mouse 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.980
 pet underneath has a beautiful story 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.949
 among the people but not the case 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.910
 first you will come you will 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.620
 put in polygons right here in this 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.210
 knew that if you do not touch lyons powder that is 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.630
 used to do what we want 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:16.190
 do and now I decided to create here the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.890
 side and mori fae and not on us snows 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.720
 processed in pole gomes and that has the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.310
 geometric objects that you can give 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:30.289
 create then you will come here in care 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:33.500
 a cube that more or less of this 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:36.459
 size increase as you go 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.429
 You will press once to click the r 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:42.470
 and there it comes and if that belly 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.380
 modifier here that will be able to raise or 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.099
 down to the other and pressing the 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.929
 w 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:49.489
 It's going to make you move the other side. 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.759
 to another 

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:54.890
 the basic concepts for and also another 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.770
 important thing is one of the most 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.709
 used is the audio you hold it and 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.680
 you can normally click the button 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:05.200
 right 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.140
 as is so left for you gives me 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.300
 so move with the middle button that is 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.490
 the scrollbar gives you to die 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.930
 this way and with the left for you 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:21.160
 approaching or separating 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.730
 then you press the 4 or 5 key you 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.490
 change the option with with kitchen or if in 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.940
 the kitchen by which you get easier on the 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.880
 your situation is primarily in our 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.910
 Beautiful house that we will have, yes we will. 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.370
 make the window door partitions with 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:47.890
 Who are you going to do this to? 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:51.760
 adnet and will choose an insight is 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.980
 deluge so that you can stand against the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.700
 fip to click on it it will appear fine 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.070
 on here 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.540
 the idea I already put here then the 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:06.280
 pay it there you go when you click 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.380
 in it you will stay an ad and will create 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.799
 this line around all the lord 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.799
 geometric figure 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.010
 Now you 're going to make the best of the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.350
 door and is is at least basic where you 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.670
 will find the most options from where 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.600
 Do you want to change you will be left with 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.940
 if you secure it over the figure and 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.080
 will be able to choose between is vortex and 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.750
 made the difference between them the edge goes 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.549
 be what these lines are like now 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.549
 you are able to select by yourself 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:52.049
 ex is just the dots made 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:55.840
 ready now you will select face 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:59.260
 to be able to exclude places where 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.400
 will have five space is not going to have no 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.680
 It's going to be stamped. 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.470
 so if you look here in my 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:15.980
 my house at home so far the market 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:19.100
 the computer to watch here 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:23.390
 Enjoy the bridesmaids here so it 's 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:29.950
 let's make them do it let's follow 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.950
 not use another modification which is 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:44.320
 the name that she will fill your bar 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.280
 It's going to stay in her. She'll give it to you if that 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.060
 money is fado 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.950
 here you will be able to stay in it 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.310
 select point from the other to how far 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:05:04.160
 You want her to be more or less? 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:08.150
 sure that's right it's not right 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.430
 we are then a bit difficult to 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.910
 it jumps right in the points 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:18.860
 has another vertex so I will use it again 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:21.080
 they stay here so you can use them 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:28.850
 to close this match to use the 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:31.790
 charges of the then closing down here 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:35.300
 ready for you now you power 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:45.380
 that relief will go easy select 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:49.370
 you want the nec faces in the kiev 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:53.450
 shakhtar type that the relief of the face of a 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.250
 muzzle ready 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:59.930
 so you'll want your window now 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:01.600
 My beautiful window, I 'm just going to create one. 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.729
 plan 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.930
 and I'm going to shoot him 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:11.300
 ready ready now there is this bug 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.810
 here this is studied and everything else 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.060
 Are you leaving here the boring watch See the 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.849
 hotel resort convenience does slutty 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.740
 then you're with me for you power 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.830
 run it leave the books position i 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:29.870
 think about the position such are you come here 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:33.020
 with squeezing it is this tool engrave 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.449
 You fiddle with angles that delight. 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.300
 So how are you going to combine these 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:42.229
 objects can select the two come here 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:46.820
 moves the medium and Hajduk will click with 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:48.740
 ticket he is not playing forever 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:53.800
 forgotten since it appeared in the 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:57.199
 It's just that it's going to be beautiful , anyway. 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.810
 So the door will let you ready. 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:01.430
 video maybe you had to do it like this 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.889
 As the roof is because it is very 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:05.840
 I was able to make a record time. 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:13.870
 the roof-to-roof door has already passed a 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:18.349
 time now, we have a door 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:21.530
 important, nor does the roof now 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:25.820
 the roof is just the roof 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:29.509
 so the roof you will stay in file 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:31.969
 the cut does not have more to make separate 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:35.930
 so do you click port on 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:40.690
 and here's the roof, so it's 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.690
 This is going to watch until the end and
