 Unboxed today we will do the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.690
 field product test here in 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.760
 this rugby field where lab is a bit 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.859
 the higher and more efficient the test will be 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.109
 slightly distorted but that's okay 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.240
 we have incorporated the michaels pixel 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.740
 inside the adidas adizero shoe 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.300
 f50 trx firme ground in such a way as to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.949
 be able to perform a workout that is there 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.170
 been programmed by a coach 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.610
 do up to the glories and see if 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.690
 actually the data reported 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.160
 within training 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.379
 will correspond with those detected 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.680
 the word is good from micro chips now 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.680
 to the field 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.880
 this is the result of the test on 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.280
 field 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.000
 my mom after I have to wash them said 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.950
 this 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.350
 now let's synchronize the data 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.119
 detected by the michaels pixel 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.080
 within the session of 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.570
 workout to see if indeed 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 match with what is produced by mine 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.659
 muscles 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.460
 then during the test we take 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:46.539
 synchronize well synchronization is 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.539
 completed 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.050
 now let's visualize the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.300
 workouts we went to find 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.950
 upload the data recorded by the michaels 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.780
 pixel 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.700
 inside the shoe during the two 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.590
 workouts performed today on 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.929

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.700

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.340
 see a little longer it was one 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.100
 little jog that I wanted to do 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.780
 after training for 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.680
 always check the quality of the data 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.690
