00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
that in the end fact is that they still

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:58.689 
that in the end fact is that they still
have<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.140> bit<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.320> work<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.739> do<00:00:57.859> but<00:00:58.160> as<00:00:58.370> Impaler

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.549 
working on it they gained their plan
together<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.149> they<00:01:02.600> can<00:01:02.749> only<00:01:02.870> get<00:01:03.140> strong<00:01:03.410> in

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.470 
together and they can only get strong in
my<00:01:03.649> opinion<00:01:03.920> yeah<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.970> follow<00:01:05.150> up<00:01:05.330> on<00:01:05.449> that

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
my opinion yeah to follow up on that

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.670 
my opinion yeah to follow up on that
point<00:01:05.810> we<00:01:05.900> saw<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:06.140> they<00:01:06.259> were<00:01:06.500> very

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
point we saw that they were very

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.740 
point we saw that they were very
aggressive<00:01:06.860> both<00:01:07.310> Impaler<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.150> selfie<00:01:08.630> they

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
aggressive both Impaler and selfie they

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.359 
aggressive both Impaler and selfie they
really<00:01:09.079> wanted<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:09.500> make<00:01:09.680> place<00:01:09.920> happen<00:01:10.220> which

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
really wanted to make place happen which

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.010 
really wanted to make place happen which
i<00:01:10.460> think<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.759> very<00:01:10.850> good<00:01:11.060> sign<00:01:11.210> coming<00:01:11.930> into

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
i think is a very good sign coming into

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.499 
i think is a very good sign coming into
the<00:01:12.500> season<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:12.979> is<00:01:13.130> when<00:01:13.280> it<00:01:13.400> works<00:01:13.579> but<00:01:14.450> it

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
the season it is when it works but it

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.630 
the season it is when it works but it
didn't<00:01:14.930> always<00:01:15.200> work<00:01:15.530> I<00:01:16.100> think<00:01:16.310> a<00:01:16.340> little<00:01:16.490> bit

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
didn't always work I think a little bit

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.490 
didn't always work I think a little bit
of<00:01:16.729> over<00:01:17.030> aggression<00:01:17.540> I<00:01:17.659> still<00:01:18.140> think<00:01:18.170> in

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
of over aggression I still think in

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.910 
of over aggression I still think in
Palin<00:01:18.860> Lisa<00:01:19.100> needs<00:01:19.460> some<00:01:19.790> some<00:01:20.630> more<00:01:20.810> time<00:01:21.049> his

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
Palin Lisa needs some some more time his

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.620 
Palin Lisa needs some some more time his
early<00:01:22.280> game<00:01:22.460> decision-making<00:01:23.000> is<00:01:23.270> not<00:01:23.509> the

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
early game decision-making is not the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.319 
early game decision-making is not the
greatest<00:01:24.100> when<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:25.250> play<00:01:25.430> early<00:01:25.729> you<00:01:25.939> can<00:01:26.119> get

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
greatest when you play early you can get

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.899 
greatest when you play early you can get
kills<00:01:26.780> earlier<00:01:27.259> on<00:01:27.500> if<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:28.070> pick<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.759> right

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
kills earlier on if you pick the right

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.249 
kills earlier on if you pick the right
engages<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.509> I<00:01:29.570> don't<00:01:29.810> think<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:30.140> he's

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.490 
and using a pink odd in the right
position<00:03:37.299> so<00:03:37.329> they<00:03:37.720> actually<00:03:37.840> have<00:03:38.199> vision

actually pink all a little bit further
in<00:03:42.129> on<00:03:42.280> that<00:03:42.400> second<00:03:42.819> Baron<00:03:43.060> attempt<00:03:43.359> but<00:03:43.540> as

in on that second Baron attempt but as

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.050 
in on that second Baron attempt but as
you<00:03:44.139> said<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:44.470> seems<00:03:44.680> like<00:03:44.859> let's<00:03:45.609> just<00:03:45.819> do<00:03:46.030> it

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
you said it seems like let's just do it

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.689 
you said it seems like let's just do it
because<00:03:46.569> there's<00:03:46.840> nothing<00:03:47.160> more<00:03:48.160> immediate

you<00:04:29.460> rotate<00:04:30.180> how<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.630> use<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.710> lanes<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.640> how

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
you rotate how you use the lanes and how

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.150 
you rotate how you use the lanes and how
use<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.150> waves<00:04:33.500> because<00:04:34.500> they<00:04:34.650> were<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.010> good

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
use the waves because they were so good

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.980 
use the waves because they were so good
at<00:04:35.250> like<00:04:35.490> stacking<00:04:35.940> up<00:04:36.210> the<00:04:36.240> waves<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.720> at<00:04:36.870> the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
at like stacking up the waves and at the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.900 
at like stacking up the waves and at the
point<00:04:37.200> where<00:04:37.500> these<00:04:37.980> weights<00:04:38.280> were<00:04:38.490> about<00:04:38.760> to

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
point where these weights were about to

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.460 
point where these weights were about to
hit<00:04:39.000> your<00:04:39.120> Tower<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:39.510> you<00:04:39.720> wanted<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.170> go<00:04:40.260> down

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
hit your Tower and you wanted to go down

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.780 
hit your Tower and you wanted to go down
there<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.830> take<00:04:41.010> all<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.250> waves<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:41.730> they

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
there to take all the waves but they

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.970 
there to take all the waves but they
gave<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.060> no<00:04:42.990> time<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.500> take<00:04:43.650> this<00:04:43.770> wave

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
gave you no time to take this wave

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.400 
gave you no time to take this wave
everybody<00:04:44.850> from<00:04:45.000> SKT<00:04:45.450> trying<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.020> work<00:04:46.230> with

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
everybody from SKT trying to work with

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.320 
everybody from SKT trying to work with
this<00:04:46.530> giant<00:04:46.860> wave<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.430> this<00:04:47.700> can<00:04:47.910> admit<00:04:48.210> you

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
this giant wave and this can admit you

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.030 
this giant wave and this can admit you
to<00:04:48.660> make<00:04:48.870> use<00:04:49.080> of<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.680> go<00:04:49.800> for<00:04:49.980> another

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
to make use of it and go for another

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.860 
to make use of it and go for another
push<00:04:50.400> not<00:04:51.090> like<00:04:51.270> just<00:04:51.660> too<00:04:52.230> slow<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.890> party

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.210 

honestly<00:04:57.870> I<00:04:57.960> think<00:04:58.080> every<00:04:58.530> team<00:04:58.710> needs<00:04:58.770> an

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
honestly I think every team needs an

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.190 
honestly I think every team needs an
analyst<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.850> problem<00:05:00.270> is<00:05:00.420> you<00:05:00.450> need<00:05:00.930> to<00:05:00.960> have

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
analyst the problem is you need to have

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.380 
analyst the problem is you need to have
a<00:05:01.440> good<00:05:01.680> at<00:05:01.800> ice<00:05:01.950> that<00:05:02.280> dies<00:05:02.460> like<00:05:02.760> there<00:05:03.270> is

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
a good at ice that dies like there is

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.960 
a good at ice that dies like there is
the<00:05:03.570> tools<00:05:04.200> of<00:05:04.320> dev<00:05:04.620> ed<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:05.040> getting<00:05:05.580> someone

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
the tools of dev ed you getting someone

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.880 
the tools of dev ed you getting someone
who<00:05:06.150> is<00:05:06.270> really<00:05:06.480> dedicated<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.350> it's<00:05:07.650> like

who is really dedicated and it's like
actually<00:05:08.160> good<00:05:08.550> at<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.760> game<00:05:08.790> you<00:05:09.030> can<00:05:09.210> be

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
actually good at the game you can be

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.290 
actually good at the game you can be
tough<00:05:09.540> it<00:05:10.080> have<00:05:10.290> to<00:05:10.650> be<00:05:10.680> like<00:05:11.220> this<00:05:11.490> which<00:05:12.120> have

tough it have to be like this which have
the<00:05:12.630> same<00:05:12.660> College<00:05:13.230> as<00:05:13.410> you<00:05:13.680> as<00:05:13.800> a<00:05:13.830> player<00:05:14.070> /

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
the same College as you as a player /

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.270 
the same College as you as a player /
better<00:05:15.600> than<00:05:15.900> you<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.320> think<00:05:16.770> we<00:05:16.860> have<00:05:16.890> someone

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
chick just be about the crystal because

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.990 
chick just be about the crystal because
is<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:21.810> best
