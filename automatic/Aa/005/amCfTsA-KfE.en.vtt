it
one<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.550> tongue<00:00:37.219> this<00:00:38.219> mesh<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.210> don't<00:00:40.020> know

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
one is the tongue this mesh I don't know

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.740 
one is the tongue this mesh I don't know
if<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.620> out<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:42.090> mesh<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.600> they

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
if you can get it out the mesh that they

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.959 
if you can get it out the mesh that they
use<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.890> tongue<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:45.510> when<00:00:46.469> they

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
use here on the tongue it when they

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.520 
use here on the tongue it when they
finished<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.180> off<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.410> it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
finished it off you can see here it's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.119 
finished it off you can see here it's
like<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:50.250> fries<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.360> bit<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.129> it's

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
like it fries out a little bit and it's

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.650 
like it fries out a little bit and it's
kind<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.550> pokey<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:55.489> when<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> wear<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> usually

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
kind of pokey and when I wear I usually

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.410 
kind of pokey and when I wear I usually
wear<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.500> Volga<00:00:58.980> socks<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.059> they're

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
wear on like Volga socks and they're

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.930 
wear on like Volga socks and they're
like<00:01:00.570> thinner<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> top<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.010> sometimes<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
like thinner on the top so sometimes the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.630 
like thinner on the top so sometimes the
little<00:01:03.210> threads<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> tongue<00:01:04.640> because

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
little threads of the tongue because

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.800 
little threads of the tongue because
it's<00:01:05.820> more<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.270> rigid<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.380> nylon<00:01:07.650> material

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
it's more of a rigid like nylon material

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.560 
it's more of a rigid like nylon material
they<00:01:09.810> poke<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.290> top<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:10.710> foot<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.119> mean

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
they poke the top of your foot so I mean

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.080 
they poke the top of your foot so I mean
if<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.930> would<00:01:13.140> do<00:01:13.680> something<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.189> maybe

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
if they would do something with maybe

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.140 
if they would do something with maybe
like<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.600> putting<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> cap<00:01:16.850> around<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> edge

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
like just putting a cap around the edge

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.060 
like just putting a cap around the edge
of<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.479> tongue<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.439> right<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.950> can

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
of this tongue like right here you can

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.590 
of this tongue like right here you can
see<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.369> kind<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.610> frayed<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.450> bit

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
see it's kind of frayed a little bit

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.649 
see it's kind of frayed a little bit
like<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.710> pokes<00:01:22.979> sometimes<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:24.540> not

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
like it just pokes sometimes it's not

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.920 
like it just pokes sometimes it's not
awful<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.939> if<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> lay<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> tongue<00:01:27.750> just

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
awful and if you lay the tongue just

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.030 
awful and if you lay the tongue just
right<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.409> fine<00:01:29.270> but<00:01:30.270> otherwise<00:01:30.590> that's<00:01:31.590> one

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
right it's fine but otherwise that's one

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.060 
right it's fine but otherwise that's one
my<00:01:32.220> issues<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.939> other<00:01:33.119> issue<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.079> foam

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
my issues the other issue is the foam

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.679 
my issues the other issue is the foam
here<00:01:35.630> um<00:01:37.009> picks<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
here um picks up you can see here it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.550 
here um picks up you can see here it
picks<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.079> rocks<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.259> gets<00:01:43.439> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
picks up rocks like it it's if it gets a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.230 
picks up rocks like it it's if it gets a
good<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.070> here<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.759> got<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:44.970> good

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
good one like here like it's got a good

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.270 
good one like here like it's got a good
divot<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.720> there<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.380> um<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.979> gets<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.250> pretty

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
divot in there it um it gets a pretty

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.280 
divot in there it um it gets a pretty
good<00:01:47.520> dent<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> picks<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.689> rock<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.140> don't

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
good dent and it picks a rock so I don't

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.749 
good dent and it picks a rock so I don't
know<00:01:49.380> if<00:01:49.439> they<00:01:49.560> could<00:01:49.710> recess<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.430> somehow

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
know if they could recess that somehow

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.249 
know if they could recess that somehow
or<00:01:51.680> maybe<00:01:52.680> lay<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.159> rubber<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.810> don't

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
or maybe lay the rubber like I I don't

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.510 
or maybe lay the rubber like I I don't
know<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.560> they're<00:01:55.829> trying<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
know I know they're trying to have that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
know I know they're trying to have that
the<00:01:57.210> flexibility<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:57.990> that's<00:01:58.140> where<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the flexibility but that's where the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.569 
the flexibility but that's where the
weave<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.979> it's<00:01:59.100> really<00:01:59.219> not<00:01:59.399> that

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
weave is so it's really not that

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.690 
weave is so it's really not that
flexible<00:01:59.850> anyway<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> don't<00:02:01.590> know<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.189> grabs

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
flexible anyway so I don't know it grabs

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.789 
flexible anyway so I don't know it grabs
rocks<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.390> little<00:02:03.540> bit<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:04.500> one<00:02:04.680> thing

then you're running you feel the ball

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.739 
then you're running you feel the ball
like<00:02:22.670> kind<00:02:22.939> of<00:02:23.030> poke<00:02:23.209> on<00:02:23.329> the<00:02:23.389> bottom<00:02:23.629> of<00:02:23.689> your

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
foot otherwise I like the design it's a

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.729 
foot otherwise I like the design it's a
little<00:02:27.469> bit<00:02:27.590> more<00:02:28.629> crazy<00:02:29.629> than<00:02:29.870> I'm<00:02:30.109> used<00:02:30.139> to

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
little bit more crazy than I'm used to

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.220 
little bit more crazy than I'm used to
well<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.159> guess<00:02:31.459> not<00:02:31.969> if<00:02:32.030> you<00:02:32.239> if<00:02:32.629> you<00:02:32.840> look<00:02:33.049> at

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
well I guess not if you if you look at

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.610 
well I guess not if you if you look at
if<00:02:33.769> you<00:02:34.099> look<00:02:34.250> at<00:02:34.400> those<00:02:34.579> shoes<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:36.139> mean<00:02:36.500> as

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
if you look at those shoes but I mean as

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.580 
if you look at those shoes but I mean as
far<00:02:36.650> as<00:02:36.859> like<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:38.629> stitching<00:02:39.109> is<00:02:39.260> kind<00:02:39.319> of

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
far as like the the stitching is kind of

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.789 
far as like the the stitching is kind of
crazy<00:02:40.689> it's<00:02:41.689> a<00:02:41.870> good<00:02:42.049> it's<00:02:42.469> a<00:02:42.530> good<00:02:42.620> design

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
crazy it's a good it's a good design

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.739 
crazy it's a good it's a good design
shoe<00:02:43.189> the<00:02:43.459> shoe<00:02:43.489> supports<00:02:44.209> me<00:02:44.329> really<00:02:44.569> well

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:44.749 
shoe the shoe supports me really well

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.610 
shoe the shoe supports me really well
it's<00:02:45.290> been<00:02:45.500> helping<00:02:45.859> me<00:02:45.980> with<00:02:46.159> my<00:02:47.109> my<00:02:48.109> ankle

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
it's been helping me with my my ankle

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.369 
it's been helping me with my my ankle
cuz<00:02:49.159> I<00:02:49.329> overpronate<00:02:50.329> so<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.540> kind<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:51.109> guess

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
cuz I overpronate so I kind of I guess

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.979 
cuz I overpronate so I kind of I guess
when<00:02:51.739> I'm<00:02:51.829> running<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.310> like<00:02:52.609> my<00:02:53.269> foot<00:02:53.569> tweaks

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
when I'm running I like my foot tweaks

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.470 
when I'm running I like my foot tweaks
so<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.949> wave<00:02:55.129> kind<00:02:55.489> of<00:02:55.579> gives<00:02:55.760> me<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:56.000> support

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
so the wave kind of gives me the support

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.110 
so the wave kind of gives me the support
so<00:02:57.379> that<00:02:57.560> I'm<00:02:57.680> not<00:02:57.919> over<00:02:58.310> like<00:02:58.579> twisted<00:02:59.000> my

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
so that I'm not over like twisted my

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.390 
so that I'm not over like twisted my
ankle<00:02:59.150> in<00:02:59.629> so<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.650> think<00:03:00.919> it<00:03:01.010> helps<00:03:01.219> me<00:03:01.370> out

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
ankle in so I think it helps me out

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.020 
ankle in so I think it helps me out
really<00:03:01.669> well<00:03:02.079> otherwise<00:03:03.099> I<00:03:04.099> remember<00:03:04.849> with<00:03:05.000> my

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
really well otherwise I remember with my

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.229 
really well otherwise I remember with my
Mizuno<00:03:05.959> Wave<00:03:06.099> Nirvana's<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.639> rubber<00:03:07.939> they

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
Mizuno Wave Nirvana's the rubber they

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:15.280 
Mizuno Wave Nirvana's the rubber they
use<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.930> really<00:03:09.530> really<00:03:12.909> like<00:03:13.909> it<00:03:14.540> lasts<00:03:15.199> a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
use is really really like it lasts a

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.619 
use is really really like it lasts a
good<00:03:15.469> good<00:03:15.829> while<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:16.790> you're<00:03:17.180> not<00:03:17.269> gonna<00:03:17.389> have

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
good good while so you're not gonna have

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.050

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
wears off they actually last a pretty

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.830 
wears off they actually last a pretty
good<00:03:24.439> amount<00:03:24.889> of<00:03:24.949> time<00:03:25.659> again<00:03:26.659> they're

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
good amount of time again they're

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.379 
good amount of time again they're
comfortable<00:03:27.319> and<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:30.220> like<00:03:31.220> them<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.669> just<00:03:32.209> it's

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
comfortable and I like them I just it's

comfortable and I like them I just it's
just<00:03:32.479> just<00:03:32.720> like<00:03:33.079> two<00:03:33.319> little<00:03:33.560> things<00:03:33.889> that<00:03:34.069> I

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
just just like two little things that I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.399 
just just like two little things that I
wish<00:03:34.489> they<00:03:34.699> I<00:03:35.060> would<00:03:35.840> hope<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.019> they<00:03:36.290> would

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409 
wish they I would hope that they would

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.580 
wish they I would hope that they would
fix<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:36.889> the<00:03:36.979> next<00:03:37.189> revision<00:03:38.019> otherwise<00:03:39.019> I

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
fix in the next revision otherwise I

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.610 
fix in the next revision otherwise I
would<00:03:40.009> probably<00:03:40.189> get<00:03:40.400> another<00:03:40.609> pair<00:03:40.939> I<00:03:41.780> did

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
would probably get another pair I did

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.809 
would probably get another pair I did
run<00:03:42.949> in<00:03:43.220> my<00:03:43.879> Nikes<00:03:44.359> again<00:03:44.659> last<00:03:44.989> night<00:03:45.169> I

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
run in my Nikes again last night I

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.770 
run in my Nikes again last night I
stopped<00:03:46.819> running<00:03:47.000> in<00:03:47.299> them<00:03:47.449> because<00:03:47.659> I

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
stopped running in them because I

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.300 
stopped running in them because I
figured<00:03:48.290> my<00:03:48.590> weight<00:03:48.799> was<00:03:48.949> up<00:03:49.159> higher<00:03:49.400> and

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
figured my weight was up higher and

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.259 
figured my weight was up higher and
because<00:03:52.310> my<00:03:52.430> weight<00:03:52.579> was<00:03:52.699> up<00:03:52.849> higher<00:03:53.000> that's

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
because my weight was up higher that's

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.550 
because my weight was up higher that's
part<00:03:53.720> of<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.870> reason<00:03:54.079> I<00:03:54.139> was<00:03:54.229> having<00:03:54.409> a<00:03:54.470> little

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
part of the reason I was having a little

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
in these and then I was like well let me

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.740 
in these and then I was like well let me
just<00:03:58.519> throw<00:03:58.609> the<00:03:58.759> Nikes<00:03:59.030> on<00:03:59.150> for<00:03:59.389> a<00:03:59.419> different

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.820 
ankle has been bothering me I went with

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
this because it just gives you that

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.290 
this because it just gives you that
stability<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:07.090> um<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.860> just<00:05:08.860> kind<00:05:09.820> of<00:05:09.940> got<00:05:10.120> into

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
stability so um I just kind of got into

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.060 
stability so um I just kind of got into
the<00:05:10.480> mood<00:05:10.600> I<00:05:10.810> originally<00:05:11.260> didn't<00:05:11.500> like<00:05:11.680> Nike

from running world and that helped so

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.330 
from running world and that helped so
much<00:05:36.130> more<00:05:36.540> and<00:05:37.540> I<00:05:37.840> was<00:05:37.990> I<00:05:38.170> swore<00:05:38.710> off<00:05:38.740> Nikes

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
much more and I was I swore off Nikes

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.720 
much more and I was I swore off Nikes
because<00:05:39.730> of<00:05:39.850> the<00:05:39.940> way<00:05:40.060> the<00:05:40.210> shocks<00:05:40.480> felt<00:05:41.730> but

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
because of the way the shocks felt but

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.450 
because of the way the shocks felt but
uh<00:05:42.760> I<00:05:44.010> now<00:05:45.010> I'm<00:05:45.460> open<00:05:46.210> to<00:05:46.390> everything<00:05:46.750> um<00:05:47.460> the

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
uh I now I'm open to everything um the

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.130 
uh I now I'm open to everything um the
only<00:05:48.580> shoes<00:05:48.820> I<00:05:48.940> haven't<00:05:49.210> the<00:05:49.480> only<00:05:49.630> brands<00:05:50.020> I

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
only shoes I haven't the only brands I

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.080 
only shoes I haven't the only brands I
really<00:05:50.530> have<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.680> tribe<00:05:50.950> of<00:05:51.220> the<00:05:51.340> most<00:05:51.700> popular

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
really have a tribe of the most popular

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.940 
really have a tribe of the most popular
brands<00:05:52.330> are<00:05:52.510> saucony<00:05:53.020> and<00:05:53.350> I<00:05:53.650> think<00:05:53.860> it's

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
brands are saucony and I think it's

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.130 
brands are saucony and I think it's
because<00:05:54.190> they<00:05:54.280> have<00:05:54.400> a<00:05:54.430> narrower<00:05:54.850> toe<00:05:55.180> box<00:05:55.450> um

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
because they have a narrower toe box um

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.390 
because they have a narrower toe box um
that's<00:05:56.410> one<00:05:56.560> good<00:05:56.770> thing<00:05:56.800> actually<00:05:57.070> about

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
that's one good thing actually about

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.990 
that's one good thing actually about
these<00:05:58.320> Mizuno<00:05:59.320> like<00:05:59.710> my<00:05:59.980> Nirvana's<00:06:00.760> were<00:06:00.970> a

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
these Mizuno like my Nirvana's were a

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.850 
these Mizuno like my Nirvana's were a
little<00:06:01.210> bit<00:06:01.390> more<00:06:01.540> narrow<00:06:01.780> here<00:06:02.140> they<00:06:02.650> give

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
little bit more narrow here they give

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.800 
little bit more narrow here they give
you<00:06:02.980> more<00:06:03.160> room<00:06:03.370> in<00:06:03.550> this<00:06:03.670> toe<00:06:03.880> box<00:06:04.120> so<00:06:04.510> I<00:06:04.540> don't

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
so that's the way of paradox the new
