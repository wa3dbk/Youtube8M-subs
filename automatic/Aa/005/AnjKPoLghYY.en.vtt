00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.809

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.350
 We will continue to work hard, so please continue your favors . 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:04.690
 Well 8 Last week I couldn't meet you, but we 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:09.729
 We held a seminar that doubles as a real person 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:13.510
 It is I am allowed to study together with the people of there in 32 people 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.170
 Though we had you the last questionnaire each let 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:21.170
 What kind of thing 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.620
 The savings method that was often in the arcade mean I want a little more study 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.630
 It was about 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:33.470
 So I would like to study with you a little about savings today 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.570
 First of all as savings 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.750
 I'm going to cut it off 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:47.320
 I think that banks will come out first if you say that you deposit savings money 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:51.610
 When I thought about what kind of person I would deposit with the bank 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:57.220
 Actually, in the old days it was extremely advantageous to deposit in a bank 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.760
 So there is a proposal art that there are many people who are entrusted still to the bank 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:09.289
 For example 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:15.859
 I 've deposited 1 million yen for 10 years now It has increased to 1.45 million yen in the old days with virtue 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:17.740
 If you put 1 million yen now, it will be only 11,000 thousand yen in 10 years 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:22.970
 Not turned 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:28.220
 The important point is the case where it did not exceed Aichi that has increased 450,000 years ago 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.800
 Still, everyone is still in the bank 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.230
 What is this ? 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.980
 safe and secure 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.130
 That's why 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.950
 If you leave it to the bank 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.480
 Safe terrain 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.080
 Money 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.910
 It is possible to go reservoir to be able to to put to sleep 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:57.010
 That's why we all put money in the bank 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:03:04.360
 Well then , if it's safe or secure if you're deposited in a bank, the bank will handle us 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:08.440
 That's because I'm making the money I've made money from now on international now 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.580
 Banks turn to government bonds 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.080
 Stable 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:18.440
 The copy 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.810
 In a mechanism that can be returned through government bonds and can be returned to you 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.910
 Become which was 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.440
 So how would you why government bonds safe 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.250
 It is to say the government bonds 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.870
 The country needs funds Make a road 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:42.020
 Or you can use the money for the sake of speaking, social security now 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:43.720
 That's when you say that what is issued when a country raises funds is called international 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.060
 Because 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.260
 It is because the country secures 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.349
 this 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:55.480
 The country promises from the beginning that how much money you deposit will be returned 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.020
 You are not 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:04.200
 Words 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:07.670
 As long as when properly government bonds come back the country does not collapse key countries is not something strange era 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.540
 That's why it is said to be safe and secure 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:16.489
 But what about now take a look at the world 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:23.840
 Should we say that international security is absolutely safe ? 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:30.169
 Finally, the international safety myth is about to collapse 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:32.420
 You can see this by looking at the euro Greece Portugal Italy Spain 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:38.380
 Any country 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:42.490
 Say the ToshiTadashi Noboriæ¡“can redeem government bonds is not able to misunderstanding 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.490
 Compress even in the state of blocked Happo 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.400
 Is the present condition 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.090
 Well then 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.070
 Even though 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:57.690
 You will be thrilled 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:59.070
 Japan may think that there is not such a thing, but in fact, even today in the country 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.220
 Related 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.780
 How to capture 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:09.660
 The concept is changing little by little 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:12.720
 That's it- well read in the newspaper 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:19.889
 Even though it's a word that stick to the eye 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:26.910
 For example, an article in the Asahi Shimbun on February 3rd Mitsubishi c ufj 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:29.230
 We will take the risk measures to prepare when government bonds plunge 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.060
 It was glue say 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:39.860
 Although it's a thing called What the elaborate Chana 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:41.289
 In other words, Mitsubishi ufj holds the largest government bonds among private financial institutions . 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:47.529
 But 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:50.940
 It is that the government bond that they possess is accompanied by the price falling sharply 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:58.230
 As soon as government bonds are likely to plunge 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:06:00.400
 Let's sell and immediately sell the system to minimize loss 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.940
 When you are trying to introduce 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.950
 So maybe that's about 2016 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:12.900
 We have calculated that say 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:15.139
 Of course that does not mean that government bonds will plummet 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:21.800
 The point can not be affirmed 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:23.060
 Government bonds may go as it is or maybe plunge who is this 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.819
 I do n't even know 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:32.240
 Safe asset = international because it will be safe until now 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:34.320
 It was said that but it is somehow different 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.810
 The whole market 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.470
 It is the present condition that we are beginning to feel 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:44.860
 In other words 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:48.030
 Low risk low return because it is safe and secure even if you leave the bank until now 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.000
 It was good with less discless car return 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:55.420
 From now on 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.420
 Risk is middle risk but there is little return 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:06.280
 I think you a little out of balance and I supposed to say 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:14.390
 Well then, it is only Japan that has just been deposited with banks in the first place 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:17.360
 What kind of savings do people living in developed countries of foreign finance do? 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:21.139
 They are from elementary school 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.889
 About investment and management savings insurance 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:26.060
 I study such things 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:28.510
 I I've been taught at school 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:35.320
 That's why they 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:38.680
 I will study with you again next week about what kind of savings you are making 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.840
 I would like to do 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.220
 To the end today 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:49.889
 Thank you very much for watching you and look forward to seeing you again next week 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.889
 Thank you very much for doing
