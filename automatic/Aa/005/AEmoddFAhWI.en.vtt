00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello friends with you Ilya about what 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.130
 proper eloquent and reads the inscription 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.800
 on my starbuck glass you know take off 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.840
 video on iphone is very simple but much 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.700
 harder to shoot this video this way 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.250
 to avoid shaking 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.080
 so that the sound is good enough 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.300
 today we will talk about what 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.519
 you and I may need to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.750
 to make a decent enough video 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.750
 on iphone let's get started 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.820
 first of all in order to avoid 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.739
 cutting in the frame we need a tripod in 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.350
 our disposal are regular state videos in 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.550
 late we use every day 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.800
 ski video filming in turn can 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.269
 get yourself some steadic 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.160
 written off iphone or guru 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.960
 2 important part of our video 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.540
 is of course the sound in order to 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.250
 achieve the most optimal sound for us 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.379
 Of course, you will need some 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.930
 external funds in this case this 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.270
 road smart love + microphone 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.339
 designed specifically for iphone 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.130
 either the same android devices cost 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.320
 this device is 4000 rubles 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.330
 plus minus store dependencies in 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.550
 which you get it to the same 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.250
 sound quality you get 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.229
 can already hear this striking 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.580
 difference from what it records 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.490
 built-in microphone 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.259
 iphone the third item that us 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.660
 be sure to also take in 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.090
 attention is weather conditions 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.190
 since smartphones cameras have a very 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.530
 small in physical size 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.310
 sensor they are very sensitive to 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.200
 lack of light and its excess in 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.780
 As a result, if there is not enough light 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.060
 then we get a large number of very 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.630
 unpleasant visual noise case with 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.880
 an excess of light here and there we 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.679
 peresvetov will appear that is 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.009
 too bright areas 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.780
 to avoid this problem the weather is us 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.679
 will need something like us 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.750
 Shoot it now darkens the light still 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.390
 enough but at the same time the sky 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.520
 overcast moderately cloudy 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.380
 way we avoid overexposure and 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.290
 Respectively not to light in the frame 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.209
 all video footage is shot on iphone 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.310
 and actually why we used 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.610
 application films about it just because 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.250
 that it offers us shooting with much 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.069
 higher bitrate and respectively 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.829
 quality 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.079
 on this, friends have the honor to be with you 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:29.849
 poppies above my name Ilya subscribe 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.769

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:39.859
 let's shoot a video on iphone 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:39.859
