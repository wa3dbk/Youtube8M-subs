harbor<00:00:57.280> teaming<00:00:57.610> itself<00:00:57.879> obviously<00:00:57.969> everyone

harbor teaming itself obviously everyone

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.630

for<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.899> club<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:23.409> think<00:01:23.979> if<00:01:24.069> we<00:01:24.220> went<00:01:24.369> I<00:01:24.490> think

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
for the club I think if we went I think

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.340 
for the club I think if we went I think
I'll<00:01:24.789> give<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:24.970> little<00:01:25.090> buddy<00:01:25.360> also<00:01:25.600> left<00:01:25.810> the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
I'll give a little buddy also left the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.950 
I'll give a little buddy also left the
noise<00:01:26.560> unbeatable<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.640> obviously<00:01:28.569> if<00:01:28.690> we<00:01:28.810> get

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
noise unbeatable and obviously if we get

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.570 
noise unbeatable and obviously if we get
beat<00:01:29.140> ever<00:01:29.740> seen<00:01:29.920> well<00:01:30.159> they'll<00:01:30.340> get<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
beat ever seen well they'll get the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.249 
beat ever seen well they'll get the
treble<00:01:30.880> again<00:01:31.119> so<00:01:31.330> I<00:01:31.569> think<00:01:31.750> it's<00:01:31.929> important

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
treble again so I think it's important

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.899 
treble again so I think it's important
for<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.470> rest<00:01:32.649> of<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.830> clubs<00:01:33.280> in<00:01:33.369> Scotland

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
for the rest of the clubs in Scotland

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.279 
for the rest of the clubs in Scotland
that<00:01:34.270> we<00:01:34.390> can<00:01:34.569> get<00:01:34.690> a<00:01:34.720> result

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
that we can get a result

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:42.560 
that we can get a result
