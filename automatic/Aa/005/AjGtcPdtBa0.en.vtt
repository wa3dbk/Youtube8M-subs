00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.390

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.409

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.739
 to be brought 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.330
 they had to be used and of course had to be distributed 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.490
 and at the same time we did not talk to the people who volunteered 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.730
