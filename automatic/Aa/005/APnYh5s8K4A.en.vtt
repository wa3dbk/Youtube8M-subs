00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.950
 very good two such here we are and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.650
 good 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.090
 new gameplay black ops 2 wright duel 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.410
 by teams I think it's the first 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.259
 starting that I raise the channel of mourning by 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.779
 equipment and the truth is that it is a way 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.220
 which is quite different from what it is in 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.960
 the other call of duty since as 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.460
 you know in this game because they give you many 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.160
 points for going to the goal for 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.529
 gusts and the truth is that it does not come out 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.210
 profitable as say whether to play hard for 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.279
 equipment compared to the other modes and 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.779
 we ways besides killing as 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.270
 you get lots of points for the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.100
 gusts and many things just 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.650
 for putting the target planting bombs 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.840
 catch good flags etc not 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.430
 a lot of things have given you points but 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.810
 well still I decided to play hard for 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.980
 you will see a few teams siempres 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.600
 team titles of this game my 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.890
 channel do not worry that you will continue 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.960
 taking hard for teams that I know that 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.550
 Many like you but as I said no 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.220
 as much as we are Carlos news 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.060
 that we basically everything your flight 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.160
 by teams 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.910
 but good you see using it mp7 take it 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.350
 mp7 with the silencer and the look that 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.659
 of red dots came the lightsaber 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.280
 complicated and I have to learn the 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.840
 names of things since I mess 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.490
 many times why do I say red dot and 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.619
 red dot we're all used to 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.190
 that is the red dot not the peephole of 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.990
 Red point 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.630
 and the truth is that sometimes I do myself 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.530
 also but well what I said I'm mp7 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.810
 with the silencer and the laser sight is 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.220
 as it is said of stable aim and I 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.350
 like to wear this weapon with silencer 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.390
 I do not carry the others with a silencer 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.420
 since I think it takes away too much damage 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.890
 but this weapon is more for 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.990
 short distances baby 7 in this 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.610
 game since as I said for me the truth 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.140
 is that long distances it seems to me that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.820
 you need to give too many shots like 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.770
 to use it so this is the only 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.200
 submachine gun that I carry with silencer all 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.880
 the others I take without silencer and 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.980
 now you will see what I have 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.240
 I do not have a silencer in there 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.380
 no other three submachine guns and it has 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.780
 taken out to place with them but good 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.000
 you are submachine guns in particular the mp7 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.920
 I like it a lot because I can put it 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.210
 muffler and is not as good as 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.070
 modern warfare 3 that was pretty 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.870
 checadita the truth that is the weapon was 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.400
 better weapon next to oil but good in 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.050
 the mission of xela endorses me doing is the 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.520
 true for the best weapon in the game 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.679
 in this they have balanced and it is quite 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.149
 well even if it's not the best it's a weapon 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.710
 that can be used and can get you 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.770
 good games perfectly with her 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.410
 but good what was being discussed 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.240
 this game itself has a few modes 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.580
 of game where you can get a lot of 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.140
 points for example in demolition you can 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.670
 get perfectly 500 points 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.010
 simply planting a bomb if I do not 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.470
 wrong you get 200 points for planting and 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.520
 300 points if the bomb explodes and the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.810
 truth is that it is an outrage to 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.050
 to be able to get gusts do not have to 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.720
 gusts that style can be v in this 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.730
 you need 400 but if you want to get out 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.580
 a high streak as they are between 1,500 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.620
 thousand 600 and that they give you then a 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.510
 third part of the streak simply 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.980
 to plant a pump and that pump 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.390
 explode more all the casualties you can 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.770
 do while the enemy has the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.010
 truth is that it's a pass, do not be 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.920
 you can inflate in a moment but good 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.690
 the gameplay is 42 as I said and you 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.220
 I promised an example and where would I get the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.110
 dogs you do not see that I have dogs 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.200
 posts and you said pussy took a 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.390
 40 2 For then set that pulls the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.800
 dogs no no I do not take the dogs out 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.620
 I said our daughter a gameplay with dogs 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.060
 but this is not this one, you will not see because 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.620
 I do not take out the dogs at the end of the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.120
 video the truth is that it is something that fucks 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.430
 rather not that I guess it has 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.440
 passed to many and will not be the only one ready 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.160
 I always say that fuck these things are 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.630
 books 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.740
 I 'm not the only one since I've 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.330
 seen many videos on youtube that 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.310
 a lot of people do and this pisses off but 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.230
 come on, you flip good, here I have 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.550
 to this one and I get the sniper this 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.710
 sniper climbs a gameplay with him the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.450
 another day where I say it's playing with 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.390
 the worst is that it is the worst or this is 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.710
 sniper is a real trash 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.360
 always always always sign that 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.280
 whenever you give someone makes the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.210
 marketing or kills a shot if it's not 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.300
 that you give him in the head obviously 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.710
 We try and kill them, you give them a 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.360
 shot and they usually make you shingles 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.780
 You say fuck male call him again and again 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.370
 but good the storms took the attack 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.990
 lightning what salt and dogs the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.460
 truth is that it is with the easiest 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.830
 I see taking out the dogs for me 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.630
 they will need a medium streak to be able to 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.440
 get to the lot be like this quickly in 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.940
 lightning attack kills pretty though it's 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.620
 it depends is not it depends because if you think 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.080
 people inside houses and such the truth is 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.270
 that you do not kill anyone because that does not kill 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.580
 no one or swell with the attack 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.720
 lightning can be of all then I have 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.160
 the what to be and once I have what 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.080
 I would be in what I was in if you see 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.640
 almost gives you the dogs you do not know that 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.960
 it's a streak that in these and that 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.000
 these studies and mo and with him where to be 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.460
 Only then can I get the dogs out 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.200
 quite easy, that's not always so 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.770
 throw a 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.070
 style of being or habit or some 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.900
 so pretty high streak that 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.890
 you have to put that you have to throw the 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.870
 portable and you have to put this 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.190
 covered always try to lay 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.750
 try to cover an area that 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.120
 be covered by your classmates is 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.670
 important that your teammates can 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.960
 Cover you while throwing any streak 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.090
 of casualties since you have many more 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.520
 chances of surviving here you see me 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.140
 to throw it inside him chiringuito 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.940
 this of the beach that there is with all my 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.800
 colleagues around and I take out the 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.510
 cisco dogs and do the dogs and if 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.480
 I say mother, my son, I have the 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.030
 I have dogs, I 'm going 42 and I say 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.680
 balls is over the starting 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.080
 the game ends with the dogs in 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.370
 the hand without being able to throw the dogs 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.530
 there had still been no dogs in the 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.090
 online and I say no to your website and to the dogs 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.470
 and here I'm bloated in this game 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.550
 I swell it takes and it ends but good 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.530
 you know is something that happens to all of us 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.610
 I hope you liked the job 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.870
 the comment has been useful and 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.610
