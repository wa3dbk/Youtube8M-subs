00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.830 
just use your fingers and then let it
dry<00:02:20.110> once<00:02:20.530> it's<00:02:20.680> dry<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.100> clear<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.660> once

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
dry once it's dry it's clear and once

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.560 
dry once it's dry it's clear and once
it's<00:02:23.050> clear<00:02:24.000> get<00:02:25.000> sticky<00:02:26.460> so<00:02:27.460> we're<00:02:28.210> gonna<00:02:28.300> put

it's clear get sticky so we're gonna put
this<00:02:28.690> little<00:02:28.750> tree<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.350> is<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.530> Tim<00:02:29.800> Holtz<00:02:30.070> tie

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
this little tree this is a Tim Holtz tie

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.550 
this little tree this is a Tim Holtz tie
this<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.420> dollar<00:02:31.840> store<00:02:32.110> stuff<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.530> I

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
this is the dollar store stuff that I

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.930 
this is the dollar store stuff that I
glued<00:02:33.340> together

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
glued together

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.270 
glued together
mmm<00:02:34.690> no<00:02:35.050> I'm<00:02:35.230> gonna<00:02:35.380> cut<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.740> out<00:02:35.890> again<00:02:36.210> so

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
mmm no I'm gonna cut this out again so

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.010 
mmm no I'm gonna cut this out again so
one<00:02:39.280> would<00:02:39.520> suggest<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.540> use<00:02:42.540> brown<00:02:43.540> for

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
one would suggest that I use brown for

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.840 
one would suggest that I use brown for
an<00:02:44.110> old<00:02:44.320> dead<00:02:44.680> tree<00:02:44.710> but<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.370> know<00:02:45.490> what<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:45.820> my

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
an old dead tree but you know what in my

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.180 
an old dead tree but you know what in my
world<00:02:46.210> everything's<00:02:46.690> pink<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.080> teal<00:02:47.260> just

world everything's pink and teal just
like<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.430> page<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.830> we<00:02:50.830> are<00:02:50.890> going<00:02:51.130> to<00:02:51.340> use

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
like this page so we are going to use

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.020 
like this page so we are going to use
picked<00:02:52.060> raspberry<00:02:52.350> distress<00:02:53.350> ink<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
picked raspberry distress ink and the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.430 
picked raspberry distress ink and the
nice<00:02:55.180> thing<00:02:55.209> about<00:02:55.420> these<00:02:55.660> foam<00:02:55.900> stamps<00:02:56.320> you

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
nice thing about these foam stamps you

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.080 
nice thing about these foam stamps you
can<00:02:56.470> create<00:02:56.800> them<00:02:56.950> over<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.640> over<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.850> over

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
can create them over and over and over

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.620 
can create them over and over and over
again<00:02:58.180> if<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.510> need<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.870> if<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.440> break<00:02:59.770> up<00:03:00.630> one

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
again if you need to if you break up one

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.390 
again if you need to if you break up one
thing<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.050> might<00:03:02.290> want<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.620> think<00:03:02.830> about<00:03:03.010> and

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
thing you might want to think about and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.199 
thing you might want to think about and
I<00:03:03.550> am<00:03:03.670> actually<00:03:03.880> still<00:03:04.240> thinking<00:03:04.540> about<00:03:04.690> this

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
I am actually still thinking about this

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.240 
I am actually still thinking about this
I'm<00:03:07.209> contemplating<00:03:08.140> actually<00:03:08.500> gluing<00:03:08.980> these

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
I'm contemplating actually gluing these

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.790 
I'm contemplating actually gluing these
to<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.240> square<00:03:10.870> piece<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.110> foam<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.590> that<00:03:11.709> way

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
to a square piece of foam so that way

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.020 
to a square piece of foam so that way
when<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.040> pull<00:03:12.250> them<00:03:12.340> up<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.610> doesn't<00:03:12.790> mess<00:03:13.000> up

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
when you pull them up it doesn't mess up

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.250 
when you pull them up it doesn't mess up
the<00:03:13.240> stamp<00:03:13.420> but<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.720> don't<00:03:13.959> know<00:03:14.020> if<00:03:14.110> that's

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
the stamp but I don't know if that's

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.699 
the stamp but I don't know if that's
gonna<00:03:14.410> make<00:03:14.590> an<00:03:14.709> impact<00:03:19.440> get<00:03:20.440> a<00:03:20.470> good

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
gonna make an impact get a good

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.460 
gonna make an impact get a good
impression

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.050 

so<00:03:26.470> yeah<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:27.100> can<00:03:27.280> get<00:03:27.430> even<00:03:27.640> more<00:03:27.910> out<00:03:27.970> of

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
so yeah you can get even more out of

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.220 
so yeah you can get even more out of
your<00:03:28.209> dies<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.600> the<00:03:28.660> nice<00:03:28.750> thing<00:03:28.959> is<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.110> can

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
your dies and the nice thing is you can

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.520 
your dies and the nice thing is you can
flip<00:03:29.590> them<00:03:29.680> over<00:03:29.830> if<00:03:30.070> you<00:03:30.190> want<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.519> reverse

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
flip them over if you want the reverse

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.080 
flip them over if you want the reverse
you<00:03:32.530> can<00:03:32.860> cut<00:03:33.400> out<00:03:33.430> another<00:03:33.940> piece<00:03:34.209> yeah<00:03:36.090> you

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
you can cut out another piece yeah you

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.400 
you can cut out another piece yeah you
can<00:03:37.269> cut<00:03:37.420> out<00:03:37.450> another<00:03:37.750> piece<00:03:37.959> going<00:03:38.320> the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
can cut out another piece going the

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.290 
can cut out another piece going the
opposite<00:03:38.709> way<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.700> can<00:03:39.820> get<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.000> reverse

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
opposite way and you can get the reverse

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.240 
opposite way and you can get the reverse
so<00:03:41.110> this<00:03:41.260> will<00:03:41.380> work<00:03:41.410> for<00:03:41.709> words<00:03:41.950> and

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
so this will work for words and

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.229 
so this will work for words and
everything<00:03:42.459> if<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.760> want<00:03:42.910> to<00:03:42.970> cut<00:03:43.120> out<00:03:43.209> your

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
everything if you want to cut out your

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.620 
everything if you want to cut out your
letters<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.470> make<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:46.269> know<00:03:46.360> your<00:03:46.540> own

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
letters and make you know your own

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.990 
letters and make you know your own
alphabet<00:03:47.110> stamps<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.650> can<00:03:47.680> do<00:03:47.860> that<00:03:48.010> just

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
alphabet stamps you can do that just

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.410 
alphabet stamps you can do that just
think<00:03:49.720> you're<00:03:50.590> gonna<00:03:50.709> need<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:51.070> use<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:52.060> steel

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
think you're gonna need to use the steel

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.970 
think you're gonna need to use the steel
rule<00:03:52.690> dyes<00:03:52.900> which<00:03:53.170> are<00:03:53.260> they're<00:03:53.410> really

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
rule dyes which are they're really

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.729 
rule dyes which are they're really
really<00:03:54.250> thick<00:03:54.519> dyes<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.840> don't<00:03:56.470> think<00:03:56.620> this<00:03:56.680> is

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
really thick dyes I don't think this is

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.410 
really thick dyes I don't think this is
gonna<00:03:56.920> work<00:03:57.010> with<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.519> chemical<00:03:57.940> reactions

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
gonna work with the chemical reactions

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.140 
gonna work with the chemical reactions
so<00:03:58.660> these<00:03:58.989> ones<00:03:59.170> will<00:03:59.320> work<00:04:00.120> Spellbinders

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
so these ones will work Spellbinders

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.550 
so these ones will work Spellbinders
because<00:04:01.630> they're<00:04:01.780> chemically<00:04:02.170> etched<00:04:02.320> I

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
because they're chemically etched I

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.530 
because they're chemically etched I
doubt<00:04:02.799> they'll<00:04:03.040> work<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:04.209> you<00:04:04.299> know<00:04:04.390> what<00:04:04.510> I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
doubt they'll work but you know what I

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.850
