 and then youtube people I'm linux brs 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.500
 I am here to make a comparative in 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.820
 another site 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.750
 these two devices here I am in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.710
 old and on the back that 3rd point with bar 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.960
 br 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.210
 Ok folks you demand are yours here. 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.890
 models and have them compared 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.150
 there the two are here to do the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.490
 combat 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.920
 Today I'm going to make samsung galaxy s 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.109
 of this cell phone that has more 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.769
 practically a month that was launched by 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:39.579
 samsung that s3 mini that was announced 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.519
 later this month if I'm not mistaken , and the a3 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.629
 day 16 is a thing as it was 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:47.859
 announced by samsung that is 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:50.229
 now officially is 16 and place them 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:54.699
 they will release you can see that it is 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:57.549
 almost identical one cell phone with the other only 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.280
 the s3 me that is a little more rounded 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:04.180
 and the different button 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.270
 so let's go the s2 he use 11 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.930
 reasons to favor favors means 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.030
 to buy it while r 3 mi gives us 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.190
 31 reasons to buy 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.620
 so come on folks I'm going to have a good time 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.830
 fast because there are many reasons someone 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.000
 where are you buying the hard 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.930
 His camera, my God. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.200
 17 16 megapixels versus 6 5 megapixels is 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.940
 wrong this camera staff would not have 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:40.720
 all this is it has led flash while the 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.780
 smn does not have connectivity he says that 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.520
 it's faster 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.280
 5.6 mega bits 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.980
 while another three have another radio not 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.950
 has data storage support via 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.330
 usb the other does not support guys here 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.220
 are a little lost because she has a 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.190
 yes or no the team loses in the middle of 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.030
 The road has a special roof for 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.479
 facebook yes another is not lighter is é 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.859
 slightly less volume is noticeable 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.970
 best semiconductor size ct more 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:16.190
 recent this is true that 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.700
 should be the size of the 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.550
 personal processor 2 is 2 pixels 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.660
 share 11 sub pixel 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.180
 did not understand on some screens 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.460
 especially the woman and two pixels 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.430
 share a submersible is to leave 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.520
 that resolution better for you to deceive 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:42.290
 Your personal eye is this but this camera 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.290
 here she is very wrong here 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.330
 I do not think that's all it 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.510
 we are going to 31 reasons to buy s3 me 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.830
 né browser has line break has 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.900
 free navigation program is 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.540
 recharging more power in the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.740
 battery or the strongest battery has 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:08.150
 a double microphone is thinner slightly 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.450
 the lower is and is narrower 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.020
 he has nfc and if we are not talking about 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.740
 domino s three mini s / n 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.810
 significantly new version of the 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:22.000
 bluetooth from four to three 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.000
 You have to share it 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.720
 multimedia by pf 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.570
 Do you share with the TV or with another 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.910
 device is also appreciably 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.420
 faster downloads 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.840
 it has an hdmi output and has gyroscope 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.560
 can be used as point is hot spot 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.060
 It's not personal, it's translated. 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:51.799
 for us here is the hotspot of wifi to 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:57.920
 speed of the clock is faster is 2 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:04:00.739
 and 1 point 2 against 1 of 1.0 has one foot 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.750
 even the korn is with gorilla glass that 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.410
 found while the other does not have the 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:10.250
 screen is greater than 4.8 against four 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.620
 it has a manual adjustment of the balance of 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.110
 White at the time of taking the picture he shoots 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.580
 in full hd or other has no adjustment 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:22.580
 focus manual yes it is noticeably more 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.729
 megapixels is to decrease density of 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.730
 megapixels has the hdr function which is very 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.000
 important this 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.730
 it's a one photo is better it has two 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.660
 photos of a f around another with dr 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.580
 has the touch ef and if f1 does not know the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.480
 that the personnel has a sensor with 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:45.720
 back lighting would be the no no 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.600
 It would be talking nonsense staff has 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.830
 Serial function is serial to photograph. 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.140
 You can take many photos. 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.060
 consecutive so you give a sapeca a 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.980
 instead he would have several pictures with adjustment 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.370
 izu manual that the sensitivity of the 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.490
 Movie visceral hatred allows photo 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:06.630
 do panoramic photography has sensor 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.960
 of simmons and has more ram and 1gb memory 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.360
 against 512 and has more internal memory 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.460
 32 versus 4 gigs 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.660
 then this was the personal comparison of the 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.400
 samsung galaxy s against the galaxy 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.650
 3min and staff 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.650
 I hope you have enjoyed the short 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.090
 Ladybug video help the channel that the 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.400
 staff if you do others 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.910
 comparatives send me your suggestions 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.620
 ok there is another detail s3 two like it 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.930
 he talks about two chips that 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:42.920
 while the other being the s3 thousand only 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.920
 a personal touch chip thank you and up
