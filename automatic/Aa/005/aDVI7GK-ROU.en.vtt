of like a dumbed down version of majesty
it's<00:01:04.049> funny<00:01:04.260> I've<00:01:04.470> been<00:01:04.589> playing<00:01:04.739> magic<00:01:05.070> since

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it's funny I've been playing magic since

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.149 
it's funny I've been playing magic since
I<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:05.519> 13<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.560> it's<00:01:07.560> almost<00:01:07.740> two<00:01:07.950> years

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
I was like 13 and it's almost two years

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.630 
I was like 13 and it's almost two years
now<00:01:09.350> but<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.860> me<00:01:10.979> it's<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.490> more

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
now but it to me it's just a more

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.190 
now but it to me it's just a more
elegant<00:01:11.909> version<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.360> magic<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.780> definitely

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
elegant version of magic it's definitely

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.660 
elegant version of magic it's definitely
not<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.560> complex<00:01:13.920> yet<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:14.430> that's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
not as complex yet but I think that's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.039 
not as complex yet but I think that's
also<00:01:14.909> cuz<00:01:15.119> they're<00:01:15.270> still<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:15.780> set

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
also cuz they're still in the first set

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.749 
also cuz they're still in the first set
of<00:01:16.140> cards<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.530> think<00:01:16.710> they'll<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.220> but

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
of cards I think they'll get there but

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.910 
of cards I think they'll get there but
to<00:01:18.060> me<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.810> solves<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> lot<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
to me it's like it solves a lot of I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.499 
to me it's like it solves a lot of I
think<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.220> fundamental<00:01:20.430> gameplay<00:01:21.180> problems

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
think the fundamental gameplay problems

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.609 
think the fundamental gameplay problems
of<00:01:21.600> magic<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.049> having<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.380> worry<00:01:22.409> about

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
of magic not having to worry about

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
of magic not having to worry about
whether<00:01:22.860> or<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.009> you'll<00:01:23.159> draw<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> land<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
whether or not you'll draw a land the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.149 
whether or not you'll draw a land the
things<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.840> find<00:01:25.020> frustrating<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.770> magic

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
things that I find frustrating in magic

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
things that I find frustrating in magic
that<00:01:26.250> made<00:01:26.400> me<00:01:26.490> feel<00:01:26.610> powerless<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.270> pretty

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
that made me feel powerless are pretty

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.880 
that made me feel powerless are pretty
much<00:01:27.780> absent<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.320> game<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.740> just

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
much absent in this game and it just

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
much absent in this game and it just
kind<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.070> stripped<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.430> down<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> core<00:01:30.150> one

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
kind of stripped it down to the core one

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.600 
kind of stripped it down to the core one
thing<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.990> really<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.500> about<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.070> how

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
thing I really like about it is how

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.789 
thing I really like about it is how
physical<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.750> everything<00:01:34.229> instead<00:01:34.680> of

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
physical it all is everything instead of

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.890 
physical it all is everything instead of
just<00:01:34.920> being<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> 2<00:01:35.430> D<00:01:35.579> flat<00:01:35.820> game<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
just being like a 2 D flat game it's it

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.850 
just being like a 2 D flat game it's it
seems<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.200> they're<00:01:37.320> trying<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.530> emulate<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
seems like they're trying to emulate a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.499 
seems like they're trying to emulate a
game<00:01:38.100> board<00:01:38.280> right<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:38.850> flat<00:01:39.270> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
game board right like it's flat and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.050 
game board right like it's flat and
cards<00:01:40.290> slammed<00:01:40.619> down<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.040> 3d<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.640> more

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
cards slammed down in 3d and like more

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.730

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
it out because I don't know the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.870 
it out because I don't know the
interface<00:02:42.930> obviously<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.680> really<00:02:44.070> easy<00:02:44.400> but

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
interface obviously is really easy but

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.440 
interface obviously is really easy but
at<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.210> same<00:02:45.420> time<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:47.250> rules<00:02:47.520> are<00:02:48.030> so

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
at the same time like the rules are so

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.240 
at the same time like the rules are so
user<00:02:48.870> friendly<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.650> you're<00:02:49.830> not<00:02:49.920> gonna<00:02:50.040> be

which I feel like an idiot saying that
but<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.770> really<00:03:05.040> does<00:03:05.280> matter<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:05.790> makes<00:03:06.030> like

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
but it really does matter it makes like

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.690 
but it really does matter it makes like
being<00:03:07.140> able<00:03:07.230> not<00:03:07.410> having<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.710> track<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.520> other

the game figure stuff like that out for

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.800 
the game figure stuff like that out for
you<00:03:21.000> makes<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.810> more<00:03:22.620> in<00:03:23.489> line<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.450> actually

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
you makes you more in line to actually

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.870 
you makes you more in line to actually
focus<00:03:24.959> on<00:03:25.260> line<00:03:25.440> totally<00:03:25.739> how<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:25.980> play<00:03:26.760> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
focus on line totally how to play the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.670 
focus on line totally how to play the
game<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.209> like<00:03:27.330> strategy<00:03:27.540> for<00:03:27.959> sure<00:03:28.080> I<00:03:28.320> think

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
game and like strategy for sure I think

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.560 
game and like strategy for sure I think
uh<00:03:28.830> one<00:03:29.459> interface<00:03:29.970> thing<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.330> think

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
uh one interface thing that I think

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.910 
uh one interface thing that I think
still<00:03:30.780> needs<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> little<00:03:31.050> work<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.470> deck

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
still needs a little work is deck

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.160 
still needs a little work is deck
building<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:32.760> mostly<00:03:33.180> really<00:03:33.540> good<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:33.959> my

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
building it's mostly really good but my

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.229 
building it's mostly really good but my
instinct<00:03:34.590> when<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.739> first<00:03:35.010> saw<00:03:35.220> my<00:03:35.459> decks<00:03:36.000> cuz

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
instinct when I first saw my decks cuz

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:37.610 
instinct when I first saw my decks cuz
it<00:03:36.330> loaded<00:03:36.630> on<00:03:36.750> all<00:03:36.900> my<00:03:37.020> decks<00:03:37.200> from<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.410> pc

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
it loaded on all my decks from the pc

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.590 
it loaded on all my decks from the pc
version<00:03:37.650> was<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.640> sort<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:38.910> run<00:03:39.090> my<00:03:39.239> finger

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
version was to sort of run my finger

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.699 
version was to sort of run my finger
down<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.900> cards<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.290> hopefully<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.650> would

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
down the cards and hopefully it would

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.080 
down the cards and hopefully it would
pop<00:03:40.920> them<00:03:41.100> open<00:03:41.160> i<00:03:41.370> could<00:03:41.550> see<00:03:41.730> what's<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:42.000> my

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
pop them open i could see what's in my

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.910 
pop them open i could see what's in my
deck<00:03:42.330> but<00:03:42.360> instead<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.930> have<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.080> press<00:03:43.680> and

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
deck but instead you have to press and

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.259 
deck but instead you have to press and
hold<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.250> each<00:03:44.430> individual<00:03:44.850> one<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.180> when

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
hold on each individual one and when

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.150 
hold on each individual one and when
it's<00:03:45.390> like<00:03:45.480> three<00:03:45.780> pixels<00:03:46.140> wide<00:03:46.350> it's<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:46.980> I

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
it's like three pixels wide it's like I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.340 
it's like three pixels wide it's like I
agree<00:03:47.580> with<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.330> weird<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:49.050> can't

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
agree with it it's weird that you can't

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.860 
agree with it it's weird that you can't
do<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.160> thought<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.519> was<00:03:50.610> odd<00:03:50.790> too<00:03:51.090> but

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
do that I thought that was odd too but

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.810 
do that I thought that was odd too but
for<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.170> most<00:03:52.320> part<00:03:52.440> as<00:03:52.800> soon<00:03:53.280> as<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.519> learned

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
for the most part as soon as I learned

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.390 
for the most part as soon as I learned
