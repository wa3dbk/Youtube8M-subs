00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.339
 highways of the south of France and 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.050
 on the peripheral wart of Toulouse 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.020
 I took over the activity of my parents 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.160
 in the 2000s he got 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.449
 specialized in towing troubleshooting 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.449
 and truck lift 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.250
 I work at garage hutch or mac in 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.289
 as a heavy truck troubleshooter 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.870
 I intervene on the motorway network 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.699
 and the secondary network with a scania 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.010
 r620 equipped with a deer 80 mrc the choice of 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.420
 rotator is very simple it allows the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 convenience store that intervenes on the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.149
 accidents to move the material for 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.580
 pick up hole and tow the 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.200
 accident vehicle things that we do not 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 could not do before 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.210
 tariff go a mobile crane and who 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.490
 require and 2 staff and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.229
 material when troubleshooting weight 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.479
 heavy we get a call the services 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.340
 highway that informs us of the location of 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.770
 breakdown and the reason for the failure and from there 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.960
 we have an hour to intervene 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.970
 cir 80 is a device that allows 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.700
 to redo traditional towing 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.750
 and also not to use the crane to 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.360
 go looking for vehicles in 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.280
 down below with the slide system that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.720
 allows to do trans lattes and the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.090
 turret back and forth on the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.789
 chassis this material allows us to lift 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.670
 all of the move from the front 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.460
 up to the back of the chassis and we 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.840
 allows a rotation of 180 degrees for 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.840
 tilt it to the other side 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.709
 then the choice fell on scania 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.910
 due to axle loads 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.340
 especially on the front axles of 9 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.590
 tons and on the back fabrics of 15 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.660
 tons for a better distribution of 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.160
 equipment charge thing that we do not 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.050
 can not find on your brand 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.989
 as well as the allowance which is 6 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.989
 meters 10 which allows us to have a 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.860
 better reach with the basket when 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.380
 a tow 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.900
 because the first one does not pitch up I 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.800
 am faithful to this winner for already 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.540
 the love of v8 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.670
 because when through breakdowns and 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.560
 on the highways we turn the key 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.209
 and it starts to always have always 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.760
 the satisfaction of coming back with my 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.760
 tow truck in the garage saint-omer - 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160
 1 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.610
 you can mentioned hui as they 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.610
 make his records elsewhere
