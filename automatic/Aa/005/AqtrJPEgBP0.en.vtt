00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.460

 brian with geri halliwell 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.420

 covering the videos now that they are 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.400
 grown up I would say that while you guys there 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.190
 my favorite expenses was absolutely geri 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.850
 halliwell has always been she remember me 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.420
 all true when announced that it is 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.820
 would have gone there is almost tears 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.380
 truly the total drama is a genius 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.000
 absolute you can invent anything 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.790
 you also want something impossible 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.310
 things mind you stay i love you dear guy 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.740
 I also invent the transporter 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.990
 I mentioned it among other things the other day 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.570
 with my hairdresser and we said 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.040
 images with teleportation speech 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.320
 smart and images with 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.030
 teleportation say bona we go tonight 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.000
 to eat a burger in times square 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.370
 in new york or dinners by the sea at 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.010
 offices then we return to the case there but that 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.440
 cool would be because they don't have it yet 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.330
 invented the teleport that is thought 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.950
 in an enchanted forest and between trees and 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.360
 new encounters one of the characters of 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.280
 Alice in Wonderland 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.630
 when the characters meet as you will 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.850
 your dialogue 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.360
 undoubtedly and perhaps even manner 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:07.380
 discounted to meet the bewitched and believe 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.709
 that would pull me pretty stupid with 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.959
 questions very intricate questions that me 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.510
 they would leave there and then be shocked 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.739
 they would let you think about cabbage 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.850
 it seemed an absurd thing but no 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.780
 assent and would lead me to do 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.880
 a psychological analysis of my city 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.190
 you would take a ride on the las inserts 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.739
 vegas duomo with installments i believe that worse 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.050
 of the series that there is leaks scream 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.959
 guys I invite you all to type 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.120
 hicks scream las vegas 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.330
 here on youtube and battery enjoy i 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.880
 video 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.400
 I suffer enough from vertigo myself 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.520
 I felt terrible about the Sagrada 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.100
 familia in barcelona i went up there 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.000
 so there I was really hurt at some 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.330
 point I said 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.020
 let me down i'm not bad 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.150
 you understand that I'm sick because if 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.890
 he lived what they seem not to burst 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.690
 have five tips 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.370
 here he is probably bewitched 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.020
 questions of this kind has the 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.000
 possibility to remove the Oscar for a 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.040
 movie or an actor that your opinion does not 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.049
 deserve it and give it to a thread an actor 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.510
 underrated according to you what 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.670
 you would change then I concentrate on 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.040
 the actors and I had to go and see me 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.220
 some who have won the various Oscar awards 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.570
 over the years they have won one 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.760
 tide of truly immense actors I speak 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.470
 own of the best leading actor 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.490
 if you had to choose, I would remove it at 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:43.700
 nicolas cage for the fact that it is mono 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.100
 serious expression and of course I would give it 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.710
 to the nardino di caprio who deserves it 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.950
 I would give him an Oscar for every film 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.130
 who did it because there is in a year of 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.890
 caprio boys but what actor is just 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.900
 dead alive and they ask you if you want 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.880
 become a ghost a vampire one 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.620
 zombie or long to naro what you would choose 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.360
 children are decidedly decided 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.419
 fascinating, however, I thought it was all right 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.490
 after being a vampire it would really be 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.980
 so pale an eternity so 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.320
 I would probably choose to be a 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.140
 ghost now I would enjoy entering 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.680
 contact with humans yet 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.750
 in life 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.580
 trump boards of this kind 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.320
 I would probably enjoy painting 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.840
 My friend 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.240
 maybe tour is your friend the question 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.810
 absurd it stops already after four words 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.280
 5 practically among your friend discover 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.900
 an abandoned house in an alley 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.540
 forgot what you do 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.660
 let me take you or venture me 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.850
 I venture all my life too 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.320
 curious and intricate from these things 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.080
 abandoned houses boys have a 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.730
 charm that has its own then 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.710
 inside right away and let's see what 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.260
 I really like this question 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.390
 of contacted forms on the occasion of 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.280
 film footage of the shadow of the wind ti 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.740
 asks you to interpret your choice one 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.200
 of characters both disguised men and 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.690
 women who choose I would be in crisis between 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.360
 Julian and Daniel a kiss is me too 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:18.090
 I very much like these two 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:21.340
 Julian characters is really my god 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.620
 truly fascinating and mysterious 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.820
 fantastic as a character 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.980
 But that probably would choose daniel 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:35.080
 however a curious character like me 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:37.570
 is looking for something and wants 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.810
 unravel this thing short, there I 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:43.090
 I find the good fermin that very careful 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.880
 have invited to met gala new york o 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.890
 gnudi star eyes though right now 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.320
 you have to choose your dress which one 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.180
 losers you would trust but above all by 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.310
 which celebrity you would like to accompany 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.100
 this will be the choice of a dress of the 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:00.100
 late alexander mcqueen 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:03.820
 i love his creations i know nothing about 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.680
 fashion however alexander mcqueen has a style 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.200
 guys that bye 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.510
 let us all bow down to 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.320
 its magnificence dressed in alexander 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.510
 mcqueen 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.720
 I would undoubtedly be accompanied by 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:20.080
 white jack from the good white jack maybe 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.790
 dressed and especially combed as in 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.290
 video dvd fight for my love 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:28.150

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.920
 scary even this Sunday guys 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.420
 we finished I hope the video will 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.760
 both liked and if so left in a 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.800
 nice lay or leave me so many 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.630
 questions in the comments and used 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.280
 the absurd questions because then 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.050
 without those that I like 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.160
 more and I will answer in a video the 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.610
 next week 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.560
