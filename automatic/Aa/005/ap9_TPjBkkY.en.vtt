00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.500
 the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.480
 welcomes tourists from all over the world who 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.369
 go to the area for its landscape without 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.470
 However, there are few who know that 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.119
 this is a key place for controversy 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.490
 and cruel experimentation industry 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.560
 with animals the island of Mauritius is 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.840
 after china the biggest exporter of 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.000
 macaques for research every year more 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.160
 of 10,000 of these animals are sent 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.710
 to labs around the world to be 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.020
 used in cruel experiments these 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.000
 Smart and sensitive animals live 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.860
 released in the jungle forming groups 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.860
 social with a complex structure 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.030
 hunters take advantage of the greatest 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.800
 difficulty that these animals have 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.239
 to find food in winter to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.950
 install traps in the jungle and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.450
 capture them are separated from their 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.250
 families and taken to the big 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.100
 breeding sites that are on the island more than 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.900
 7,500 macaques contemplate behind bars 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.240
 from these centers the jungle in which 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.250
 they lived a few meters from their cages they 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.530
 they found that in just about 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.869
 days was their home these animals are 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.820
 used here as their reproducers 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.619
 children will be the victims of all kinds of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.290
 experiments in laboratories around 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.300
 world each year around 4,000 macaques 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.820
 from this island they arrive in europe 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.490
 mainly to spain united kingdom and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.590
 france- the airline air france 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.840
 one of the few that still carry 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.430
 animals for experimentation moves to 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.320
 these animals in the holds of their 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.270
 the regular flights of tourists 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.220
 passengers are usually oblivious to everything 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.200
 this because air france interests you 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.810
 continue your business without facing 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.090
 critics locked in tiny boxes 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.130
 of wood the macaques can not even 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.050
 stand up and suffer the lack of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.630
 ventilation noise and changes of 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.060
 temperature for almost 12 hours of 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.510
 flight will travel the 9,000 kilometers 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.640
 that stops 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.650
 The island of Mauritius from Europe Spain 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.840
 receives annually around 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.300
 2000 macaques from this island 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 is the largest importer of these animals 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.840
 from all of europe 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.610
 these animals are taken to the center of 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.010
 camaries run by the company camaney 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.720
 and 9 hard print the team's 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.550
 animal equality research has 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.950
 got unpublished images of this 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.230
 place this center located in the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.730
 Province of Tarragona serves as a point 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.190
 of supply to laboratories of 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.600
 experimentation across Europe is about 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.000
 from a hidden and difficult place 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.640
 access with tight security 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.410
 and even electrified fences despite 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.480
 of all the protests and attempts that 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.170
 there has been closure 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.370
 its activities under great secrecy 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.920
 enclosed between concrete and cages of 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.959
 metal around 3000 macaques spend 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.940
 his days waiting to be sent to 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.030
 a distant laboratory where some 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.100
 terrible experiment will end his life 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.959
 the animals bite the fence or treat in 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.310
 unscrewing your screws to 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.739
 escape 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.599
 some of them as we see can be 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.360
 victims in addition to diseases such as 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:07.190
 scabies caused by parasites or viruses 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.190
 like herpes that remain untreated 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.310
 many of them will die in the 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.650
 laboratories of private companies like 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.290
 covance in huntingdon life sciences 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.180
 known internationally after 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.100
 that activists and journalists infiltrate 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.620
 in them and recorded with hidden camera 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.780
 your secrets thanks to them we can 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.240
 know now what really happens in 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.520
 these places in this investigation 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.380
 made by peta activists and 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.990
 filtered in the laboratory of cobÃ¡n ce 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.270
 in vienna usa can be seen as the 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.100
 employees they hit strangle and they 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.500
 they mock animals completely 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.210
 terrified the animals are so 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.100
 scared that they bite their own 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.860
 arms or spin compulsively 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.490
 about themselves in cages solitude 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.690
 agony and despair is indescribable 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.970
 certainly it is necessary that society 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.130
 progress and discover effective ways 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.160
 to fight the diseases that 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.780
 we suffer however this advance must 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.020
 give without experimenting on animals 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.760
 because they like us 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.950
 they long to live in freedom far from 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.650

 camarles and that the airlines 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.500
 do not collaborate in the transport of these 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.970
 animals with such a terrible fate 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.239
 together we can help finish everything
