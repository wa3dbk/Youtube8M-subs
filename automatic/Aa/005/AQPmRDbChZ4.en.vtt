00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.680
 hi how about my name is a reporter and 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:10.300
 well I bring you presenting my new 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:14.500
 nano tank 120 liters is a bun 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:16.420
 550 modified lighting by me 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.010
 I have four months from now 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.900
 have started it and how can you notice 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.349
 Well, it is evolving quite 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.960
 quite well the water has matured very 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.089
 very very very well very fast 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.009
 I want to show you some caresses that 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:33.050
 I have done to this aquarium as 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.730
 example the control panel that what 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.680
 believe I think we should all have one 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.329
 same to control all the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.340
 connections and all the devices that 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.230
 we have installed in our aquarium 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.210
 as the pump the light is the heater 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.270
 etcetera that we have in this aquarium 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.190
 well we already have live rock live sand 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.309
 I have two different moods 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:03.219
 we also find three hermits 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.219
 legs are tiny snails 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.330
 polyps 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.229
 what else do we have good we have a clam 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.680
 fire I recommend you watch the video 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.409
 that I have made of this clam that 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.960
 find on my channel available 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.600
 and well the aquarium is evolving 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.479
 quite pretty well how can 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.259
 watch him miss more corals 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.090
 more polyps plus little things but life is 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.280
 interesting how it is created in a 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.399
 marine aquarium for all of us 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.619
 like it 's something very impressive is something 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.899
 very very very father and for those who do not 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.649
 I could recommend that you start with a 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.469
 saltwater aquariums are very pretty 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.530
 You can see this anemone is beautiful 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:54.369
 this is so is photosynthetic requires of 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.790
 light feeds on light part of flight 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.130
 of your special food obviously 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.220
 I'm going to talk to you a little bit more about this 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.190
 aquarium that I am riding 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:10.710
 its original lighting I keep it 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.390
 although I no longer use it and they are 2 pl of 24 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.600
 watts each 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.960
 contains 2 are 48 watts two whites two 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.960
 blue 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.239
 I modified this this lighting 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.129
 for a led bar that I made myself 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.490
 contains 5 high brightness LEDs 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:33.000
 700,000 jumpers 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.490
 five white four four connected 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.310
 in parallel 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.180
 and they give me an intensity of barbaric light 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.130
 but quite pretty strong and with so 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.110
 only a consumption of 27 watts 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.290
 well what else we have in this aquarium 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.530
 we have a wave generator pump 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.140
 we have a submersible digital thermometer 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.050
 the tip obviously we have organized 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.910
 all cables with a hose to 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.240
 that looks aesthetic and is cleaner 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.890
 all 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.150
 well I can tell you the truth 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.430
 I invite all the people who are 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.590
 watching this video to start with a 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.920
 marine aquarium I know that they are not going to 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.670
 regret 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.630
 they will see a truly world 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.190
 wonderful 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.380
 something from what is also I want 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.900
 comment the skimmer the skimmer is something 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.700
 it's like the heart of the aquarium its 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.730
 operation is the one that more or less is 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.190
 Ours is the optimum among more foam 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.710
 means that the water is quite 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.960
 well of salt does not mean that it is 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.390
 last as long as you have the measurements 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:40.030
 made but if no foam lacks salt 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.790
 to your water 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.590
 What I can tell you is that I'm going 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.580
 to be creating several videos of everything 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.610

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.340
 in my aquarium or in my aquariums I will 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.120

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.580
