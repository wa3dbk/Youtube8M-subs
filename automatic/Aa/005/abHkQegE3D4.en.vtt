00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello girls I'm daphne 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.340
 professional hairdresser and there I go 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.830
 show you how to make a bun 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.389
 giant at the jennifer lopez to achieve 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.690
 this bun you will need big 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.380
 bars is small bars of a 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.199
 elastic of a comb for crÃªpes of a 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.730
 brush and act then the first 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.369
 step of this bun and make a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.980
 relatively high ponytail so 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.320
 you take your brush to the brushes and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.200
 well and so the goal is to have 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.340
 something smooth and not that is the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.829
 boss you take your elastic and you 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.059
 fixed as you usually set 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.059
 your ponytail 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.670
 if there are small bumps behind 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.110
 it's not serious but good must before 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.110
 it's still as fast as possible 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.199
 so once you are assured that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.550
 your ponytail and well centered 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.350
 you take a first wick 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.460
 knowing that you are going to divide it into 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.559
 four and that the four 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.359
 matches be roughly equal to roughly 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.619
 of that size and then with the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.720
 pen you just create the wick back in the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.090
 pen in the wick and bhutta so it's 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.490
 the crepe who likes you come 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.460
 then rolled this lock on her 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.810
 even if it is small wick that 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.939
 overtakes on the right on the left is not very 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.439
 serious you will show after how the 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:35.450
 erase you take a large bar 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.450
 and you come there fixed 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.750
 here you renew the operation with 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.820
 a second wick that you just creped 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.130
 in the same way as the first and 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.860
 you come the always coiled of the same 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.140
 way wanted to fix with great 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.299
 bar is you perform the same 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.429
 operation for the two remaining locks 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.810
 once you're done with crepe 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.610
 and place the four but I you 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.189
 take big bars and you 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.619
 are going to actually tweak to have a 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.440
 well round shape can then take 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.310
 the small bars to hide the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.709
 wicks that exceed once your 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.810
 bun and well round you come 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.430
 to hide the bars that you have 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.560
 put in front if she sees herself a little bit 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.319
 you just have to put the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.340
 lacquer not too much because the encryption is already 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.340
 your hairstyle to hold 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.760
 and now you know how to make a 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.760
