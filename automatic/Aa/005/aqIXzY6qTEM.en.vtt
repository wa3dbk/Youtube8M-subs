00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
of cuts that allow us now to be able to

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.750 
of cuts that allow us now to be able to
fixate<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:27.019> procedure<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.920> have<00:02:28.519> a<00:02:28.549> better

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
fixate this procedure and have a better

result with it and that's what I mean

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.619

the<00:02:30.950> ability<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.340> see<00:02:31.670> not<00:02:32.090> just<00:02:32.450> the

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
the ability to see not just the

the ability to see not just the
procedure<00:02:33.019> but<00:02:33.680> how<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:33.859> procedure<00:02:34.249> can<00:02:34.489> be

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
procedure but how the procedure can be

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.750 
procedure but how the procedure can be
for<00:02:35.930> not<00:02:36.049> only<00:02:36.170> for<00:02:36.379> himself<00:02:36.980> but<00:02:37.159> for<00:02:37.219> people

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
for not only for himself but for people

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.240 
for not only for himself but for people
around<00:02:37.939> him<00:02:38.150> because<00:02:38.930> he<00:02:39.260> does<00:02:39.469> such<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:40.010> good

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
around him because he does such a good

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.890 
around him because he does such a good
block<00:02:40.579> and<00:02:41.090> it's<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:42.310> effective<00:02:43.659> the<00:02:44.659> amount

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
block and it's so effective the amount

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.630 
block and it's so effective the amount
of<00:02:44.959> anesthetic<00:02:45.469> I<00:02:45.560> give<00:02:45.739> her<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.040> sedation

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
of anesthetic I give her the sedation

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.300 
of anesthetic I give her the sedation
that<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.819> give<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.510> quite<00:02:47.870> minimal<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:49.250> the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
that I give this is quite minimal so the

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.940 
that I give this is quite minimal so the
patient's<00:02:49.760> again<00:02:50.590> when<00:02:51.590> they<00:02:51.709> wake<00:02:51.920> up

they're<00:02:52.579> much<00:02:52.760> more<00:02:53.000> awake<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.510> they're<00:02:53.629> less

likely to have nausea or vomiting the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.520 
likely to have nausea or vomiting the
second<00:02:56.389> thing<00:02:56.540> that's<00:02:56.659> quite<00:02:56.840> remarkable<00:02:57.049> is

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
second thing that's quite remarkable is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.410 
second thing that's quite remarkable is
his<00:02:57.739> surgical<00:02:58.219> skill<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.939> the<00:02:59.030> technique

his surgical skill and the technique

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.449 
his surgical skill and the technique
that<00:02:59.450> he's<00:02:59.719> developed

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
that he's developed

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.729 
that he's developed
he's<00:03:01.459> able<00:03:01.639> to<00:03:01.790> minimize<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.329> trauma<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
he's able to minimize the trauma and the

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.580 
he's able to minimize the trauma and the
inflammation<00:03:04.719> that's<00:03:05.719> associated<00:03:06.019> with<00:03:06.319> foot

surgery<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:08.000> greatly<00:03:08.329> reduces<00:03:08.480> the

surgery and that greatly reduces the

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.229 
surgery and that greatly reduces the
swelling<00:03:09.889> the<00:03:10.280> inflammation<00:03:10.489> in<00:03:10.909> the<00:03:11.000> pain

for him part-time and I would take care
of<00:05:16.700> patients<00:05:17.120> preoperatively<00:05:17.780> and<00:05:18.260> I<00:05:18.680> could

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
of patients preoperatively and I could

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.100 
of patients preoperatively and I could
not<00:05:19.040> believe<00:05:19.160> how<00:05:19.370> many<00:05:19.610> people<00:05:20.120> came<00:05:20.300> back<00:05:20.540> to

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
not believe how many people came back to

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.380 
not believe how many people came back to
get<00:05:21.200> their<00:05:21.380> second<00:05:21.710> foot<00:05:21.890> done<00:05:22.100> really<00:05:22.790> and<00:05:23.150> I

get their second foot done really and I

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.940 
get their second foot done really and I
was<00:05:23.540> amazed<00:05:23.870> so<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.110> would<00:05:24.350> sit<00:05:24.560> there<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:24.770> I'd

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
was amazed so I would sit there and I'd

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.650 
was amazed so I would sit there and I'd
ask<00:05:25.130> him<00:05:25.280> questions<00:05:25.760> and<00:05:26.000> I'd<00:05:26.150> pick<00:05:26.419> their

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
ask him questions and I'd pick their

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.960 
ask him questions and I'd pick their
brains<00:05:26.960> and<00:05:27.350> because<00:05:28.040> I<00:05:28.190> was<00:05:28.370> shocked<00:05:28.669> I

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
brains and because I was shocked I

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.480 
brains and because I was shocked I
really<00:05:29.450> did<00:05:29.630> not<00:05:29.750> believe<00:05:30.050> him<00:05:30.290> and<00:05:30.530> yet<00:05:31.280> I

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
really did not believe him and yet I

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.580 
really did not believe him and yet I
heard<00:05:31.760> patient<00:05:32.270> after<00:05:32.600> patient<00:05:32.630> who<00:05:33.140> told<00:05:33.410> me

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
heard patient after patient who told me

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.030 
heard patient after patient who told me
it<00:05:34.310> was<00:05:34.520> easy<00:05:35.030> it<00:05:35.720> was<00:05:35.870> great<00:05:36.200> I'm<00:05:36.530> here<00:05:36.919> to

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
it was easy it was great I'm here to

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.240 
it was easy it was great I'm here to
have<00:05:37.160> my<00:05:37.280> next<00:05:37.550> foot<00:05:37.700> done<00:05:37.910> and<00:05:38.680> that<00:05:39.680> was<00:05:39.890> to

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
have my next foot done and that was to

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.450 
have my next foot done and that was to
me<00:05:40.370> that<00:05:40.640> was<00:05:40.820> finally<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.270> proof<00:05:41.510> that<00:05:41.780> said

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
me that was finally the proof that said

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.040 
me that was finally the proof that said
he<00:05:43.460> must<00:05:43.640> be<00:05:43.820> doing<00:05:43.940> something<00:05:44.270> right<00:05:44.600> right

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
he must be doing something right right

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.020 
he must be doing something right right
so<00:05:45.410> after<00:05:45.800> all<00:05:45.950> these<00:05:46.280> years<00:05:46.340> you<00:05:46.730> were<00:05:46.760> going

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
so after all these years you were going

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.240 
so after all these years you were going
through<00:05:47.090> pain<00:05:47.450> you<00:05:47.780> selected<00:05:48.260> the<00:05:48.380> pain<00:05:48.650> over

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
through pain you selected the pain over

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.650 
through pain you selected the pain over
actually<00:05:49.640> having<00:05:49.910> a<00:05:49.970> surgery<00:05:50.180> oh<00:05:50.450> absolutely

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
actually having a surgery oh absolutely

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.770 
actually having a surgery oh absolutely
and<00:05:51.350> I<00:05:51.950> thought<00:05:52.430> for<00:05:52.640> sure<00:05:52.669> that<00:05:53.030> the<00:05:53.210> surgery

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
and I thought for sure that the surgery

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.530 
and I thought for sure that the surgery
is<00:05:53.930> far<00:05:54.169> worse<00:05:54.320> than<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.680> pain<00:05:54.830> right<00:05:55.400> so<00:05:56.210> and

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
is far worse than the pain right so and

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.270 
is far worse than the pain right so and
what<00:05:56.690> about<00:05:56.870> now<00:05:57.110> I'm<00:05:57.580> convinced<00:05:58.580> I'm<00:05:58.970> amazed

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
what about now I'm convinced I'm amazed

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.159 
what about now I'm convinced I'm amazed
it's<00:06:01.280> been<00:06:01.490> about<00:06:01.640> two<00:06:01.850> months<00:06:01.880> and<00:06:02.419> it's

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
it's been about two months and it's

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.409 
it's been about two months and it's
truly<00:06:03.440> everything<00:06:04.370> he<00:06:04.490> said<00:06:04.669> it<00:06:04.760> was<00:06:04.910> that's

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
truly everything he said it was that's

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.670 
truly everything he said it was that's
great<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:06.020> that's<00:06:06.140> why<00:06:06.290> you<00:06:06.380> have<00:06:06.470> a<00:06:06.500> big

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
great and that's why you have a big

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.469 
great and that's why you have a big
smile<00:06:06.890> on<00:06:06.919> your<00:06:07.130> face
