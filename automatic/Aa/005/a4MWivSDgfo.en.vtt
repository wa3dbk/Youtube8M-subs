about it it's a mathematical equation

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.220 
about it it's a mathematical equation
yeah<00:02:57.770> so<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.430> can<00:02:58.610> pull<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.360> salt<00:02:59.840> and<00:02:59.930> fluid

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
go away because your hydration goes up

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.560
