all<00:00:01.560> right<00:00:01.889> so<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.520> new<00:00:02.669> leo<00:00:02.879> events<00:00:03.179> exhaust

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
all right so the new leo events exhaust

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.929 
all right so the new leo events exhaust
is<00:00:03.749> completely<00:00:04.200> on<00:00:04.290> on<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:05.339> old<00:00:05.490> stuffs<00:00:05.790> right

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:05.939 
is completely on on the old stuffs right

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.710 
is completely on on the old stuffs right
there<00:00:06.149> along<00:00:06.569> with<00:00:06.600> all<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.959> parts<00:00:08.060> so<00:00:09.060> it

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:09.720 
there along with all the parts so it

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.880 
there along with all the parts so it
took<00:00:09.840> two<00:00:10.050> different<00:00:10.350> types<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.650> Allen

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:10.890 
took two different types of Allen

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.210 
took two different types of Allen
wrenches<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.880> get<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.180> I<00:00:12.770> went<00:00:13.770> ahead<00:00:13.890> and<00:00:14.040> I

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
wrenches to get it on I went ahead and I

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.259 
wrenches to get it on I went ahead and I
installed<00:00:14.760> the<00:00:15.230> hook<00:00:16.230> up<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.679> back<00:00:17.269> it

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
installed the hook up in the back it

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.630 
installed the hook up in the back it
fits<00:00:18.779> better<00:00:19.410> up<00:00:19.650> front<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.279> looks<00:00:20.460> better

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
fits better up front but it looks better

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.790 
fits better up front but it looks better
and<00:00:20.759> back<00:00:21.140> because<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.230> away<00:00:22.349> from<00:00:22.499> the<00:00:22.589> front

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
and back because I away from the front

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.739 
and back because I away from the front
you<00:00:22.890> don't<00:00:22.980> see<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.310> dangling<00:00:23.669> so<00:00:23.939> much<00:00:24.119> all

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:24.749 
you don't see it dangling so much all

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:32.060 
you don't see it dangling so much all
the<00:00:24.960> part<00:00:26.990> Chrome's<00:00:27.990> nice<00:00:28.259> the<00:00:30.859> spring<00:00:31.859> has<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
the part Chrome's nice the spring has a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.350 
the part Chrome's nice the spring has a
little<00:00:32.340> rubber<00:00:32.550> thing<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:32.970> it's<00:00:33.090> not<00:00:33.150> as

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
little rubber thing so it's not as

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.690 
little rubber thing so it's not as
obvious<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.530> it'll<00:00:34.860> just<00:00:35.040> holds<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.310> secure

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
obvious but it'll just holds it secure

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.620 
obvious but it'll just holds it secure
right<00:00:36.150> there<00:00:36.330> because<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.920> welded<00:00:38.630> and

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
right there because it is not welded and

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.570 
right there because it is not welded and
that<00:00:39.990> you<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:40.890> need<00:00:41.070> an<00:00:41.130> Allen<00:00:41.370> wrench<00:00:41.400> to

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
that you just need an Allen wrench to

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.240 
that you just need an Allen wrench to
tighten<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.030> loosen<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.950> that's<00:00:43.950> one<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
tighten the loosen that that's one the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.920 
tighten the loosen that that's one the
societics<00:00:44.820> has<00:00:45.090> turned<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.930> believe

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
societics has turned out to be I believe

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.710 
societics has turned out to be I believe
sighs<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.320> guess<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.040> first<00:00:50.160> ones<00:00:50.400> with<00:00:50.520> five

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
sighs I guess the first ones with five

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.860 
sighs I guess the first ones with five
mount<00:00:51.720> to<00:00:51.870> six<00:00:52.700> so<00:00:53.700> larger<00:00:54.330> of<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:54.630> Allen

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
mount to six so larger of my Allen

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.650 
mount to six so larger of my Allen
wrenches<00:00:56.060> so<00:00:57.060> I'm<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.240> to<00:00:57.270> go<00:00:57.390> ahead<00:00:57.450> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
wrenches so I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.370 
wrenches so I'm going to go ahead and
start<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.990> now<00:00:58.160> it's<00:00:59.160> been<00:00:59.340> sitting<00:00:59.700> all<00:00:59.790> night

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
start it now it's been sitting all night

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.660 
start it now it's been sitting all night
it's<00:01:01.380> starting<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.740> get<00:01:01.830> sunny<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.490> kind

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it's starting to get sunny but it's kind

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.440 
it's starting to get sunny but it's kind
of<00:01:02.700> a<00:01:02.790> colder<00:01:03.150> day<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:05.060> we'll<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.420> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
of a colder day and we'll see what it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:03:09.790 
of a colder day and we'll see what it
sounds<00:01:06.990> like

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.290 

so<00:03:11.870> because<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:13.020> Li<00:03:13.170> ovince<00:03:13.410> is<00:03:14.280> just<00:03:15.060> the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
so because the Li ovince is just the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.360 
so because the Li ovince is just the
muffler<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:16.230> will<00:03:16.440> not<00:03:16.590> have<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.890> catalytic

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
muffler it will not have the catalytic

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.100 
muffler it will not have the catalytic
converter<00:03:17.460> inside<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.750> old<00:03:18.840> one<00:03:18.990> did

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
converter inside like the old one did

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.590 
converter inside like the old one did
build<00:03:19.770> one<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.430> lot<00:03:20.700> heavier<00:03:20.880> but<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.480> does

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
build one is a lot heavier but it does

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.590 
build one is a lot heavier but it does
have<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.870> catalytic<00:03:22.260> converter<00:03:22.350> inside<00:03:23.600> the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
have the catalytic converter inside the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.980 
have the catalytic converter inside the
oven<00:03:24.780> looks<00:03:25.140> nicer<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:26.240> lot<00:03:27.240> nicer<00:03:27.300> for<00:03:27.840> sure

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
oven looks nicer a lot nicer for sure

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.890 
oven looks nicer a lot nicer for sure
and<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:29.190> sound<00:03:29.460> is<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:30.060> lot<00:03:30.300> better<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:30.750> you

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
and the sound is a lot better if you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.330 
and the sound is a lot better if you
liked<00:03:31.140> it<00:03:31.320> really<00:03:31.710> quiet<00:03:31.970> they<00:03:34.280> they<00:03:35.280> do

bike but I'm not going to put that on

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.770 
bike but I'm not going to put that on
because<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.470> like<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.800> a<00:03:40.860> little<00:03:41.010> louder<00:03:41.780> after
