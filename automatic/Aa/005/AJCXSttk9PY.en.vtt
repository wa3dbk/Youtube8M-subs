00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:09.710
 holding together we would be today for you 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.949
 the asus x4 and 50 c speak one of the 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.170
 entry-level devices from asus as well as here 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.640
 is short and just over 300 euros 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.109
 Of course there are also in different 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.540
 configurations we just have them 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.310
 sometimes the cheapest snatched with ubuntu 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.050
 on it instead of windows and so on 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.520
 that is just then really for the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.310
 Einsteiger par excellence has a lot 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.450
 would like to spend money on notebook from 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.670
 external 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.480
 we have such a flute here 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.850
 surface 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.090
 yes that is already so easily copied and 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.260
 but fluted that must be 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.850
 significantly more grip has when touch 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.050
 So, if there is not a big threat 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.090
 you go to the area that you are here 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.739
 slips off but even with easy 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.910
 you still have dirty fingers 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.130
 very good adhesion animated residente 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.079
 claims of which have been pleasing 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.380
 It definitely will not be that way 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.010
 out of hand then look again 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.110
 the connections always and that is what we have 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.879
 Here again the one power connection 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.069
 a bit unfavorably located in the middle 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.630
 then better if it was somewhere 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:09.920
 here at back for example for the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.569
 left-handed so then always here 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.249
 this cable because somehow a mouse 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:15.799
 areas are of course not quite 

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:17.990
 so practically then we have the 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.380
 Air outlet for the cooling system 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.539
 we once have a network connection 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.630
 to a vga connection just from lima 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.369
 or similar hdmi also available 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.630
 and here is a nude me too 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.299
 then look for a usb 3.0 connection 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.149
 we have relative to the front 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.069
 manageable once the headphones and 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.319
 Microphone connection just synonymous both 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.630
 separately from each other separately 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.459
 executed and we once have the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.810
 sd-card slot or beside on the 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.270
 Rectors cards from the camera or something 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.609
 can insert 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.719
 So on the right side also relative 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.689
 clear but not much 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.579
 available once we have 2.0 usb and 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.640
 then just now is the dvd 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.770
 Drive comes to it and here still the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.229
 kensington lock so speak the device 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.840
 to be able to close somewhere 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.349
 yes back nothing synonymous except the battery 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.970
 but nothing else available 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.400
 and on the bottom really looks 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.530
 comparable to yours on the back 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.989
 her nothing else would be so once 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.700
 in short, the nameplate na now has 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.290
 just without any license key 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.430
 or the like because the just as said 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.170
 no windows is on it and we are 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.670
 young still have the big maintenance 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.170
 flap or service flap as you can 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.849
 you can call there once you can 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.989
 exchange memory and also the 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.489
 replace hard disk 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.780
 depending on the device accordingly 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.739
 can be upgraded if you feel like it 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:49.940
 then have a look 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:52.690
 inside we have here too 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.139
 further on as well as on the outside ultimately 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.700
 this grooved surface can be 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.680
 Again, that's just not so 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.260
 Slipping easily can make him feel good 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.600
 in the hand everything is so wrong 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.040
 a great feeling comes because it 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.889
 Feels really very high quality 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.880
 to thereby have to say 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.829
 Maybe you know who one of you 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.200
 formal nexus 7 of asus in hand 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.549
 So he knew this surface 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.970
 similarly, this is also here and from the feeling 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.349
 almost the same thing and then watch 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.269
 We still have one 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.349
 touchpad is not that big right now 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.709
 but we already know that clearly 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.989
 bigger even at 15 inch devices but it 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.329
 is very accurate for it very responsive 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.280
 Here also had a slightly roughened 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.329
 I personally always find the surface 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.440
 a little bit nicer than this whole one 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.299
 smooth surfaces there I come 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.530
 somehow not really clear though 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.739
 that is natural for yourself 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.739
 decide 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.840
 Touchpad buttons are here separately 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.709
 I think now quite loud from the click 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.180
 Noise for this very good feedback 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.349
 very good 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.609
 the good feedback so you notice 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:01.049
 right now okay i have 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:02.730
 pressed keyboard also little in itself 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.590
 one touches the touchpad 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.930
 good feedback so many things just around 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:13.129
 of course everything will be tapped here 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.129
 locked a moment and practical 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:19.400
 lock key enabled we wanted 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.400
 Not 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.930
 as I said the keyboard really synonymous 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.759
 very well executed at least think that 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.009
 it just a total beginner devices 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.449
 are then mostly with many devices 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.860
 possible grotto bad keyboards 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.560
 somehow they are like rubber 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.000
 from another tip of it is the ever further 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.680
 So it really takes a break 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.870
 pressure point you realize the really okay 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.690
 Taste hit me and you can zack 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.910
 so very good to write about it 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.889
 once number pad a bit 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.710
 English match the whole but good because 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.699
 the place is not passed on 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.460
 otherwise no other controls 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.070
 besides, bakhtov up here and 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.050
 Finally, we have that again 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.560
 altec lansing logo because everyone also like 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.630
 open so often at asos altec lansing 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.340
 sound system in it just has it 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.570
 a small increase at least 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.669
 compared to the standard speaker main 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.070
 grew up 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:19.289
 but now for the real special feature 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.000
 here because we have a lot here 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.490
 cheap device and moreover with one 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.800
 matt display the right of players 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.169
 completely antireflective you can see here 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.490
 now there is no reflection either 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.349
 similar we have one more 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.750
 matte display frame just as well 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:35.070
 no reflection of itself is therefore also 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.800
 no problem that one is there 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.289
 sit a little bit in the sun and 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.500
 so that next to the device already uses 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.320
 has a bit brighter here just yet 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.030
 even the maximum brightness is enough 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.530
 but also from what you already know 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.270
 I noticed that there just for me 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.680
 only too dark 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.590
 unfortunately, the perspectives are not 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.570
 especially good 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.010
 So that means when I get this now 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.660
 open up and here from the edge to a 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.250
 I 've got this up here in the 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.630
 area and everywhere color investments 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.470
 So that means here then fluctuate 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.230
 really the colors 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.110
 that is going to be very dark that's really 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.010
 not very pleasant 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.240
 as soon as I look in here 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.040
 little increase over nothing 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.990
 more 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.070
 and from the side, yes that is unfortunately 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.630
 the same well it is also it stops 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.890
 very dark so very fast 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.810
 Shades of color you only have 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.960
 horizontal percent hand shifts 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.910
 vertical but no color no 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.070
 Conversion it's just very much 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.020
 of course, very dark has the dark 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.150
 advantage of a plane and to the car or 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.370
 a hat in the car does not matter but airplane 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.020
 The neighbor can not sit in the train 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.730
 everything just so drives 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.470
 if anything to write for work 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.850
 Do not want to see what everyone is supposed to see 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.780
 Of course, then better if you 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.540
 the neighbor not simply from 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.980
 screen can watch 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.810
 otherwise as you think here already 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.270
 we have an ubuntu here now 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.530
 preinstalled speaks linux fans under 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.850
 Of course, you too can 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.620
 easily in other versions 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.020
 play we have now namely for 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.670
 the other version 11.10 from ubuntu 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.720
 I do not know what the current one 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.510
 is there I unfortunately know myself at all 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:08.340
 no longer with it but it is on everyone 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:10.570
 fall loud asus below and certified 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.580
 you can definitely speak too 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.320
 a linux then work if one 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.820
 the research should not run yet 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.250
 big problem might be one 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.190
 do it manually but otherwise it should 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.030
 most work right away 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.380
 Of course, you can also do windows 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.830
 install that is not at all 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.260
 problem 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.460
 in addition to some only 708 with 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.300
 order or if I already have 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:34.390
 just install it and it's good 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.220
 so much for the ixs 54 c of asus and me 

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.850
 Hope I hope you liked it and 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.850
 Until next time
