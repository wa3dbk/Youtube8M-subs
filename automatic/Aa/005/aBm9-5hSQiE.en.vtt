00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
have a big enough bit so I had to make

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.229 
have a big enough bit so I had to make
do<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.379> kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.129> work<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> bit<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.560 
do and kind of work with the bit and
just<00:00:57.930> make<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.260> bigger<00:00:58.609> but<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.760> works<00:00:59.969> fine<00:01:00.239> so

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
just make it bigger but it works fine so

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.049

I don't plan on using this camera for
any<00:01:03.239> underwater<00:01:03.690> applications<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.729> works

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
any underwater applications so it works

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.700 
any underwater applications so it works
for<00:01:06.390> me<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.869> didn't<00:01:07.110> want<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> spend

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the extra money for a new skeleton for

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.140

this in order to have access to the
external<00:01:12.450> mic<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.409> works<00:01:13.680> well<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.390> as

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
external mic but this works well and as

basically<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.820> slides<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.450> here

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.880 

as<00:01:28.040> you<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> slides<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.360> locks

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
as you can see it slides in and locks

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.710 
as you can see it slides in and locks
this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.280> looks<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> helmet

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
I like this mount the best because it's

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.170 
I like this mount the best because it's
out<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.390> view<00:01:40.430> when<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:41.549> looking<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.000> of

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.640 
the camera in my line of you out of the
helmet<00:02:18.290> here<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> 3-way<00:02:19.950> pivot<00:02:20.190> arm<00:02:20.489> and

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
helmet here is a 3-way pivot arm and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.220 
helmet here is a 3-way pivot arm and
with<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.770> 3-way<00:02:23.130> pivot<00:02:23.400> arm<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:24.810> actually

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
with the 3-way pivot arm it actually

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.140 
with the 3-way pivot arm it actually
works<00:02:25.470> out<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.610> little<00:02:26.640> bit<00:02:26.910> better

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
works out just a little bit better

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.760 
works out just a little bit better
because<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.660> can<00:02:27.810> actually<00:02:28.050> angle<00:02:28.680> the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
because you can actually angle the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.070 
because you can actually angle the
camera<00:02:29.300> more<00:02:30.300> back<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:33.450> way<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:33.840> you're

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
camera more back so that way if you're

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.490 
camera more back so that way if you're
in<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.650> more<00:02:34.920> aggressive<00:02:35.459> riding<00:02:36.090> position<00:02:36.630> it

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
in a more aggressive riding position it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.370 
in a more aggressive riding position it
will<00:02:37.590> get<00:02:37.800> more<00:02:38.010> view<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.940> road<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:40.260> like

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
will get more view of the road but like

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.979

view<00:03:47.990> of<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.290> road<00:03:48.530> so<00:03:48.920> it's<00:03:49.070> whatever<00:03:49.400> your

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
personal preference is as far as putting

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.550 
personal preference is as far as putting
the<00:03:53.060> camera<00:03:53.540> on<00:03:53.720> top<00:03:54.020> of<00:03:54.200> your<00:03:54.320> helmet

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
the camera on top of your helmet

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.290 
the camera on top of your helmet
personally<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.430> don't<00:03:55.640> like<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:56.060> view<00:03:56.270> from

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
personally I don't like the view from

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.540 
personally I don't like the view from
the<00:03:56.600> top<00:03:56.630> of<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.080> helmet<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.650> also<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.340> looks

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
the top of the helmet and also it looks

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.020 
the top of the helmet and also it looks
dorky<00:03:59.030> on<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.270> rider<00:03:59.710> and<00:04:00.760> as<00:04:01.760> far<00:04:01.970> as

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
dorky on the rider and as far as

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.060 
dorky on the rider and as far as
mounting<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.960> camera<00:04:02.990> on<00:04:03.530> either<00:04:03.710> side<00:04:04.040> of

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
mounting the camera on either side of

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.240 
mounting the camera on either side of
your<00:04:04.280> helmet<00:04:04.570> it<00:04:05.570> limits<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.140> view<00:04:06.410> to<00:04:07.070> only

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
your helmet it limits the view to only

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.430 
your helmet it limits the view to only
one<00:04:07.580> side<00:04:07.820> of<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.210> you<00:04:08.540> know<00:04:08.660> just<00:04:09.050> the<00:04:09.140> front

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
one side of the you know just the front

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.350 
one side of the you know just the front
and<00:04:09.650> whatever<00:04:09.890> side<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.610> cameras<00:04:11.000> on<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:11.330> I

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
and whatever side the cameras on so I

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.150 
and whatever side the cameras on so I
don't<00:04:11.570> really<00:04:11.660> care<00:04:11.960> for<00:04:12.020> that<00:04:12.230> mounting

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
don't really care for that mounting

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.040 
don't really care for that mounting
position<00:04:13.610> either<00:04:13.760> in<00:04:13.970> my<00:04:14.120> opinion<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.720> front

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
position either in my opinion the front

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.500 
position either in my opinion the front
