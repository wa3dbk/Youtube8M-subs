00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.400
 case we're going to use two cups of 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.490
 Flour previously admired two eggs 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.490

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.570
 two 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.510
 and finally add little by little 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.370
 beer until you get a mixture with the 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.370
 consistency as you can see here 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.570
 in a high-walled frying pan pour 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.250
 enough oil to fry the fish 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.530
 and allows it to warm up 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.110
 to check that it has warmed up 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.270
 the oil pours a drop of the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.710
 coverage to see that it reacts to 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:39.260
 heat and do not sink covers very well the 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.450

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.200

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.320
 eliminate excess oil 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.550
