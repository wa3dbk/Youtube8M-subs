time-lapse part of this video uh one of

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.440 
time-lapse part of this video uh one of
the<00:00:27.500> main<00:00:27.650> things<00:00:27.890> I<00:00:28.009> wanted<00:00:28.039> to<00:00:28.490> explain<00:00:29.090> was

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
the main things I wanted to explain was

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.319 
the main things I wanted to explain was
the<00:00:29.990> lengths<00:00:30.619> of<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:31.009> legs<00:00:31.149> from<00:00:32.149> what<00:00:32.300> I

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
the lengths of the legs from what I

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.110 
the lengths of the legs from what I
understand<00:00:32.809> most<00:00:33.380> animals<00:00:33.860> have<00:00:33.950> lar<00:00:34.399> longer

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
understand most animals have lar longer

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.959 
understand most animals have lar longer
rear<00:00:35.600> legs<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.110> they<00:00:36.170> do<00:00:36.230> with<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.620> front

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
rear legs and they do with the front

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.360 
rear legs and they do with the front
especially<00:00:37.969> cats<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:38.540> stuff<00:00:39.010> so<00:00:40.010> basically

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
especially cats and stuff so basically

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.970 
especially cats and stuff so basically
what<00:00:40.579> I<00:00:40.610> did<00:00:40.670> for<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:41.149> front<00:00:41.270> legs<00:00:41.600> each<00:00:42.530> major

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
what I did for the front legs each major

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.250 
what I did for the front legs each major
bone<00:00:43.340> is<00:00:43.640> 2<00:00:44.629> inches

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
bone is 2 inches

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260 
bone is 2 inches
so<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:45.920> is<00:00:46.040> 2<00:00:46.190> inches<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.700> this<00:00:46.790> is<00:00:46.940> 2<00:00:47.090> inches

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
so this is 2 inches and this is 2 inches

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.700 
so this is 2 inches and this is 2 inches
all<00:00:47.600> four<00:00:48.260> feet<00:00:48.530> are<00:00:48.769> one<00:00:49.339> inch<00:00:49.519> long<00:00:49.760> so

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
all four feet are one inch long so

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.639 
all four feet are one inch long so
basically<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:51.859> have<00:00:52.129> four<00:00:53.199> inches<00:00:54.199> of<00:00:54.409> length

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
basically I have four inches of length

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.399 
basically I have four inches of length
however<00:00:55.399> you<00:00:55.670> bend<00:00:55.879> it<00:00:56.089> there's<00:00:56.870> basically

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
however you bend it there's basically

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.169 
however you bend it there's basically
four<00:00:57.679> inches<00:00:57.980> of<00:00:58.129> linked<00:00:58.399> for<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.609> front<00:00:58.850> arms

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
four inches of linked for the front arms

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.720 
four inches of linked for the front arms
not<00:00:59.749> counting<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.109> feet<00:01:00.289> and<00:01:00.829> for<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:01.489> rear

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
not counting the feet and for the rear

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.180 
not counting the feet and for the rear
what<00:01:02.600> I<00:01:02.629> did<00:01:02.839> was<00:01:03.050> as<00:01:03.230> I<00:01:03.350> went<00:01:03.559> two<00:01:03.800> and<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:04.010> half

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
what I did was as I went two and a half

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.510 
what I did was as I went two and a half
inches<00:01:04.550> each<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:06.170> basically<00:01:06.680> you<00:01:07.190> know<00:01:07.310> it's

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
inches each so basically you know it's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.940 
inches each so basically you know it's
five<00:01:07.729> inches<00:01:07.970> of<00:01:08.150> length<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:08.780> gave<00:01:09.470> me<00:01:09.740> that

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
five inches of length that gave me that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
five inches of length that gave me that
are<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:11.060> longer<00:01:11.450> length<00:01:11.690> and<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.020> rear

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
are the longer length and the rear

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.660 
are the longer length and the rear
they're<00:01:13.970> all<00:01:14.150> individual<00:01:14.900> wires<00:01:15.580> there's<00:01:16.580> a

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
they're all individual wires there's a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.390 
they're all individual wires there's a
bend<00:01:16.940> here<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:17.479> I<00:01:18.170> take<00:01:18.470> them<00:01:18.650> to<00:01:18.800> get<00:01:18.890> her<00:01:19.100> I

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
bend here and I take them to get her I

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.999 
bend here and I take them to get her I
wired<00:01:20.090> them<00:01:20.329> together<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.899> then<00:01:21.710> once<00:01:21.890> they

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
wired them together and then once they

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.490 
wired them together and then once they
were<00:01:22.070> wired<00:01:22.340> together<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:22.729> wire<00:01:23.540> them<00:01:23.840> again<00:01:24.140> to

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
were wired together I wire them again to

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.480 
were wired together I wire them again to
the<00:01:24.710> s<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:26.090> I<00:01:26.119> Bend<00:01:26.770> that's<00:01:27.770> pretty<00:01:28.070> much<00:01:28.219> it

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
the s that I Bend that's pretty much it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.819 
the s that I Bend that's pretty much it
I<00:01:28.899> recommend<00:01:29.899> that<00:01:30.170> when<00:01:30.320> you're<00:01:30.500> when<00:01:30.799> you're

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
I recommend that when you're when you're

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.670 
I recommend that when you're when you're
doing<00:01:31.250> this<00:01:31.810> don't<00:01:32.810> worry<00:01:33.049> about<00:01:33.140> like<00:01:33.469> how

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
doing this don't worry about like how

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.529 
doing this don't worry about like how
the<00:01:33.740> position<00:01:34.610> are<00:01:34.729> if<00:01:34.850> you<00:01:34.939> look<00:01:35.090> this<00:01:35.240> looks

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
the position are if you look this looks

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.319 
the position are if you look this looks
very<00:01:35.600> animated<00:01:36.500> like<00:01:37.460> he's<00:01:37.640> ready<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:37.969> just

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
very animated like he's ready to just

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.389 
very animated like he's ready to just
start<00:01:38.509> walking<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.200> as<00:01:39.409> also<00:01:40.039> this<00:01:40.159> is<00:01:40.369> the

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
start walking and as also this is the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.349 
start walking and as also this is the
armature<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.240> far<00:01:42.070> but<00:01:43.070> before<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.610> go<00:01:44.180> into

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
armature so far but before you go into

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.660 
armature so far but before you go into
you<00:01:44.780> know<00:01:44.810> make<00:01:45.289> all<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.649> angles<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.490> all

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
you know make all the angles and and all

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.910 
you know make all the angles and and all
the<00:01:46.789> positioning<00:01:47.359> worry<00:01:48.289> about<00:01:48.530> your<00:01:48.680> major

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
the positioning worry about your major

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.179 
the positioning worry about your major
bins<00:01:49.369> first<00:01:49.850> and<00:01:50.500> have<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.619> look<00:01:51.770> like<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:51.979> robot

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
bins first and have it look like a robot

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.849 
bins first and have it look like a robot
basically<00:01:52.969> then<00:01:53.509> you<00:01:53.539> can<00:01:53.780> go<00:01:53.930> back<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.350> like

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
basically then you can go back and like

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.319 
basically then you can go back and like
pull<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:55.280> arm<00:01:55.520> back<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> little<00:01:56.149> bit

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
pull this arm back a little bit

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.029 
pull this arm back a little bit
straighten<00:01:56.840> this<00:01:56.960> one<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.409> compensate

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
straighten this one of the compensate

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.719 
straighten this one of the compensate
you<00:01:58.729> know<00:01:58.850> mean<00:01:59.560> but<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.590> hope<00:02:00.829> this<00:02:01.009> kind<00:02:01.579> of

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
you know mean but I hope this kind of

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.279 
you know mean but I hope this kind of
like<00:02:01.909> gives<00:02:02.179> you<00:02:02.270> an<00:02:02.420> idea<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:03.079> is

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
like gives you an idea this is

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.200 
like gives you an idea this is
demonstration<00:02:04.159> that<00:02:04.369> you're<00:02:04.549> fixin<00:02:04.880> see<00:02:05.030> and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
demonstration that you're fixin see and

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.290 
demonstration that you're fixin see and
this<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.079> pretty<00:02:06.289> big<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:07.490> rulers<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.090> are

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
this is pretty big this rulers that are

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.320 
this is pretty big this rulers that are
foot<00:02:08.840> long<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.369> it's<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.640> pretty<00:02:10.850> good<00:02:11.090> size

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
foot long so it's a pretty good size

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.500 
foot long so it's a pretty good size
project<00:02:11.830> I'm<00:02:12.830> really<00:02:13.670> really<00:02:13.820> excited<00:02:14.000> about

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
project I'm really really excited about

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
wire this is a 20 gauge and that's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.470 
wire this is a 20 gauge and that's
pretty<00:02:42.750> much<00:02:42.870> all<00:02:43.050> I'm<00:02:43.170> going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.320> be<00:02:43.410> using

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
pretty much all I'm going to be using

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.700 
pretty much all I'm going to be using
the<00:02:45.480> galvanized<00:02:45.930> wire<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.440> comes<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.660> spool

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
the galvanized wire it comes in a spool

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.330 
the galvanized wire it comes in a spool
that's<00:02:49.710> 100<00:02:50.160> foot<00:02:50.400> long<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.800> smaller<00:02:53.070> one

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
that's 100 foot long and the smaller one

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.270 
that's 100 foot long and the smaller one
is<00:02:53.520> 75<00:02:54.030> foot<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.540> got<00:02:55.050> them<00:02:55.230> both<00:02:55.380> from<00:02:55.650> Walmart

is 75 foot I got them both from Walmart
they<00:02:56.940> were<00:02:57.000> pretty<00:02:57.360> cheap<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.840> they're

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
they were pretty cheap and they're

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.760 
they were pretty cheap and they're
pretty<00:02:58.710> stiff<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.750> just<00:03:00.750> wanted<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.470> give<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.710> a

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
pretty stiff I just wanted to give it a

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.310 
pretty stiff I just wanted to give it a
try<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.010> see<00:03:02.310> how<00:03:02.340> how<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:02.970> works<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.390> all<00:03:03.770> but

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
try and see how how it works and all but

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.790 
try and see how how it works and all but
basically<00:03:07.320> what<00:03:07.530> I'm<00:03:07.620> doing<00:03:07.890> here<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.100> I'm

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
basically what I'm doing here is I'm

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.050 
basically what I'm doing here is I'm
bending<00:03:10.800> my<00:03:10.860> first<00:03:11.250> two<00:03:11.460> pieces<00:03:11.640> these<00:03:12.000> are

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
bending my first two pieces these are

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.480 
bending my first two pieces these are
the<00:03:12.300> front<00:03:12.540> legs<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.580> I<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:15.180> first<00:03:15.330> bend<00:03:15.990> it

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
the front legs and I the first bend it

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.380 
the front legs and I the first bend it
doesn't<00:03:17.490> really<00:03:17.580> matter<00:03:17.790> how<00:03:17.970> long<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.360> is

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
doesn't really matter how long it is

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.060 
doesn't really matter how long it is
it's<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:19.050> going<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.230> be<00:03:19.380> that's<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:19.890> part

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
it's just going to be that's the part

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.570 
it's just going to be that's the part
that's<00:03:20.100> going<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.400> be<00:03:20.550> tied<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.320> S<00:03:22.800> I<00:03:23.190> make

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
that's going to be tied to the S I make

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.270 
that's going to be tied to the S I make
the<00:03:23.820> main<00:03:24.000> body<00:03:24.770> what<00:03:25.770> you<00:03:25.950> see<00:03:26.130> me<00:03:26.250> doing

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
the main body what you see me doing

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.740 
the main body what you see me doing
right<00:03:26.640> there<00:03:28.190> in<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.400> very<00:03:30.000> next<00:03:30.210> bend<00:03:30.510> will

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
right there in the very next bend will

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.390 
right there in the very next bend will
be<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:32.300> 2-inch<00:03:35.239> Bend<00:03:36.950> that<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.010> was<00:03:38.220> talking

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
be that 2-inch Bend that I was talking

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.930 
be that 2-inch Bend that I was talking
about<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:41.010> I'm<00:03:41.760> going<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.600> do<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.930> with<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
second part too but I'm just making the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.270 
second part too but I'm just making the
measurement<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.100> little<00:03:47.220> bit<00:03:47.400> longer<00:03:49.280> this

project I'm going to try it to make
these<00:03:55.860> videos<00:03:56.040> not<00:03:56.550> very<00:03:57.270> very<00:03:57.420> long<00:03:58.160> there

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
these videos not very very long there

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.790 
these videos not very very long there
might<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.760> know<00:04:00.290> I'm<00:04:01.290> not<00:04:01.410> going<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.680> say

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
there's like I'm going to be a bunch of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.820 
there's like I'm going to be a bunch of
them<00:04:03.180> but<00:04:03.360> I'm<00:04:03.450> not<00:04:03.540> going<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.780> try<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.470> stuff

them but I'm not going to try to stuff

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.490 
them but I'm not going to try to stuff
it<00:04:04.980> all<00:04:05.100> into<00:04:05.400> just<00:04:05.610> a<00:04:05.700> few<00:04:05.880> videos<00:04:06.290> like<00:04:07.290> for

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
it all into just a few videos like for

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.140 
it all into just a few videos like for
instance<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:07.980> video<00:04:08.280> right<00:04:08.580> here<00:04:08.610> all's<00:04:08.970> it

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
instance this video right here all's it

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.910 
instance this video right here all's it
is<00:04:09.239> is<00:04:09.300> this<00:04:09.630> armature<00:04:10.080> because<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.650> think<00:04:10.830> this

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
is is this armature because I think this

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.160 
is is this armature because I think this
is<00:04:11.040> very<00:04:11.100> important<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.660> don't<00:04:12.720> want<00:04:13.020> it<00:04:13.050> to

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
is very important and I don't want it to

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.810 
is very important and I don't want it to
be<00:04:13.260> all<00:04:13.380> jumbled<00:04:13.890> together<00:04:13.980> with<00:04:14.459> like<00:04:14.670> the

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
be all jumbled together with like the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.870 
be all jumbled together with like the
tape<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:15.270> the<00:04:15.420> foil<00:04:16.250> this<00:04:17.250> way<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.489> can<00:04:17.700> focus

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
tape in the foil this way I can focus

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.210 
tape in the foil this way I can focus
more<00:04:18.390> on<00:04:18.690> trying<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.470> explain<00:04:19.830> what<00:04:20.100> I'm<00:04:20.190> doing
