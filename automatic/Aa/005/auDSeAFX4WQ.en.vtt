right now first of all I'm going to show

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.049 
right now first of all I'm going to show
you<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:34.230> tail<00:00:34.500> these<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.580> modular

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
you the tail these are a modular

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.729 
you the tail these are a modular
snowshoe<00:00:36.629> which<00:00:36.989> means<00:00:37.199> you<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.470> add<00:00:37.590> these

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
snowshoe which means you can add these

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.189 
snowshoe which means you can add these
tails<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.220> you<00:00:38.280> need<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.580> flotation<00:00:39.199> when

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
tails and you need more flotation when

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.750 
tails and you need more flotation when
the<00:00:40.290> snows<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.530> real<00:00:40.890> deep<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.460> mainly

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the snows not real deep you just mainly

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.160 
the snows not real deep you just mainly
need<00:00:41.970> a<00:00:42.030> snowshoe<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:42.570> sort<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.870> minimal

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
need a snowshoe for sort of minimal

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.960 
need a snowshoe for sort of minimal
floatation<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.830> good<00:00:44.010> traction<00:00:44.339> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.640> use

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
floatation and good traction you can use

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.329 
floatation and good traction you can use
it<00:00:45.150> without<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> tail<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.220> a<00:00:47.250> little

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
it without the tail so it's a little

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:48.890 
it without the tail so it's a little
more<00:00:47.460> maneuverable<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.720> day<00:00:48.870> like

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
more maneuverable but on a day like

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.810 
more maneuverable but on a day like
today<00:00:49.080> we're<00:00:49.409> a<00:00:49.440> deep<00:00:49.680> deep<00:00:49.920> powder<00:00:50.159> I'm<00:00:50.519> going

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
today we're a deep deep powder I'm going

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
today we're a deep deep powder I'm going
to<00:00:50.879> slap<00:00:51.089> on<00:00:51.269> a<00:00:51.299> pair<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:51.720> tails<00:00:52.080> they

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
to slap on a pair of these tails they

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
to slap on a pair of these tails they
come<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.799> one<00:00:52.979> size<00:00:53.220> for<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.580> Evo<00:00:53.879> model<00:00:54.210> it's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
come in one size for the Evo model it's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.390 
come in one size for the Evo model it's
a<00:00:54.390> six<00:00:54.659> inch<00:00:54.870> tail<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.409> it<00:00:55.949> basically<00:00:56.280> just

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
a six inch tail and it basically just

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.430 
a six inch tail and it basically just
goes<00:00:56.729> on<00:00:57.589> right<00:00:58.589> on<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.799> back<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.900> and<00:01:00.900> once

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
goes on right on the back here and once

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.090 
goes on right on the back here and once
that<00:01:01.589> is<00:01:01.769> in<00:01:01.890> place<00:01:02.449> I'm<00:01:03.449> gonna<00:01:03.659> have

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
that is in place I'm gonna have

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.950 
that is in place I'm gonna have
significantly<00:01:05.100> more<00:01:05.330> flotation<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.600> basically

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
significantly more flotation I basically

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.980 
significantly more flotation I basically
increased<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> length<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:07.770> snowshoe

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
increased the length of my snowshoe

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.810 
increased the length of my snowshoe
check<00:01:09.990> out<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> traction<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> Evo<00:01:11.250> ascend

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
check out the traction on the Evo ascend

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.340 
check out the traction on the Evo ascend
here<00:01:12.060> there's<00:01:12.299> lots<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.780> lots<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.260> these

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
here there's lots and lots of it these

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.590 
here there's lots and lots of it these
are<00:01:13.409> steel<00:01:13.830> traction<00:01:14.729> running<00:01:15.000> length<00:01:15.240> front

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
are steel traction running length front

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.780 
are steel traction running length front
and<00:01:15.840> back<00:01:16.140> as<00:01:16.500> well<00:01:16.800> as<00:01:16.950> these<00:01:17.190> horizontal

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790

traction<00:01:18.390> bars<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.680> get<00:01:19.950> extraordinarily

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
traction bars so you get extraordinarily

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.960 
traction bars so you get extraordinarily
good<00:01:21.060> traction<00:01:21.480> with<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.690> model<00:01:22.050> here<00:01:22.970> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
good traction with this model here the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
good traction with this model here the
ascent<00:01:24.690> means<00:01:25.050> that<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.440> comes<00:01:25.650> with<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
ascent means that it comes with a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.680 
ascent means that it comes with a
climbing<00:01:26.310> bar<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.300> can<00:01:27.450> pop<00:01:27.660> that

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
climbing bar so you can pop that

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.900 
climbing bar so you can pop that
climbing<00:01:28.260> bar<00:01:28.410> up<00:01:28.560> when<00:01:28.980> you're<00:01:29.100> ascending<00:01:29.730> up

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
climbing bar up when you're ascending up

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.280 
climbing bar up when you're ascending up
a<00:01:30.030> hill<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.510> a<00:01:30.540> long<00:01:30.690> ways<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.230> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
a hill for a long ways it's going to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.290 
a hill for a long ways it's going to
take<00:01:31.470> strain<00:01:32.010> off<00:01:32.130> your<00:01:32.160> calf<00:01:32.550> as<00:01:32.760> well<00:01:32.940> as<00:01:33.030> put

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
take strain off your calf as well as put

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.850 
take strain off your calf as well as put
a<00:01:33.330> little<00:01:33.480> more<00:01:33.600> pressure<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> shoe<00:01:34.650> for

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
a little more pressure to the shoe for

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.250 
a little more pressure to the shoe for
better<00:01:35.010> traction<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> binding<00:01:38.880> is

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
better traction and then the binding is

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260 
better traction and then the binding is
been<00:01:40.260> improved<00:01:40.680> over<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.040> classic<00:01:41.670> Denali

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
been improved over the classic Denali

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.750 
been improved over the classic Denali
model<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.380> stiffer<00:01:43.680> material<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
model it's a stiffer material so it

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.670 
model it's a stiffer material so it
actually<00:01:45.090> stays<00:01:45.360> open<00:01:45.900> it's<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> little<00:01:46.500> easier

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
actually stays open it's a little easier

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.430 
actually stays open it's a little easier
to<00:01:46.800> get<00:01:46.920> into<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.370> out<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.750> aside<00:01:48.750> from<00:01:48.960> the

MSR<00:02:24.840> did<00:02:25.110> build<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.470> stopping

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
MSR did build a stopping

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.070 
MSR did build a stopping
point<00:02:26.129> so<00:02:26.790> at<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.970> certain<00:02:27.300> point<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.690> finding

point so at a certain point the finding

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.780 
point so at a certain point the finding
actually<00:02:28.260> hits<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.010> stopping<00:02:29.430> point<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:29.700> it's

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
actually hits the stopping point so it's

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.910 
actually hits the stopping point so it's
not<00:02:29.910> gonna<00:02:30.030> completely<00:02:30.540> swing<00:02:30.959> away<00:02:31.200> all
