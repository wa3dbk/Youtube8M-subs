00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 very good to all of them that we are 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.270
 in minecraft 1.6 point 4 we will see a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.179
 mod what it costs me to find a way 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.250
 I like it a lot 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.799
 but good this tangle of wands and 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.760
 some that are very cool we keep 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.529
 is the magic wand that this is a 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.430
 potato season because this wand is 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.560
 well, that's how I order, I do not know how not 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.539
 use this stick because it does not have any 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.869
 it is used for nothing but good is done with 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.160
 two go naked of these and a little stick and 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.640
 now let's see the real rods 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.770
 let's see for example this same up 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.489
 here does not make much sense we're going to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.489
 around here there is a river 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.670
 is for example the tender wand 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 He passed 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:56.489
 these two eyes to sell and an emerald 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.489
 what it does is throw in pearls 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.630
 which is quite wrong let's load it 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.900
 I was in the same hosts but I was 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.659
 so this wand is like ice 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.659
 so the same graphic is done but in 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.820
 instead of ender eyes of these balls of 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.820
 snow and this freeze the water 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.290
 forever 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.010
 you can not do so for example have 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.050
 to have a party block but that 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.080
 It is too bad but not be cool 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.630
 should that nothing that will freeze it 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.450
 because you have that is pretty cool the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.190
 healing wand that is made with two 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.820
 gas tears and the usual mailman 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.810
 emerald stick and the gold nuggets and 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.810
 this thank you throw passions 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.200
 the issues that have enough uses 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.640
 my mother is wands to pick up 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.610
 crops the truth is that we were 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.680
 enough nutrition is that if done with 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.810
 two scissors of these and coffee or this 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.060
 It is always the sign and pretty 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.329
 cool 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.560
 especially for that for crops 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.820
 for everything that has to do now 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.160
 then we will try it better than it is 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.290
 rather the growth rod 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.599
 it would be this that is the character of always 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.120
 but with two bones it acts as labor and 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:20.099
 thousand 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.099
 but it is very beast 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.500
 here 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.290
 we will do well the just 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.650
 see before harvesting that pick 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.080
 crops then we need to do this 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.080
 I'm pretty full if it can be 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.319
 so for example if it grows 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.569
 simply but it is here we have seen 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.440
 before picking pick up any 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:52.209
 growing things and these are plants 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.600
 we click and around collect everything 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.910
 break everything less 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.910
 which is pretty cool 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.450
 the blow crops for example is 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.310
 pretty but good the growth of 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.340
 the one that we are seeing what dwells me 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.860
 it's also that you can do barbarities 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.050
 we 're going to see it with the cactus if we give 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.500
 right click distinguishes is that we can 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.500
 Helping 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.230
 and it grows up there before 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.450
 let's try 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.379
 it is a barbarity 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.200
 and keeps growing 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.590
 let's spend the whole wand in a 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.860
 cactus I do not know why I feel like it and go 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.940
 to put us here look what atrocity is 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.080
 a mine that is to pick up though if 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.430
 you break it from below is the same 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.650
 really because this one is already enough 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.739
 from here that is to chop let's see what 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.010
 which is two gold peaks we are always 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.590
 there 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.720
 as you see keeping right clicking 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.060
 the point is that they go down instants is 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.739
 awful this peak 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.160
 in its place it was up to the peaks of 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.160
 gold to do it 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.419
 it's super epic I'm at your dances 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.340
 creative the wand of death should 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.710
 be done with two heads of 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.300
 Krafft care and the usual and this 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.300
 that launches that same 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.460
 let's see if you are spending a lot 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.910
 next you keep it pressing you're going 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.070
 letting go 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.380
 it does not have a lot of uses that does 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.480
 but we have also here the one of 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.600
 fireballs made with fire 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.170
 search these and the usual punishment and 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.170
 act the same 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.129
 and this seems faster 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.960
 the magical missile wand of this 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.190
 most that is with two golden swords 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:06.140
 of the postman of always and it is not that it is 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.140
 an arrow simply to keep it 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.449
 as you see what is keeping it is 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.580
 I'm just not doing any 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.669
 click 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.620
 the spears super fast uncle is 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.810
 pretty cool but hey this is the 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.539
 engine I hope you liked it very 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.550
 curious that if you have the and that the 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.020
 description is for 1.6 point 4 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.020
 will be with forge and so on 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:40.800
 we go up there are a lot 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.800
 bye 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.800
 ah
