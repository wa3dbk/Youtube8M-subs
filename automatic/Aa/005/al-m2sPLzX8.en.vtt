00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
then if this is the first edit we would

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.750 
then if this is the first edit we would
say<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.450> is<00:02:23.630> number<00:02:23.780> one<00:02:24.110> we<00:02:24.830> always<00:02:25.430> save

ours this JPEG format it's easy to open
with<00:02:29.570> most<00:02:29.780> programs<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.440> then<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.560> would<00:02:30.710> say

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
with most programs and then we would say

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.060 
with most programs and then we would say
okay<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:33.170> asking<00:02:33.380> me<00:02:33.560> where<00:02:33.740> I<00:02:33.770> want<00:02:33.980> to

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
store it in this case I'm just going to

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.330 
store it in this case I'm just going to
store<00:02:36.380> it<00:02:36.470> in<00:02:36.560> my<00:02:36.680> documents<00:02:36.740> where<00:02:37.310> I

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.760 
store it in my documents where I
originally<00:02:37.520> started<00:02:38.360> but<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:39.290> could<00:02:39.470> save<00:02:39.650> it

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
originally started but you could save it

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.020 
originally started but you could save it
wherever<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.160> want<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:43.160> next<00:02:43.730> thing<00:02:43.910> I

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
wherever you want and the next thing I

wherever you want and the next thing I
teach<00:02:44.120> my<00:02:44.420> students<00:02:44.780> how<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:44.900> do<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.410> any<00:02:45.800> kind

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
teach my students how to do is any kind

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.860 
teach my students how to do is any kind
of<00:02:46.220> adjustment<00:02:46.820> basic<00:02:47.120> adjustments<00:02:47.570> so<00:02:47.690> in

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
of adjustment basic adjustments so in

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
of adjustment basic adjustments so in
this<00:02:47.990> case<00:02:48.230> adjustment<00:02:50.500> actually<00:02:51.500> let's<00:02:51.710> do

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
this case adjustment actually let's do

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.760 
this case adjustment actually let's do
image<00:02:52.370> we<00:02:52.730> want<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:52.970> rotate<00:02:53.090> this<00:02:53.480> one<00:02:53.770> line

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
image we want to rotate this one line

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.110 
image we want to rotate this one line
just<00:02:54.800> happens<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.430> be<00:02:55.520> turned<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.940> wrong<00:02:56.060> way

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
just happens to be turned the wrong way

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.160 
just happens to be turned the wrong way
so<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:56.930> rotated<00:02:57.440> 90<00:02:57.709> degrees<00:02:58.010> clockwise<00:02:58.310> and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
so I rotated 90 degrees clockwise and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.790 
so I rotated 90 degrees clockwise and
adjustment<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.260> first<00:03:00.470> thing<00:03:00.650> I<00:03:00.740> teach

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
adjustment the first thing I teach

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.980 
adjustment the first thing I teach
usually<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.610> desaturate<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:02.660> if<00:03:02.750> they<00:03:02.840> want

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
usually is to desaturate so if they want

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.380 
usually is to desaturate so if they want
to<00:03:03.050> have<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> black<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.560> white<00:03:03.650> photo<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.390> we

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
to have a black and white photo and we

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.230 
to have a black and white photo and we
want<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.630> do<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:07.130> case<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.640> then

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
want to do that in this case and then

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.030 
want to do that in this case and then
the<00:03:08.390> next<00:03:08.690> thing<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:08.959> usually<00:03:09.110> teach<00:03:09.590> for<00:03:09.860> photo

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
the next thing I usually teach for photo

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.190 
the next thing I usually teach for photo
editing<00:03:10.400> for<00:03:10.610> elementary<00:03:11.209> school<00:03:11.510> we<00:03:11.900> will

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
editing for elementary school we will

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.890 
editing for elementary school we will
learn<00:03:12.320> how<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.500> crop<00:03:12.740> so<00:03:13.459> if<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:14.180> want<00:03:14.510> them<00:03:14.720> to

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
learn how to crop so if I want them to

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.780 
learn how to crop so if I want them to
pay<00:03:15.080> attention<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.740> the<00:03:15.980> expression<00:03:16.610> on<00:03:16.760> a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
pay attention to the expression on a

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.780 
pay attention to the expression on a
face<00:03:17.140> we<00:03:18.140> probably<00:03:18.530> don't<00:03:18.920> need<00:03:19.070> all<00:03:19.610> that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
face we probably don't need all that

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.840 
face we probably don't need all that
extra<00:03:20.000> background<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.440> would<00:03:22.160> use<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.490> cropping

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
extra background I would use a cropping

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.540 
extra background I would use a cropping
tool<00:03:23.270> and<00:03:23.690> when<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.170> hit<00:03:24.380> enter<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:25.010> crops<00:03:25.340> a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
tool and when I hit enter it crops a

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.920 
tool and when I hit enter it crops a
photo<00:03:25.760> for<00:03:26.000> me<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.790> next<00:03:29.209> thing<00:03:29.600> I

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
photo for me and the next thing I

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.600 
photo for me and the next thing I
usually<00:03:30.110> teach<00:03:30.560> them<00:03:30.769> how<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:30.920> do<00:03:31.160> in<00:03:31.400> this

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
usually teach them how to do in this

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.580 
usually teach them how to do in this
project<00:03:31.940> is<00:03:32.330> how<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.570> poster<00:03:33.019> eyes<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.320> image

project is how to poster eyes the image

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.310 
project is how to poster eyes the image
I<00:03:33.800> want<00:03:34.519> this<00:03:34.760> desaturated<00:03:35.320> black-and-white

I want this desaturated black-and-white
photo<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:37.160> be<00:03:37.280> simplified<00:03:38.000> so<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.390> my

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
photo to be simplified so that my

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.020 
photo to be simplified so that my
students<00:03:38.870> can<00:03:39.110> see<00:03:39.320> highlights<00:03:40.250> mid-tones

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
students can see highlights mid-tones

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.890 
students can see highlights mid-tones
and<00:03:41.680> shadows<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:44.090> we<00:03:44.239> can<00:03:44.420> use<00:03:44.600> the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
and shadows and we can use the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.680 
and shadows and we can use the
adjustment<00:03:46.330> posterized

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
adjustment posterized

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.289

different<00:03:55.670> levels<00:03:55.790> but<00:03:56.600> I<00:03:56.660> have<00:03:56.900> my<00:03:57.049> students

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
different levels but I have my students

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.580 
different levels but I have my students
change<00:03:57.709> this<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:58.130> three<00:03:58.430> levels<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:59.440> that<00:04:00.440> way

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
change this to three levels and that way

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.930 
change this to three levels and that way
it's<00:04:00.769> giving<00:04:01.010> me<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.130> highlight<00:04:01.489> of<00:04:01.670> mid-tone

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
it's giving me a highlight of mid-tone

it's giving me a highlight of mid-tone
in<00:04:02.209> a<00:04:02.330> dark<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.110> that<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.440> it<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:04.390> say<00:04:05.390> okay
