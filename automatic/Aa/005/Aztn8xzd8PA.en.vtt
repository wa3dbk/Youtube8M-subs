00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 The air club of Paraíba has never been so 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.000
 busy and sought after as it is now 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.730
 explanation is in this place is where 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.250
 operates the 1st maintenance workshop of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.289
 executive aircraft of the state 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.900
 the new venture that works 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.689
 only four months but is already a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.970
 true success, everything started from the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.519
 initiative of this businessman from São Paulo who 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.039
 is also a pilot and owner of 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.760
 aircraft and that he chose paraíba to 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.859
 live 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.530
 I had to send the planes out. 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.050
 state out of the northeast to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.149
 proper maintenance and this in addition 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.800
 logistics is also very large. 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.250
 cost is not too expensive you do 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.260
 that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.600
 the idea of diego was to receive on average 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.520
 three aircraft per month 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.270
 but today the workshop meets at least 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.280
 three clients per week and they come from 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.340
 all parts of the country 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.079
 andré nunes for example is from ceará 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.850
 state that also has workshops 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.460
 specialized 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.949
 the aircraft that has just 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.619
 buy in the united states will receive 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.990
 maintenance in joão pessoa is the only 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.760
 northeastern workshop that has the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.770
 for this type of aircraft 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.340
 this aircraft is a classic 1967 right 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.619
 I researched and knew here is the workshop 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.259
 now at the beginning of the year that I came to joão 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.159
 person and I already identified myself with the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.040
 Hey guys , what's the definition of doing? 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.380
 here is not the same intentions 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 what is the differential of your company and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.000
 I think it's a whole in this 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.040
 set includes price includes quality 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.070
 included care 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.229
 then it is where increasing 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.090
 number of customers precisely in this 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.280
 here in the center of 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.829
 tools, we have an idea of ​​the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.509
 control of the company's concern with 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.390
 security issue, we observe that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.969
 each tool has a bar code and 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.979
 this may be fundamental to ensure 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.750
 flight safety is and group like 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.640
 the system works and the goal is to 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.409
 precisely one of the objectives of this 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.550
 control system and traceability of 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.110
 tool to ensure that the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.880
 tool it went out to aircraft 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.890
 returned to the center of 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.540
 tool at the correct time and was 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.210
 used for short way correct way 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.770
 also then later in the day we do 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.330
 a control the tools to know if 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.700
 no tool was left inside the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.410
 aircraft which may even compromise the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.120
 security is precisely this is one of the 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.770
 barriers that we put in place to 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.360
 ensure the safety of operations and 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.880
 that control this tool does not 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.110
 bolt you also know every item in the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.330
 aircraft is controlled 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.390
 the success of the enterprise and 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.340
 igor already thinks about going further 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.190
 The next goal is to install a 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.920
 air taxi company and 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.720
 and the workshop is the basis of the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.610
 projects other projects would be to 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.950
 2016 2017 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.710
 the success that has not been achieved until 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.030
 then it was possible to main this 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.340
 other projects such as 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.170
 cargo transport company as well as the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.450
 interior medical service of the state and 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.450
 also the aerial taxi prajá for 2015
