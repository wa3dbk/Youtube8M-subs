00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
storm series started okay and it's given

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.160 
storm series started okay and it's given
people<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.760> mindset<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.390> they<00:00:48.719> need<00:00:48.989> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
people this mindset that they need to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.810 
people this mindset that they need to
rely<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.500> supports<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.280> order<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.579> play<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
rely on supports in order to play a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.439 
rely on supports in order to play a
match<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:52.079> with<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> new<00:00:53.370> feature<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:54.120> think

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
match and with this new feature I think

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.910 
match and with this new feature I think
it'll<00:00:54.600> change<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.320> way<00:00:55.440> people<00:00:55.469> think

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
it'll change the way people think

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
it'll change the way people think
because<00:00:56.460> you're<00:00:57.420> gonna<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
because you're gonna have that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.500 
because you're gonna have that
availability<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.770> playing<00:00:59.129> by<00:00:59.309> yourself<00:00:59.510> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
availability of playing by yourself and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.090 
availability of playing by yourself and
you're<00:01:00.930> gonna<00:01:01.050> start<00:01:01.620> being<00:01:01.859> more

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
you're gonna start being more

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.490 
you're gonna start being more
independent<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:03.239> know<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.840> your<00:01:04.019> character

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that you're gonna have to rely on this

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.219 
that you're gonna have to rely on this

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
one character that you're playing and I

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.649 
one character that you're playing and I
think<00:01:13.619> person<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.490> gonna<00:01:14.580> change<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.150> mindset

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
think person is gonna change the mindset

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
think person is gonna change the mindset
of<00:01:15.689> how<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:15.990> play<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.590> how<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.979> fight<00:01:17.340> how

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of how you play and how you fight how

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.999 
of how you play and how you fight how
you<00:01:17.610> approach<00:01:18.030> everything<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.890> not<00:01:19.890> only

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
you approach everything and not only

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.950 
you approach everything and not only
that<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.240> when<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.570> do

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that but I think that when you do

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.109 
that but I think that when you do
actually<00:01:22.290> designed<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> your<00:01:23.130> support<00:01:23.580> I
