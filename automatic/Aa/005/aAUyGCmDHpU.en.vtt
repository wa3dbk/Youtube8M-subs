00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.490
 ah 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.280
 hello I had been cg 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.100
 in this new tutorial I come to 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.070
 present a beautiful program created by 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.920
 rain evans a friend of mine program 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.450
 this program has now created four 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.000
 programs that help you 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.030
 configuration of your account the strike and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.149
 much more good let's start 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 in more detailed information for 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.610
 what is the use of the program we are going to enter 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.680
 this program calculates the best 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.420
 Mouse configuration is better than a 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.579
 human head based on documentation 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.980
 of the game can be an annulment of 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.600
 calculate excite action exactly 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.960
 equal to the game and a new system 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.870
 to calculate the servers rats and the rate 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.880
 open the program without calculating pones 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 the value of your was ps and in proceeding 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.790
 When I have determined what matters 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.760
 aimed loosen point rs or dot text 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.420
 this is very useful for a hpg or for your 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.930
 Acs configuration fine 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.760
 we do what we do well that we will 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.500
 angular 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.530
 how many times do you play ask us 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.920
 why 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.890
 in my case always 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.780
 perceive a configuration this is already 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.759
 we already have our commands 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.010
 commands that we have to have so that 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:45.190
 I will be 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.690
 rate 105 c lm baku 3 celebrates 50 this is 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.720
 my configuration which I could use 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.200
 to play with the best times and to 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.180
 best confederation 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.750
 this was all at least youtube I'm going to 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.050
 follow in new tutorials presenting 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.590
 these two programs that we have left 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.590
 It's a very good program 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.280
 it is also very good program clear this 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.720
 is created by reign counter-strike a 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.239
 greeting to him thank you very much for 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.170
 let me share of these programs 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:21.010
 about a beast really serve a lot 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.010
 until next time
