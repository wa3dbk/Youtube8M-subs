00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:14.160
 90 Today I will teach you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.440
 how does that one receive the beloved that the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.310
 people have seen so much out there and it 's okay 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.539
 weak is very simple and easy to do 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.539
 I'm going back tutorial 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.040
 the first thing we'll do is 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.730
 cut the fabric in the size that people 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.780
 I want to make the network right in my 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.840
 if I cut about 77 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.390
 that's enough to give 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.290
 one turn in my head and leave the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.330
 tips is appearing as a detail 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.340
 that the great grace of this same band network 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.890
 to show up is to be 2 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:14.410
 laces so I made this cut stayed 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:17.850
 77 more or less by up to 10 centimeters 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.850
 more or less wide 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.680
 You can not leave that is too wide 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.400
 It's ugly, it really happens, it's going to 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.400
 that subway does not look pretty 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:19.810
 Now we are going to do the finishing 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.130
 at the tips of the band's network leaves 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.740
 rounded up because when people 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.560
 will make will go around in the air made me 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.620
 that finish can be left to the uncle 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.239
 as if they were two tie-stitches or 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.100
 You can leave Italy in your own head. 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.050
 but it is interesting to finish 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:44.000
 leaving the end of the network band 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:46.820
 round and then we will score is the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.920
 edge as we're going to sew now 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.190
 We'll check, I 'll make this appointment. 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.970
 the edge with pins that are not for 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.970
 leaving the port comes out pretty regular 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:33.489
 the appointment is now time for 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:37.720
 to sew I'll sew along 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:41.160
 my whole band had violence that 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:45.690
 I'll leave it at the end of the other end. 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.100
 an opening for who I can to 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.560
 will unravel 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.030
 my network well and leave it by the side 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.660
 sure as we continue for the 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.590
 Averse to leaving a little open 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.500
 on the other side turns and interesting 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.070
 after we finish this part 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.230
 and iron 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:13.000
 Let's go and let's think about it. 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.500
 think that the points of the machine is what 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.500
 We 're going to discuss sewing. 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.460
 now I left that opening I said 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.030
 for you I left that opening 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.490
 I already spent on the iron just put the wire 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.210
 we measure more or less the extent of 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:19.270
 was our host cut the wire and 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:27.690
 puts in the milk what people 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:27.690
 it's making it very simple very easy 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:40.870
 I find it very practical and silenced because 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.909
 he is the character string or anything to 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.190
 people can shape it just for 

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:50.639
 Because the air is allow environment which is 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:56.979
 that we really see the law. 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:59.710
 and now to finish it is only closed the 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:04.139
 part that we want to leave the stone 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.139
 also turned up to put the wire 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:47.680
 our wraps are ready 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.870
