orchestra there's a dialogue that goes
on<00:00:26.939> between<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:28.740> soloist<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> front<00:00:29.580> and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
on between the soloist at the front and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.910 
on between the soloist at the front and
the<00:00:29.910> people<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.570> orchestra<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.859> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the people in the orchestra you have to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.830 
the people in the orchestra you have to
be<00:00:32.009> very<00:00:32.189> careful<00:00:32.460> about<00:00:32.550> balances<00:00:33.210> that's<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
be very careful about balances that's a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380 
be very careful about balances that's a
that's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.620> prime<00:00:34.980> consideration<00:00:35.390> it's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
that's a prime consideration it's

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.360 
that's a prime consideration it's
something<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.809> actually<00:00:37.469> worry<00:00:37.800> about<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> lot

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
something I actually worry about a lot

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.110 
something I actually worry about a lot
and<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.390> meet<00:00:39.780> Julie<00:00:40.170> yeah<00:00:40.649> I'm<00:00:40.980> sure<00:00:41.120> anyway

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and I meet Julie yeah I'm sure anyway

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.520 
and I meet Julie yeah I'm sure anyway
because<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.600> know<00:00:42.690> what<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> soloist<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.379> have

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
because you know what the soloist I have

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.049 
because you know what the soloist I have
to<00:00:43.649> push<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> tendency<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.850> write<00:00:45.030> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
to push and I have a tendency to write a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.029 
to push and I have a tendency to write a
lot<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.420> counterpoint<00:00:45.930> lines<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.590> active

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
lot of counterpoint lines and active

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.920 
lot of counterpoint lines and active
rhythms<00:00:47.370> which<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:48.030> much<00:00:48.360> harder<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.780> balance

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
rhythms which is much harder to balance

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.010 
rhythms which is much harder to balance
a<00:00:49.200> soloist<00:00:49.590> against<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.789> balance<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a soloist against but balance is the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.560 
a soloist against but balance is the
primary<00:00:52.260> thing<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.730> also<00:00:53.820> capturing

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
primary thing but it's also capturing

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.360 
primary thing but it's also capturing
the<00:00:54.719> essence<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> performer<00:00:55.739> trying<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the essence of the performer trying to

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.060 
the essence of the performer trying to
figure<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.760> ways<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.930> show<00:00:58.170> them<00:00:58.440> off<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
figure out ways to show them off all the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.319 
figure out ways to show them off all the
different<00:00:59.160> aspects<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.910> they're<00:01:00.030> playing

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
different aspects that they're playing

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.510 
different aspects that they're playing
their<00:01:00.570> artistry<00:01:01.129> especially<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> contrary

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
their artistry especially in a contrary

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.670 
their artistry especially in a contrary
you<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.090> opportunity<00:01:03.600> over<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> pretty

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
you have the opportunity over a pretty

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.710 
you have the opportunity over a pretty
big<00:01:04.860> narration<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.489> show<00:01:05.700> different<00:01:06.270> aspects

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
big narration to show different aspects

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.390 
big narration to show different aspects
of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> artist<00:01:07.290> that's<00:01:07.680> true<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.220> you're

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
of the artist that's true if you're

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.060 
of the artist that's true if you're
doing<00:01:08.610> something<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.180> orchestra<00:01:10.070> just

doing something for just orchestra just

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.380 
doing something for just orchestra just
less<00:01:11.250> pressure<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.090> don't<00:01:12.240> have

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
less pressure because you don't have

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.460 
less pressure because you don't have
someone<00:01:12.450> you're<00:01:12.869> trying<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.110> balance<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
someone you're trying to balance at the

what's<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.689> figure<00:01:39.840> out<00:01:39.900> how<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
what's on I can figure out how to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.289 
what's on I can figure out how to
balance<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.009> they<00:01:41.490> often<00:01:41.850> determine<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
balance it and they often determine the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.520 
balance it and they often determine the
instrumentation<00:01:42.840> according<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.409> what

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
instrumentation according to what

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.289 
instrumentation according to what
they've<00:01:43.649> already<00:01:43.890> put<00:01:44.280> on<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> program<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.180> if

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
they've already put on the program so if

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.389 
they've already put on the program so if
it's<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.930> bring<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.470> other<00:01:46.649> people<00:01:46.740> that's

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
it's I can bring in other people that's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.139 
it's I can bring in other people that's
right

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
right

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.179 
right
waste<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.899> people<00:01:49.200> who<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.409> there<00:01:49.649> that's<00:01:50.009> it

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
waste the people who are there that's it

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.249 
waste the people who are there that's it
exactly<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.119> what<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.020> do<00:01:52.140> is

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
exactly and so what I have to do is

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.109 
exactly and so what I have to do is
think<00:01:52.470> about<00:01:52.500> how<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.009> fit<00:01:53.280> my<00:01:53.310> creativity

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
think about how do I fit my creativity

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.209 
think about how do I fit my creativity
within<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.509> confines<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.170> they<00:01:55.470> need<00:01:55.710> for

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
within the confines that they need for

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.459 
within the confines that they need for
that<00:01:56.280> particular<00:01:56.759> concert<00:01:57.329> chamber<00:01:58.320> is

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
that particular concert chamber is

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.840 
that particular concert chamber is
different<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.250> gestures<00:01:59.670> are<00:01:59.700> very

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
different the gestures are very

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.310 
different the gestures are very
different<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.360> chamber<00:02:00.630> music<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:01.140> it's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
different in chamber music because it's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.450 
different in chamber music because it's
a<00:02:01.380> more<00:02:01.469> intimate<00:02:01.740> setting<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.310> more

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
a more intimate setting and it's more

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.240 
a more intimate setting and it's more
rehearsal<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.719> good<00:02:04.409> example<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.159> you

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
rehearsal a good example would be if you

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.050 
rehearsal a good example would be if you
looked<00:02:05.430> at<00:02:05.610> they

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
looked at they

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.910 
looked at they
toven<00:02:06.540> string<00:02:06.840> quartets<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.560> Beethoven

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
toven string quartets and Beethoven

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.080 
toven string quartets and Beethoven
symphonies<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> string<00:02:08.759> writing<00:02:09.030> is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
symphonies the string writing is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.510 
symphonies the string writing is
actually<00:02:09.209> different<00:02:09.569> that's<00:02:10.440> true<00:02:10.830> yeah<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
actually different that's true yeah the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.820 
actually different that's true yeah the
complexity<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.599> way<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.989> lines<00:02:13.200> interact

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
complexity the way the lines interact

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.650 
complexity the way the lines interact
and<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.120> consider<00:02:15.450> when<00:02:15.599> you're

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
and you have to consider when you're

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.120 
and you have to consider when you're
running<00:02:15.900> for<00:02:15.989> Orchestra<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:16.739> it's<00:02:17.010> a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
running for Orchestra that it's it's a

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.280 
running for Orchestra that it's it's a
big<00:02:17.280> organism<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.510> big<00:02:18.690> hall<00:02:18.989> so

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
big organism and it's in a big hall so

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.229 
big organism and it's in a big hall so
there's<00:02:19.620> an<00:02:19.739> acoustical<00:02:20.340> phenomenon<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.030> this

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
there's an acoustical phenomenon of this

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.660 
there's an acoustical phenomenon of this
sound<00:02:21.959> that<00:02:22.170> kind<00:02:22.349> of<00:02:22.440> collects<00:02:22.920> if<00:02:23.430> you<00:02:23.489> get<00:02:23.640> a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
sound that kind of collects if you get a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.240 
sound that kind of collects if you get a
lot<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:23.910> people<00:02:24.030> playing<00:02:24.360> fast<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.920> slows

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
lot of people playing fast it it slows

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.699 
lot of people playing fast it it slows
down<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.670> bit<00:02:26.700> has<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.060> for<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.840> sound<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.620> go

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
down a bit has to for the sound to go

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.009 
down a bit has to for the sound to go
out<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.459> string<00:02:29.700> quartet<00:02:29.880> it's<00:02:30.660> not<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
out it's a string quartet it's not the

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.089 
out it's a string quartet it's not the
same<00:02:31.200> thing<00:02:31.230> you've<00:02:31.530> got<00:02:31.650> four<00:02:31.830> string

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
same thing you've got four string

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.160 
same thing you've got four string
players<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.489> can<00:02:32.580> actually<00:02:32.760> move<00:02:33.000> faster<00:02:33.510> of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
players you can actually move faster of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.630 
players you can actually move faster of
course<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.500> had<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.830> doing<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.160> concerto<00:02:35.580> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
course I had you doing the concerto and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.949 
course I had you doing the concerto and
I<00:02:35.700> have<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:35.940> moving<00:02:36.209> pretty<00:02:36.360> fast

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
I have you moving pretty fast

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.050 
I have you moving pretty fast
yeah<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:37.860> not<00:02:38.010> everyone's<00:02:38.400> moving<00:02:38.640> fast<00:02:38.850> all

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
yeah but not everyone's moving fast all

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.160 
yeah but not everyone's moving fast all
the<00:02:39.180> time<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.480> mean<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.660> still<00:02:39.870> playing<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.110> same

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the time I mean I still playing the same

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.660 
the time I mean I still playing the same
note<00:02:40.530> that's<00:02:40.830> right<00:02:41.069> like<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.580> this

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
note that's right like in this

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.949 
note that's right like in this
particular<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.269> you're<00:02:42.360> gonna<00:02:42.480> have<00:02:42.750> to

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
particular and you're gonna have to

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.140 
particular and you're gonna have to
figure<00:02:43.530> out<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.950> weight<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.519> orchestra

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
figure out the weight of the orchestra

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.059 
figure out the weight of the orchestra
the<00:02:45.480> sound<00:02:45.780> whether<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:46.200> brass<00:02:46.500> because<00:02:46.890> at

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
the sound whether it's brass because at

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.320 
the sound whether it's brass because at
one<00:02:47.190> point<00:02:47.250> when<00:02:47.610> we<00:02:47.700> tried<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.090> we<00:02:48.269> actually

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
one point when we tried this we actually

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.150 
one point when we tried this we actually
had<00:02:48.630> full<00:02:48.840> brass<00:02:49.080> sections<00:02:49.590> accompanying<00:02:50.040> me

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
had full brass sections accompanying me

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.920 
had full brass sections accompanying me
when<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.340> realized<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.790> weight<00:02:51.030> was<00:02:51.360> too<00:02:51.569> great

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
when I realized the weight was too great

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.320 
when I realized the weight was too great
it<00:02:52.410> was<00:02:52.530> creating<00:02:52.980> yeah<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.640> overtones<00:02:54.180> were

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
it was creating yeah the overtones were

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.580 
it was creating yeah the overtones were
clashing<00:02:54.870> right

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
clashing right

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.530 
clashing right
so<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.739> actually<00:02:56.190> rescored<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:57.000> section<00:02:57.360> for

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
so I actually rescored that section for

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.720 
so I actually rescored that section for
just<00:02:57.720> four<00:02:58.019> horns<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.799> horns<00:02:59.370> how<00:02:59.519> much

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
just four horns and horns how much

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.270 
just four horns and horns how much
smaller<00:03:00.090> board<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.290> instrument<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.160> that

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
smaller board on the instrument so that

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.820 
smaller board on the instrument so that
means<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.610> tube<00:03:02.819> they<00:03:03.030> play<00:03:03.380> with<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.680> they

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
means the tube they play with it they

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.380 
means the tube they play with it they
have<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.040> blow<00:03:05.310> into<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.580> mouthpiece<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.120> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
have to blow into the mouthpiece and the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.990 
have to blow into the mouthpiece and the
mouthpiece<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:07.110> also<00:03:07.380> shower<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:08.670> doesn't

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
mouthpiece is also shower it doesn't

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.610 
mouthpiece is also shower it doesn't
allow<00:03:09.390> as<00:03:09.599> much<00:03:09.750> air<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.109> so<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.410> Miller

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
allow as much air and so it's a Miller

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.699 
allow as much air and so it's a Miller
mellower<00:03:11.519> sound<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:13.380> have<00:03:13.560> to

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
mellower sound and so I have to

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.740 
mellower sound and so I have to
calculate<00:03:14.430> where<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.030> are<00:03:15.209> in<00:03:15.359> your<00:03:15.540> range

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
calculate where you are in your range

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.990 
calculate where you are in your range
and<00:03:16.109> how<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.829> balance<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.670> orchestra

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
and how to balance that in the orchestra

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.120 
and how to balance that in the orchestra
so<00:03:18.359> I<00:03:18.390> kind<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.170> shifted<00:03:19.560> some<00:03:19.769> things<00:03:19.980> around

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
so I kind of shifted some things around

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.530 
so I kind of shifted some things around
and<00:03:20.400> make<00:03:20.519> it<00:03:20.640> a<00:03:20.670> little<00:03:20.730> bit<00:03:20.940> easier<00:03:21.329> so<00:03:21.450> you

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
and make it a little bit easier so you

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.789 
and make it a little bit easier so you
wouldn't<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.900> push<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:22.290> hard<00:03:22.319> and<00:03:22.680> I'm

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
wouldn't have to push so hard and I'm

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:23.870 
wouldn't have to push so hard and I'm
probably<00:03:23.190> I'm<00:03:23.310> guessing<00:03:23.459> I'm<00:03:23.700> probably

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
probably I'm guessing I'm probably

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.640 
probably I'm guessing I'm probably
making<00:03:24.060> four<00:03:24.329> more<00:03:24.450> adjustments<00:03:24.989> hmm<00:03:25.530> I'm

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
making four more adjustments hmm I'm

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.289 
making four more adjustments hmm I'm
sitting<00:03:25.950> there<00:03:26.010> making<00:03:26.130> mental<00:03:26.459> notes<00:03:26.609> for

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
sitting there making mental notes for

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.849 
sitting there making mental notes for
the<00:03:27.390> performance<00:03:27.780> I'm<00:03:27.840> like<00:03:27.959> hmm<00:03:28.319> I<00:03:28.470> need<00:03:28.769> to

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
the performance I'm like hmm I need to

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.740 
the performance I'm like hmm I need to
tone<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.310> down<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.120> he<00:03:30.359> doesn't<00:03:30.420> have<00:03:30.660> to

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
tone that down so he doesn't have to

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.690 
tone that down so he doesn't have to
work<00:03:30.930> too<00:03:31.049> hard<00:03:31.079> on<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:32.220> know<00:03:32.310> your<00:03:32.459> sound

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
work too hard on it you know your sound

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.190 
work too hard on it you know your sound
is<00:03:32.910> great<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.510> if<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.750> stay<00:03:33.959> away<00:03:34.140> from

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
is great and if you stay away from

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.470 
is great and if you stay away from
interpretations<00:03:35.069> as<00:03:35.220> well<00:03:35.400> as<00:03:35.880> I'm<00:03:36.030> playing<00:03:36.359> a

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
interpretations as well as I'm playing a

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.259 
interpretations as well as I'm playing a
piece<00:03:36.690> I'll<00:03:36.930> think<00:03:37.819> okay<00:03:38.819> well<00:03:38.970> next<00:03:39.060> time

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
piece I'll think okay well next time

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.240 
piece I'll think okay well next time
I'll<00:03:39.450> try<00:03:39.930> it<00:03:40.109> differently<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.130> this

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
I'll try it differently in this

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.670 
I'll try it differently in this
direction<00:03:41.459> right<00:03:42.000> right<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:42.900> it's<00:03:43.079> you're

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
direction right right and so it's you're

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.140 
direction right right and so it's you're
always<00:03:44.010> tweaking<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.609> I<00:03:44.730> think<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.970> lot<00:03:45.120> of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
always tweaking and I think a lot of

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.509 
always tweaking and I think a lot of
people<00:03:45.420> think<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.720> composers<00:03:46.230> don't<00:03:46.709> really

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
people think that composers don't really

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.699 
people think that composers don't really
like<00:03:47.910> it's<00:03:48.060> written<00:03:48.239> in<00:03:48.420> done<00:03:48.959> no<00:03:49.319> it's<00:03:49.530> not

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
like it's written in done no it's not

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.530 
like it's written in done no it's not
some<00:03:50.100> people<00:03:50.370> are<00:03:50.459> like<00:03:50.579> that<00:03:50.639> right<00:03:51.000> yeah<00:03:51.329> I

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
some people are like that right yeah I

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.780 
some people are like that right yeah I
think<00:03:51.840> there<00:03:51.959> are<00:03:51.989> definitely<00:03:52.519> composers<00:03:53.519> who

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
think there are definitely composers who

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.030 
think there are definitely composers who
think<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.299> way<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:54.569> to<00:03:54.900> me<00:03:55.019> musics<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.530> living

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
think that way but to me musics a living

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.660 
think that way but to me musics a living
organism

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
organism

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.520 
organism
you<00:03:57.120> know<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.510> it's<00:03:57.690> also<00:03:57.810> an<00:03:58.019> expression<00:03:58.470> on

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
you know and it's also an expression on

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.949 
you know and it's also an expression on
the<00:03:58.620> person<00:03:58.980> playing<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.880> think<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.840> have

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
the person playing and I think you have

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.900 
the person playing and I think you have
to<00:04:01.049> really<00:04:01.230> take<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:01.530> into<00:04:02.040> consideration<00:04:02.069> I

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
to really take that into consideration I

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.340 
to really take that into consideration I
love<00:04:03.150> hearing<00:04:03.359> different<00:04:03.630> interpretations

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
love hearing different interpretations

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.050 
love hearing different interpretations
of<00:04:04.440> my<00:04:04.560> music<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:05.100> know<00:04:05.160> some<00:04:05.579> composers

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
of my music I know some composers

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.790 
of my music I know some composers
Stravinsky<00:04:06.540> was<00:04:06.750> very<00:04:06.930> adamant<00:04:07.109> that

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
Stravinsky was very adamant that

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.180 
Stravinsky was very adamant that
the<00:04:08.220> way<00:04:08.340> he<00:04:08.550> written<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:08.970> but<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.630> love<00:04:09.930> giving

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
the way he written it but I love giving

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.710 
the way he written it but I love giving
musicians<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.340> freedom<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.820> kind<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.180> express

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
musicians the freedom to kind of express

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.990 
musicians the freedom to kind of express
themselves<00:04:13.260> because<00:04:13.650> in<00:04:14.220> essence<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:14.880> a

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
themselves because in essence it's a

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.240 
themselves because in essence it's a
script<00:04:15.300> right<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.260> you're<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.560> actor<00:04:16.950> right

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
script right and you're the actor right

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.000 
script right and you're the actor right
yeah<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.239> we<00:04:18.840> could<00:04:18.959> be<00:04:19.080> bored<00:04:19.350> if<00:04:19.500> everything

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
yeah so we could be bored if everything

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.130 
yeah so we could be bored if everything
was<00:04:20.130> done<00:04:20.250> exactly<00:04:20.520> the<00:04:20.730> same<00:04:20.820> way<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:21.209> and

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
was done exactly the same way so and

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.660 
was done exactly the same way so and
there's<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.620> lot<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.830> training<00:04:23.160> that<00:04:23.190> goes<00:04:23.310> into

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
there's a lot of training that goes into

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.090 
there's a lot of training that goes into
what<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.090> do<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.500> kind<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.770> respect

interesting<00:04:29.550> for<00:04:29.850> all<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.210> us<00:04:30.300> yeah<00:04:30.930> I<00:04:31.050> always

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
interesting for all of us yeah I always

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.920 
interesting for all of us yeah I always
find<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.830> though<00:04:31.980> it's<00:04:32.280> for<00:04:32.820> me<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.600> such

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
find it though it's for me it's such

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.690 
find it though it's for me it's such
discovery<00:04:34.530> and<00:04:34.800> that's<00:04:35.100> what<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.370> love<00:04:35.670> about

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
discovery and that's what I love about

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.040
