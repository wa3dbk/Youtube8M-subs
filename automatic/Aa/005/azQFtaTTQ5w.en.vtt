going to fire off so what we did we
added<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.750> aftermarket<00:00:51.750> shock<00:00:52.020> sensor<00:00:52.440> which

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
added a aftermarket shock sensor which

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.979 
added a aftermarket shock sensor which
is<00:00:52.649> an<00:00:52.890> OEM<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:54.120> make<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.690> Mercedes

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
is an OEM they make it for the Mercedes

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.189 
is an OEM they make it for the Mercedes
and<00:00:55.379> German<00:00:55.710> cars<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.280> BMWs<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.199> then

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
give you guys a demonstration you can

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440 
give you guys a demonstration you can
earn<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.220> system<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> same<00:01:11.939> way<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.150> lock

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
earn the system the same way you lock

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.660 
earn the system the same way you lock
the<00:01:12.600> door<00:01:12.780> basically<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.100> arming<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the door basically you just arming the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.800 
the door basically you just arming the
factory<00:01:15.000> alarm<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.390> get<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> honk

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
factory alarm you get the honk

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.300 
factory alarm you get the honk
confirming<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.650> alarm<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.280> now

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
confirming that the alarm is on and now

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.120 
confirming that the alarm is on and now
you<00:01:18.299> got<00:01:18.689> away<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> few<00:01:19.380> seconds<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.009> know

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
you got away like a few seconds you know

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.350 
you got away like a few seconds you know
because<00:01:20.310> factory<00:01:20.700> alarms<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
because factory alarms have like a

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.690 
because factory alarms have like a
little<00:01:21.570> delay<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.140> once<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.159> once<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
little delay on once they once you

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.910 
little delay on once they once you
unlock<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.330> in<00:01:24.420> arm<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.350> actually<00:01:25.770> engage

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
unlock it in arm it to actually engage

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.490 
unlock it in arm it to actually engage
okay<00:01:26.729> basically<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.270> think<00:01:27.540> we're<00:01:27.689> good<00:01:27.900> if

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
okay basically I think we're good if

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:40.580 
okay basically I think we're good if
anybody<00:01:28.860> walks<00:01:29.009> up<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.400> bang<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:40.140> turn<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.439> off

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
anybody walks up and bang to turn it off

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.080 
anybody walks up and bang to turn it off
you<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.159> same<00:01:41.369> thing<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> hit<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> unlock

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
you do the same thing you hit the unlock

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.420 
you do the same thing you hit the unlock
on<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.479> remote<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.950> turns<00:01:44.159> off<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
on the remote and that turns off the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.069 
on the remote and that turns off the
alarm<00:01:44.460> basically<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.689> were<00:01:45.840> doing

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
alarm basically what we were doing

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.660 
alarm basically what we were doing
before<00:01:46.170> arming<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.829> disarming<00:01:47.100> along<00:01:47.549> with

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
before arming and disarming along with

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.069 
before arming and disarming along with

installing an aftermarket alarm the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.600 
installing an aftermarket alarm the
reason<00:01:59.820> why<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.000> factory<00:02:00.689> does<00:02:01.380> not<00:02:01.740> add<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
reason why the factory does not add the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.459 
reason why the factory does not add the
shock<00:02:02.820> sensors<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.329> vehicles<00:02:03.780> because
