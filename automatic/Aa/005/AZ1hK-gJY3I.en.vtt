as you just saw it's kind of like a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.440 
as you just saw it's kind of like a
shotgun<00:00:34.530> Remington<00:00:35.100> nak<00:00:35.340> do<00:00:35.969> with<00:00:36.149> both<00:00:36.300> the

semi-auto<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.410> bolts<00:00:46.770> but

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
semi-auto you can do it with bolts but

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.279
