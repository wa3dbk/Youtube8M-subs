00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
is just just crazy now once you add

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.609 
is just just crazy now once you add
other<00:01:30.119> perks<00:01:30.420> such<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.780> marathon<00:01:31.380> and

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
and other sorts guns too that's why i

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.360 
and other sorts guns too that's why i
like<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.660> use<00:03:18.690> submachine<00:03:19.380> guns<00:03:19.590> more<00:03:20.160> than

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
like to use submachine guns more than

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.550 
like to use submachine guns more than
eighty<00:03:20.609> percent<00:03:20.820> of<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.209> time<00:03:21.420> it's<00:03:22.109> much

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
eighty percent of the time it's much

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.310 
eighty percent of the time it's much
more<00:03:22.769> of<00:03:22.859> a<00:03:22.950> challenge<00:03:23.250> for<00:03:23.760> me<00:03:23.910> because<00:03:24.320> it

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
more of a challenge for me because it

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.069 
more of a challenge for me because it
has<00:03:25.590> obviously<00:03:26.310> more<00:03:26.940> recall<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.660> faster

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
has obviously more recall and faster

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.170 
has obviously more recall and faster
rate<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.320> fire<00:03:28.590> which<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:28.950> obviously<00:03:29.910> more

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
rate of fire which is obviously more

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.050 
rate of fire which is obviously more
difficult<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.630> control<00:03:31.100> which<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:33.030> to

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
difficult to control which I like to

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.780
