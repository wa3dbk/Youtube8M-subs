00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
what color you want your genes to be so

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.470 
what color you want your genes to be so
just<00:03:38.280> come<00:03:38.459> back<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.790> check<00:03:38.909> it<00:03:39.060> about<00:03:39.239> every

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
just come back and check it about every

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.539 
just come back and check it about every
30<00:03:39.750> minutes<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.260> see<00:03:40.769> what<00:03:40.920> color<00:03:41.129> your<00:03:41.340> genes

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
30 minutes and see what color your genes

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.759 
30 minutes and see what color your genes
are<00:03:41.700> turning<00:03:42.000> out<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.599> may<00:03:42.780> have<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.319> flip<00:03:43.650> it

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
are turning out you may have to flip it

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.289 
are turning out you may have to flip it
over<00:03:43.920> like<00:03:44.220> mine<00:03:44.519> are<00:03:44.790> not<00:03:44.940> completely

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
over like mine are not completely

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.420 
over like mine are not completely

just come back and when the color on the
bottom<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.769> color<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.160> want<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.579> be

I'll flip it over and then do the other

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.020 
I'll flip it over and then do the other
side<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:52.829> hasn't<00:03:53.040> been<00:03:53.220> touching<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.819> water

your<00:04:59.110> James<00:04:59.259> to<00:04:59.440> be<00:04:59.560> more<00:04:59.830> of<00:05:00.009> a<00:05:00.220> white

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
your James to be more of a white

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.790 
your James to be more of a white
bleached<00:05:01.120> color<00:05:01.479> like<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.229> pants<00:05:02.530> that<00:05:02.590> I<00:05:02.680> use

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
bleached color like the pants that I use

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.260 
bleached color like the pants that I use
for<00:05:02.919> my<00:05:03.009> inspiration<00:05:03.220> what<00:05:04.030> you're<00:05:04.120> going<00:05:04.240> to

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
for my inspiration what you're going to

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.270 
for my inspiration what you're going to
have<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.479> do<00:05:04.569> is<00:05:04.720> one<00:05:05.169> use<00:05:05.560> more<00:05:05.770> bleach<00:05:06.039> and

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
have to do is one use more bleach and

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.969 
have to do is one use more bleach and
two<00:05:06.610> possibly<00:05:07.210> put<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:07.930> in<00:05:08.020> for<00:05:08.289> a<00:05:08.319> longer<00:05:08.680> time

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
two possibly put it in for a longer time

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.309 
two possibly put it in for a longer time
but<00:05:09.580> using<00:05:10.000> more<00:05:10.180> bleach<00:05:10.419> would<00:05:10.840> make<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.199> go

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:11.319 
but using more bleach would make it go

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.890 
but using more bleach would make it go
wider<00:05:11.590> faster<00:05:12.220> but<00:05:12.729> I<00:05:12.759> have<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.120> say<00:05:13.300> be<00:05:13.630> very

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
wider faster but I have to say be very

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.600 
wider faster but I have to say be very
careful<00:05:14.650> when<00:05:14.740> you're<00:05:14.830> doing<00:05:14.949> that<00:05:15.160> because

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
careful when you're doing that because

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.120 
careful when you're doing that because
you<00:05:16.360> could<00:05:16.720> bleach<00:05:17.349> a<00:05:17.500> whole<00:05:17.650> rights<00:05:17.919> of<00:05:18.039> your

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
you could bleach a whole rights of your

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.499 
you could bleach a whole rights of your
pants<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:18.699> might<00:05:18.849> be<00:05:19.000> in<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.270> very

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
pants and it might be in a very

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:21.210 
pants and it might be in a very
unflattering<00:05:19.990> area<00:05:20.620> so<00:05:20.860> just<00:05:20.889> be<00:05:21.099> careful

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
unflattering area so just be careful

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.070 
unflattering area so just be careful
when<00:05:21.520> you're<00:05:21.639> doing<00:05:21.729> that<00:05:22.000> and<00:05:22.210> also<00:05:22.870> have<00:05:23.020> I
