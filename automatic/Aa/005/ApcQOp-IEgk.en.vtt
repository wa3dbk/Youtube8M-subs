else is going to be coming off of here

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.090 
else is going to be coming off of here
and<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> includes<00:01:01.140> anything<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.800> fruited

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
and that includes anything that fruited

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
and that includes anything that fruited
last<00:01:02.340> year<00:01:02.789> now<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.539> tell<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> two<00:01:04.049> year

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
last year now you can tell the two year

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.690 
last year now you can tell the two year
old<00:01:04.260> canes<00:01:04.619> or<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> Canes<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> fruited<00:01:05.489> last

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
old canes or the Canes it fruited last

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
old canes or the Canes it fruited last
year<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.689> they'll<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.900> thicker<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
year because they'll be thicker and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.280 
year because they'll be thicker and
they'll<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.979> gray<00:01:08.250> peeling<00:01:08.880> bark<00:01:09.119> okay<00:01:09.869> so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
they'll have gray peeling bark okay so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.170 
they'll have gray peeling bark okay so
all<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.680> these<00:01:10.830> are<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> come<00:01:11.549> off<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
all of these are going to come off and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.630 
all of these are going to come off and
we're<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.140> save<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.189> one<00:01:14.400> year<00:01:14.549> old

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
we're going to save the one year old

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940 
we're going to save the one year old
cane<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> chocolate<00:01:16.140> brown<00:01:16.350> color<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
cane with the chocolate brown color and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.490 
cane with the chocolate brown color and
the<00:01:17.100> smooth<00:01:17.340> bark<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> first<00:01:18.960> step<00:01:19.259> in

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the smooth bark so the first step in

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.679 
the smooth bark so the first step in
pruning<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.939> look<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.240> our<00:01:21.360> permanent

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
pruning is to look at our permanent

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.649 
pruning is to look at our permanent
trunk<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.350> remove<00:01:22.610> all<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.240> two-year-old

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
trunk and remove all of the two-year-old

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.460 
trunk and remove all of the two-year-old
growth<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.439> growth<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:26.689> fruited<00:01:27.689> last<00:01:27.960> year

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
growth the growth that fruited last year

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.010 
growth the growth that fruited last year
saving<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.490> few<00:01:29.700> canes<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.630> we'll<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.869> using

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
saving a few canes that we'll be using

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.679 
saving a few canes that we'll be using
for<00:01:31.229> fruiting<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.829> year<00:01:32.159> okay<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.270> our<00:01:33.509> first

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
for fruiting this year okay so our first

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.560 
for fruiting this year okay so our first
step<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.560> cut<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.310> these<00:01:35.400> off<00:01:35.570> looking

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
step is to cut some of these off looking

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.520 
step is to cut some of these off looking
at<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.869> older<00:01:37.350> bark<00:01:37.619> there<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.320> cut

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
at that older bark there and we just cut

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.620 
at that older bark there and we just cut
that<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.549> right<00:01:41.729> out<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.939> there

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.660 

this<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.810> open<00:01:45.960> up<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> planting<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.070> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
this will open up the planting and that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.109 
this will open up the planting and that
two<00:01:47.939> year<00:01:48.119> old<00:01:48.270> wood<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> fruit

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
two year old wood is not going to fruit

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
winter injury on that one and you'll be

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.990 
winter injury on that one and you'll be
