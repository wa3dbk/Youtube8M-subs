00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
glass panel cabinet doors so there I was

something<00:00:27.530> you've<00:00:27.770> thought<00:00:27.950> about<00:00:28.130> many

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
something you've thought about many

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.310 
something you've thought about many
times<00:00:28.700> yourself<00:00:29.240> but<00:00:29.750> it's<00:00:29.869> what<00:00:30.020> I'd<00:00:30.110> like<00:00:30.260> to

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
times yourself but it's what I'd like to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.990 
times yourself but it's what I'd like to
spend<00:00:30.619> a<00:00:30.740> few<00:00:30.890> minutes<00:00:31.010> talking<00:00:31.400> about<00:00:31.850> in

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
spend a few minutes talking about in

doors<00:00:34.760> I<00:00:35.030> wanted<00:00:35.720> to<00:00:35.809> finish<00:00:36.080> thickness<00:00:36.650> to<00:00:36.770> be

doors I wanted to finish thickness to be
three<00:00:37.160> quarters<00:00:37.550> of<00:00:37.580> an<00:00:37.760> inch<00:00:37.850> but<00:00:38.540> I<00:00:38.600> also

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
three quarters of an inch but I also

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.260 
three quarters of an inch but I also
needed<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.650> leave<00:00:39.830> myself<00:00:40.070> some<00:00:40.579> leeway<00:00:40.850> in

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
needed to leave myself some leeway in

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.600 
needed to leave myself some leeway in
terms<00:00:41.899> of<00:00:42.079> lumber<00:00:42.440> thickness<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.430> that<00:00:43.460> I

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
terms of lumber thickness so that I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.150 
terms of lumber thickness so that I
could<00:00:43.730> surface<00:00:44.210> my<00:00:44.540> Stiles<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.440> rails<00:00:45.530> for

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
could surface my Stiles and rails for

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.790 
could surface my Stiles and rails for
these<00:00:46.309> doors<00:00:46.640> flat<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:47.720> true<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:48.620> is

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
these doors flat and true that is

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.830 
these doors flat and true that is
critical<00:00:49.340> in<00:00:49.579> this<00:00:49.880> project<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.630> doors

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
critical in this project of the doors

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.110 
critical in this project of the doors
wouldn't<00:00:51.230> sit<00:00:51.440> flat<00:00:51.649> in<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:51.920> cabinet<00:00:52.399> well

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
wouldn't sit flat in the cabinet well

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.450 
wouldn't sit flat in the cabinet well
the<00:00:53.660> logical<00:00:54.170> choice<00:00:54.230> for<00:00:54.500> me<00:00:54.890> was<00:00:55.130> to<00:00:55.160> go

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
the logical choice for me was to go

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.580 
the logical choice for me was to go
through<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.940> fourth<00:00:56.570> quarter<00:00:56.809> lumber<00:00:57.320> at<00:00:57.440> my

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
through the fourth quarter lumber at my

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.410 
through the fourth quarter lumber at my
supplier<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.399> that's<00:00:58.820> really<00:00:59.059> where<00:00:59.300> the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
supplier and that's really where the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.619 
supplier and that's really where the
issue<00:00:59.600> comes<00:00:59.750> in<00:01:00.260> four<00:01:01.250> quarter<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:01.969> not<00:01:02.390> the

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
issue comes in four quarter is not the

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.150 
issue comes in four quarter is not the
finished<00:01:02.840> thickness<00:01:03.469> of<00:01:03.620> what<00:01:03.800> you'll<00:01:03.980> find

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
finished thickness of what you'll find

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.330 
finished thickness of what you'll find
on<00:01:04.369> the<00:01:04.520> shelf<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:05.600> actually<00:01:05.869> refers<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.890> the

on the shelf it actually refers to the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.310 
on the shelf it actually refers to the
thickness<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.090> number<00:01:08.420> before<00:01:08.840> it

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320

of an inch that's only a sixteenth of an
inch<00:01:28.880> thicker<00:01:29.240> than<00:01:29.479> what<00:01:29.659> i<00:01:29.770> needed<00:01:30.770> for<00:01:30.920> my

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
inch thicker than what i needed for my

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.390 
inch thicker than what i needed for my
doors<00:01:31.960> now<00:01:32.960> on<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.200> project<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.799> i<00:01:33.920> completed

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
doors now on a project that i completed

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.370 
doors now on a project that i completed
just<00:01:34.670> prior<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.060> these<00:01:35.420> doors<00:01:35.780> i<00:01:36.049> was<00:01:36.170> using

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
just prior to these doors i was using

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.120 
just prior to these doors i was using
maple<00:01:36.740> from<00:01:37.159> a<00:01:37.250> different<00:01:37.640> supplier<00:01:37.820> and

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
maple from a different supplier and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.850 
maple from a different supplier and
therefore<00:01:40.130> quarter-inch<00:01:40.729> lumber<00:01:41.860> measures

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
therefore quarter-inch lumber measures

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.830 
therefore quarter-inch lumber measures
out<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.400> little<00:01:43.880> better<00:01:44.060> than<00:01:44.270> fifteen

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
out to a little better than fifteen

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.249 
out to a little better than fifteen
sixteenth<00:01:45.439> of<00:01:45.590> an<00:01:45.710> inch<00:01:46.750> now<00:01:47.750> in<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:47.990> case<00:01:48.200> of

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
sixteenth of an inch now in the case of

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.149 
sixteenth of an inch now in the case of
these<00:01:48.680> two<00:01:48.979> suppliers<00:01:50.560> that's<00:01:51.560> almost<00:01:51.920> an

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
these two suppliers that's almost an

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.700 
these two suppliers that's almost an
eighth<00:01:52.400> of<00:01:52.640> an<00:01:52.759> inch<00:01:53.320> difference<00:01:54.320> in

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
eighth of an inch difference in

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.660 
eighth of an inch difference in
thickness<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.280> material<00:01:55.850> for<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.630> same<00:01:56.930> floor

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
thickness of material for the same floor

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.990 
thickness of material for the same floor
inch<00:01:58.290> specification<00:01:59.290> but<00:02:00.220> that<00:02:00.430> eighth<00:02:00.670> of<00:02:00.909> an

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
inch specification but that eighth of an

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.480 
inch specification but that eighth of an
inch<00:02:01.119> can<00:02:01.420> make<00:02:01.600> all<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.930> difference<00:02:02.350> if<00:02:03.009> you

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
inch can make all the difference if you

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.940 
inch can make all the difference if you
need<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.880> surface<00:02:04.150> away<00:02:04.630> some<00:02:04.990> distortions<00:02:05.799> in
