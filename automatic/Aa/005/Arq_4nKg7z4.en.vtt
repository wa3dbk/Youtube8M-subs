got<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.120> extra<00:01:48.450> case<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.410> fly<00:01:49.710> back<00:01:49.950> home

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
got an extra case so you fly back home

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.370 
got an extra case so you fly back home
and<00:01:50.550> then<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.210> got<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.479> break<00:01:51.690> out<00:01:51.840> two<00:01:52.080> tools

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
and then you got to break out two tools

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.910 
and then you got to break out two tools
put<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.830> camera<00:01:53.160> aside<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.500> get<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.650> bad

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
put the camera aside and get that bad

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.330 
put the camera aside and get that bad
boy<00:01:56.160> like<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.350> Rockwell<00:01:58.350> it's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
boy like this this is the Rockwell it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.650 
boy like this this is the Rockwell it's
a<00:01:59.400> 12-volt<00:02:00.290> cordless<00:02:01.290> drill<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:03.450> nice

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
a 12-volt cordless drill that nice

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.350 
a 12-volt cordless drill that nice
little<00:02:03.840> light<00:02:04.050> there<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.940> you<00:02:06.000> want<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.300> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
little light there and you want to get a

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.330 
little light there and you want to get a
bit<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.050> it's<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> little<00:02:07.740> small<00:02:08.100> bit

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
bit like this it's a little small bit

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.650 
bit like this it's a little small bit
this<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.610> just<00:02:08.759> something<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> mark<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.479> so

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
this is just something to mark it so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.900 
this is just something to mark it so
basically<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.110> did<00:02:10.320> here<00:02:10.590> I'm<00:02:11.130> gonna<00:02:11.280> take<00:02:11.550> take

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
basically I did here I'm gonna take take

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.670 
basically I did here I'm gonna take take
this<00:02:12.120> camera<00:02:12.630> put<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.350> there<00:02:13.500> make<00:02:13.620> sure

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
this camera put it in there make sure

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.470 
this camera put it in there make sure
that<00:02:14.100> lens<00:02:14.310> lines<00:02:14.550> up<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.910> right<00:02:15.060> position

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
that lens lines up in the right position

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.090 
that lens lines up in the right position
so<00:02:15.959> there's<00:02:16.140> where<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.470> microphone<00:02:16.800> inputs

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
so there's where the microphone inputs

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.040 
so there's where the microphone inputs
gonna<00:02:17.280> be<00:02:17.489> when<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> cameras<00:02:18.690> near<00:02:18.870> right

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
gonna be when the cameras near right

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.160 
gonna be when the cameras near right
close<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:24.150> there<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.540> then<00:02:25.080> I

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
close it up and so there it is then I

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.960 
close it up and so there it is then I
just<00:02:25.410> went<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.010> scratched<00:02:26.730> a

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
just went and I you just scratched a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.640 
just went and I you just scratched a
little<00:02:27.239> hole<00:02:27.420> right<00:02:28.080> there<00:02:28.140> with<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
little hole right there with the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.000 
little hole right there with the
microphone<00:02:29.430> input<00:02:29.610> would<00:02:29.820> be<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.860> then<00:02:31.860> the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
microphone input would be and then the

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.440 
microphone input would be and then the
next<00:02:32.220> thing<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.430> did<00:02:32.489> is<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.850> went<00:02:33.030> ahead<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.300> I

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
next thing I did is I went ahead and I

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.560 
next thing I did is I went ahead and I
grabbed<00:02:33.840> one<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.560> my<00:02:34.709> cables<00:02:35.700> for<00:02:36.420> my

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
grabbed one of my cables for my

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.229 
grabbed one of my cables for my
microphones<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.940> here<00:02:39.239> is<00:02:40.940> here's<00:02:41.940> one<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
microphones so here is here's one of the

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.640 
microphones so here is here's one of the
microphones<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.780> use<00:02:42.989> this<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.230> actually

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
microphones that I use this is actually

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.949 
microphones that I use this is actually
a<00:02:43.680> rode<00:02:43.950> microphone<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.209> I'm<00:02:45.299> looking<00:02:45.660> at<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
a rode microphone so I'm looking at the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.320 
a rode microphone so I'm looking at the
diameter<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:47.100> approximate<00:02:47.670> diameter<00:02:47.880> of

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
diameter the approximate diameter of

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.710 
diameter the approximate diameter of
this<00:02:48.930> plug<00:02:49.260> right<00:02:49.700> went<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.790> my<00:02:50.880> drill<00:02:51.180> bit<00:02:51.450> set

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
this plug right went to my drill bit set

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.350 
this plug right went to my drill bit set
and<00:02:51.989> found<00:02:52.730> something<00:02:53.730> that's<00:02:54.030> kind<00:02:54.299> of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
and found something that's kind of

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.930 
and found something that's kind of
similar<00:02:54.690> if<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.170> look<00:02:55.320> at<00:02:55.440> these<00:02:55.940> diameters

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
similar if you look at these diameters

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.120 
similar if you look at these diameters
are<00:02:57.120> kind<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.540> close<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.140> I'm<00:02:58.769> gonna<00:02:58.860> go<00:02:59.040> with

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
are kind of close so I'm gonna go with

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.770 
are kind of close so I'm gonna go with
that<00:02:59.340> all<00:02:59.640> right<00:02:59.820> so<00:03:00.390> now<00:03:00.480> we're<00:03:00.600> just<00:03:00.660> gonna

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
that all right so now we're just gonna

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.470 
that all right so now we're just gonna
break<00:03:01.110> out<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> drill<00:03:01.709> here<00:03:02.070> I'm<00:03:02.970> gonna<00:03:03.150> start

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
bigger hole this may be a too big of a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.980 
bigger hole this may be a too big of a
jump<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.000> make<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:36.300> we're<00:03:36.420> gonna<00:03:36.510> give<00:03:36.690> it

putting<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.920> camera<00:03:44.190> in<00:03:44.250> there<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.550> checking

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
putting the camera in there and checking

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.410 
putting the camera in there and checking
it<00:03:50.510> let's<00:03:51.510> plug<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.710> here

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
it let's plug this in here

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.970 
it let's plug this in here
not<00:03:54.420> quite<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.900> diameter<00:03:55.350> we<00:03:55.500> need<00:03:55.740> this

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
not quite the diameter we need this

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.620 
not quite the diameter we need this
needs<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.220> be<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.340> little<00:03:56.520> bit<00:03:56.640> wider<00:03:56.820> but<00:03:57.390> it's

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
needs to be a little bit wider but it's

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.790 
needs to be a little bit wider but it's
going<00:03:57.960> right<00:03:58.140> in<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.440> hole

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
going right in the hole

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.920 
going right in the hole
so<00:03:58.920> we're<00:03:59.130> lined<00:03:59.340> up<00:03:59.520> pretty<00:03:59.670> good<00:03:59.930> looking

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
so we're lined up pretty good looking

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.780 
so we're lined up pretty good looking
pretty<00:04:01.140> good<00:04:01.290> let's<00:04:01.590> get<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:01.740> wider<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.400> was

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
pretty good let's get a wider I was

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.710 
pretty good let's get a wider I was
gonna<00:04:02.940> get<00:04:03.420> our<00:04:03.540> biggest<00:04:03.990> drill<00:04:04.560> bit<00:04:04.800> here<00:04:05.190> and

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
gonna get our biggest drill bit here and

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.640 
gonna get our biggest drill bit here and
that<00:04:06.720> should<00:04:06.870> do<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.110> trick

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
that should do the trick

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.790 
that should do the trick
alright<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.460> I<00:04:08.490> think<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:09.030> big<00:04:09.600> bit<00:04:10.230> did<00:04:10.650> the

alright so I think that big bit did the

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.710 
alright so I think that big bit did the
trick<00:04:11.070> for<00:04:11.340> us<00:04:11.400> now<00:04:12.000> let's<00:04:12.240> go<00:04:12.390> ahead<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.630> put
