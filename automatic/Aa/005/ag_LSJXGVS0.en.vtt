on<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> collaboration<00:00:28.560> between<00:00:28.830> an<00:00:29.609> interior

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
on a collaboration between an interior

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.179 
on a collaboration between an interior

through<00:00:32.880> our<00:00:32.969> collaboration<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:33.870> we

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
through our collaboration what we

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.830 
through our collaboration what we
realized<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.829> elements<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.520> design<00:00:35.840> were

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
realized is the elements of design were

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.580 
realized is the elements of design were
universally<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.420> idea<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.989> balance<00:00:40.500> of

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
universally so the idea is a balance of

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.860 
universally so the idea is a balance of
proportion<00:00:41.219> were<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> same<00:00:41.850> throughout<00:00:42.180> no

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
proportion were the same throughout no

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.049 
proportion were the same throughout no

difference<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.809> our<00:00:48.930> craft<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
difference in our craft was with the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.779 
difference in our craft was with the

this you took this idea and we use it

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.649 
this you took this idea and we use it
within<00:01:23.219> the<00:01:23.429> whole<00:01:23.579> collection<00:01:24.149> so

ships we were working with was square

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.949 
ships we were working with was square
and<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.890> importance<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.580> square<00:02:07.970> was<00:02:08.539> drawing

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
and the importance of square was drawing

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.540 
and the importance of square was drawing
the<00:02:09.170> ire<00:02:09.320> from<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.830> vertical<00:02:10.280> to<00:02:10.459> the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
horizontal we then worked with the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.280 
horizontal we then worked with the

all the design principles the triangle

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.720 
all the design principles the triangle
represents<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:18.590> distribution<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.430> weight

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730
