best of you know twisting everything
those<00:02:24.960> up<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.700> far<00:02:26.970> grander<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.450> we

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
those up so this is a far grander so we

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.660 
those up so this is a far grander so we
have<00:02:27.780> all<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:30.110> place<00:02:31.110> on<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.560> for<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:32.370> do<00:02:32.430> have

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
have all to place on that for we do have

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
have all to place on that for we do have
one<00:02:32.940> two<00:02:33.300> three<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:34.050> we<00:02:34.170> have<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.520> support<00:02:35.690> on

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
one two three and we have a support on

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.110 
one two three and we have a support on
the<00:02:36.810> middle<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.380> it's<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.550> good<00:02:38.880> it's

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
the middle and it's really good it's

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.620 
the middle and it's really good it's
it's<00:02:39.360> like<00:02:39.810> 3d<00:02:40.400> gives<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.580> really<00:02:41.910> nice<00:02:42.209> curve
