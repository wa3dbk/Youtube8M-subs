00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.549
 Tell me the movie guys here? 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.040
 first episode of the series tips for 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.960
 snipper the name already says practically the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.700
 purpose of the series that is to help 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.610
 is starting to play on the new suits 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.449
 code with tips from the best class 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.390
 used at the time to positioning 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.199
 sport you have a trichot feed 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.060
 several things then this first 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.019
 episode then we will try to reach a thousand 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.019
 likes this video 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.430
 so I'm here on my soldier already and I 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.100
 I'll show you better class prass 4 suipes 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.230
 in my opinion the best is can have 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.739
 variations will then have four variations 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.900
 profiles and then you see the 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.390
 first class with al 115 but is not 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.290
 Very good action question with 1 10m 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.570
 really loud 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.430
 From then until the first time I will use the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.160
 chrome coating wants to increase the 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.890
 damage and the large 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.780
 you have more ammo on your comb and 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.390
 It helps a lot when we start to stay 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.340
 loading and makes the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.670
 fish to charge faster and 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.140
 and the little pistol will not change. 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.610
 very much our class then you choose the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.030
 Whatever you want I'll take any 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.040
 and put the service to kimbo and lethal 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.020
 I like to use some and 4 but feel that 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.790
 it is also good that the tactical to the conclusion 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.610
 It's good to prepare enemies like you. 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.010
 See you have a radar crew and you're kwai. 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.450
 most important spectrum of the class to 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.780
 me both is needed in all 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.250
 classes is the preparation and the quick serve 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.150
 quick serve makes better faster and 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.100
 prepared 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.260
 after scrolling shape gets ready 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.050
 faster and another by using the 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.600
 reflex that makes you change the secondary 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.790
 and use the equipment faster and 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.770
 also has the focus that it reduces the 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.500
 oscillation of the aim and also when someone 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.900
 is taking the aim is not going to move so much 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.910
 How to play before was very good to 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.100
 this combination is very good for this 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.200
 class but will see that there are 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.250
 still aspects but in all classes and 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.620
 I recommend prepared and the quick serve 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.080
 and then the other gun you have the most 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:14.780
 played the good technique also the same 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.940
 up to times chrome coatings and more 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.970
 bullets and now on the tactical instead of 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.640
 put in the lethal instead of putting the c4 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.830
 any seat and out the feet that comes 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.780
 have a quick serve prepared but I 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.300
 I put the invisible one that is for you 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.190
 to be invisible to the 7 common and dripping 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.739
 of radar and is very good in this 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.720
 beginning the galley is all with 17 with 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.150
 she's the standard class there right? 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.310
 then it becomes invisible and also the point 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.590
 that is left over and placed a bettor because I 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.900
 not 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.060
 good feet with a point there the bettor 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.860
 can learn from random advantage 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.319
 so sometimes it looks like a break 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.629
 good sometimes with 11 but also in 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.760
 different and now the class with the link 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.099
 leave and the language only has one has one 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.890
 I do not know her friend's particularity. 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.410
 who already played and is very bad but in the semi 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.780
 automatic but my 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.879
 party from the field of vision there is much 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.099
 bad so I put the coat of 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.560
 also increase the ecological damage to 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.870
 thermometer that solves this problem 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.970
 Say what you say you 're going to play. 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.459
 that way, but it stays 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.500
 Mira's cap is too bad and again 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.840
 the secondary and a detail the tactic is 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.630
 your choice but I like to use the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.650
 such as the cemtec the tactical conclusion of 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:31.319
 you see there instead of the ghost and 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.060
 another with which agility and focus the 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.640
 agility is good because the ones in the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.310
 automatic ghost they draw 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.840
 mobility and agility is achieved 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.910
 run faster and move more 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.090
 fast then it helped a lot in the game 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.829
 play and the focus is also to decrease the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.950
 oscillation in the sights of the church continues in 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.690
 2nd class is also a great bank is the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.459
 the last vks 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.650
 but it is not because it already comes with muffler 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.459
 semi-automatic with 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.579
 hour too 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.329
 and you see you do not have the chrome barrel 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.799
 for that one then I put the comb 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.090
 extended and I also put my 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.430
 I think it helps a lot 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.160
 because this friend also michael 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.069
 so strange the half approaches her is medium 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.989
 large I did not like and again and now there 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.440
 the pequi and I looked the same as 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.889
 I put it in the other so it 's basically 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.210
 Now I hope you have a 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.910
 understood which best class 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.430
 Of course there are variations and such you 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.560
 choose if you want to put the ghost 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.570
 put what makes you change water 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.160
 faster and in equipment 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.010
 but for me the essentials even for 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.250
 Everyone in the perspective I already said is the service 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.389
 fast and prepared, that's what I 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.330
 I hope you enjoyed this episode 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.550
 of this new series to comment on the trip there 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.530
 and I know it's annoying to ask but the 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.479
 feedback has been greatly reduced since 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.740
 my back videos but this is not it 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.030
 Thank you guys, thank you so much for watching. 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.030
 now and say hug
