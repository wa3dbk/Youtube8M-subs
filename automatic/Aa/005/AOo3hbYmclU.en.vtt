00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
of get into a space where you just Lego

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.800 
of get into a space where you just Lego
the<00:02:46.459> evolution<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:47.000> becoming<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.480> master

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
the evolution of becoming a master

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.420 
the evolution of becoming a master
builder<00:02:48.049> you<00:02:48.080> do<00:02:48.380> experience<00:02:48.769> building<00:02:49.280> and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
builder you do experience building and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.890 
builder you do experience building and
then<00:02:49.519> designing<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.480> throughout<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
then designing and throughout the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.630 
then designing and throughout the
process<00:02:50.930> there's<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.769> high<00:02:51.980> it's<00:02:52.160> not<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.310> common

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
process there's a high it's not a common

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.009 
process there's a high it's not a common
trigger<00:02:52.819> to<00:02:52.910> be<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.030> knight<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.239> say<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.630> figured

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
trigger to be a knight and say I figured

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.479 
trigger to be a knight and say I figured
out<00:02:54.080> how<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.290> make<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:54.650> better<00:02:54.860> how<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.310> make

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
out how to make this better how to make

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.860 
out how to make this better how to make
this<00:02:55.610> stronger<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:56.120> make<00:02:56.269> this<00:02:56.390> work<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.750> little

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
this stronger I make this work a little

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.559 
this stronger I make this work a little
bit<00:02:57.080> more<00:02:57.459> correctly<00:02:58.459> that's<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.269> real<00:02:59.420> way<00:02:59.540> to

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
bit more correctly that's a real way to

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.350 
bit more correctly that's a real way to
say<00:02:59.840> it's<00:03:00.590> one<00:03:00.680> of<00:03:00.830> those<00:03:00.950> things<00:03:01.160> yeah<00:03:02.090> more

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
say it's one of those things yeah more

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.140 
say it's one of those things yeah more
better<00:03:02.890> put<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:03.980> in<00:03:04.069> American<00:03:04.430> terms<00:03:04.549> yeah<00:03:04.760> so

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
better put it in American terms yeah so

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.789 
better put it in American terms yeah so
it's<00:03:05.510> really<00:03:05.780> just<00:03:05.930> something<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.410> you<00:03:06.620> kind

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
it's really just something that you kind

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.140 
it's really just something that you kind
of<00:03:06.860> evolve<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:07.489> like<00:03:07.640> we're<00:03:07.790> gonna<00:03:07.940> get<00:03:08.030> into

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
of evolve it's like we're gonna get into

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.640 
of evolve it's like we're gonna get into
play<00:03:08.329> it's<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.780> new<00:03:08.900> medium<00:03:09.290> it's<00:03:09.470> got<00:03:09.620> a

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
play it's just a new medium it's got a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.700 
play it's just a new medium it's got a
different<00:03:10.010> set<00:03:10.130> of<00:03:10.160> rules

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
different set of rules

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.900 
different set of rules
in<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.890> end<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.160> still<00:03:11.190> make<00:03:11.610> beautiful

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
in the end you still make beautiful

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.180 
in the end you still make beautiful
things<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.390> Duclair<00:03:12.690> inspire<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.440> now<00:03:13.830> with

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
things of Duclair inspire and now with

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.950 
things of Duclair inspire and now with
every<00:03:14.430> set<00:03:14.670> there's<00:03:14.850> new<00:03:15.120> combos<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.690> course

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
every set there's new combos of course

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.260 
every set there's new combos of course
too<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.410> it's<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.650> game<00:03:16.800> changer<00:03:17.030> around<00:03:18.030> every

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
too so it's a game changer around every

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.670 
too so it's a game changer around every
turn<00:03:18.480> yeah<00:03:18.780> especially<00:03:19.140> when<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.530> start

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680

you take it to the next level you can

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.870 
you take it to the next level you can
start<00:03:30.240> building<00:03:30.480> off<00:03:30.750> into<00:03:31.020> new<00:03:31.170> directions

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
of Minecraft very well aligned to Lego

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.090

way too I suppose but internally we call
it<00:04:54.480> sideways<00:04:54.720> builders<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:55.530> as<00:04:55.950> Lego

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
it sideways builders and as Lego

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:06.630 
it sideways builders and as Lego
continues<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.210> grow<00:05:02.390> sideways<00:05:03.390> building

Jag's out exactly as I've been doing
this<00:05:18.140> since<00:05:18.290> 1997<00:05:19.250> if<00:05:19.370> I<00:05:19.490> go<00:05:20.480> as<00:05:20.600> a<00:05:20.660> builder<00:05:21.050> and

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
this since 1997 if I go as a builder and

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.510 
this since 1997 if I go as a builder and
to<00:05:21.710> see<00:05:21.920> the<00:05:22.100> evolution<00:05:22.340> of<00:05:22.790> what<00:05:23.000> Lego

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
to see the evolution of what Lego

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.610 
to see the evolution of what Lego
started<00:05:25.520> a<00:05:25.610> really<00:05:26.240> has<00:05:26.390> evolved<00:05:27.020> but<00:05:27.530> the

started a really has evolved but the
primary<00:05:27.890> foundational<00:05:28.280> basis

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
primary foundational basis

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.840 
primary foundational basis
it's<00:05:30.200> fun<00:05:30.410> it's<00:05:30.650> creativity<00:05:31.250> and<00:05:31.400> pushing
