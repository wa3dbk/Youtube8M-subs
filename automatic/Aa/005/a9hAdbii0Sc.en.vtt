integrated machine control system in
this<00:00:16.100> excavator<00:00:16.550> which<00:00:16.820> allows<00:00:17.150> us<00:00:17.390> to<00:00:18.230> fully

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:18.860 
this excavator which allows us to fully

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.760 
this excavator which allows us to fully
control<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.400> boom<00:00:20.060> hydraulic<00:00:20.720> lift<00:00:21.050> to

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
control the boom hydraulic lift to

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.560 
control the boom hydraulic lift to
ensure<00:00:22.100> that<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.430> 3d<00:00:22.880> design<00:00:23.210> model

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
ensure that the 3d design model

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.670 
ensure that the 3d design model
underneath<00:00:24.020> the<00:00:24.500> bucket<00:00:24.980> is<00:00:25.160> not<00:00:25.520> actually

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
underneath the bucket is not actually

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.070 
underneath the bucket is not actually
destroyed<00:00:27.680> in<00:00:27.890> any<00:00:27.980> way<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:29.240> screen<00:00:29.570> over

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
destroyed in any way the screen over

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.440 
destroyed in any way the screen over
here<00:00:30.110> shows<00:00:30.860> us<00:00:31.070> various<00:00:31.880> different<00:00:32.270> view

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
here shows us various different view

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.510 
here shows us various different view
types<00:00:32.719> so<00:00:33.050> we<00:00:33.079> can<00:00:33.350> see<00:00:33.620> on<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.129> minute<00:00:34.370> we

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
types so we can see on the minute we

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.610 
types so we can see on the minute we
have<00:00:34.700> a<00:00:34.730> prote<00:00:35.629> what<00:00:35.809> we<00:00:35.899> call<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.079> profile<00:00:36.589> view

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
have a prote what we call a profile view

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.250 
have a prote what we call a profile view
so<00:00:36.859> basically<00:00:37.219> a<00:00:37.370> side-on<00:00:37.789> view<00:00:38.170> allowing<00:00:39.170> the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
so basically a side-on view allowing the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.479 
so basically a side-on view allowing the
operator<00:00:39.440> to<00:00:39.649> actually<00:00:39.949> view<00:00:40.100> where<00:00:40.339> he's

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
operator to actually view where he's

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.459 
operator to actually view where he's
booked<00:00:40.670> it<00:00:40.760> is<00:00:40.940> in<00:00:41.120> real<00:00:41.480> time<00:00:41.780> in<00:00:42.079> relation<00:00:42.199> to

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
booked it is in real time in relation to

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.880 
booked it is in real time in relation to
his<00:00:42.769> design<00:00:43.190> model<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:44.690> button<00:00:45.469> up<00:00:45.679> at<00:00:45.829> the

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
his design model the button up at the

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.200 
his design model the button up at the
top<00:00:46.039> of<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.190> screen<00:00:46.429> here<00:00:46.609> allows<00:00:46.969> us<00:00:46.999> to

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
top of the screen here allows us to

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.669 
top of the screen here allows us to
actually<00:00:47.420> turn<00:00:47.749> on<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.140> semi-automatic

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
actually turn on the semi-automatic

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.149 
actually turn on the semi-automatic
control<00:00:49.670> of<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.300> system<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:50.960> what<00:00:51.769> that<00:00:51.890> does

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
control of the system so what that does

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.309 
control of the system so what that does
is<00:00:52.309> essentially<00:00:52.640> as<00:00:52.969> I<00:00:52.999> said<00:00:53.269> it<00:00:53.480> cuts<00:00:54.079> out<00:00:54.289> the

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
is essentially as I said it cuts out the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.259 
is essentially as I said it cuts out the
boom<00:00:54.649> hydraulics<00:00:55.249> in<00:00:55.489> order<00:00:55.850> to<00:00:55.969> allow<00:00:56.210> the

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
boom hydraulics in order to allow the

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.689 
boom hydraulics in order to allow the
operator<00:00:56.719> not<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.319> over<00:00:57.649> dig<00:00:57.829> at<00:00:58.010> all<00:00:58.339> in<00:00:58.550> any

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
operator not to over dig at all in any

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.020 
operator not to over dig at all in any
way<00:00:59.469> coupled<00:01:00.469> with<00:01:00.499> that<00:01:00.589> the<00:01:01.100> system

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
way coupled with that the system

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.479 
way coupled with that the system
automatically<00:01:02.780> grades<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.829> bucket<00:01:04.190> for<00:01:04.400> you

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
automatically grades the bucket for you

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.490 
automatically grades the bucket for you
as<00:01:04.610> well<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.030> as<00:01:05.180> we<00:01:05.720> are<00:01:05.840> setting<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.140> batter<00:01:06.320> at

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
as well so as we are setting a batter at

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.050 
as well so as we are setting a batter at
the<00:01:06.530> moment<00:01:06.920> if<00:01:07.400> you<00:01:07.460> have<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.640> look<00:01:07.790> down<00:01:07.909> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
the moment if you have a look down the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.120 
the moment if you have a look down the
slope<00:01:08.299> in<00:01:08.540> front<00:01:08.840> of<00:01:08.960> me<00:01:09.049> and<00:01:09.259> we<00:01:09.920> can

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
slope in front of me and we can

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.740 
slope in front of me and we can
basically<00:01:10.250> automatically<00:01:11.060> allow<00:01:11.329> the<00:01:11.390> arm<00:01:11.630> to

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
basically automatically allow the arm to

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.399 
basically automatically allow the arm to
pull<00:01:12.079> towards<00:01:12.950> us<00:01:13.100> which<00:01:14.409> automatically

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
pull towards us which automatically

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.260 
pull towards us which automatically
raises<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:16.009> boom<00:01:16.189> at<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.430> same<00:01:16.640> time<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.180> it

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
raises the boom at the same time so it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.149 
raises the boom at the same time so it
keeps<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.570> bucket<00:01:17.899> on<00:01:17.990> your<00:01:18.079> grade<00:01:18.649> at<00:01:18.920> all

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
keeps the bucket on your grade at all

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.630 
keeps the bucket on your grade at all
times<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:19.700> doesn't<00:01:20.060> over<00:01:20.329> dig<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.600> surface

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
times and doesn't over dig the surface

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.100 
times and doesn't over dig the surface
the<00:01:22.640> screen<00:01:22.909> itself<00:01:23.240> gives<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.899> lot<00:01:24.079> of

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
the screen itself gives a lot of

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.539 
the screen itself gives a lot of
information<00:01:24.320> for<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.829> operator<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.280> be<00:01:25.460> able

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
information for the operator to be able

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.490 
information for the operator to be able
to<00:01:25.670> view<00:01:25.880> down<00:01:26.719> the<00:01:26.810> left-hand<00:01:27.079> side<00:01:27.350> of<00:01:27.380> the

to view down the left-hand side of the

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.899 
to view down the left-hand side of the
screen<00:01:27.680> we<00:01:27.860> can<00:01:27.890> see<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.159> light<00:01:28.430> bar<00:01:28.640> showing

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
screen we can see a light bar showing

ability to set design offsets on this we

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.270 
ability to set design offsets on this we
can<00:01:35.420> lift<00:01:35.600> or<00:01:35.869> lower<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.229> design<00:01:36.530> in<00:01:36.829> relation

can lift or lower the design in relation

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.279 
can lift or lower the design in relation
to<00:01:37.310> however<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.210> want<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.479> work<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.960> say<00:01:39.109> for

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
to however you want to work to say for

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.050 
to however you want to work to say for
example<00:01:39.320> you're<00:01:39.680> putting<00:01:39.950> in<00:01:40.070> layers<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:41.000> can

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
example you're putting in layers you can

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.870 
example you're putting in layers you can
always<00:01:41.329> leave<00:01:41.869> your<00:01:42.140> surface<00:01:42.560> 255<00:01:43.520> in<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.700> mil

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
always leave your surface 255 in a mil

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.149 
always leave your surface 255 in a mil
high<00:01:44.090> for<00:01:44.960> dozers<00:01:45.409> then<00:01:45.560> come<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:45.859> trim<00:01:46.070> up

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
high for dozers then come and trim up

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.950 
high for dozers then come and trim up
afterwards<00:01:47.229> it's<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.409> fully<00:01:48.799> GPS<00:01:49.429> system<00:01:50.119> so<00:01:50.390> it

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
afterwards it's a fully GPS system so it
