how big is a trillion well to get an
idea<00:00:04.140> I<00:00:04.740> want<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.339> imagine<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.940> you

how<00:00:09.389> long<00:00:09.570> do<00:00:09.660> you<00:00:09.719> think<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:10.050> would<00:00:10.110> take<00:00:10.170> at<00:00:10.440> a

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
how long do you think it would take at a

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
it would take to count to 1 billion

about 32 years you heard right 32 years
to<00:00:24.480> count<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.960> 1<00:00:25.170> billion<00:00:25.830> now<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> difference

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
to count to 1 billion now the difference

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.839 
to count to 1 billion now the difference
between<00:00:27.240> 1<00:00:27.660> million<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.260> 1<00:00:28.529> billion<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.160> huge

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
between 1 million and 1 billion is huge

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.410 
between 1 million and 1 billion is huge
but<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.929> nothing<00:00:31.260> compared<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.420> trillion

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420
