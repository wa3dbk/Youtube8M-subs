traditional sense but it will work my
upper<00:02:05.310> back<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.520> lot<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:06.060> feel<00:02:06.420> like<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.600> do<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.869> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
upper back a lot I feel like I do have a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.380 
upper back a lot I feel like I do have a
lot<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.140> access<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:08.310> my<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.729> my<00:02:08.759> lower<00:02:09.090> lats

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
lot of access to my to my lower lats

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.300 
lot of access to my to my lower lats
especially<00:02:09.959> through<00:02:10.170> those<00:02:10.349> Zita<00:02:10.709> rose<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
especially through those Zita rose and

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.250 
especially through those Zita rose and
the<00:02:11.760> pull<00:02:12.000> downs<00:02:12.180> like<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.660> obviously<00:02:13.020> at<00:02:13.170> my

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the pull downs like and obviously at my

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.930 
the pull downs like and obviously at my
lower<00:02:13.410> lots<00:02:13.620> pretty<00:02:13.920> well<00:02:14.069> but<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.610> think<00:02:14.640> one

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
lower lots pretty well but I think one

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.490 
lower lots pretty well but I think one
of<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.090> areas<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.390> needs<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> most<00:02:15.900> growth

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
of the areas that needs the most growth

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.320 
of the areas that needs the most growth
is<00:02:16.680> my<00:02:17.250> upper<00:02:17.489> back<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.879> I'm<00:02:17.940> doing<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.180> lot<00:02:18.270> of

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
is my upper back so I'm doing a lot of

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.390 
is my upper back so I'm doing a lot of
exercises<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.080> access<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:20.160> however

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
exercises to access that this however

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.250 
exercises to access that this however
does<00:02:20.879> not<00:02:20.940> hit<00:02:21.360> me<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.629> my<00:02:21.660> upper<00:02:21.870> back<00:02:21.989> very

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
does not hit me in my upper back very

majority of the movement the majority of
the<00:02:58.860> flexion<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.459> stretching<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.510> still

exercise so i thought i'd give it a try
and<00:03:43.170> i<00:03:43.440> did<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.769> instead<00:03:44.519> of<00:03:44.549> doing<00:03:44.670> some<00:03:45.060> of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
and i did that instead of doing some of

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.110 
and i did that instead of doing some of
the<00:03:45.209> close<00:03:45.750> grip<00:03:46.049> pull<00:03:46.260> downs<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.709> i<00:03:46.769> do<00:03:46.860> i<00:03:47.700> I

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
both ways this close grip so you use the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.240 
both ways this close grip so you use the
same<00:03:55.080> grip<00:03:55.349> that<00:03:55.439> i'm<00:03:55.560> using<00:03:55.590> here<00:03:55.830> for<00:03:56.129> these

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
same grip that i'm using here for these

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.420 
same grip that i'm using here for these
uh<00:03:56.280> these<00:03:56.780> sort<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.840> bent<00:03:58.140> over<00:03:58.470> t-bar<00:03:59.040> rose

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.369 
uh these sort of bent over t-bar rose
but<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.480> do<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.689> with<00:04:00.780> a<00:04:00.810> pulldown<00:04:01.140> but<00:04:01.319> i'm

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
but you do that with a pulldown but i'm

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:02.990 
but you do that with a pulldown but i'm
trying<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.650> get<00:04:01.709> more<00:04:01.860> t-virus<00:04:02.159> i<00:04:02.459> think<00:04:02.909> one

trying to get more t-virus i think one

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.009 
trying to get more t-virus i think one
of<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.150> things<00:04:03.209> would<00:04:03.480> like<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.720> do<00:04:03.780> for<00:04:03.810> my

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
of the things would like to do for my

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.360 
of the things would like to do for my
tea<00:04:04.080> bar<00:04:04.379> Rosen's<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.799> think<00:04:04.950> any<00:04:05.069> actually

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
tea bar Rosen's I think any actually

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.640 
tea bar Rosen's I think any actually
move<00:04:05.790> my<00:04:05.970> feet<00:04:06.239> back<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.569> little<00:04:06.870> bit<00:04:07.080> but<00:04:07.530> the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
move my feet back a little bit but the

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.750 
move my feet back a little bit but the
reason<00:04:07.769> I'm<00:04:07.920> doing<00:04:08.010> them<00:04:08.159> like<00:04:08.280> this<00:04:08.549> is

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
reason I'm doing them like this is

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.110 
reason I'm doing them like this is
because<00:04:09.330> I<00:04:09.689> want<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.890> with<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.670> downward

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
because I want to the with the downward

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.449 
because I want to the with the downward
motion<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.629> downward<00:04:12.959> tension<00:04:13.439> to<00:04:13.950> be<00:04:14.099> placed

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
motion the downward tension to be placed

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.699 
motion the downward tension to be placed
on<00:04:14.640> my<00:04:14.790> traps<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.420> when<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.840> pull<00:04:16.139> up<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.470> course

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
on my traps and when I pull up of course

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.020 
on my traps and when I pull up of course
it's<00:04:16.889> still<00:04:17.070> using<00:04:17.280> my<00:04:17.370> back<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.729> these<00:04:17.880> on<00:04:17.940> my

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
that's one of the things that happens

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
things with traps is that and you'll

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
notice that I'm doing this a lot is I'm

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.450 
notice that I'm doing this a lot is I'm
allowing<00:05:09.720> my<00:05:09.990> traps<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.500> be<00:05:10.620> stretched<00:05:11.130> and

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
allowing my traps to be stretched and

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.730 
allowing my traps to be stretched and
now<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.150> course<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.570> squeeze<00:05:12.870> part<00:05:13.229> of<00:05:13.380> the<00:05:13.500> of

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
now of course the squeeze part of the of

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.650 
now of course the squeeze part of the of
the<00:05:14.070> movement<00:05:14.460> is<00:05:14.520> important<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.389> hear<00:05:15.539> that

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
the movement is important you hear that

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.060 
the movement is important you hear that
the<00:05:15.810> stretch<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.139> squeeze<00:05:16.620> that's<00:05:16.860> what<00:05:16.979> it

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
the stretch and squeeze that's what it

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.430 
the stretch and squeeze that's what it
all<00:05:17.160> comes<00:05:17.190> down<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.639> a<00:05:17.850> lot<00:05:18.090> but<00:05:18.780> i<00:05:18.990> think<00:05:19.350> the

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
all comes down to a lot but i think the

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.570 
all comes down to a lot but i think the
stretch<00:05:19.800> is<00:05:20.010> something<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.370> definitely

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
stretch is something that definitely

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.390 
stretch is something that definitely
gets<00:05:20.880> overlooked<00:05:21.449> a<00:05:21.600> lot<00:05:21.660> in<00:05:22.169> terms<00:05:22.590> of<00:05:22.860> muscle

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
gets overlooked a lot in terms of muscle

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.800 
gets overlooked a lot in terms of muscle
building<00:05:23.729> you<00:05:24.120> know<00:05:24.210> you<00:05:24.300> think<00:05:24.510> about<00:05:24.690> how

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
building you know you think about how

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
building you know you think about how
does<00:05:24.930> something<00:05:25.169> grow<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:25.500> might<00:05:25.620> want<00:05:25.770> to

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
does something grow you might want to

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.469 
does something grow you might want to
stretch<00:05:26.160> it<00:05:26.430> right<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:27.090> that's<00:05:27.240> one<00:05:27.360> of<00:05:27.389> the
