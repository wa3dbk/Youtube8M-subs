00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.200 
are kind of cheap as you know here you
go<00:00:56.090> what<00:00:57.090> you're<00:00:57.239> looking<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:59.210> lot

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
go what you're looking at here is a lot

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.080 
go what you're looking at here is a lot
of<00:01:00.359> articulation<00:01:01.079> first<00:01:02.039> off<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:03.059> have

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
of articulation first off you have

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.560 
of articulation first off you have
articulation<00:01:03.979> goes<00:01:04.979> up<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> I

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
articulation goes up and down so I

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.390 
articulation goes up and down so I
decide<00:01:06.960> he<00:01:07.260> has<00:01:07.380> pretty<00:01:07.680> much<00:01:07.860> full<00:01:08.130> movement

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
decide he has pretty much full movement

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.760 
decide he has pretty much full movement
there<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.960> his<00:01:10.080> joints<00:01:10.619> look

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
there so you can see his joints look

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.270 
there so you can see his joints look
really<00:01:11.460> good<00:01:12.590> they're<00:01:13.590> solid<00:01:14.070> they're<00:01:14.250> not

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
really good they're solid they're not

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.490 
really good they're solid they're not

about her looks like she's got a rubbery
on<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.489> legs<00:03:45.760> if<00:03:46.359> you<00:03:46.510> notice<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:47.049> looks<00:03:47.230> like

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
on the legs if you notice it looks like

thing<00:03:48.939> going<00:03:49.239> on<00:03:49.359> I<00:03:49.659> think<00:03:50.409> it's<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.560> way<00:03:50.709> she

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
thing going on I think it's the way she

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.349 
thing going on I think it's the way she
stuffed<00:03:51.129> in<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.310> packaging<00:03:51.819> hopefully<00:03:52.209> her

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
stuffed in the packaging hopefully her

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.149 
stuffed in the packaging hopefully her
legs<00:03:52.569> go<00:03:52.780> back<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.109> normal<00:03:53.260> shape<00:03:53.680> because

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
legs go back to normal shape because

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.849 
legs go back to normal shape because
that<00:03:55.000> does<00:03:55.239> look<00:03:55.419> a<00:03:55.480> little<00:03:55.629> bit<00:03:55.840> strange<00:03:56.169> not

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
that does look a little bit strange not

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:58.500 
that does look a little bit strange not
quite<00:03:57.069> sure<00:03:57.099> if<00:03:57.280> that's<00:03:57.489> just<00:03:57.730> that<00:03:57.879> figure<00:03:58.269> I

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
quite sure if that's just that figure I

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.949 
quite sure if that's just that figure I
haven't<00:03:58.810> looked<00:03:58.900> at<00:03:59.079> other<00:03:59.230> ones<00:03:59.530> but<00:03:59.680> I<00:04:00.959> think

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
haven't looked at other ones but I think

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.390 
haven't looked at other ones but I think
it's<00:04:02.049> just<00:04:02.109> the<00:04:02.290> way<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.799> packaging<00:04:03.310> is

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
it's just the way that the packaging is

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.550 
it's just the way that the packaging is
kind<00:04:03.579> of<00:04:03.669> squeezing<00:04:04.000> her<00:04:04.090> legs<00:04:04.329> but<00:04:05.260> anyways

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
kind of squeezing her legs but anyways

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.640 
kind of squeezing her legs but anyways
