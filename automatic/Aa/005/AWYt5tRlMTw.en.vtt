00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.500 

so<00:00:00.719> now<00:00:00.930> I<00:00:00.960> have<00:00:01.380> to<00:00:01.650> model<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.340> water<00:00:02.700> which

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
so now I have to model the water which

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.749 
so now I have to model the water which
will<00:00:03.689> be<00:00:03.870> inside<00:00:04.290> my<00:00:04.560> test<00:00:04.890> tube<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.460> test

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
will be inside my test tube the test

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.740 
will be inside my test tube the test
tube<00:00:06.060> had<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.359> diameter<00:00:06.810> equal<00:00:08.179> to<00:00:09.179> 16

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
tube had a diameter equal to 16

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.169 
tube had a diameter equal to 16
millimeters<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.590> used<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.460> wall<00:00:11.820> thickness

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
millimeters I used a wall thickness

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.860 
millimeters I used a wall thickness
we'll<00:00:13.080> call<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.469> T<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.160> 1<00:00:14.910> millimeter<00:00:15.269> let's

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
we'll call that T of 1 millimeter let's

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.560 
we'll call that T of 1 millimeter let's
take<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> look<00:00:16.470> at<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:16.740> circle<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.490> actually<00:00:18.029> I'm

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
take a look at my circle I actually I'm

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.970 
take a look at my circle I actually I'm
having<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.320> ring<00:00:20.090> with<00:00:21.090> 16<00:00:21.750> millimeters<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.650> my

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
having a ring with 16 millimeters of my

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.750 
having a ring with 16 millimeters of my
outside<00:00:23.609> diameter<00:00:23.880> my<00:00:24.750> inside<00:00:25.529> diameter<00:00:25.800> here

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
outside diameter my inside diameter here

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.060 
outside diameter my inside diameter here
of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.779> ring<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> test<00:00:28.560> tube

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
of the ring of the test tube

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.370 
of the ring of the test tube
would<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.090> 14<00:00:30.660> millimeters<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
would have to be 14 millimeters so the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.110 
would have to be 14 millimeters so the
water<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.190> model<00:00:35.760> has<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> diameter<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:38.120> 14

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
water that I model has a diameter of 14

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.010 
water that I model has a diameter of 14
millimeters<00:00:40.730> remember<00:00:41.730> subtracting

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
millimeters remember subtracting

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.720 
millimeters remember subtracting
thickness<00:00:43.020> from<00:00:43.230> both<00:00:43.620> sides<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> left

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
thickness from both sides on the left

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.160 
thickness from both sides on the left
and<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.050> right<00:00:46.200> if<00:00:46.940> my<00:00:47.940> diameter<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and on the right if my diameter of the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.369 
and on the right if my diameter of the
water<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.800> 14<00:00:50.399> millimeters<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.930> radius

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
water is 14 millimeters then the radius

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.430 
water is 14 millimeters then the radius
has<00:00:53.070> got<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.520> be<00:00:53.640> half<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.030> diameter<00:00:54.449> which<00:00:55.410> is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
has got to be half the diameter which is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.119 
has got to be half the diameter which is
7<00:00:56.070> millimeters<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.109> that<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.710> value<00:00:59.100> that

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
7 millimeters and that is the value that

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.959 
7 millimeters and that is the value that
I<00:00:59.370> used<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.600> my<00:01:00.660> Philip<00:01:01.230> radius<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.760> my

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
I used for my Philip radius I have my

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.950 
I used for my Philip radius I have my
water<00:01:03.270> measured<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.830> my<00:01:05.040> test<00:01:05.339> tube<00:01:05.549> I

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
water measured and I have my test tube I

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.770 
water measured and I have my test tube I
can<00:01:06.960> use<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.530> water<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:09.060> test<00:01:09.330> tube<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
can use this water and the test tube to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.310 
can use this water and the test tube to
create<00:01:10.049> an<00:01:10.350> assembly<00:01:11.150> but<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.330> cosmetics<00:01:13.140> so

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
create an assembly but for cosmetics so

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.830 
create an assembly but for cosmetics so
that<00:01:13.470> we<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.830> clearly<00:01:14.220> see<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.850> water<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.630> be
