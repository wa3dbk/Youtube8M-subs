after I was at Black Mountain I must

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.380 
after I was at Black Mountain I must
have<00:00:28.289> said<00:00:28.529> something<00:00:28.830> because<00:00:29.310> max<00:00:29.820> came<00:00:30.210> up

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
have said something because max came up

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.810 
have said something because max came up
to<00:00:30.570> me<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.840> said<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> want<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:32.340> take<00:00:32.610> my

had more than three students but the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.270 
had more than three students but the
students<00:00:42.719> he<00:00:42.809> had<00:00:43.020> were<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.649> significant

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
when he asked me to take his class I was

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.049 
when he asked me to take his class I was
horrified<00:00:48.289> because<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.680> said<00:00:49.980> I've<00:00:50.250> had<00:00:50.579> no

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
horrified because I said I've had no

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.360 
horrified because I said I've had no
training<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.660> can't<00:00:52.020> take<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.379> class<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.039> he

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
training I can't take your class and he

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
training I can't take your class and he
said<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.090> haven't<00:00:54.300> been<00:00:54.480> math<00:00:54.750> poison<00:00:55.410> which

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
said you haven't been math poison which

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.240 
said you haven't been math poison which
is<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.629> he<00:00:57.629> said<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.230> will<00:00:58.649> teach<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
is right he said I will teach you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.889 
is right he said I will teach you
mathematics<00:00:59.520> for<00:01:00.210> artists<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.809> he<00:01:01.379> showed<00:01:01.829> me

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
mathematics for artists and he showed me

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.899 
mathematics for artists and he showed me
mathematics<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.110> nature<00:01:04.589> he<00:01:05.339> wasn't<00:01:05.729> teaching

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
mathematics in nature he wasn't teaching

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910 
mathematics in nature he wasn't teaching
a<00:01:06.240> mathematician<00:01:06.659> he<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.350> teaching<00:01:07.770> an

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
a mathematician he was teaching an

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.370 
a mathematician he was teaching an
artist<00:01:08.430> how<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:09.060> mathematically<00:01:09.380> but

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
artist how to think mathematically but

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.789 
artist how to think mathematically but
it<00:01:10.680> was<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.490> wonderful<00:01:12.390> that's<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.110> heady<00:01:13.439> I

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
it was so wonderful that's so heady I

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.600 
it was so wonderful that's so heady I
felt<00:01:14.130> big<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:18.200> was<00:01:19.200> studying<00:01:19.580> transitive

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
felt big I was studying transitive

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.249 
felt big I was studying transitive
geometry<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.479> wanted<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.900> find<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
geometry and I wanted to find a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.399 
geometry and I wanted to find a
transitive<00:01:22.890> material<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.729> located<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.840> carbon

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
transitive material I located the carbon

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.520 
transitive material I located the carbon
paper<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.979> by<00:01:26.189> folding<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.090> unfolding<00:01:27.530> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
paper and by folding and unfolding the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.969 
paper and by folding and unfolding the
sheets<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.310> could<00:01:30.240> transpose<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.470> equations

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
sheets I could transpose the equations

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.270 
sheets I could transpose the equations
I'd<00:01:32.220> been<00:01:32.430> working<00:01:32.640> into<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:34.280> materialized

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I'd been working into a materialized

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.289 
I'd been working into a materialized
artwork<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.320> was<00:01:37.320> very<00:01:37.650> interested<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
artwork I was very interested in the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
artwork I was very interested in the
fact<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.960> whole<00:01:40.170> room<00:01:40.820> should

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
fact that the whole room should

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.420 
fact that the whole room should
represent<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.689> art<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.290> painted<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.189> walls

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
represent the art I painted the walls

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.460 
represent the art I painted the walls
with<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.880> brightest<00:01:45.360> white<00:01:45.659> paint<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.229> could

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
with the brightest white paint you could

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.950 
with the brightest white paint you could
find<00:01:46.829> as<00:01:47.159> people<00:01:47.880> walked<00:01:48.149> into<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> room

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
find as people walked into the room

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.749 
find as people walked into the room
their<00:01:50.509> footprints<00:01:51.979> became<00:01:52.979> part<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
drawing that was my plan I lived unchain

drawing that was my plan I lived unchain
bro<00:01:59.040> Street<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.729> was<00:01:59.939> working<00:02:00.420> all<00:02:00.570> kinds<00:02:00.659> of

jobs at once plus I had a child I was

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.609 
jobs at once plus I had a child I was
raising<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.840> didn't<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.290> money<00:02:04.439> to

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
raising and I didn't have the money to

raising and I didn't have the money to
buy<00:02:04.860> art<00:02:05.100> supplies<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.610> were<00:02:05.700> expensive<00:02:06.210> so

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
buy art supplies that were expensive so

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.059 
buy art supplies that were expensive so
I<00:02:06.420> went<00:02:06.750> across<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.049> street<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.680> hardware

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
I went across the street to the hardware

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.479 
I went across the street to the hardware
store<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.940> bought<00:02:09.200> crude<00:02:10.200> oil<00:02:10.470> gallons<00:02:11.310> of

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
store and I bought crude oil gallons of

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.410 
store and I bought crude oil gallons of
crude<00:02:11.670> oil

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
crude oil

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.620 
crude oil
people<00:02:13.420> look<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.170> crude<00:02:14.560> oil<00:02:14.920> as<00:02:15.460> a<00:02:16.240> big

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
people look on the crude oil as a big

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.170 
people look on the crude oil as a big
insight<00:02:17.170> into<00:02:17.440> material<00:02:18.100> believe<00:02:18.550> me<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.970> was

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
insight into material believe me it was

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.670 
insight into material believe me it was
not<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.750> was<00:02:19.810> accident<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.750> also<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.650> know

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
not it was accident but I also you know

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.950 
not it was accident but I also you know
had<00:02:24.010> done<00:02:24.370> some<00:02:24.640> tests<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:25.330> knew<00:02:25.600> what<00:02:25.930> it

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
had done some tests and I knew what it

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.650 
had done some tests and I knew what it
would<00:02:26.200> do<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.770> knew<00:02:26.950> that<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.340> had

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
would do and I knew that it had

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.230 
would do and I knew that it had
incredible<00:02:28.660> properties<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.590> color<00:02:30.190> wise<00:02:30.520> it

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
incredible properties and color wise it

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.150 
incredible properties and color wise it
fell<00:02:31.570> right<00:02:31.780> into<00:02:32.050> my<00:02:32.200> Bose<00:02:32.560> art<00:02:32.800> training

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
fell right into my Bose art training

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.880 
fell right into my Bose art training
because<00:02:33.760> this<00:02:34.120> was<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.360> natural<00:02:34.690> in<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.410> earth

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
because this was a natural in the earth

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.330 
because this was a natural in the earth
material<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.510> me<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:38.140> has<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.950> lot<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.370> color

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
material and to me it has a lot of color

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.370 
material and to me it has a lot of color
by<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.400> time<00:02:42.730> I've<00:02:42.910> been<00:02:42.940> looking<00:02:43.150> at<00:02:43.990> a<00:02:44.050> lot

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
by this time I've been looking at a lot

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.699 
by this time I've been looking at a lot
of<00:02:44.560> Italian<00:02:44.860> painting<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:46.230> realized<00:02:47.230> that

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
of Italian painting and realized that

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.590 
of Italian painting and realized that
they<00:02:48.370> were<00:02:48.430> all<00:02:48.550> based<00:02:49.390> on<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.900> golden<00:02:50.140> mean<00:02:50.620> I

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
they were all based on the golden mean I

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.900 
they were all based on the golden mean I
was<00:02:52.600> very<00:02:52.690> familiar<00:02:53.230> with<00:02:53.620> what<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.550> golden

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
was very familiar with what the golden

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.540 
was very familiar with what the golden
mean<00:02:55.090> looked<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.630> now<00:02:56.350> our<00:02:56.560> bodies<00:02:57.070> are<00:02:57.340> all

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
mean looked like now our bodies are all

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.260 
mean looked like now our bodies are all
golden<00:02:58.150> mean<00:02:58.840> this<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.260> our<00:02:59.880> everything<00:03:00.880> as

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
golden mean this is our everything as

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.890 
golden mean this is our everything as
you<00:03:02.050> begin<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.530> realize<00:03:03.270> it's<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.420> magic

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
you begin to realize it's a magic

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.560 
you begin to realize it's a magic
proportion<00:03:05.560> if<00:03:06.100> you<00:03:06.370> do<00:03:06.550> anything<00:03:06.850> using<00:03:07.450> it

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
proportion if you do anything using it

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.630 
proportion if you do anything using it
you<00:03:07.690> can't<00:03:07.930> go<00:03:08.080> wrong<00:03:08.260> it<00:03:08.830> Spellman<00:03:09.489> be<00:03:09.610> a

you can't go wrong it Spellman be a
success<00:03:10.239> it's<00:03:10.510> amazing<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.580> wanted<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.670> work

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
success it's amazing I wanted to work

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.000 
success it's amazing I wanted to work
with<00:03:12.880> curves<00:03:13.450> because<00:03:14.110> everything<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:14.800> was

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
with curves because everything that was

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.080 
with curves because everything that was
in<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.370> universe<00:03:15.790> moves<00:03:16.150> on<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> elliptical<00:03:17.410> I

was<00:03:19.090> able<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.450> work<00:03:19.840> with<00:03:20.410> the<00:03:20.680> water<00:03:20.890> color

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
was able to work with the water color

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.400 
was able to work with the water color
very<00:03:21.730> very<00:03:21.970> thick<00:03:22.239> so<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.840> has<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.019> real

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
very very thick so it has a real

presence to it the canvas has been
painted<00:03:26.620> white<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.220> acts<00:03:27.580> like<00:03:27.730> the

painted white so that acts like the

painted white so that acts like the
