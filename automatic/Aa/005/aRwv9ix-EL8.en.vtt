00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
looking up here at the details that are

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.940 
looking up here at the details that are
included<00:00:40.060> in<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.329> profile<00:00:40.810> there<00:00:41.500> are<00:00:41.650> a<00:00:41.710> lot

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
included in the profile there are a lot

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.520 
included in the profile there are a lot
of<00:00:41.980> steps<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:43.000> lot<00:00:43.210> of<00:00:43.240> curves<00:00:43.660> this<00:00:44.320> is

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
of steps and a lot of curves this is

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.870 
of steps and a lot of curves this is
something<00:00:44.860> where<00:00:45.010> you<00:00:45.040> look<00:00:45.280> at<00:00:45.400> this<00:00:45.580> and<00:00:45.760> say

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
something where you look at this and say

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.160 
something where you look at this and say
oh<00:00:45.910> my<00:00:46.180> gosh<00:00:46.390> where<00:00:46.720> am<00:00:46.750> I<00:00:46.840> going<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.050> get<00:00:47.110> a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
oh my gosh where am I going to get a

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.710 
oh my gosh where am I going to get a
router<00:00:47.440> bit<00:00:47.680> or<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.130> shaper<00:00:48.700> cutter<00:00:48.910> that<00:00:49.420> looks

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
router bit or a shaper cutter that looks

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.890 
router bit or a shaper cutter that looks
like<00:00:49.990> that<00:00:50.290> and<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:51.100> answer<00:00:51.280> is<00:00:51.760> think<00:00:52.630> about

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
like that and the answer is think about

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.060 
like that and the answer is think about
this<00:00:53.230> in<00:00:53.530> two<00:00:54.370> passes<00:00:54.640> or<00:00:55.270> two<00:00:55.600> layers<00:00:56.070> instead

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
this in two passes or two layers instead

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.150 
this in two passes or two layers instead
of<00:00:57.220> just<00:00:57.490> in<00:00:57.610> a<00:00:57.700> single<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:58.750> here<00:00:59.290> I've<00:00:59.860> got<00:01:00.130> a

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
of just in a single so here I've got a

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.790 
of just in a single so here I've got a
quarter<00:01:00.670> inch<00:01:00.850> beating<00:01:01.390> bit<00:01:01.630> and<00:01:01.870> when<00:01:02.380> I<00:01:02.410> hold

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
quarter inch beating bit and when I hold

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.090 
quarter inch beating bit and when I hold
that<00:01:03.040> up<00:01:03.220> against<00:01:03.580> the<00:01:03.700> profile<00:01:04.299> it<00:01:04.900> looks

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that up against the profile it looks

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.859 
that up against the profile it looks
suspiciously<00:01:06.100> like<00:01:06.220> what<00:01:07.060> I'm<00:01:07.210> trying<00:01:07.540> to<00:01:07.630> do

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
suspiciously like what I'm trying to do

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.929 
suspiciously like what I'm trying to do
here<00:01:07.900> so<00:01:08.350> in<00:01:08.470> fact<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.400> way<00:01:09.520> that's<00:01:09.729> going<00:01:09.880> to

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
here so in fact the way that's going to

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.660 
here so in fact the way that's going to
get<00:01:10.060> generated<00:01:10.540> is<00:01:10.890> we're<00:01:11.890> going<00:01:12.009> to<00:01:12.070> use<00:01:12.280> two

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
get generated is we're going to use two

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.510 
get generated is we're going to use two
distinct<00:01:13.180> layers<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:14.100> three-eighths<00:01:15.100> beating

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
distinct layers a three-eighths beating

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.160 
distinct layers a three-eighths beating
bit<00:01:15.700> on<00:01:15.850> one<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.299> a<00:01:16.359> quarter<00:01:16.659> inch<00:01:16.810> beating

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
bit on one and a quarter inch beating

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.840 
bit on one and a quarter inch beating
bit<00:01:17.320> on<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.590> other<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.039> when<00:01:18.340> we're<00:01:18.490> done<00:01:18.640> and

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
bit on the other and when we're done and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.609 
bit on the other and when we're done and
we<00:01:18.939> put<00:01:19.119> those<00:01:19.270> layers<00:01:19.539> together<00:01:19.810> we're<00:01:20.499> gonna

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
we put those layers together we're gonna

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.560 
we put those layers together we're gonna
have<00:01:20.890> exactly<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.579> profile<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.450> we're

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
have exactly the profile that we're

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:40.520 
have exactly the profile that we're
trying<00:01:22.719> to<00:01:22.840> produce<00:01:23.020> here

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.500 

this<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.860> first<00:01:42.159> of<00:01:42.490> two<00:01:42.520> profiles<00:01:43.300> that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
this is the first of two profiles that

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.820 
this is the first of two profiles that
we're<00:01:43.690> going<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.870> cut<00:01:44.080> what<00:01:44.260> I've<00:01:44.380> done<00:01:44.560> so<00:01:44.800> far

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
we're going to cut what I've done so far

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.090 
we're going to cut what I've done so far
is<00:01:45.340> put<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.060> 5/8<00:01:46.720> inch<00:01:46.900> thick<00:01:47.200> board<00:01:47.500> through

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
is put a 5/8 inch thick board through

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.560 
is put a 5/8 inch thick board through
the<00:01:48.160> router<00:01:48.430> table<00:01:48.850> I've<00:01:48.910> got<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.090> quarter-inch

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
the router table I've got a quarter-inch

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.990 
the router table I've got a quarter-inch
beating<00:01:50.080> bit<00:01:50.260> in<00:01:50.440> there<00:01:50.830> right<00:01:51.010> now<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.820> that

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
beating bit in there right now and that

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.250 
beating bit in there right now and that
quarter<00:01:52.360> inch<00:01:52.390> beating<00:01:52.900> bid<00:01:53.050> is<00:01:53.229> the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
quarter inch beating bid is the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.170 
quarter inch beating bid is the
beginning<00:01:53.830> of<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.280> curved<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:54.910> stepped

now<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:58.270> grandfather<00:01:58.750> clock<00:01:59.140> requires

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
now the grandfather clock requires

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.820 
now the grandfather clock requires
various<00:02:00.670> pieces<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.390> skirt<00:02:01.930> molding<00:02:02.350> the

various pieces of the skirt molding the
easiest<00:02:03.190> way<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.460> make<00:02:03.729> this<00:02:03.880> happen<00:02:04.119> is<00:02:04.540> to

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
easiest way to make this happen is to

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.260 
easiest way to make this happen is to
work<00:02:05.020> with<00:02:05.229> long<00:02:05.470> pieces<00:02:06.070> we're<00:02:06.759> gonna<00:02:06.850> end<00:02:07.119> up

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
work with long pieces we're gonna end up

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.240 
work with long pieces we're gonna end up
with<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.479> lamination<00:02:08.050> here<00:02:08.500> of<00:02:08.740> two<00:02:08.950> different

with a lamination here of two different
thicknesses<00:02:09.399> after<00:02:10.390> everything<00:02:10.720> is<00:02:10.840> done

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
thicknesses after everything is done

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.260 
thicknesses after everything is done
there<00:02:11.500> then<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.370> can<00:02:12.520> cut<00:02:12.760> those<00:02:12.910> into<00:02:13.180> the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
there then you can cut those into the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.300 
there then you can cut those into the
shorter<00:02:13.600> lengths<00:02:13.959> required<00:02:14.560> for<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.860> project

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
shorter lengths required for the project

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.400 
shorter lengths required for the project
itself<00:02:15.670> because<00:02:16.630> we're<00:02:16.810> working<00:02:16.959> with<00:02:17.140> long

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
itself because we're working with long

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.199 
itself because we're working with long
pieces<00:02:17.770> I've<00:02:18.070> added<00:02:18.250> feather<00:02:18.580> boards<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.090> my

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
pieces I've added feather boards to my

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.150 
pieces I've added feather boards to my
router<00:02:19.450> table<00:02:19.720> those<00:02:20.380> do<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.590> really<00:02:20.950> good<00:02:21.100> job

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
router table those do a really good job

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.760 
router table those do a really good job
of<00:02:21.610> providing<00:02:22.090> uniform<00:02:22.540> down<00:02:22.989> pressure<00:02:23.380> and

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
of providing uniform down pressure and

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.680 
of providing uniform down pressure and
its<00:02:24.130> really<00:02:24.580> critical<00:02:24.760> especially<00:02:25.180> with<00:02:25.510> long

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
its really critical especially with long

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.050 
its really critical especially with long
stuff<00:02:26.080> like<00:02:26.320> this<00:02:26.560> those<00:02:27.220> feather<00:02:27.580> boards<00:02:27.940> are

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
stuff like this those feather boards are

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.120 
stuff like this those feather boards are
gonna<00:02:28.150> hold<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.630> down<00:02:28.660> making<00:02:29.560> sure<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:29.980> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
gonna hold it down making sure that the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.580 
gonna hold it down making sure that the
profile<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.910> uniformly<00:02:31.660> cut<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.410> right

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
profile is uniformly cut it's the right

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.710 
profile is uniformly cut it's the right
depth<00:02:32.920> all<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.489> way<00:02:33.880> down<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.360> length<00:02:34.540> of

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
depth all the way down the length of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.900 
depth all the way down the length of
this<00:02:34.870> board<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:35.860> next<00:02:36.220> thing<00:02:36.400> I'm<00:02:36.700> going<00:02:36.820> to

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
this board so next thing I'm going to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.880 
this board so next thing I'm going to
switch<00:02:37.180> cutters<00:02:37.660> change<00:02:38.050> my<00:02:38.260> set<00:02:38.500> up<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:38.739> a

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
switch cutters change my set up just a

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.190 
switch cutters change my set up just a
little<00:02:38.920> bit<00:02:39.160> run<00:02:39.940> another<00:02:40.239> board<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.080> we'll

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
little bit run another board and we'll

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.600 
little bit run another board and we'll
be<00:02:41.290> able<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.470> see<00:02:41.709> how<00:02:41.890> these<00:02:42.040> components<00:02:42.400> are

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
be able to see how these components are

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.160 
be able to see how these components are
gonna<00:02:42.760> come<00:02:43.030> together<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.570> complete<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
gonna come together to complete the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:03:00.710 
gonna come together to complete the
skirt<00:02:44.470> molding<00:02:44.920> for<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.400> clock

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.390 

well<00:03:01.720> that's<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.080> second<00:03:02.500> profile<00:03:03.010> that's<00:03:03.250> a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
well that's the second profile that's a

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.509 
well that's the second profile that's a
3/8<00:03:03.790> speeding<00:03:04.300> bit<00:03:04.480> in<00:03:04.690> half<00:03:05.200> inch<00:03:05.470> side<00:03:05.800> now

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
3/8 speeding bit in half inch side now

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.339 
3/8 speeding bit in half inch side now
when<00:03:06.790> these<00:03:06.940> two<00:03:07.000> boards<00:03:07.390> get<00:03:07.720> laminated

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
when these two boards get laminated

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.300 
when these two boards get laminated
together<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:10.000> net<00:03:10.390> result<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.800> it's

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
together the net result is that it's

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.729 
together the net result is that it's
going<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.610> give<00:03:12.910> us<00:03:12.940> that<00:03:13.739> complicated

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
going to give us that complicated

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.580 
going to give us that complicated
looking<00:03:15.129> but<00:03:15.519> easy<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.970> produce<00:03:16.319> stepped<00:03:17.319> and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
looking but easy to produce stepped and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.190 
looking but easy to produce stepped and
curved<00:03:18.069> profile<00:03:18.730> called<00:03:19.480> for<00:03:19.750> by<00:03:20.170> the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
curved profile called for by the

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:42.220 
curved profile called for by the
grandfather<00:03:20.739> clock<00:03:21.010> plan

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.260 

Oh
