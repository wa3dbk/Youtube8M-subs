00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.419 
guys another glitch on Call of Duty
ghosts<00:00:05.850> this<00:00:06.690> glitch<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.230> on<00:00:07.410> strike<00:00:07.830> zone

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
ghosts this glitch is on strike zone

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.270 
ghosts this glitch is on strike zone
it's<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.790> very<00:00:09.090> easy<00:00:09.300> glitch<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.929> do<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:11.010> only

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
it's a very easy glitch to do the only

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.310 
it's a very easy glitch to do the only
exception<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.719> want<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:12.990> be<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
exception is you want to be on the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.169 
exception is you want to be on the
strike<00:00:13.650> zone<00:00:13.679> map<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.460> has<00:00:14.580> already<00:00:14.849> blown

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
strike zone map that has already blown

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.050 
strike zone map that has already blown
up<00:00:15.360> by<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.690> Kem<00:00:16.049> strike<00:00:16.279> so<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.310> would

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
up by the Kem strike so I would

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.810 
up by the Kem strike so I would
recommend<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:19.039> keep<00:00:20.039> looking<00:00:20.430> until<00:00:20.580> you

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
recommend just keep looking until you

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.429 
recommend just keep looking until you
find<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> one<00:00:21.449> that's<00:00:21.779> already<00:00:21.930> blown<00:00:22.260> up

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
find the one that's already blown up

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.939 
find the one that's already blown up
because<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.519> glitch<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.000> mainly<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.949> glitch

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
because this glitch is mainly a glitch

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.970 
because this glitch is mainly a glitch
to<00:00:26.220> hide<00:00:26.490> out<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.810> mainly<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.349> infected

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to hide out so it's mainly for infected

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.290 
to hide out so it's mainly for infected
and<00:00:29.990> possibly<00:00:30.990> searching<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:32.180> it's<00:00:33.180> gonna

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
and possibly searching that it's gonna

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.049 
and possibly searching that it's gonna
be<00:00:33.450> pretty<00:00:34.440> hard<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:35.010> get<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> Kem<00:00:35.550> strike<00:00:35.700> in

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
be pretty hard to get a Kem strike in

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.420 
be pretty hard to get a Kem strike in
one<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> those<00:00:36.469> two<00:00:37.469> game<00:00:38.340> modes<00:00:38.510> but<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> once

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
one of those two game modes but so once

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.510 
one of those two game modes but so once
you<00:00:41.610> find<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.780> strike<00:00:43.739> zone<00:00:43.800> that's<00:00:44.160> actually

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you find the strike zone that's actually

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.209 
you find the strike zone that's actually
blown<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:46.140> went<00:00:46.440> ahead<00:00:46.530> turned<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.100> my

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
blown up I just went ahead turned on my

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.350 
blown up I just went ahead turned on my
mods<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.940> got<00:00:48.500> 25<00:00:49.500> kills<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.489> I'm<00:00:50.850> glowing<00:00:51.180> at

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
mods and got 25 kills and I'm glowing at

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.959

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
map on the strike zone map that's

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.490 
map on the strike zone map that's
already<00:00:56.910> blown<00:00:57.149> up<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:58.140> want<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> go<00:01:00.350> just<00:01:01.350> let

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
make sure you don't crouch because if

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
make sure you don't crouch because if

you crouch you're gonna fall right

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.370 
you crouch you're gonna fall right
through<00:01:21.799> I'm<00:01:22.799> gonna<00:01:22.890> kill<00:01:23.220> yourself<00:01:24.229> it's<00:01:25.229> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
through I'm gonna kill yourself it's a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.649 
through I'm gonna kill yourself it's a
really<00:01:25.619> easy<00:01:25.650> glitch<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.759> mean<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.540> not

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
really easy glitch to do I mean it's not

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.120 
really easy glitch to do I mean it's not
that<00:01:27.720> much<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.380> thought<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.890> worth

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that much but I thought it was worth

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.179 
that much but I thought it was worth
sharing<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:30.540> seems<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> would<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.890> really

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
sharing it seems like it would be really

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.069 
sharing it seems like it would be really
good<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.400> infected<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.900> hop<00:01:34.049> right

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
good for infected you can just hop right

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.140 
good for infected you can just hop right
down<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.740> nobody<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.729> knows<00:01:35.939> where

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
down here nobody really knows where

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.620
