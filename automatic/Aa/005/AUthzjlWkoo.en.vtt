00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
top of that I'm gonna have to do the

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.040 
top of that I'm gonna have to do the
lights<00:06:14.870> so<00:06:16.240> I've<00:06:17.240> got<00:06:17.450> the<00:06:17.630> little<00:06:17.870> yellow

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
lights so I've got the little yellow

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.600 
lights so I've got the little yellow
light<00:06:18.260> that'll<00:06:18.650> probably<00:06:18.770> go<00:06:18.950> up<00:06:19.100> towards<00:06:19.490> the

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
light that'll probably go up towards the

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.770 
light that'll probably go up towards the
front<00:06:19.730> here<00:06:20.090> and<00:06:20.740> I<00:06:21.820> might<00:06:22.820> add<00:06:23.090> a<00:06:23.150> few<00:06:23.300> more

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
front here and I might add a few more

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.510 
front here and I might add a few more
little<00:06:24.020> lights<00:06:24.380> along<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:24.770> side<00:06:25.130> or<00:06:25.430> maybe

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
little lights along the side or maybe

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.280 
little lights along the side or maybe
some<00:06:25.790> reflective<00:06:26.330> stuff<00:06:26.630> I<00:06:26.870> think<00:06:27.080> that'd<00:06:27.200> be

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.290 
some reflective stuff I think that'd be

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.620 
some reflective stuff I think that'd be
kind<00:06:27.500> of<00:06:27.530> cool<00:06:27.880> make<00:06:28.880> the<00:06:29.000> trailer<00:06:29.300> itself

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630
