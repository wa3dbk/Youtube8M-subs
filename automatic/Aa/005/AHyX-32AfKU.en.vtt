like<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> different<00:00:50.340> clip<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.700> let's<00:00:50.730> say<00:00:50.969> we

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
like a different clip so let's say we

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.619 
like a different clip so let's say we
started<00:00:51.480> at<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> beginning<00:00:51.800> then<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
started at the beginning then the

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.880 
started at the beginning then the
someone<00:00:54.629> go<00:00:54.750> blah<00:00:54.960> blah<00:00:55.140> blah<00:00:55.289> blah<00:00:55.320> blah<00:00:55.469> and

someone go blah blah blah blah blah and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.160 
someone go blah blah blah blah blah and
then<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> started<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.570> another<00:00:57.809> place

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
then if you started like another place

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.790 
then if you started like another place
in<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.460> video<00:00:59.719> then<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.930> song<00:01:01.289> would<00:01:01.680> be

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
in the video then the song would be

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680 
in the video then the song would be
different<00:01:02.309> from<00:01:02.609> if<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.000> has<00:01:03.120> started<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
and just something i noticed about this

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.460 
and just something i noticed about this
gameplay<00:02:40.820> was<00:02:41.120> it's<00:02:41.540> like<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.960> opposite<00:02:42.380> of

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
gameplay was it's like the opposite of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.950 
gameplay was it's like the opposite of
the<00:02:42.620> few<00:02:42.830> miles<00:02:43.160> i've<00:02:43.340> gotten<00:02:43.670> which<00:02:43.850> them<00:02:44.090> and

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
the few miles i've gotten which them and

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.330 
the few miles i've gotten which them and
find<00:02:45.230> they<00:02:45.350> were<00:02:45.410> pretty<00:02:45.560> quick<00:02:45.860> in<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.010> start

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
find they were pretty quick in the start

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.280 
find they were pretty quick in the start
or<00:02:46.460> something<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:46.970> then<00:02:47.090> basically<00:02:47.660> towards

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
or something and then basically towards

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.810 
or something and then basically towards
the<00:02:48.470> end<00:02:48.650> they<00:02:48.800> get<00:02:48.950> slow<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.340> slow<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.580> this

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
the end they get slow and slow and this

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.190 
the end they get slow and slow and this
was<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.090> pretty<00:02:50.240> slow<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.570> start<00:02:50.930> with<00:02:51.050> and

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
was like pretty slow and start with and
