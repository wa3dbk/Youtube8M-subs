00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.439
 dream because I saw that there was a 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.700
 there the possibility of having fun and 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.560
 to stay a child all his life in fact and 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.710
 that it made me when I was little I 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.030
 think it's hard to do this 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.530
 job if you're not generous about 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.530

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.810
 watched what was happening around me 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.260
 and then I wrote but it was not I 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.910
 not a writing pen I laugh in the 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.580
