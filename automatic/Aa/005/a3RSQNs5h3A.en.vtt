00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770

and<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.460> control<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.090> car<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.869> there's

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
and to control the car or as there's

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.890 
and to control the car or as there's
just<00:01:10.530> move<00:01:10.950> your<00:01:11.159> person<00:01:11.580> around<00:01:11.900> basically

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
just move your person around basically

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
just move your person around basically
so<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> pretty<00:01:13.950> cool<00:01:14.310> mod<00:01:15.320> -<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.860> think

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
so that is a pretty cool mod - I think

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.520 
so that is a pretty cool mod - I think
if<00:01:17.909> your<00:01:18.060> fuel<00:01:18.330> runs<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.840> I'm<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.259> actually

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
if your fuel runs down I'm not actually

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.340 
if your fuel runs down I'm not actually
sure<00:01:20.240> because<00:01:21.240> I've<00:01:21.479> never<00:01:21.659> ran<00:01:21.900> out<00:01:21.930> field

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
sure because I've never ran out field

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
sure because I've never ran out field
but<00:01:22.590> apparently<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.170> get<00:01:25.170> AB<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.890> iron

there<00:02:35.680> was<00:02:35.769> actually<00:02:35.889> a<00:02:36.099> glitch<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.670> do<00:02:36.819> this

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139 
there was actually a glitch to do this

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.449 
there was actually a glitch to do this
except<00:02:38.139> I<00:02:38.230> think<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.889> could<00:02:39.040> only<00:02:39.250> go

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
except I think you could only go

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.679 
except I think you could only go
straight<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.090> couldn't<00:02:40.389> actually<00:02:40.480> move

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
straight and you couldn't actually move

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.709 
straight and you couldn't actually move
