00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
whole new approach there's no sliding

letter to letter with your fingers to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.250 
letter to letter with your fingers to
produce<00:00:47.520> words<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.180> customizing<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.050> color

of<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.530> keys<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.039> make<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.280> look<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
of you keys to make it look like a

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.119 
of you keys to make it look like a
rainbow<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:51.480> gesture<00:00:52.050> driven<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.980> what

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
rainbow it's all gesture driven but what

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.189 
rainbow it's all gesture driven but what
does<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.370> mean<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> basically

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
does that really mean so basically

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.229 
does that really mean so basically
instead<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.739> having<00:00:55.980> designated<00:00:56.699> keys<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
instead of having designated keys to

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.119 
instead of having designated keys to
complete<00:00:57.600> necessary<00:00:58.079> actions<00:00:58.649> while<00:00:58.859> typing

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
complete necessary actions while typing

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.189 
complete necessary actions while typing
such<00:00:59.640> as<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.969> Delete<00:01:00.239> key<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> space<00:01:00.989> bar

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
such as the Delete key in the space bar

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.990 
such as the Delete key in the space bar
you<00:01:01.649> simply<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.039> swipe<00:01:02.489> across<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> screen

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
you simply just swipe across the screen

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700 
you simply just swipe across the screen
and<00:01:03.690> you'll<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.170> you've<00:01:04.290> done<00:01:04.500> that

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and you'll know that you've done that

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.170 
and you'll know that you've done that
once<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.010> see<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> futuristic<00:01:05.909> blue

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
once you see the futuristic blue

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.750 
once you see the futuristic blue
animation<00:01:06.750> flow<00:01:07.049> across<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> keyboard<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.640> if

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
animation flow across the keyboard so if

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.219 
animation flow across the keyboard so if
you're<00:01:08.909> someone<00:01:09.150> who<00:01:09.270> types<00:01:09.540> fast<00:01:09.869> how

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you're someone who types fast how

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.350 
you're someone who types fast how
helpful<00:01:10.590> exactly<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.490> well<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.060> guess<00:01:12.330> that

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
helpful exactly is it well I guess that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.760 
helpful exactly is it well I guess that
it<00:01:12.600> more<00:01:12.750> or<00:01:12.810> less<00:01:12.930> depends<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> purpose

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
it more or less depends on the purpose

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
it more or less depends on the purpose
but<00:01:14.189> from<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.610> experienced<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.479> it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
but from what I experienced with it it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
but from what I experienced with it it
only<00:01:15.720> slowed<00:01:16.110> me<00:01:16.290> down<00:01:16.460> usually<00:01:17.460> whenever

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
only slowed me down usually whenever

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.100 
only slowed me down usually whenever
you're<00:01:17.850> introduced<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.420> new<00:01:18.479> format<00:01:18.960> or

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you're introduced to a new format or

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.510 
you're introduced to a new format or
something<00:01:19.470> you'll<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.310> used

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
something you'll just have to get used

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.460 
something you'll just have to get used
to<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.790> over<00:01:20.880> time<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.750> my<00:01:21.900> use<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.290> never

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
to it over time but in my use I never

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.289 
to it over time but in my use I never
really<00:01:22.740> could<00:01:22.920> seem<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.220> fully<00:01:23.549> adapt<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
really could seem to fully adapt to it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.940 
really could seem to fully adapt to it
making<00:01:24.540> me<00:01:24.780> only<00:01:24.960> wish<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.560> could<00:01:25.710> return

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
making me only wish that I could return

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.890 
making me only wish that I could return
to<00:01:26.009> my<00:01:26.159> old<00:01:26.340> keyboard<00:01:26.670> every<00:01:27.210> time<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.450> used<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
to my old keyboard every time I used it

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.620 
to my old keyboard every time I used it
but<00:01:28.560> why<00:01:28.799> well<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.000> result<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.509> many

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
but why well this is a result of many
