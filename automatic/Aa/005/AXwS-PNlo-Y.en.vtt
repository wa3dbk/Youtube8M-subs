it's<00:02:40.700> done<00:02:40.970> if<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.269> take<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.650> spoonful<00:02:42.650> out

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
it's done if you take a spoonful out

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.539 
it's done if you take a spoonful out
these<00:02:44.359> two<00:02:44.600> just<00:02:44.840> gently<00:02:45.260> skin<00:02:45.739> over<00:02:46.100> doesn't

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
these two just gently skin over doesn't

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.280 
these two just gently skin over doesn't
need<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.760> be<00:02:46.880> like<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.060> rhinoceros<00:02:47.420> or<00:02:47.900> skin<00:02:48.140> if

it's like that you can find a chance

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.160 
it's like that you can find a chance
going<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:49.880> be<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.120> sweet<00:02:50.329> or<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:50.750> sticky<00:02:51.140> that

much so I think that's about them I'm
going<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.609> take<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:55.970> off<00:02:56.120> just<00:02:56.530> keep<00:02:57.530> stirring

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
going to take it off just keep stirring

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.610 
going to take it off just keep stirring
in<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.310> same<00:02:58.549> direction<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.900> this<00:03:00.109> is<00:03:00.380> one<00:03:00.590> of

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
in the same direction and this is one of

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.039 
in the same direction and this is one of
those<00:03:00.829> little<00:03:01.070> jam<00:03:01.730> makers<00:03:02.180> secrets<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:02.930> you

those little jam makers secrets that you

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.860 
those little jam makers secrets that you
really<00:03:03.320> need<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.560> sort<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.340> understand<00:03:05.000> if<00:03:05.359> you

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
really need to sort of understand if you

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.270 
really need to sort of understand if you
had<00:03:05.989> to<00:03:06.109> do<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.260> figure<00:03:06.440> eight<00:03:06.590> all<00:03:07.010> you're

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
had to do a figure eight all you're

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.130 
had to do a figure eight all you're
doing<00:03:07.489> is<00:03:07.609> going<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.850> make<00:03:08.030> more<00:03:08.150> bubbles<00:03:08.569> but

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
doing is going to make more bubbles but

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.809 
doing is going to make more bubbles but
if<00:03:09.319> you<00:03:09.410> just<00:03:09.620> keep<00:03:09.829> stirring<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.549> one

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
if you just keep stirring in one

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.140 
if you just keep stirring in one
direction<00:03:11.440> you'll<00:03:12.440> find<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.670> foam<00:03:13.910> would

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
direction you'll find the foam would

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.740 
direction you'll find the foam would
just<00:03:14.440> gradually<00:03:15.440> disappear<00:03:16.750> alternatively

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
just gradually disappear alternatively

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.870 
just gradually disappear alternatively
if<00:03:18.140> you<00:03:18.380> have<00:03:18.680> got<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.890> lot<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.069> them<00:03:19.310> sometimes

if you have got a lot of them sometimes

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.550 
if you have got a lot of them sometimes
you'll<00:03:20.000> find<00:03:20.150> strawberry<00:03:20.569> jam<00:03:20.750> does<00:03:21.019> foam<00:03:21.319> up

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
you'll find strawberry jam does foam up

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.610 
you'll find strawberry jam does foam up
quite<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.430> lot<00:03:22.790> pop<00:03:23.630> just<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.989> tiny<00:03:24.200> knob<00:03:24.470> of

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
quite a lot pop just a tiny knob of

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.490 
quite a lot pop just a tiny knob of
butter<00:03:24.769> in<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:26.299> stir<00:03:26.569> that<00:03:26.810> in<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.440> that

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
butter in and to stir that in and that

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.400 
butter in and to stir that in and that
would<00:03:27.709> just<00:03:27.739> carry<00:03:28.340> all<00:03:28.579> this<00:03:28.959> excess<00:03:29.959> bubbles

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
would just carry all this excess bubbles

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.210 
would just carry all this excess bubbles
away<00:03:31.840> Jam<00:03:32.840> looks<00:03:33.080> just<00:03:33.379> beautiful<00:03:33.920> now<00:03:34.370> so
