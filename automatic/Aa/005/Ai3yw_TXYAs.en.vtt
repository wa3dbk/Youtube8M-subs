00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.680 
you know I think he underestimated out
quick<00:02:48.350> Overmars<00:02:48.800> was<00:02:49.130> because<00:02:49.520> he<00:02:50.210> just<00:02:50.450> left

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
quick Overmars was because he just left

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.070 
quick Overmars was because he just left
him

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
him

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.200 
him
van<00:02:51.920> vas<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.550> think<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.910> was<00:02:53.060> the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
van vas and I think it was the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.850 
van vas and I think it was the
substitute<00:02:53.570> or<00:02:54.020> von<00:02:54.320> versa

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
substitute or von versa

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.990

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
whichever way we go at it comes up and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.710 
whichever way we go at it comes up and

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.470 
the stomach that none of us wanted it
was<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.500> first<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:23.190> have<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.850> say<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.210> in<00:03:24.360> all

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
was the first I have to say this in all

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.180 
was the first I have to say this in all
honesty<00:03:24.900> all<00:03:24.990> those<00:03:25.170> years<00:03:25.350> gone<00:03:25.740> it's<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
honesty all those years gone it's the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.130 
honesty all those years gone it's the
first<00:03:26.490> time<00:03:26.790> after<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.300> Dutch<00:03:27.480> game<00:03:27.780> at<00:03:27.960> home

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
first time after the Dutch game at home

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.130 
first time after the Dutch game at home
I<00:03:28.440> went<00:03:29.250> home<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.420> first<00:03:30.690> thought<00:03:31.080> of

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
I went home and the first thought of

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.790 
I went home and the first thought of
possible<00:03:31.950> non<00:03:32.460> qualification<00:03:33.650> entered<00:03:34.650> my

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
possible non qualification entered my

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.610 
possible non qualification entered my
head<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.640> for<00:03:35.940> me<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.360> 2-2<00:03:36.900> draw<00:03:36.930> was<00:03:37.590> a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
head and for me the 2-2 draw was a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.130 
head and for me the 2-2 draw was a
turning<00:03:38.100> point<00:03:38.280> in<00:03:38.580> my<00:03:38.790> reign<00:03:39.090> as<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.630> England

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
turning point in my reign as the England

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.790 
turning point in my reign as the England
manager<00:03:40.530> so<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.580> look<00:03:42.120> back<00:03:42.390> on<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:43.050> try<00:03:43.620> not

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
manager so I look back on it and try not

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.610 
manager so I look back on it and try not
to<00:03:43.950> think<00:03:44.070> about<00:03:44.220> it
