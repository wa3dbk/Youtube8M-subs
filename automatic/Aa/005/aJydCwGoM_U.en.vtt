another mom organizes all of her son's

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.710 
another mom organizes all of her son's

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
or her child's out of season clothes I

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.780 
or her child's out of season clothes I
know<00:03:49.020> it<00:03:49.290> can<00:03:49.440> kind<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.739> be<00:03:49.800> overwhelming<00:03:50.550> just

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
know it can kind of be overwhelming just

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.220 
know it can kind of be overwhelming just
dealing<00:03:51.000> with<00:03:51.150> all<00:03:51.360> those<00:03:51.570> things<00:03:51.900> and

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
dealing with all those things and

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.510 
dealing with all those things and
deciding<00:03:52.680> what<00:03:52.800> you<00:03:52.920> want<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.160> keep<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.489> what

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
deciding what you want to keep and what

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.729 
deciding what you want to keep and what
you<00:03:53.670> want<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:53.910> get<00:03:54.030> rid<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.209> but<00:03:54.959> basically<00:03:55.620> I

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
you want to get rid of but basically I

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.930 
you want to get rid of but basically I
think<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.520> overall<00:03:56.820> principle<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:59.130> less

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
think the overall principle is the less

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.420 
think the overall principle is the less
you<00:04:00.270> store<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:01.140> better<00:04:01.500> definitely<00:04:02.100> hold

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
you store the better definitely hold

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.680 
you store the better definitely hold
onto<00:04:02.580> those<00:04:02.790> outfits<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.360> are<00:04:03.450> really

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
onto those outfits that are really

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.990 
onto those outfits that are really
special<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.440> hold<00:04:04.860> onto<00:04:05.040> those<00:04:05.280> things<00:04:05.340> that

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
special and hold onto those things that

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.360 
special and hold onto those things that
you<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:07.020> know<00:04:07.140> they're<00:04:07.290> classic<00:04:07.770> pieces<00:04:08.010> you

you you know they're classic pieces you

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.680 
you you know they're classic pieces you

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
can definitely use them again for

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.449 
can definitely use them again for
another<00:04:09.870> child<00:04:10.470> if<00:04:10.709> you're<00:04:10.830> planning<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.310> have
