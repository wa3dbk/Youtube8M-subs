Here are 3 methods to convert from VHS to
DVD

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.839
the first two are the easiest for non-tech
people

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.309
and the last one requires some pretty good
computer skills

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.820
so method 1: the VHS/DVD recorder that I recommend
it's the easiest to do yourself

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.340
it does take some time
and you must find a recorder

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.710
which are getting increasingly more difficult
to find

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.800
but that is the easiest turnkey solution
without having to mess around

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.840
with other converter boxes and software
All you have to do is put a blank DVD in the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.800
tray
Put your VHS tape in the other side

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.820
And press the one touch dubbing "video button"
No need to connect to your computer

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.180
buy or install software
or monkey around with external converters

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:02.370
In my opinion this is by far the easiest turnkey
dummy-proof way to do the conversion yourself

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.920
method 2: mail away web services
YesVideo.com, iMemories

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.710
these are paid web services that are available
at least in the US

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.470
and what you do is you ship your old tapes
out to these companies

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.850
and they make your audio and video content
available

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.880
for download and for ordering online
and then method 3: which requires some pretty

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.840
good
tech skill and computer know-how

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.369
external converts
so you can go to Amazon and check out

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.619
Easy VHS to DVD by Roxio
or Honestech VHS to DVD

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.760
or Hauppauge makes the 1212 HD-PVR
once you start using external converters

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.650
designed to work with your computer
you have to worry about software issues

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.470
storage issues
do you have enough space (Gigabytes)

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.159
on your computer to hold all this video data?
are you comfortable using using DVD burning

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.469
software
and managing digital files?

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:17.930
so like I said before method 1 here
the VHS/DVD recorder is the simplest way to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.709
do it yourself
but hopefully you found some of this information

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.579
helpful
Here's a tip for all you pirates out there

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.439
These methods I have suggested
only work with home videos that do not have

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.460
copy protection
so if you have a commercial VHS tape

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.680
that you bought from the store
like The Sandlot or Goonies or the first season

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.749
of Full House
none of these methods will work

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:50.329
even though VHS tapes are older analog technology
they still have copy protection built in

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.249
these aren't sponsored product placements
I'm just throwing out some different options

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.480
for you to consider
but you can help me out by clicking the links
