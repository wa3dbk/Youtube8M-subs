00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.460 
Dutch braid so you'll bring the outside
strands<00:01:21.020> under<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:22.190> middle<00:01:22.369> strand<00:01:22.550> and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
strands under the middle strand and

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.139

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.120 

once<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.140> get<00:01:51.230> a<00:01:51.290> little<00:01:51.350> ways<00:01:51.650> down<00:01:51.680> you're

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
once you get a little ways down you're

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.640 
once you get a little ways down you're
going<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.280> add<00:01:52.460> in<00:01:52.730> your<00:01:53.030> tiny<00:01:53.870> micro<00:01:54.440> braids

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
going to add in your tiny micro braids

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.730 
going to add in your tiny micro braids
and<00:01:55.480> what<00:01:56.480> you<00:01:56.570> want<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.840> do<00:01:56.960> is<00:01:57.170> add<00:01:57.500> these

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
and what you want to do is add these

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.130 
and what you want to do is add these
braids<00:01:58.070> in<00:01:58.310> two<00:01:58.880> different<00:01:59.300> sections<00:01:59.900> each

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
braids in two different sections each

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.710 
braids in two different sections each
times<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:00.890> you<00:02:00.950> don't<00:02:01.160> want<00:02:01.400> three<00:02:02.390> small

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
times so you don't want three small

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.980 
times so you don't want three small
braids<00:02:03.020> in<00:02:03.260> one<00:02:03.560> section<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.910> want<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.240> divide

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
braids in one section you want to divide

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.810 
braids in one section you want to divide
them<00:02:06.170> equally<00:02:06.500> so<00:02:06.800> there's<00:02:06.979> one<00:02:07.220> small<00:02:07.580> braid

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
them equally so there's one small braid

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.160 
them equally so there's one small braid
and<00:02:08.060> each<00:02:08.350> strand<00:02:13.510> now<00:02:14.510> once<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.870> get<00:02:14.960> to

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
and each strand now once you get to

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.560 
and each strand now once you get to
about<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.770> top<00:02:16.010> of<00:02:16.160> your<00:02:16.340> ear<00:02:17.060> you're<00:02:17.300> going

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
about the top of your ear you're going

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.870 
about the top of your ear you're going
to<00:02:17.720> start<00:02:18.080> grabbing<00:02:18.350> in<00:02:18.470> really<00:02:19.280> big<00:02:19.430> sections

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
to start grabbing in really big sections

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.660 
to start grabbing in really big sections
from<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.150> other<00:02:20.360> side<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:22.160> make<00:02:22.370> sure<00:02:22.550> you're

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
from the other side and make sure you're

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.280 
from the other side and make sure you're
smoothing<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.120> out<00:02:23.180> as<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.510> add<00:02:23.660> them<00:02:23.840> in<00:02:23.990> so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
smoothing it out as you add them in so

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.140 
smoothing it out as you add them in so
you<00:02:24.380> don't<00:02:24.560> have<00:02:24.680> any<00:02:24.890> lumps<00:02:25.160> in<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.910> back<00:02:26.030> of

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
you don't have any lumps in the back of

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:37.800 
you don't have any lumps in the back of
your<00:02:26.240> head

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.199 

once<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.930> get<00:02:39.050> to<00:02:39.260> about<00:02:39.410> your<00:02:39.650> chin<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.970> will

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
once you get to about your chin you will

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.590 
once you get to about your chin you will
add<00:02:41.390> all<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.810> your<00:02:41.930> hair<00:02:42.110> in<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:43.600> continue

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
add all of your hair in and continue

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.410 
add all of your hair in and continue
braiding<00:02:44.840> all<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.500> way<00:02:45.590> down<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:47.000> tie<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.330> off

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
braiding all the way down and tie it off

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.620 
braiding all the way down and tie it off
with<00:02:47.630> elastic<00:02:48.200> I<00:02:51.640> like<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:52.850> spray<00:02:53.180> my<00:02:53.300> braids

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
with elastic I like to spray my braids

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.350 
with elastic I like to spray my braids
before<00:02:53.840> I<00:02:54.050> pull<00:02:54.290> them<00:02:54.410> apart<00:02:54.800> so<00:02:55.100> they<00:02:56.000> stay<00:02:56.330> a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
before I pull them apart so they stay a

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.620 
before I pull them apart so they stay a
little<00:02:56.660> bit<00:02:56.780> better<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:59.060> now<00:02:59.330> you're<00:02:59.450> just

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
little bit better and now you're just

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.199 
little bit better and now you're just
going<00:02:59.840> to<00:03:00.080> tug<00:03:00.410> on<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.770> very<00:03:00.980> outer<00:03:01.400> edges<00:03:01.790> of

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
going to tug on the very outer edges of

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:17.229 
going to tug on the very outer edges of
the<00:03:02.450> braid<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:16.280> what<00:03:16.519> I'm<00:03:16.610> doing<00:03:16.640> now<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:17.030> just

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
the braid so what I'm doing now is just

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.960 
the braid so what I'm doing now is just
focusing<00:03:18.019> on<00:03:18.080> pulling<00:03:18.620> out<00:03:18.860> those<00:03:19.610> tiny

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
focusing on pulling out those tiny

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.820 
focusing on pulling out those tiny
little<00:03:20.209> micro<00:03:20.720> braids<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.260> can<00:03:21.500> see<00:03:21.680> them

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
little micro braids so you can see them

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:46.980 
little micro braids so you can see them
better

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.930 

and<00:03:47.990> I<00:03:48.110> don't<00:03:48.170> like<00:03:48.500> my<00:03:48.680> ears<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.100> show<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:49.730> I'm
