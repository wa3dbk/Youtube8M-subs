00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.259
 psv a1 plays after two away matches 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.599
 Tuesday the third game in the 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.300
 next jerry's and so at home on their own 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.490
 really can handle tottenham hotspur 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.730
 the first two games lost psv 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.500
 a1 in basel it became 0 and in milan 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 was lost with three two 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.400
 International 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.310
 and the first chance is also the re-entry 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.160
 not for psv bavil until there is a hotspur 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.869
 the shot of masimo longo the rescue 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.520
 from goalie eric hiding that one 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.440
 got some help from the pole in the 13th 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.989
 minute for sight to one and here 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.930
 corner kicking 10 kudu around you 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.809
 look a and this is the technical staff 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.239
 tim sherwood and the lesson ordered from to 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.039
 a give him the code and there the chance for the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.039
 number 6 wheel axles veljkovic 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.690
 hitting the bar above eric 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.370
 and so psv has a1 twice 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.369
 luck first pole and now the bar then 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.810
 they come to London again 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.090
 veljkovic naturally forward with it 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.000
 he says organize 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 watch that number 6 until it comes to him 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.210
 corner kick and there is again the bar 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.939
 hit 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.810
 this time it is any spread shirt 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.810
 who is not lucky 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.700
 hendriks he plays the ball a rare 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.350
 mistake by psv's central defender 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.080
 a1 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.120
 forest anyway with the ball on stupid bax the 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.710
 cross is excellent and there anyway 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.580
 to take 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.140
 goals make suleiman coulibaly 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.140
 and this somersault belongs there at 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.590
 and that ghoul is of course unjustified 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.410
 not to mention nicely played out 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.540
 excellent cross and good suddenly 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.180
 shot into the air by coulibaly 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.830
 and eric still pass by 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.030
 and 0 1 is also the rest position on the 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.450
 re-entry 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.300
 weird 'on our bipolar 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.640
 good pass in the back is the elvio van 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.060
 overbeek great chance excellent half 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.730
 from john it was a boss also byte de a1 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.140
 away in the second half 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.840
 Jorrit Hendrix stank on the property 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.390
 his body row but we are already 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.400
 whistled by referee berber 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.400
 and therefore a free kick for the a1 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.250
 riley behind the ball is shrinking in people too 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.830
 anyway wagner or touch you need the page 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.660
 it's a one we lived the goal 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.280
 and then assume that it bought 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.680
 ball does not hit the swings 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.330
 ball it tries to turn bought 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.950
 extending does not 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.930
 and partly because of that john is it en maals 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.930
 surprised , the one is gone 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.920
 van ooijen 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:10.310
 looking for antonio striker 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.080
 this is elvio van overbeek and you can see 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.610
 your photo meshes him to the ball of the 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.610
 line reached by Kevin Sjoerd 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.709
 this what a hit him must be and 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.329
 psv should therefore have taken the lead here 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.790
 stand 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.129
 three minutes for tight brunet with the 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.930
 ball on stuck still the cross deeds 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.140
 header van gogh and the excellent 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.099
 slope of john miles that picks one here 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.099
 point for his team 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.950
 good header but also excellent 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.269
 rescue and then from the counterattack 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.170
 encounter 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:47.180
 from until there is a hotspur coulibaly 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.549
 with the ball on raiding Jack Nicholson 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.209
 the shot half the load of dismount 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:57.260
 and there the two one of jackman's 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.970
 and so the a1 gets the lid on the nose 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.549
 so on the one hand you are close to one 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.310
 goal via this menno koch 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.650
 and then it falls good on the other hand 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.799
 cross from lol good header from koch 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.810
 broken excellent rescue of miles 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.060
 on the other hand half the operation of 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.410
 to step out and the winning goal of 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.500
 luns 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.539
 as PSV A1 loses two and three will 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.789
 it the last three games of this 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.789
 nextgen series must be full
