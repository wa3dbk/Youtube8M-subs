00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
show you guys what I have so the first

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.520 
show you guys what I have so the first
thing<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.510> need<00:00:59.059> is<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.780> razor<00:01:01.079> blade<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
thing you need is a razor blade in the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.049 
thing you need is a razor blade in the
holder<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.399> I've<00:01:02.489> got<00:01:02.670> here

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
holder like this one that I've got here

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.500 
holder like this one that I've got here
so<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.049> need<00:01:04.170> razor<00:01:04.409> blades<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.489> pull<00:01:06.270> out<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
so you need razor blades to pull out the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.870 
so you need razor blades to pull out the
silicone<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:08.040> recommend<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.520> holder

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
silicone and I recommend a holder

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
silicone and I recommend a holder
because<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.960> holding<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.260> razor<00:01:10.409> blades

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
because just holding the razor blades

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.770 
because just holding the razor blades
really<00:01:11.490> starts<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> hurt<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> hands<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.720> you

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
really starts to hurt the hands so you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.090 
really starts to hurt the hands so you
can<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.470> got<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.680> Home<00:01:13.830> Depot<00:01:14.070> for

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
can get this I got this Home Depot for

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.670 
can get this I got this Home Depot for
like<00:01:14.340> $3<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.990> holder<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.560> came

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
like $3 for the holder and then it came

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.020 
like $3 for the holder and then it came
with<00:01:16.860> ten<00:01:17.580> blades<00:01:17.850> which<00:01:18.090> should<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.330> plenty

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
with ten blades which should be plenty

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.870 
with ten blades which should be plenty
so<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.060> also<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.900> tape<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.070> tank<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
so I also have tape on the tank that you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.850 
so I also have tape on the tank that you
can<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.560> rimless

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
can see and so because this is a rimless

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.350 
can see and so because this is a rimless
tank<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:28.020> concerned<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.729> I<00:01:29.729> could

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
tank I'm a little concerned that I could

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.090 
tank I'm a little concerned that I could
destabilize<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:31.200> quite<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> bit<00:01:31.530> by<00:01:31.740> removing

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
destabilize it quite a bit by removing

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.499 
destabilize it quite a bit by removing
the<00:01:32.159> silicone<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.759> haven't<00:01:33.030> noticed<00:01:33.150> anything

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the silicone I haven't noticed anything

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.050 
the silicone I haven't noticed anything
bad<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.079> far<00:01:34.290> I've<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:34.740> removed<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:36.000> of

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
bad so far I've actually removed all of

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.410 
bad so far I've actually removed all of
the<00:01:36.479> sealant<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:38.090> four<00:01:39.090> vertical

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the sealant on the four vertical

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
the sealant on the four vertical
surfaces<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.560> seems<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.979> holding

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
surfaces so it seems to be holding

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.710 
surfaces so it seems to be holding
together<00:01:41.310> okay<00:01:41.729> but<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.030> put<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.329> tape<00:01:42.540> there

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
together okay but I put that tape there

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.219 
together okay but I put that tape there
just<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.049> case<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:44.340> also<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.909> tape<00:01:45.240> for

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
just in case and I also have tape for

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.240 
just in case and I also have tape for
when<00:01:46.409> I'm<00:01:46.500> getting<00:01:46.619> right<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.070> lay<00:01:47.220> down

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
when I'm getting right to lay down

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.780 
when I'm getting right to lay down
silicone<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.360> can<00:01:48.720> put<00:01:48.899> down<00:01:48.930> tape<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.790> kind

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
silicone so I can put down tape as kind

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.190 
silicone so I can put down tape as kind
of<00:01:50.820> like<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.030> guiding<00:01:51.360> edge<00:01:51.570> kind<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.079> when

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
of like a guiding edge kind of like when

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.469 
of like a guiding edge kind of like when
you<00:01:52.290> paint<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.490> I'll<00:01:53.640> show<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.909> guys<00:01:54.090> more<00:01:54.450> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you paint and I'll show you guys more of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.179 
you paint and I'll show you guys more of
that<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.140> next<00:01:55.229> video<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.920> series

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
that in the next video of the series

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.280 
that in the next video of the series
when<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.430> get<00:01:56.729> ready<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.969> railay<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.840> silicone

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
when I get ready to railay the silicone

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.429 
when I get ready to railay the silicone
down<00:01:59.180> so<00:02:00.180> I'll<00:02:00.329> also<00:02:00.509> show<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> silicone

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
down so I'll also show you the silicone

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.090 
down so I'll also show you the silicone
I<00:02:01.469> have

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.830 

so<00:02:06.100> this<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.520> silicon<00:02:06.850> I<00:02:06.909> bought<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.420> got<00:02:07.719> it

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
so this is the silicon I bought I got it

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.499 
so this is the silicon I bought I got it
from<00:02:08.140> Home<00:02:08.349> Depot<00:02:08.800> for<00:02:09.069> I<00:02:09.580> think<00:02:09.789> about<00:02:09.940> $4<00:02:10.479> a

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
from Home Depot for I think about $4 a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.510 
from Home Depot for I think about $4 a
bottle<00:02:10.899> which<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.170> pretty<00:02:11.349> expensive<00:02:11.560> there

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
bottle which is pretty expensive there

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.890 
bottle which is pretty expensive there
are<00:02:12.700> much<00:02:13.030> more<00:02:13.739> less<00:02:14.739> expensive<00:02:15.280> options<00:02:15.910> but

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
are much more less expensive options but

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.630 
are much more less expensive options but
I<00:02:16.930> decided<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.650> go<00:02:17.769> with<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.069> because<00:02:18.310> it

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
I decided to go with this because it

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.699 
I decided to go with this because it
said<00:02:18.910> specifically<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.840> its<00:02:20.050> aquarium<00:02:20.500> safe

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
said specifically that its aquarium safe

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.370 
said specifically that its aquarium safe
and<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.910> that's<00:02:22.090> why<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.300> selected<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.319> know

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
and so that's why I selected it I know

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.110 
and so that's why I selected it I know
that<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.769> lot<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:23.980> people<00:02:24.220> use<00:02:24.370> like<00:02:24.610> this<00:02:24.760> GE

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
that a lot of people use like this GE

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.050 
that a lot of people use like this GE
brand<00:02:25.980> but<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.099> main<00:02:27.280> thing<00:02:27.489> is<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.730> want<00:02:27.970> to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
brand but the main thing is you want to

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.430 
brand but the main thing is you want to
buy<00:02:28.440> silicone<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.769> does<00:02:30.400> not<00:02:30.580> contain

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
buy silicone that does not contain

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.140 
buy silicone that does not contain
anything<00:02:32.440> that's<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:33.099> antifungal<00:02:34.090> or

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
anything that's like antifungal or

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.940 
anything that's like antifungal or
something<00:02:34.420> like<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.569> because<00:02:34.959> all<00:02:35.680> those

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
something like that because all those

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.130 
something like that because all those
contain<00:02:36.340> properties<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.120> will<00:02:37.390> hurt<00:02:38.019> the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
contain properties that will hurt the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.100 
contain properties that will hurt the
fish<00:02:38.349> so<00:02:38.799> make<00:02:39.459> sure<00:02:39.489> it's<00:02:39.730> 100%<00:02:39.849> silicone<00:02:40.540> and

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
fish so make sure it's 100% silicone and

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.289 
fish so make sure it's 100% silicone and
make<00:02:42.040> sure<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.340> doesn't<00:02:42.519> contain<00:02:42.940> any<00:02:43.150> like

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
make sure it doesn't contain any like

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.270 
make sure it doesn't contain any like
moisture<00:02:43.780> resistant<00:02:44.260> or<00:02:44.470> mildew<00:02:44.890> resistant

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
moisture resistant or mildew resistant

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.009 
moisture resistant or mildew resistant
properties<00:02:45.489> antifungal<00:02:46.390> stuff<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.810> want<00:02:46.959> to

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
properties antifungal stuff you want to

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.440 
properties antifungal stuff you want to
avoid<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:50.769> I<00:02:50.799> also<00:02:51.099> have<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.700> giant<00:02:52.269> can<00:02:52.420> of

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
avoid that so I also have a giant can of

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.570 
avoid that so I also have a giant can of
acetone<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.830> giant<00:02:54.160> roll<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.280> paper<00:02:54.489> towels

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
acetone and a giant roll of paper towels

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.059 
acetone and a giant roll of paper towels
so<00:02:55.180> once<00:02:55.599> I've<00:02:55.750> removed<00:02:55.900> all<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.260> silicone<00:02:56.799> I

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
so once I've removed all the silicone I

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.390 
so once I've removed all the silicone I
need<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.360> make<00:02:58.989> sure<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.319> I<00:02:59.410> clean<00:02:59.739> all<00:02:59.980> the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
need to make sure that I clean all the

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.949 
need to make sure that I clean all the
surfaces<00:03:00.549> really<00:03:01.120> really<00:03:01.450> really<00:03:01.660> really

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
surfaces really really really really

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.410 
surfaces really really really really
really<00:03:02.290> well<00:03:02.730> before<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:03.940> apply<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.269> new

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
really well before I apply the new

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.990 
really well before I apply the new
silicone<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.890> main<00:03:06.040> thing<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.400> old

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
silicone so the main thing is that old

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.420 
silicone so the main thing is that old
silicone<00:03:07.540> will<00:03:08.079> not<00:03:08.319> stick<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.859> new<00:03:08.980> silicone

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
silicone will not stick to new silicone

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.430 
silicone will not stick to new silicone
which<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.150> one<00:03:10.390> reason<00:03:10.540> why<00:03:10.780> I'm<00:03:10.989> resealing

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
which is one reason why I'm resealing

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.460 
which is one reason why I'm resealing
the<00:03:11.530> whole<00:03:11.650> tank<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:13.049> another<00:03:14.049> reason<00:03:14.230> why

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
the whole tank and another reason why

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.900 
the whole tank and another reason why
you<00:03:14.530> need<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.829> make<00:03:14.950> sure<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.370> clean<00:03:15.609> off

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
you need to make sure that you clean off

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.729 
you need to make sure that you clean off
all<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.329> old<00:03:16.480> silicone<00:03:16.840> very<00:03:17.230> well<00:03:17.440> before

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
all the old silicone very well before

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.120 
all the old silicone very well before
you<00:03:17.950> lay<00:03:18.040> down<00:03:18.069> anything<00:03:18.430> new<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.709> that's<00:03:20.829> step

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
you lay down anything new so that's step

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.660 
you lay down anything new so that's step
one

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
one

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.110 
one
and<00:03:22.569> phase<00:03:22.959> one<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.290> this<00:03:23.470> project<00:03:24.069> I<00:03:24.579> will

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
and phase one of this project I will

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.580 
and phase one of this project I will
bring<00:03:25.299> you<00:03:25.420> guys<00:03:25.540> another<00:03:25.780> video<00:03:25.989> when<00:03:26.470> I'm

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
bring you guys another video when I'm

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.250 
bring you guys another video when I'm
further<00:03:26.859> along<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.600> hopefully<00:03:28.600> this<00:03:29.079> works

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
further along and hopefully this works

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.349 
further along and hopefully this works
out<00:03:29.470> well<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:30.190> I'm<00:03:30.850> gonna<00:03:31.090> keep<00:03:31.299> going

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
out well so I'm gonna keep going

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.020 
out well so I'm gonna keep going
stripping<00:03:31.989> away<00:03:32.109> all<00:03:32.350> this<00:03:32.470> old<00:03:32.680> silicone<00:03:33.030> and

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
stripping away all this old silicone and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.580 
stripping away all this old silicone and
then<00:03:34.389> I'll<00:03:34.480> make<00:03:34.630> a<00:03:34.660> new<00:03:34.840> video<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.260> I'm<00:03:35.380> ready

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
then I'll make a new video and I'm ready

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.879 
then I'll make a new video and I'm ready
to<00:03:35.650> lay<00:03:36.190> down<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.489> new<00:03:36.519> silicone<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.590> wish<00:03:38.709> me

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
to lay down the new silicone so wish me

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.930 
to lay down the new silicone so wish me
luck<00:03:39.010> guys<00:03:39.220> until<00:03:39.639> next<00:03:39.700> time<00:03:40.030> thanks
