in<00:00:00.179> this<00:00:00.359> video<00:00:00.630> I'm<00:00:00.930> going<00:00:01.079> to<00:00:01.140> talk<00:00:01.230> about

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
in this video I'm going to talk about

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.619 
in this video I'm going to talk about
disease<00:00:01.860> and<00:00:02.129> transmission<00:00:02.760> of<00:00:02.850> disease<00:00:03.240> the

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
disease and transmission of disease the

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.240 
disease and transmission of disease the
next<00:00:03.899> video<00:00:04.110> will<00:00:04.440> be<00:00:04.470> about<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.740> worldwide

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
next video will be about the worldwide

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.070 
next video will be about the worldwide
importance<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:06.029> disease<00:00:06.390> we'll<00:00:06.690> start<00:00:06.930> off

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
importance of disease we'll start off

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.259 
importance of disease we'll start off
definitions<00:00:07.830> health<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:08.760> state<00:00:09.120> of

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
definitions health is the state of

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.000 
definitions health is the state of
social<00:00:09.750> mental<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.530> physical<00:00:10.740> well-being

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
social mental and physical well-being

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.910 
social mental and physical well-being
not<00:00:12.000> just<00:00:12.360> being<00:00:12.599> free<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.990> disease<00:00:13.290> disease

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
not just being free of disease disease

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.829 
not just being free of disease disease
is<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> Parcher<00:00:14.700> from<00:00:14.820> good<00:00:14.969> health<00:00:15.179> caused

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
is the Parcher from good health caused

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.330 
is the Parcher from good health caused
by<00:00:16.049> malfunction<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.949> mind<00:00:17.190> or<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.520> body

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
by malfunction in the mind or the body

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.849 
by malfunction in the mind or the body
so<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.850> causes<00:00:21.150> disease<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:22.020> disease<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.769> be

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
so what causes disease a disease can be

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.400 
so what causes disease a disease can be
caused<00:00:23.279> by<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> parasite<00:00:24.320> parasite<00:00:25.320> is

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
caused by a parasite parasite is

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.960 
caused by a parasite parasite is
something<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.890> lives<00:00:26.070> either<00:00:26.279> on<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.730> host

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
something that lives either on the host

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.689 
something that lives either on the host
or<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> host<00:00:27.890> parasites<00:00:28.890> cause<00:00:29.160> harm<00:00:29.519> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
or in the host parasites cause harm to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.550 
or in the host parasites cause harm to
their<00:00:29.849> hosts<00:00:30.060> by<00:00:30.420> feeding<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> nutrition

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
their hosts by feeding on the nutrition

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.610 
their hosts by feeding on the nutrition
next<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> pathogen<00:00:33.320> pathogens<00:00:34.320> are

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
next we have a pathogen pathogens are

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.190 
next we have a pathogen pathogens are
purely<00:00:34.890> organisms<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.790> cause<00:00:36.000> disease<00:00:36.480> they

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
purely organisms that cause disease they

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.139 
purely organisms that cause disease they
do<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.559> by<00:00:37.800> also<00:00:38.160> feed<00:00:38.370> enough<00:00:38.579> nutrition<00:00:39.030> of

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
do this by also feed enough nutrition of

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.020 
do this by also feed enough nutrition of
the<00:00:39.180> host

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
the host

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.700 
the host
now<00:00:42.030> when<00:00:42.480> list<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> organisms<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.500> cause

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
now when list the organisms that cause

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
now when list the organisms that cause
disease<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.430> how<00:00:44.670> they<00:00:44.879> regularly<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:45.539> this

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
disease and how they regularly do this

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.900 
disease and how they regularly do this
first<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.770> bacteria<00:00:47.340> these<00:00:47.700> are

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
first of all we have bacteria these are

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.240 
first of all we have bacteria these are
single-celled<00:00:48.350> organisms<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:50.039> cause<00:00:50.219> harm

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
single-celled organisms they cause harm

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
single-celled organisms they cause harm
by<00:00:50.579> releasing<00:00:50.850> waste<00:00:51.180> products<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
by releasing waste products and the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.619 
by releasing waste products and the
dangers<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:52.710> spread<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.399> rapidly

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
dangers because they spread so rapidly

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
dangers because they spread so rapidly
next<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.870> fungi<00:00:55.289> fungi<00:00:55.620> live<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.129> in

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
next we have fungi fungi live on in

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.860 
next we have fungi fungi live on in
between<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> layers<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.210> skin<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.690> also

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
between the layers of the skin they also

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.020 
between the layers of the skin they also
cause<00:00:58.199> disease<00:00:58.590> they<00:00:58.949> cause<00:00:59.190> irritation<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
cause disease they cause irritation and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.180 
cause disease they cause irritation and
soreness<00:01:00.270> by<00:01:00.870> sending<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.260> hyphae<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.070> is

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
soreness by sending out hyphae this is

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
soreness by sending out hyphae this is
how<00:01:02.309> they<00:01:02.460> reproduce<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.329> hyphae<00:01:03.780> then

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
how they reproduce the hyphae then

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.859 
how they reproduce the hyphae then
release<00:01:04.379> spores<00:01:05.119> next<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.330> viruses

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
release spores next we have viruses

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.560 
release spores next we have viruses
viruses<00:01:07.460> invade<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.640> cells<00:01:08.909> leave<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
viruses invade the cells leave the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
viruses invade the cells leave the
cell's<00:01:09.810> genetic<00:01:10.020> machinery<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.890> replicate

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
cell's genetic machinery to replicate

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.250 
cell's genetic machinery to replicate
they<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.090> produce<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.570> many<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.900> themselves

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
they then produce so many of themselves

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.740 
they then produce so many of themselves
they<00:01:13.920> burst<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.340> cell<00:01:14.520> open<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.060> many<00:01:15.570> more

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
they burst a cell open and many more

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.469 
they burst a cell open and many more
viruses<00:01:16.200> emerge<00:01:16.340> next<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.700> protozoa

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
viruses emerge next we have protozoa

Anopheles<00:04:29.819> mosquito<00:04:30.560> bites<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:31.800> guy<00:04:32.069> and

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
Anopheles mosquito bites this guy and

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.360 
Anopheles mosquito bites this guy and
sucks<00:04:32.849> his<00:04:33.000> blood<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:33.990> now<00:04:34.199> the<00:04:34.650> gametes<00:04:35.069> are

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
sucks his blood so now the gametes are

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.059 
sucks his blood so now the gametes are
inside<00:04:35.759> this<00:04:36.030> mosquito<00:04:36.629> and<00:04:36.949> inside<00:04:37.949> the

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:40.409 
mosquito they start to fuse and just

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.800 
mosquito they start to fuse and just
quickly<00:04:40.800> in<00:04:40.979> this<00:04:41.400> scenario<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:42.419> female

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
quickly in this scenario the female

quickly in this scenario the female
Anopheles<00:04:43.289> mosquito<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:44.069> acting<00:04:44.610> as<00:04:44.759> a<00:04:44.789> vector

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
Anopheles mosquito is acting as a vector

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.300 
Anopheles mosquito is acting as a vector
a<00:04:45.479> vector<00:04:45.599> is<00:04:46.199> an<00:04:46.439> organism<00:04:46.710> that<00:04:46.919> carries<00:04:47.219> the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
a vector is an organism that carries the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.550 
a vector is an organism that carries the
disease<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:47.939> that<00:04:48.330> can<00:04:48.449> spread<00:04:48.689> it<00:04:48.870> but<00:04:49.469> your

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
disease and that can spread it but your

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.320 
disease and that can spread it but your
organism<00:04:49.770> itself<00:04:50.219> is<00:04:50.460> unaffected<00:04:51.090> by<00:04:51.270> this

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
organism itself is unaffected by this

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.230 
organism itself is unaffected by this
disease<00:04:51.750> so<00:04:52.199> inside<00:04:53.009> this<00:04:53.310> mosquito<00:04:53.879> the

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
disease so inside this mosquito the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.420 
disease so inside this mosquito the
zygote<00:04:54.689> you've<00:04:54.840> got<00:04:55.050> they<00:04:55.530> fuse<00:04:55.979> and<00:04:56.310> then

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
zygote you've got they fuse and then

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.179 
zygote you've got they fuse and then
migrate<00:04:56.969> to<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.330> saliva<00:04:57.599> gland<00:04:58.139> in<00:04:58.830> the

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
migrate to the saliva gland in the

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.159 
migrate to the saliva gland in the
mosquito<00:04:59.729> so<00:05:00.120> this<00:05:00.240> mosquito<00:05:00.750> is<00:05:00.779> really

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
mosquito so this mosquito is really

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.640 
mosquito so this mosquito is really
really<00:05:01.349> thirsty<00:05:01.639> goes<00:05:02.639> to<00:05:02.789> boy<00:05:02.939> another<00:05:03.210> chap

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
really thirsty goes to boy another chap

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.580 
really thirsty goes to boy another chap
but<00:05:04.650> so<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.039> mosquito<00:05:05.580> can<00:05:05.939> bite<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.300> sky

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
but so the mosquito can bite the sky

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.129 
but so the mosquito can bite the sky
undetected<00:05:07.939> injects<00:05:08.939> a<00:05:09.120> general<00:05:09.479> anesthetic

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:15.200 
from its saliva glands into the guy
subjects<00:05:13.319> who<00:05:13.379> doesn't<00:05:13.650> feel<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.979> however<00:05:14.909> in

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
subjects who doesn't feel it however in

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.360 
subjects who doesn't feel it however in
the<00:05:15.449> process<00:05:15.599> of<00:05:15.930> doing<00:05:15.990> this<00:05:16.259> the<00:05:16.740> Plasmodium

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
the process of doing this the Plasmodium

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.209 
the process of doing this the Plasmodium
is<00:05:17.520> now<00:05:17.639> fused<00:05:18.090> inside<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:19.020> mosquito<00:05:19.889> saliva

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
is now fused inside this mosquito saliva

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.309 
is now fused inside this mosquito saliva
glands<00:05:20.580> had<00:05:21.120> just<00:05:21.270> been<00:05:21.389> injected<00:05:21.900> into<00:05:22.199> the

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
glands had just been injected into the

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.409 
glands had just been injected into the
guy<00:05:22.439> so<00:05:23.069> now<00:05:23.189> he<00:05:23.250> is<00:05:23.490> carrying<00:05:23.939> this

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
guy so now he is carrying this

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.050 
guy so now he is carrying this
Plasmodium<00:05:25.139> once<00:05:25.949> inside<00:05:26.279> the<00:05:26.490> dude<00:05:26.699> the

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
Plasmodium once inside the dude the

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.659 
Plasmodium once inside the dude the
Plasmodium<00:05:27.659> migrates<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.379> the<00:05:28.500> liver<00:05:28.710> around

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
Plasmodium migrates to the liver around

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.309 
Plasmodium migrates to the liver around
here<00:05:29.879> the<00:05:30.060> Plasmodium<00:05:30.599> releases<00:05:30.870> offspring

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
here the Plasmodium releases offspring

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.290 
here the Plasmodium releases offspring
so<00:05:31.620> now<00:05:31.830> in<00:05:32.099> the<00:05:32.279> blood<00:05:32.460> cells<00:05:32.639> you<00:05:33.000> have<00:05:33.089> the

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
so now in the blood cells you have the

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.999 
so now in the blood cells you have the
Plasmodium<00:05:33.750> gametes<00:05:34.139> so<00:05:34.319> here<00:05:34.560> we<00:05:34.650> are<00:05:34.680> back
