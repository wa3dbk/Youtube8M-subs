00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.980
 what do you do with old ones in bavaria 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.650
 of course, dumplings and how 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.260
 I'll tell you something now 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.760
 you need to 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.619
 I have six old stale ones now 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.360
 pretty rubbery soft semmel 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:38.840
 also taken two bavaria 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:45.530
 some parsley representatives lukewarm 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.449
 milk one onion medium sized salt after 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.210
 taste maybe some nutmeg 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:54.770
 and if that should become too soft 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.739
 semmelbrÃ¶sel I have you too 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.610
 How to make rock hard and if so one 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.470
 old coffee grinder with that you can 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:10.110
 make wonderful breadcrumbs 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.110
 the seeds will be small thin slices 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.060
 now salt comes about about 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.060
 this amount 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.680
 units tele 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.810
 the leftover breadcrumbs on 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.230
 you have to create cutting 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.780
 Do not throw it away, just give it away 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:55.730
 to the possibility to do so 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.490
 next is now the lukewarm 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.490
 milk choked on the rolls 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.209
 the whole thing stays for about 20 minutes 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.030
 until the shipment is softened and 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.840
 you can pull through more easily graf 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.230
 Add a little more milk, too 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.599
 you can see that only after 20 minutes in 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.830
 in the meantime the peeled onion 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:42.019
 cut into small cubes 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:42.019
 Now the parsley is also free 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.090
 about 20 minutes are required 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.090
 passed 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.090
 onion 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:10.739
 to this flyer added 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.819
 The whole thing is now mixed vigorously 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.269
 really nice by force 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.080
 about that also with minced meat 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.349
 The whole thing is left now after five 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.349
 to dry for a few minutes 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.890
 Now the eggs connect together 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.890
 Milk in the cells supple 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.459
 anyone's taste nutmeg 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.750
 the whole thing again might have wonder 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.980
 it put water on it and it 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:48.080
 coming up this once high 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:50.810
 two to three teaspoons salt and 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.180
 Now wait for the water to bubble 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.730
 cooks in the meantime can the 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.480
 forming dumplings 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.740
 depending on how big you want them 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.560
 just choose the appropriate one 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:08.690
 size out though 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.710
 let wages work ahead with it 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.710
 no part is left 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.070
 So the subset has about new 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.070
 crisis 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.680
 when the water is bubbling boiled 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:41.150
 immediately there here to zero switched the 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.150
 dumplings come into the water 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.160
 now she has to pull 20 minutes 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.169
 after 20 minutes can be served 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.159
 become 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.159
 wonderful 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.569
 firmly 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:36.410
 wonderful by together, of course , something 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:39.400

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.979

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:48.349
 Oyster mushrooms or chanterelles a biz 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:50.990
 franzose is the ideal companion for 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:55.039
 his ankles and a little anecdote 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.930
 Finally, in the north of Germany 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:01.009
 was until the first world war 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:04.639
 sr divl a holiday armchair in the south 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:06.380
 on the other hand probably something on the edge everyday 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.330
 so you can like wonderful 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.550

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.570
 Freezer always has enough space 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.199
 and in the aftermath of their appearance 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:27.919
 You can either use them in the microwave 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:30.169
 23 minutes to heat or back in 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:32.389
 hot water little bit 

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:34.610
 In addition, let them go through 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:37.840
 do not disassemble and now 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.840
