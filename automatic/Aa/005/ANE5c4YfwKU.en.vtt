00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.070 
well today I have a windshield

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.990 
well today I have a windshield
modification<00:00:07.000> I'm<00:00:07.960> going<00:00:08.320> to<00:00:08.440> put<00:00:08.650> the<00:00:08.830> MRA<00:00:09.340> ex

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
modification I'm going to put the MRA ex

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.589 
modification I'm going to put the MRA ex
screen<00:00:10.690> on<00:00:11.110> and<00:00:11.590> I'm<00:00:11.710> just<00:00:11.830> gonna<00:00:11.950> use<00:00:12.190> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
screen on and I'm just gonna use the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.089 
screen on and I'm just gonna use the
single<00:00:13.599> mount<00:00:13.809> and<00:00:14.050> not<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.349> offset<00:00:14.800> mount

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
single mount and not the offset mount

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.429 
single mount and not the offset mount
but<00:00:15.460> you<00:00:15.759> can<00:00:15.880> put<00:00:16.000> that<00:00:16.090> on<00:00:16.240> later<00:00:16.480> it's<00:00:17.349> just

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
but you can put that on later it's just

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.479 
but you can put that on later it's just
a<00:00:17.710> joint<00:00:18.279> that<00:00:18.460> goes<00:00:18.640> in<00:00:18.849> there<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.980> that<00:00:21.340> can

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:21.489 
a joint that goes in there this that can

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.510 
a joint that goes in there this that can
be<00:00:21.579> added<00:00:21.730> later<00:00:22.710> I'm<00:00:23.710> being<00:00:23.950> brave<00:00:24.220> and<00:00:24.460> I'm

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
be added later I'm being brave and I'm

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.609 
be added later I'm being brave and I'm
gonna<00:00:24.640> bolt<00:00:24.970> mine<00:00:25.239> on<00:00:25.450> instead<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.110> clamp<00:00:26.439> it

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
gonna bolt mine on instead of clamp it

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.089 
gonna bolt mine on instead of clamp it
on<00:00:27.270> so<00:00:28.270> what<00:00:28.419> I<00:00:28.450> did<00:00:28.570> I<00:00:28.689> had<00:00:29.050> a<00:00:29.079> piece<00:00:29.410> of<00:00:29.649> blue

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
on so what I did I had a piece of blue

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.950 
on so what I did I had a piece of blue
painters<00:00:30.520> tape<00:00:30.579> all<00:00:31.029> the<00:00:31.329> way<00:00:31.419> across<00:00:31.660> the

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
painters tape all the way across the

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.799 
painters tape all the way across the
windshield<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:33.250> I<00:00:34.000> just<00:00:34.359> kept<00:00:34.600> this<00:00:34.750> little

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
windshield and I just kept this little

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.630 
windshield and I just kept this little
piece<00:00:35.260> here<00:00:35.559> so<00:00:35.829> I<00:00:35.859> just<00:00:36.010> put<00:00:36.160> a<00:00:36.190> little<00:00:36.340> mark

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640 
piece here so I just put a little mark

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.360 
piece here so I just put a little mark
on<00:00:36.760> it<00:00:36.850> with<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:36.969> sharpie<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.570> then<00:00:38.370> this

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
on it with a sharpie and then this

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.110 
on it with a sharpie and then this
applique<00:00:40.059> comes<00:00:40.690> right<00:00:40.929> back<00:00:41.079> off<00:00:41.350> I<00:00:42.160> probably

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
applique comes right back off I probably

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.759 
applique comes right back off I probably
should<00:00:43.329> clean<00:00:43.539> the<00:00:43.660> windshield<00:00:43.899> but<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:44.559> more

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
should clean the windshield but the more

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.939 
should clean the windshield but the more
bug<00:00:44.949> gets<00:00:45.160> easier<00:00:45.489> comes<00:00:45.699> off<00:00:46.499> this<00:00:47.499> lined<00:00:47.769> up

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
bug gets easier comes off this lined up

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.479 
bug gets easier comes off this lined up
the<00:00:48.039> center<00:00:48.339> point<00:00:48.640> on<00:00:48.820> my<00:00:49.329> mark<00:00:49.570> that<00:00:49.719> I<00:00:49.809> made

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
the center point on my mark that I made

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.009 
the center point on my mark that I made
it<00:00:51.489> was<00:00:51.640> 18<00:00:52.089> and<00:00:52.239> 3/4<00:00:52.929> across<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.579> 1/2<00:00:54.879> 18<00:00:55.329> 9<00:00:55.600> and

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
it was 18 and 3/4 across so 1/2 18 9 and

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.599 
it was 18 and 3/4 across so 1/2 18 9 and
1/2<00:00:56.350> of<00:00:56.620> 3<00:00:57.309> force<00:00:57.730> is<00:00:57.969> 3/8<00:00:58.480> I<00:00:59.129> know<00:01:00.129> that<00:01:00.399> much

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
1/2 of 3 force is 3/8 I know that much

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.450 
1/2 of 3 force is 3/8 I know that much
math<00:01:00.909> don't<00:01:01.149> ask<00:01:01.420> me<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.749> solve<00:01:01.989> an<00:01:02.109> equation

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
math don't ask me to solve an equation

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.550 
math don't ask me to solve an equation
so<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:05.019> midpoint<00:01:05.350> and<00:01:06.390> then<00:01:07.390> he's<00:01:08.350> got<00:01:08.500> a

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
so as a midpoint and then he's got a

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.280 
so as a midpoint and then he's got a
drill<00:01:09.119> whatever<00:01:10.119> six<00:01:10.420> millimeters<00:01:10.930> turns

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
drill whatever six millimeters turns

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.359 
drill whatever six millimeters turns
into<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.950> fractional<00:01:12.670> which<00:01:13.060> I<00:01:13.180> don't<00:01:13.390> know

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
into in fractional which I don't know

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.030 
into in fractional which I don't know
drill<00:01:15.369> two<00:01:15.640> holes<00:01:15.670> on<00:01:16.450> each<00:01:16.720> side<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.549> then

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
drill two holes on each side and then

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.359 
drill two holes on each side and then
should<00:01:21.040> be<00:01:21.159> good<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.399> mount<00:01:21.579> it<00:01:23.040> well<00:01:24.040> it<00:01:24.159> turns

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
should be good to mount it well it turns

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.020 
should be good to mount it well it turns
out<00:01:24.579> point<00:01:24.939> to<00:01:25.869> four<00:01:26.350> inches<00:01:27.130> equals<00:01:27.640> six

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
out point to four inches equals six

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.749 
out point to four inches equals six
millimeters<00:01:28.659> so<00:01:28.899> I<00:01:29.110> got<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.159> closest<00:01:30.579> thing

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
millimeters so I got the closest thing

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.550 
millimeters so I got the closest thing
1/4<00:01:31.180> inch<00:01:31.299> drill<00:01:31.390> bit<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.930> I'm<00:01:32.200> gonna<00:01:32.350> pop

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
1/4 inch drill bit and I'm gonna pop

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.440 
1/4 inch drill bit and I'm gonna pop
some<00:01:32.590> holes<00:01:32.950> in<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.219> windshield<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.880> really

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
some holes in the windshield I really

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.730 
some holes in the windshield I really
don't<00:01:34.630> want<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:34.840> put<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.049> lot<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.320> pressure<00:01:35.560> on

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
don't want to put a lot of pressure on

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
don't want to put a lot of pressure on
this<00:01:36.039> because<00:01:36.159> I'm<00:01:36.340> worried<00:01:36.579> it'll<00:01:37.020> fracture

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:02:04.130 

and<00:01:50.229> for<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.530> windshield<00:01:50.890> no<00:01:51.190> matter<00:01:51.400> what<00:01:51.700> now

on the other side that use view from the
driver's<00:03:36.200> seat<00:03:37.450> I'll<00:03:38.450> probably<00:03:38.690> have<00:03:38.930> it

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
driver's seat I'll probably have it

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.780 
driver's seat I'll probably have it
something<00:03:39.410> like<00:03:39.440> that<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.250> when<00:03:40.700> I'm

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
something like that so that when I'm

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.190 
something like that so that when I'm
going<00:03:40.910> through<00:03:41.060> town<00:03:41.420> it'll<00:03:41.690> still<00:03:41.990> actually

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
going through town it'll still actually

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.840 
going through town it'll still actually
bring<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.620> little<00:03:42.770> bit<00:03:42.920> of<00:03:43.010> air<00:03:43.160> up<00:03:43.310> into<00:03:43.520> here

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
bring a little bit of air up into here

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.920 
bring a little bit of air up into here
and<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.870> can<00:03:45.020> get<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.440> my<00:03:45.530> face

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
and I can get that to my face

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.000 
and I can get that to my face
and<00:03:47.930> now<00:03:48.080> when<00:03:48.260> I'm<00:03:48.350> going<00:03:48.590> down<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.830> highway

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
and now when I'm going down the highway

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.670 
and now when I'm going down the highway
it'll<00:03:49.880> probably<00:03:50.660> be<00:03:51.050> about<00:03:51.350> here<00:03:51.650> about

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
it'll probably be about here about

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.160 
it'll probably be about here about
straight<00:03:52.190> up<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.640> way<00:03:52.850> it<00:03:53.239> will<00:03:53.390> kick<00:03:53.630> air<00:03:53.870> up

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
straight up that way it will kick air up

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.760 
straight up that way it will kick air up
over<00:03:54.650> my<00:03:54.800> helmet<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.220> up<00:03:55.459> over<00:03:55.700> my<00:03:55.850> passenger

higher because the factory screens so

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.580 
higher because the factory screens so
low<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.560> there's<00:04:36.800> a<00:04:36.890> difference<00:04:37.280> between<00:04:37.460> a

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
low so there's a difference between a

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.760 
low so there's a difference between a
double<00:04:39.590> arm<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:41.050> just<00:04:42.050> mounting<00:04:42.410> it<00:04:42.500> right<00:04:42.680> to
