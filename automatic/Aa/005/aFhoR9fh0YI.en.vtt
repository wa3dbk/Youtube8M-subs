00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello my friends all right here dread 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.310
 what are you talking about daniel technology são paulo 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.710
 is the kit installation tutorial for the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.910
 playstation 4 you do not want to see all 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
 world of 2014 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.529
 here's how it installed what you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.390
 will catch here is that you will 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.789
 you get when you get back the coruche 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.550
 Arriving at your house you will get the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.160
 icasa takes your mother 's pliers from 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.489
 wife to monica who is very good and you 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.559
 will measure where you will cut flights and 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.320
 cutting you very calmly you will 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.820
 pick up and peel children calmly 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.190
 unhurried 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.399
 press you peel both ends 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.940
 as I had previously already told 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.399
 here is the right place for you now 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.180
 peel the three photos of the passages 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.520
 Brown 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.520
 the black and the gray are you doing for 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.659
 another or by one you are peeling and 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.299
 leaving a few millimeters of deviation 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.600
 then we'll wonder what the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.509
 process of putting loose on the black tip 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.549
 then you will get these two tips 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.840
 peeled and ready for you can 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.570
 wonder is very easy to do 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.520
 simply watch the video watch 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.330
 until the end for you to understand how to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.299
 does 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.380
 The second step you'll get the plate 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.840
 You were surprised the rivers passed only in the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.670
 His door and you'll put him 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.590
 first in practice on the plate 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.250
 You can not go wrong, you can not. 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.520
 to err the sequence of the children is thus 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.420
 this right corner of rafael 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.610
 gray the other is black and the one on the left is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:00.000
 Jajá you will show a video that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.450
 You 'll understand that you like to have it. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.790
 solder wire by wire watch the video until 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.520
 the end you will understand 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.270
 completely the process is easy to 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.670
 do 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.890
 this time to a support plate because 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.470
 to avoid that you have to play in 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.040
 terminals and prevent you from 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.190
 have to stay kids do things 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.300
 horrible ugly then this board is from 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.550
 first version 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.990
 I'm already sending a bigger board 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.120
 still a little bit bigger 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.230
 it has the greatest distance between those who 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.120
 between the pins 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.390
 then there is and there is no possibility 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.090
 Do you like to care? 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.390
 there is no such danger but this 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.040
 and I said it even more and 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.630
 I got a card that fits 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.280
 perfectly in this green part that 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.600
 touched the hand it fits 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.660
 perfectly there 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.240
 and these wires now editing me from 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.800
 the same quality with which the 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.709
 kits up to today 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.570
 so some received with these colors 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.800
 these four colored threads and other 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.270
 received a little bit gray and brown 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.480
 Remember, I told you that. 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.489
 black brown left in the middle and gray 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.590
 it's on the right 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.050
 there is no way you no longer have one 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.260
 another hole for you to put these 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:23.100
 children are not simply 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.130
 have an alternative to do the service 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.350
 It's done, it's finished, that's it. 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.570
 that you have practically we had the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.180
 second public step from the left corner 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.250
 brown with the center is black and the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.290
 right side is gray 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.030
 remembering that there is only one way for you 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.620
 Put your kids there is not like you. 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:48.890
 Okay, now we 're going to the next. 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:52.410
 part that is welding the way over 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.600
 because it 's the easiest way to 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.680
 you install the kit is just risk 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:01.380
 first connect the black wire to the center wire 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.200
 There's no way you're wrong, too. 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.370
 to win you just a strange icon of the 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.100
 and then what you do you support the 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.860
 connector 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.240
 I'll do it already because I already know the size 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:18.050
 the distance that has to stay longer 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.140
 You tip is you put only the sun 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:23.750
 the middle of the middle and fits the 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.610
 connector already on the board and then 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.310
 the gray and the brown for you or 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.800
 give us just the sides and there 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.320
 you can flex the wires with 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.550
 ease as I do there is a 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.990
 Time then I already know the size the angle 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.480
 What do I have to do? 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.030
 It's ready now, I'm just going. 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.990
 fit the wire on one I'll fold 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.680
 he always fit ready whenever 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.930
 ever 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.750
 You can not miss the child does not like 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.480
 you reverse the end result 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.350
 finished the service is how it goes 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.130
 to wear a black brown outfit with black 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.880
 was amended and the ashes are separated 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.610
 thus 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.780
 This is the universal kit and it works. 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.220
 on all 2014 cards in both one 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:18.130
 computer says ok 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.130
 I'll see you next month stay with God
