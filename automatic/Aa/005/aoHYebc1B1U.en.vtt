and<00:01:57.990> hobbies<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.380> 3<00:01:58.500> second<00:01:59.630> there<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.720> go<00:02:00.870> and

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
and hobbies for 3 second there we go and

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.420 
and hobbies for 3 second there we go and
that<00:02:01.110> light<00:02:01.409> indicator<00:02:01.830> let<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.250> that

that light indicator let you know that
right<00:02:02.580> now<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:02.940> in<00:02:03.120> both<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.900> Y<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.380> wireless

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
right now is in both the Y and wireless

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.560 
right now is in both the Y and wireless
mode<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.310> basically<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.790> four<00:02:06.000> LED<00:02:06.360> for

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
mode so basically you have four LED for

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.539 
mode so basically you have four LED for
level<00:02:06.900> of<00:02:07.200> power<00:02:07.619> indicator<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:08.399> you

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
level of power indicator and then you

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.309 
level of power indicator and then you
have<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.849> led<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.479> let<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.140> mode

happened<00:03:25.450> when<00:03:25.569> you<00:03:25.659> add<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.840> device<00:03:26.200> that's

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439 
happened when you add a device that's

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.800 
happened when you add a device that's
not<00:03:26.590> supported<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:28.000> we<00:03:28.150> can<00:03:28.269> put<00:03:28.419> my<00:03:28.540> phone

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
not supported so we can put my phone

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.289 
not supported so we can put my phone
here<00:03:29.019> as<00:03:29.079> you<00:03:29.169> can<00:03:29.319> see<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:29.939> it's<00:03:30.939> hard<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.090> see

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
here as you can see and it's hard to see

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.179 
here as you can see and it's hard to see
but<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.719> LED<00:03:32.139> here<00:03:32.319> is<00:03:32.469> actually<00:03:32.739> flashing

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
but the LED here is actually flashing

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.759 
but the LED here is actually flashing
red<00:03:34.060> it's<00:03:34.299> basically<00:03:34.599> just<00:03:34.689> blinking<00:03:35.109> red<00:03:35.290> can

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
red it's basically just blinking red can

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.969 
red it's basically just blinking red can
let<00:03:35.949> you<00:03:36.040> know<00:03:36.159> that<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.970> not<00:03:37.859> detecting<00:03:38.859> the

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979 
let you know that it's not detecting the

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:40.530 
let you know that it's not detecting the
correct<00:03:39.220> devices<00:03:39.639> detect<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.060> middle<00:03:40.359> but

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
correct devices detect the middle but

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.149 
correct devices detect the middle but
not<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> correct<00:03:40.989> device<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.440> charge<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:41.889> that's

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
not a correct device to charge so that's

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.770 
not a correct device to charge so that's
what<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.489> get<00:03:42.639> with<00:03:42.819> it<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.359> of<00:03:43.479> all<00:03:43.569> the

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
what you get with it so of all the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.020 
what you get with it so of all the
mobile<00:03:44.079> pal<00:03:44.229> 10,000<00:03:44.739> milliamp<00:03:44.979> battery<00:03:45.129> woops

mobile pal 10,000 milliamp battery woops

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.119 
mobile pal 10,000 milliamp battery woops
pretty<00:03:46.329> well<00:03:46.479> I<00:03:46.689> like<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.470> fact<00:03:47.650> that<00:03:47.799> it's<00:03:48.010> a

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
pretty well I like the fact that it's a

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.149 
pretty well I like the fact that it's a
pretty<00:03:48.400> nice<00:03:48.579> flat<00:03:49.120> side<00:03:49.449> and<00:03:49.799> basically<00:03:50.799> look

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
pretty nice flat side and basically look

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.819 
pretty nice flat side and basically look
like<00:03:51.189> a<00:03:51.699> 5<00:03:52.389> inch<00:03:52.599> phone<00:03:52.840> but<00:03:53.139> the<00:03:53.409> longer<00:03:53.769> is

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
like a 5 inch phone but the longer is

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.800 
like a 5 inch phone but the longer is
you<00:03:53.949> can<00:03:54.099> see<00:03:54.250> usually<00:03:54.970> 10,000<00:03:55.569> milliamp

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
you can see usually 10,000 milliamp

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.110 
you can see usually 10,000 milliamp
charging<00:03:56.530> capacity<00:03:57.400> so<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:57.669> can<00:03:57.849> use<00:03:57.970> this

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
charging capacity so you can use this

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.339 
charging capacity so you can use this
device<00:03:58.269> your<00:03:58.569> charger<00:03:58.840> phone<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.049> few

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
device your charger phone a few

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.960 
device your charger phone a few
different<00:03:59.650> time<00:03:59.769> of<00:04:00.009> course<00:04:00.430> with<00:04:00.579> 10,000

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
different time of course with 10,000

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.219 
different time of course with 10,000
milliamp<00:04:01.209> you're<00:04:01.449> not<00:04:01.569> gonna<00:04:01.659> get<00:04:01.870> exactly

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:02.229 
milliamp you're not gonna get exactly

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.469 
milliamp you're not gonna get exactly
10,000<00:04:03.040> million<00:04:03.189> output<00:04:03.639> due<00:04:03.819> to<00:04:03.849> efficiency

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:04.479 
10,000 million output due to efficiency

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.379 
10,000 million output due to efficiency
but<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.199> should<00:04:05.379> get<00:04:05.500> between<00:04:05.739> lady<00:04:06.340> 35%<00:04:07.239> out

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
but you should get between lady 35% out

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.360 
but you should get between lady 35% out
that<00:04:07.599> so<00:04:07.810> around<00:04:08.169> 8,000<00:04:08.560> Mariamma<00:04:08.979> so<00:04:09.099> I<00:04:09.220> also

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
that so around 8,000 Mariamma so I also

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.770 
that so around 8,000 Mariamma so I also
like<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.699> fact<00:04:09.729> that<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.180> has<00:04:10.419> this<00:04:10.540> nice

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
like the fact that it has this nice

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.619 
like the fact that it has this nice
little<00:04:10.810> letter<00:04:11.259> design<00:04:11.799> pretty<00:04:12.729> simple<00:04:13.120> it's

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
little letter design pretty simple it's

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.240 
little letter design pretty simple it's
not<00:04:13.780> soft<00:04:14.049> I<00:04:14.229> wish<00:04:14.379> it<00:04:14.500> was<00:04:14.590> actually<00:04:14.889> soft<00:04:15.099> so

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
not soft I wish it was actually soft so

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.469 
not soft I wish it was actually soft so
would<00:04:15.370> be<00:04:15.459> nicer<00:04:15.790> but<00:04:15.909> I<00:04:16.030> think<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.299> tough

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
would be nicer but I think the tough

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.509 
would be nicer but I think the tough
stuff<00:04:16.659> is<00:04:16.810> pretty<00:04:16.989> decent<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.620> also<00:04:17.979> like<00:04:18.310> the

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
stuff is pretty decent I also like the

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.249 
stuff is pretty decent I also like the
adapter<00:04:18.970> cable<00:04:19.269> when<00:04:19.389> I<00:04:19.449> walk<00:04:19.599> pretty<00:04:19.840> well<00:04:20.079> I

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:20.259 
adapter cable when I walk pretty well I

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.320 
adapter cable when I walk pretty well I
don't<00:04:20.650> know<00:04:20.739> uses<00:04:20.979> mi5<00:04:21.430> certify<00:04:21.909> or<00:04:21.970> not<00:04:22.180> by
