stickers the turning of this puzzle is
in<00:00:36.239> fact<00:00:36.510> smoother<00:00:36.960> than<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.200> regular<00:00:37.559> along

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
in fact smoother than the regular along

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.709 
in fact smoother than the regular along
it<00:00:38.219> doesn't<00:00:38.820> feel<00:00:38.910> quite<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.210> buttery<00:00:39.629> and

also faster and less stable than the 57
version<00:00:44.760> making<00:00:45.360> me<00:00:45.450> unsure<00:00:45.629> whether<00:00:45.960> this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
version making me unsure whether this

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.200 
version making me unsure whether this
cue<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.649> good<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:46.950> O<00:00:47.010> age<00:00:47.250> or<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.579> but

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
cue would be good for O age or not but

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.729 
cue would be good for O age or not but
I'm<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.329> really<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.750> know<00:00:48.899> each<00:00:49.050> person<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.710> I

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
I'm not really a know each person so I

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.100 
I'm not really a know each person so I
can't<00:00:50.010> say<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.250> sure<00:00:50.510> core<00:00:51.510> decoding<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.870> past

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
can't say for sure core decoding is past

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.040 
can't say for sure core decoding is past

45 with some force reverses close to a
full<00:00:55.289> piece<00:00:55.579> popping<00:00:56.579> does<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.910> occur

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
full piece popping does not occur

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
full piece popping does not occur
considering<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.719> mechanism<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.289> exactly<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
considering the mechanism is exactly the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.500 
considering the mechanism is exactly the
same<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> 57-millimeter<00:00:59.789> version

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
same as the 57-millimeter version

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.540 
same as the 57-millimeter version
however<00:01:01.230> because<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.250> key<00:01:02.399> was

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
however because of this the key was

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.920 
however because of this the key was
going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> inherit<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> same<00:01:03.480> problem<00:01:03.899> that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
going to inherit the same problem that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.980 
going to inherit the same problem that
the<00:01:04.199> 57-millimeter<00:01:04.739> version<00:01:05.430> had<00:01:05.750> lock<00:01:06.750> ups

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the 57-millimeter version had lock ups

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.330 
the 57-millimeter version had lock ups
are<00:01:07.170> an<00:01:07.290> issue<00:01:07.409> especially<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> last

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
are an issue especially on the last

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
are an issue especially on the last
layer<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.760> expected<00:01:09.180> corner<00:01:10.020> twisting<00:01:10.409> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
layer as expected corner twisting is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.810 
layer as expected corner twisting is
also<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> major<00:01:11.070> problem<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.760> would

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
also a major problem and I would

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.370 
also a major problem and I would
estimate<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.450> happens<00:01:12.750> once<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.170> every

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
estimate that it happens once in every

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.830 
estimate that it happens once in every
25<00:01:13.770> solves<00:01:14.280> I'm<00:01:14.490> sure<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.390> could<00:01:15.540> play<00:01:15.630> with

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
25 solves I'm sure you could play with

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.510 
25 solves I'm sure you could play with
the<00:01:15.930> tensions<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.470> reduce<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.430> may

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the tensions to reduce this but it may

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.670 
the tensions to reduce this but it may
limit<00:01:17.759> corner<00:01:18.090> cutting<00:01:18.270> abilities<00:01:18.750> so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
limit corner cutting abilities so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
limit corner cutting abilities so
overall<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.340> recommend<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.000> mini<00:01:21.150> Oh<00:01:21.210> long

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
overall I do recommend the mini Oh long

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
overall I do recommend the mini Oh long
the<00:01:22.049> turning<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.470> fast<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.040> corner<00:01:23.280> cutting

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the turning is fast the corner cutting

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.070 
the turning is fast the corner cutting
is<00:01:23.640> adequate<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.330> cube<00:01:24.570> doesn't<00:01:24.750> pop

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
is adequate and the cube doesn't pop

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
is adequate and the cube doesn't pop
lock<00:01:25.830> ups<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.250> corner<00:01:26.490> twisting<00:01:26.880> are<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
lock ups and corner twisting are the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.850 
lock ups and corner twisting are the
major<00:01:27.270> problems<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.470> particularly

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
major problems but are not particularly

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.340 
major problems but are not particularly
annoying<00:01:29.460> I'm<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.659> fully<00:01:30.930> sure<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.170> can

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
annoying I'm not fully sure I can

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.020 
annoying I'm not fully sure I can
recommend<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.860> -<00:01:31.950> oh<00:01:31.979> wait<00:01:32.220> sulfur's<00:01:32.700> because

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
recommend it - oh wait sulfur's because

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880 
recommend it - oh wait sulfur's because
of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> unstable<00:01:33.600> feeling<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.799> people

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
of the unstable feeling but to people

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.380 
of the unstable feeling but to people
with<00:01:35.159> small<00:01:35.400> hands<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:35.880> through<00:01:36.090> f3

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
with small hands or through f3

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
with small hands or through f3
collectors<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.380> would<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> good<00:01:37.890> cube<00:01:38.159> for

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
collectors this would be a good cube for

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.719 
collectors this would be a good cube for
you

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.789 
you
so<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:39.630> overall<00:01:39.930> grade<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.259> puzzle<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
so my overall grade on this puzzle is a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.950 
so my overall grade on this puzzle is a
B+<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.360> puzzle<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.780> better
