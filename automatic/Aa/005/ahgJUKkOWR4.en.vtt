another<00:03:21.840> thing<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.230> note<00:03:22.380> about<00:03:22.500> raid<00:03:22.830> 5<00:03:23.100> is

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
another thing to note about raid 5 is

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.520 
another thing to note about raid 5 is
that<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.850> does<00:03:24.030> offer<00:03:24.239> disk<00:03:24.630> hot<00:03:24.840> swapping<00:03:25.320> so

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that it does offer disk hot swapping so

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.140 
that it does offer disk hot swapping so
if<00:03:25.650> there<00:03:25.799> is<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> failure<00:03:26.370> then<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.760> can<00:03:26.970> fix

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
if there is a failure then you can fix

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.060 
if there is a failure then you can fix
it<00:03:27.299> with<00:03:27.330> absolutely<00:03:27.840> zero<00:03:27.959> downtime<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.739> think

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
it with absolutely zero downtime I think

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.130 
it with absolutely zero downtime I think
what<00:03:29.160> we<00:03:29.250> mean<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.549> hots<00:03:29.790> bare<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:30.989> means

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
what we mean is hots bare so that means

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.390 
what we mean is hots bare so that means
you<00:03:31.260> could<00:03:31.350> have<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.500> raid<00:03:31.709> 5<00:03:31.920> with<00:03:32.130> three<00:03:32.310> of

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
you could have a raid 5 with three of

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.710 
you could have a raid 5 with three of
these<00:03:32.519> drives<00:03:32.820> with<00:03:33.060> one<00:03:33.209> assigned<00:03:33.540> as<00:03:33.690> a

these drives with one assigned as a

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.140 
these drives with one assigned as a
permanent<00:03:33.989> hot<00:03:34.350> spare<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.070> second<00:03:35.459> one<00:03:36.030> of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
permanent hot spare so the second one of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.000 
permanent hot spare so the second one of
them<00:03:36.269> dies<00:03:36.510> it'll<00:03:37.049> go<00:03:37.290> ahead<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.739> start

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
them dies it'll go ahead and start

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.449 
them dies it'll go ahead and start
rebuilding<00:03:38.400> itself<00:03:39.330> now<00:03:39.799> obviously<00:03:40.799> at<00:03:41.190> all
