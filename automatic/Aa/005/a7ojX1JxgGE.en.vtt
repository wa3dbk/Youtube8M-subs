00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
about it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.599 
about it
no<00:03:32.419> bar<00:03:32.630> chords<00:03:32.930> involved<00:03:33.320> but<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:34.310> song<00:03:34.489> is

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
no bar chords involved but the song is

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.589 
no bar chords involved but the song is
still<00:03:34.699> very<00:03:35.030> tricky<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.540> get<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.930> the

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
still very tricky to get the the

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.619 
still very tricky to get the the
the<00:03:36.870> swampy<00:03:37.439> bluesy<00:03:38.010> feel<00:03:38.969> that's<00:03:39.269> that's

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
the swampy bluesy feel that's that's

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:41.449 
the swampy bluesy feel that's that's
going<00:03:39.780> on<00:03:39.930> down<00:03:40.170> here<00:03:40.230> now<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.680> subject

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
going on down here now the subject

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.949 
going on down here now the subject
matter<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:41.999> song<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.329> really<00:03:42.420> interesting

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
matter the song is really interesting

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.410 
matter the song is really interesting
because<00:03:43.430> not<00:03:44.430> only<00:03:44.489> does<00:03:44.939> it<00:03:44.999> have<00:03:45.180> this

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
because not only does it have this

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.050 
because not only does it have this
southern<00:03:45.780> feel<00:03:46.049> but<00:03:47.040> Blackwater<00:03:47.909> is

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
southern feel but Blackwater is

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.569 
southern feel but Blackwater is
referring<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.689> Mississippi<00:03:49.230> River<00:03:49.579> which

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
referring to the Mississippi River which

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.729 
referring to the Mississippi River which
was<00:03:50.760> called<00:03:50.999> up<00:03:51.180> even<00:03:51.540> while<00:03:51.989> going<00:03:52.019> way<00:03:52.499> back

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
was called up even while going way back

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.190 
was called up even while going way back
but<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.549> know<00:03:53.819> Pat<00:03:54.120> really<00:03:54.420> felt<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:55.079> this

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
but I know Pat really felt that this

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.399 
but I know Pat really felt that this
song<00:03:55.469> brought<00:03:55.920> up<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.219> brings<00:03:56.370> up<00:03:56.609> images<00:03:57.000> of

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:57.409 
song brought up it brings up images of

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.020 
song brought up it brings up images of
Huckleberry<00:03:58.409> Finn<00:03:58.469> Tom<00:03:59.099> Sawyer<00:03:59.549> and<00:03:59.849> just

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
Huckleberry Finn Tom Sawyer and just

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.360 
Huckleberry Finn Tom Sawyer and just
just<00:04:00.359> life<00:04:00.629> on<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.959> Mississippi<00:04:01.219> through<00:04:02.219> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
just life on the Mississippi through the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.090 
just life on the Mississippi through the
eyes<00:04:02.519> of<00:04:03.260> Mark<00:04:04.260> Twain<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:04.829> it's<00:04:05.159> fascinating

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.800 

Blackwater<00:04:10.100> is<00:04:10.280> done<00:04:10.460> in<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.819> double<00:04:11.300> dropped

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
Blackwater is done in a double dropped

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.750 
Blackwater is done in a double dropped
detuning<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:12.860> need<00:04:13.010> to<00:04:13.100> take<00:04:13.250> your<00:04:13.370> sixth

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
detuning so you need to take your sixth

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.660 
detuning so you need to take your sixth
string<00:04:14.090> down<00:04:14.720> a<00:04:14.750> whole<00:04:15.050> step<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.440> D<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.980> your

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
string down a whole step to D and your

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.699 
string down a whole step to D and your
first<00:04:17.060> string<00:04:17.420> down<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.870> whole<00:04:18.140> step<00:04:18.290> as<00:04:18.560> well

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
first string down a whole step as well

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.640 
first string down a whole step as well
to<00:04:19.040> D<00:04:19.220> now<00:04:19.760> briefly<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:21.079> get<00:04:21.260> there<00:04:21.500> the

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
to D now briefly to get there the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.730 
to D now briefly to get there the
easiest<00:04:21.980> to<00:04:22.340> get<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.580> high<00:04:22.760> D<00:04:23.240> down<00:04:23.930> if<00:04:24.290> your

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
easiest to get the high D down if your

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.640 
easiest to get the high D down if your
ear<00:04:24.890> can<00:04:25.070> hear<00:04:25.250> an<00:04:25.310> octave<00:04:25.990> very<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.620> know

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
ear can hear an octave very you know

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.900 
ear can hear an octave very you know
pretty<00:04:27.919> clearly<00:04:28.190> you<00:04:28.370> can<00:04:28.490> just<00:04:28.640> bring<00:04:28.760> them

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
pretty clearly you can just bring them

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.730 
pretty clearly you can just bring them
both<00:04:29.090> down<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:29.780> they<00:04:29.900> match<00:04:30.169> an<00:04:30.410> octave

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
both down so that they match an octave

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.950 
both down so that they match an octave
away<00:04:31.040> from<00:04:31.280> your<00:04:31.430> fourth<00:04:32.090> string<00:04:32.390> D<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:32.810> it's

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
away from your fourth string D so it's

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.659 
away from your fourth string D so it's
going<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.110> be<00:04:33.200> your<00:04:33.320> reference<00:04:33.680> point<00:04:33.919> but<00:04:34.190> you

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
going to be your reference point but you

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.790 
going to be your reference point but you
can<00:04:34.820> get<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.000> high<00:04:35.150> D<00:04:35.390> very<00:04:35.750> easily<00:04:35.990> but<00:04:36.380> using

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
can get the high D very easily but using

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.090 
can get the high D very easily but using
the<00:04:36.890> third<00:04:37.190> fret<00:04:37.550> of<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:39.020> second<00:04:39.650> string<00:04:39.680> to

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
the third fret of the second string to

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.920 
the third fret of the second string to
give<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.400> d<00:04:40.610> rather<00:04:40.880> than<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.150> fifth<00:04:41.419> fret<00:04:41.720> of

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
give you d rather than the fifth fret of
