play style there are a number of traits
that<00:01:30.440> are<00:01:30.500> related<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.950> endurance<00:01:31.429> and<00:01:31.610> they

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
that are related to endurance and they

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.999

traits<00:01:34.369> are<00:01:34.550> profession<00:01:35.090> specific<00:01:35.720> so

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
traits are profession specific so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.870 
traits are profession specific so
they're<00:01:36.170> not<00:01:36.319> available<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:37.009> everyone<00:01:37.220> the

they're not available to everyone the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.460 
they're not available to everyone the
first<00:01:38.149> are<00:01:38.330> traits<00:01:38.569> that<00:01:38.720> grant<00:01:38.990> benefits

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
first are traits that grant benefits

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.440 
first are traits that grant benefits
when<00:01:39.649> endurance<00:01:40.039> is<00:01:40.160> full<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:41.000> value<00:01:41.390> of

when endurance is full the value of
these<00:01:41.509> traits<00:01:41.929> is<00:01:42.140> going<00:01:42.289> to<00:01:42.349> depend<00:01:42.440> heavily

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
these traits is going to depend heavily

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.190 
these traits is going to depend heavily
on<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.280> rest<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.700> your<00:01:43.789> build<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.300> your<00:01:44.990> play

on the rest of your build and your play
style<00:01:45.500> if<00:01:45.740> you're<00:01:45.890> not<00:01:46.009> dodging<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.670> lot<00:01:46.849> they

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
style if you're not dodging a lot they

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.589 
style if you're not dodging a lot they
may<00:01:47.660> hold<00:01:47.899> some<00:01:48.110> value<00:01:48.170> for<00:01:48.739> you<00:01:49.239> next<00:01:50.239> up<00:01:50.390> are

may hold some value for you next up are

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.330 
may hold some value for you next up are
traits<00:01:50.899> which<00:01:51.110> provide<00:01:51.500> benefit<00:01:52.009> when<00:01:52.190> your

traits which provide benefit when your

endurance is not full somehow I think

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.900 
endurance is not full somehow I think
these<00:01:54.770> are<00:01:54.830> going<00:01:55.039> to<00:01:55.099> be<00:01:55.160> traits<00:01:55.489> I<00:01:55.670> may<00:01:55.849> be

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
these are going to be traits I may be

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.080 
these are going to be traits I may be
interested<00:01:56.509> in<00:01:56.630> for<00:01:56.810> my<00:01:56.959> warrior<00:01:58.090> these

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
interested in for my warrior these

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.699 
interested in for my warrior these
traits<00:01:59.420> increase<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.020> rate<00:02:00.200> of<00:02:00.229> endurance

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
traits increase the rate of endurance

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.710 
traits increase the rate of endurance
regeneration<00:02:01.310> most<00:02:01.970> cases<00:02:02.209> I<00:02:02.390> think<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:02.630> can

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
regeneration most cases I think we can

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.719 
regeneration most cases I think we can
expect<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.200> ten<00:02:03.410> percent<00:02:03.560> improvement<00:02:03.979> those

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729

expect a ten percent improvement those

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069

directly but rather restore some

don't<00:02:42.720> forget<00:02:43.200> keep<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.250> endurance<00:02:44.670> level

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
don't forget keep that endurance level
