introduction to the average consumer in
India<00:01:55.980> clearly<00:01:56.980> from<00:01:57.130> a<00:01:57.190> ease-of-use

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
India clearly from a ease-of-use

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.280 
India clearly from a ease-of-use
perspective<00:01:58.390> people<00:01:58.810> find<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.230> very

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
perspective people find it very

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.620 
perspective people find it very
interesting<00:01:59.770> it's<00:02:00.550> definitely<00:02:00.850> more<00:02:01.210> easy<00:02:01.420> to

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
interesting it's definitely more easy to

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.680 
interesting it's definitely more easy to
use<00:02:01.870> then<00:02:02.230> other<00:02:02.830> products<00:02:03.340> that<00:02:03.460> they<00:02:03.550> were

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
use then other products that they were

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.980 
use then other products that they were
familiar<00:02:04.690> with<00:02:04.780> before<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:06.310> cost<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:06.820> high<00:02:07.240> so

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
familiar with before the cost is high so

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
familiar with before the cost is high so
it's<00:02:08.140> going<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.319> be<00:02:08.440> interesting<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.979> see<00:02:09.250> how

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
it's going to be interesting to see how

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.230 
it's going to be interesting to see how
it's<00:02:10.300> going<00:02:10.509> to<00:02:10.600> really<00:02:10.780> take<00:02:11.140> off

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
it's going to really take off

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.990 
it's going to really take off
and<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.450> think<00:02:12.810> until<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.200> cost<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:14.000> reduced

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and I think until the cost is reduced

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.500 
and I think until the cost is reduced
and<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:15.810> available<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.620> consumers<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.370> a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
and it's available to the consumers at a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.390 
and it's available to the consumers at a
reasonable<00:02:18.510> price<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:19.560> may<00:02:19.770> be<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.980> barrier

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
reasonable price that may be a barrier

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.460 
reasonable price that may be a barrier
may<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.880> challenge<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.570> then<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> third

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
may be a challenge and then the third

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.900 
may be a challenge and then the third
aspect<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.130> from<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.520> content

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
aspect of it is from a content

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.150 
aspect of it is from a content
consumption<00:02:24.300> perspective<00:02:25.110> again<00:02:25.710> an<00:02:25.830> average

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
consumption perspective again an average

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.640 
consumption perspective again an average
consumer<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.670> India<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.720> really<00:02:28.110> consuming

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
consumer in India is really consuming
