think that it would allow me to slow the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.890 
think that it would allow me to slow the
course<00:02:50.310> down<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.790> take<00:02:51.239> it<00:02:51.269> more<00:02:51.570> at<00:02:51.630> my<00:02:51.750> own

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
course down and take it more at my own

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.990 
course down and take it more at my own
pace<00:02:52.140> because<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.950> really<00:02:53.100> helps<00:02:53.280> me<00:02:53.700> to

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
pace because that really helps me to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000 
pace because that really helps me to
make<00:02:54.570> sure<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.750> understand<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.350> material<00:02:55.860> and
