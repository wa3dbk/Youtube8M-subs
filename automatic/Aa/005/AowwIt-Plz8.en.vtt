00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
I didn't really enjoy doing this I just

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.350 
I didn't really enjoy doing this I just
felt<00:05:30.260> like<00:05:30.380> I<00:05:30.800> couldn't<00:05:31.310> find<00:05:31.850> the<00:05:32.330> right

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
felt like I couldn't find the right

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.820 
felt like I couldn't find the right
places<00:05:32.960> for<00:05:33.169> everything<00:05:33.800> just<00:05:34.090> constantly

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
places for everything just constantly

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.379 
places for everything just constantly
didn't<00:05:36.830> know<00:05:36.949> where<00:05:37.160> to<00:05:37.280> put<00:05:37.460> anything<00:05:37.910> I

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
didn't know where to put anything I

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.409 
didn't know where to put anything I
constantly<00:05:39.139> changed<00:05:39.650> my<00:05:39.800> mind<00:05:40.099> on<00:05:40.460> what<00:05:40.940> type

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
constantly changed my mind on what type

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.719 
constantly changed my mind on what type
of<00:05:41.449> organization<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:42.440> wanted<00:05:42.740> to<00:05:42.860> do<00:05:43.009> I<00:05:43.340> started

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
of organization I wanted to do I started

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.520 
of organization I wanted to do I started
with<00:05:44.539> author<00:05:45.639> organization<00:05:46.639> and<00:05:47.030> then<00:05:47.449> I<00:05:47.960> went

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
with author organization and then I went

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.760 
with author organization and then I went
into<00:05:48.979> color<00:05:49.729> coordination<00:05:50.449> and<00:05:51.110> I<00:05:51.320> figured

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
into color coordination and I figured

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.159 
into color coordination and I figured
not--that's<00:05:52.460> know<00:05:53.150> I'm<00:05:53.360> gonna<00:05:53.570> get<00:05:53.750> tired<00:05:53.990> of

anything<00:05:59.990> so<00:06:01.150> there<00:06:02.150> probably<00:06:02.240> will<00:06:02.900> be

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
anything so there probably will be
