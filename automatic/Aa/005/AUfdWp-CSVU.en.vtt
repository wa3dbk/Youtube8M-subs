00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 Memories of Gunpla Kit Review Collection Mobile Suit Gundam Mobile Suit Variation 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.010
 ms 06 r zaku 2 black three star specification model 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.150
 ms 06 r Zaku ii and plastic model planning 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.590
 It is said that it is a symbol of this series that appeared in Mobile Suit Gundam Mobile Suit variation 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.050
 Be a mobile suit 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:25.050
 Daaa 1/60 scale kit of the ms 06 r is this simple kit 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.849
 The black plastic model that just swept the gun plastic boom 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.290
 The 1/60 scale was right at the same time that the intimacy was not a level. 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.090
 That was released in the kit by the time the value mobile suit variation in the real had been raised up to 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.050
 Whether such because of the popularity Nde 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.040
 I have never seen them selling at the store back then- they were mostly in Gunpla 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.579
 The plastic model list certainly answers 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:51.079
 It's funny there's something like a twisted neck 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.149
 What I asked the aunt of the haunt of toy store and I is Toka high school students go to buy 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.839
 Jan foul say high school students 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:02.570
 What an image I thought of being a high school student wearing something 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:06.450
 It looks like you'll see in the eye how you're winning with a face that is Furabayashi volcano or golden dog or spatula 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:11.520
 It appeared in black plastic model sunset in black clothes, but seems to match 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.990
 I think it may be a news item if a recent child listens to something, but the tomb in the country is a high school high school student 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.710
 How is this 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.130
 If you put your lunch on your desk, you will be eaten during the rest time 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.460
 Naa ze is tangled absolute When I was Nante quiet reading 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.010
 Oh you, such sure to also co-rotated on the way back if you do not have A 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.430
 Hey wrong 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.420
 Or take over the family business since there really Nante employment in the near field 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.380
 It's because I have no choice but to become a local government official or join the SDF 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:43.350
 Those who want to find a job in a big city are aiming for a higher school a little higher 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:46.030
 It is true that there are a lot of people who are already working at this time. 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.610
 For Gakincho, it was an adult existence. 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.159
 The general public of adults these days the way Bakayaro by Ne Ja do buy Nante Gundam is the geta 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.190
 There were a lot of people wearing it, of course 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.320
 It is natural cupboard also I also girl shoebox 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.060
 Attach the string and remote control 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.049
 How did you fly like Titaro 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.910
 This kit was released in October 1983 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:14.489
 The price of the fit is 2500 yen, saying that it is the same price as Tom and Gerugug 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.209
 So you could buy finally also from me also to Tokyo 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.209
 Yeah I thing were asked to clean packed in Yamashiroya in Ueno 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.200
 Tokai 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.240
 Suddenly , 4 was caught in the waiting for the cash register with the grandchild 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.470
 Is this the one in downtown Shikasan or me? 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:39.600
 Yeah it became I'll and grandmother Pegira like a face to say Nante 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.260
 People who look around and all of them hanging around at the hobby corner of Yamashiroya are all such people 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.600
 From 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.700
 If you do n't know pedia, maybe you know 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.720
 There are many days when kit contents are improved than the early 1/60 series- 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.500
 Overall stout proportions the mold leaving that are increasing significant amount 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.610
 What 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:02.690
 It was not something that was completely disgusting, but a good amount of sense made it sound tense 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.380
 I'm also glad that the fist I took in the idiot became smaller and the toy character disappeared and became real 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.530
 Hey 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.490
 Even if it is neither erg nor a person has a bellows structure 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.150
 Zach machine gun that was sharp and increased dramatically was the best cutaway thing 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.890
 The 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.120
 Those who paint Zaku Machine Gun in JNR color are greatly affected by this aircraft, Zaku 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.600
 Bazooka goes without saying 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.100
 Mountains without heat hawk 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.350
 It was a year 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:30.000
 Annual the toppling of the things I also buy separately by wheat 9 are reproduced'm not Kawan 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.050
 If the mono-eye look is just a film, don't turn on the decal directly on the film 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.700
 It is a specification to stick 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:40.120
 Also it got to wobbly to rest Ne was wreck by Thats Ne meaning of the movable gimmick 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:44.600
 It's such a place you want to keep up against a bookcase and the crab It is in this kit there is a school bag 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:51.100
 There were a lot of parts, so I chose a place to decorate. 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.100
 I probably I who decorated on 3 Kisoroe than Toka remodeling's a realistic
