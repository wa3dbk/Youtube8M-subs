well<00:00:03.090> here<00:00:03.330> we<00:00:03.449> are<00:00:03.480> on<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.870> thirty-first<00:00:04.290> of

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
well here we are on the thirty-first of

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.190 
well here we are on the thirty-first of
August<00:00:05.130> as<00:00:05.400> harvest<00:00:06.029> log<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.629> think<00:00:06.930> it's<00:00:07.049> day

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
August as harvest log I think it's day

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.400 
August as harvest log I think it's day
24<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.480> we've<00:00:09.480> moved<00:00:09.870> from<00:00:10.170> wheat

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
24 and we've moved from wheat

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.620 
24 and we've moved from wheat
temporarily<00:00:11.160> into<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.670> winter<00:00:12.030> beans<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.599> a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
temporarily into the winter beans is a

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.430 
temporarily into the winter beans is a
crop<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:12.990> wizard<00:00:13.380> which<00:00:13.590> means<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:15.440> the

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
crop of wizard which means and the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.320 
crop of wizard which means and the
reason<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.949> really<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.060> try<00:00:18.300> and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
reason for that really is to try and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.120 
reason for that really is to try and
give<00:00:18.539> them<00:00:18.750> wings<00:00:18.779> another<00:00:19.260> day<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> dry

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
give them wings another day to dry

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429 
give them wings another day to dry
before<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.699> go<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.000> cut<00:00:21.270> some<00:00:21.539> week<00:00:22.170> there's

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
before we go and cut some week there's

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.700 
before we go and cut some week there's
probably<00:00:22.800> too<00:00:23.100> wet<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:24.210> cut<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.840> around

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
probably too wet to cut this is around

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.830 
probably too wet to cut this is around
twenty<00:00:26.310> percent<00:00:26.609> 19<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.269> half<00:00:27.300> twenty

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
twenty percent 19 and a half twenty

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.410 
twenty percent 19 and a half twenty
percent<00:00:28.109> moisture<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.760> take<00:00:30.000> sort<00:00:30.359> of

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
percent moisture and we can take sort of

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.459 
percent moisture and we can take sort of
three<00:00:30.720> or<00:00:30.810> four<00:00:31.019> percent<00:00:31.410> out<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.070> beans

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
three or four percent out of the beans

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.770 
three or four percent out of the beans
varia-<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.829> lower<00:00:35.040> yield<00:00:35.460> per<00:00:35.820> hectare<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.630> that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
varia- a lower yield per hectare so that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.630 
varia- a lower yield per hectare so that
is<00:00:36.989> running<00:00:37.350> around<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.129> sort<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.370> four

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
is running around that sort of four

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.959 
is running around that sort of four
tonnes<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.090> hectare<00:00:39.510> Mar<00:00:40.280> go<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.460> jumping<00:00:41.850> out

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
tonnes a hectare Mar go that jumping out

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.840 
tonnes a hectare Mar go that jumping out
of<00:00:42.090> there<00:00:42.440> then<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.649> also<00:00:43.800> got<00:00:44.100> less<00:00:44.280> material

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
of there then we also got less material

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
of there then we also got less material
to<00:00:45.000> put<00:00:45.149> through<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> dryer<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.079> means<00:00:46.320> that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
to put through the dryer it means that

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.290 
to put through the dryer it means that
the<00:00:46.829> wheat<00:00:47.070> instead<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.610> being<00:00:47.850> twenty

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
the wheat instead of being twenty

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.990 
the wheat instead of being twenty
percent<00:00:48.629> when<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.190> tomorrow

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
percent when we get to it tomorrow

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.290 
percent when we get to it tomorrow
hopefully<00:00:51.600> will<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.170> sort<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.760> 1819<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.120> can

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
hopefully will be sort of 1819 so we can

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.880 
hopefully will be sort of 1819 so we can
get<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.660> through<00:00:55.280> a<00:00:56.280> little<00:00:57.059> bit<00:00:57.090> faster<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
get that through a little bit faster a

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.319 
get that through a little bit faster a
little<00:00:58.890> bit<00:00:59.219> more<00:01:00.090> cheaply<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:01.079> well<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.059> it's

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
little bit more cheaply as well so it's

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.870 
little bit more cheaply as well so it's
not<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> bad<00:01:03.899> crop<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.409> beans<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:05.640> very

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
not a bad crop of beans it's very very

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.240 
not a bad crop of beans it's very very
weedy<00:01:06.119> underneath

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.750 

just<00:01:11.470> as<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.620> trouble<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.010> herbicides<00:01:13.520> on

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
just as the trouble the herbicides on

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.370 
just as the trouble the herbicides on
themes<00:01:14.060> its<00:01:14.390> source<00:01:14.600> imaging<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.200> things

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
themes its source imaging and things

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.130 
themes its source imaging and things
like<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:15.590> have<00:01:16.220> been<00:01:16.490> withdrawn<00:01:17.060> trying<00:01:17.990> to

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
like that have been withdrawn trying to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.969 
like that have been withdrawn trying to
get<00:01:18.320> them<00:01:18.530> clean<00:01:18.890> is<00:01:19.180> really<00:01:20.180> really<00:01:20.979> hard

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
get them clean is really really hard

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.390 
get them clean is really really hard
work<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.150> there's<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.420> lot<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:24.350> lot<00:01:25.310> of

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
work so there's a lot of a lot of

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.080 
work so there's a lot of a lot of
rubbish<00:01:26.979> well<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.070> can<00:01:28.220> see<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.520> there's<00:01:29.030> a

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
rubbish well you can see that there's a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.060 
rubbish well you can see that there's a
lot<00:01:29.210> of<00:01:29.270> rubbish<00:01:29.630> going<00:01:29.960> into<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.320> into<00:01:30.950> the

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
lot of rubbish going into the into the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.430 
lot of rubbish going into the into the
tank<00:01:31.340> there<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.570> that's<00:01:32.750> why<00:01:32.900> we'll<00:01:33.200> clean

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
tank there but that's why we'll clean

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.010 
tank there but that's why we'll clean
that<00:01:33.650> out<00:01:33.830> I<00:01:34.390> suppose<00:01:35.390> you<00:01:35.510> could<00:01:35.630> argue<00:01:35.690> it's

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
that out I suppose you could argue it's

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.200 
that out I suppose you could argue it's
better<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.650> tank<00:01:36.920> and<00:01:37.160> in<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.670> yard<00:01:37.910> and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
better in the tank and in the yard and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.300 
better in the tank and in the yard and
on<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.390> fire<00:01:38.690> then<00:01:39.380> going<00:01:39.590> back<00:01:39.800> on<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:39.979> ground

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
on a fire then going back on the ground

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.190 
on a fire then going back on the ground
but<00:01:41.770> that's<00:01:42.770> where<00:01:43.070> we<00:01:43.220> are<00:01:43.250> really<00:01:44.170> been<00:01:45.170> a

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
but that's where we are really been a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.290 
but that's where we are really been a
frustrating<00:01:45.470> few<00:01:46.070> days<00:01:46.509> heavy<00:01:47.509> rain<00:01:47.840> and

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
frustrating few days heavy rain and

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.969 
frustrating few days heavy rain and
we're<00:01:50.300> lucky<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.570> be<00:01:50.750> going<00:01:50.899> really<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:51.800> good

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
we're lucky to be going really it's good

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.440 
we're lucky to be going really it's good
that<00:01:52.160> we've<00:01:52.310> got<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.490> great<00:01:52.729> cock<00:01:52.970> like<00:01:53.149> beans

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
that we've got a great cock like beans

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.060 
that we've got a great cock like beans
to<00:01:53.750> sort<00:01:53.930> of<00:01:53.990> spread<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.350> harvest<00:01:54.800> and<00:01:55.009> a

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
to sort of spread the harvest and a

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.820 
to sort of spread the harvest and a
nihilist<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:56.600> sort<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.899> jump<00:01:57.110> around<00:01:57.470> we've

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
nihilist the sort of jump around we've

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.340 
nihilist the sort of jump around we've
got<00:01:57.979> 50<00:01:58.310> hectares<00:01:58.750> we<00:01:59.750> probably<00:01:59.930> won't<00:02:00.110> get<00:02:00.289> it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
got 50 hectares we probably won't get it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.010 
got 50 hectares we probably won't get it
all<00:02:00.560> done<00:02:00.770> tonight<00:02:01.539> so<00:02:02.539> there'll<00:02:02.750> be<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.869> little

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
all done tonight so there'll be a little

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.800 
all done tonight so there'll be a little
bit<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.380> do<00:02:03.500> in<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.710> morning<00:02:03.940> before<00:02:04.940> we<00:02:05.390> move

bit to do in the morning before we move

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.749 
bit to do in the morning before we move
into<00:02:06.020> wheat<00:02:07.869> for<00:02:08.869> for<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> few<00:02:09.860> days<00:02:10.009> we<00:02:10.310> still

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
into wheat for for a few days we still

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.190 
into wheat for for a few days we still
got<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:10.910> bit<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.120> spring<00:02:11.330> valley<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.810> cuttin<00:02:12.110> up

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
got a bit of spring valley to cuttin up

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.289 
got a bit of spring valley to cuttin up
on<00:02:12.320> the<00:02:12.440> hill<00:02:12.640> but<00:02:13.640> we'll<00:02:13.760> need<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.030> get<00:02:14.180> that

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
on the hill but we'll need to get that

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.140 
on the hill but we'll need to get that
down<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> less<00:02:15.110> than<00:02:15.260> sixteen<00:02:15.650> percent

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
down to a less than sixteen percent

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.150 
down to a less than sixteen percent
ideally<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.470> we<00:02:18.530> can't<00:02:18.709> even<00:02:18.890> straight

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
ideally so that we can't even straight

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.660 
ideally so that we can't even straight
up<00:02:19.340> in<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.580> shed<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.540> moment

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
up in the shed the moment

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.720 
up in the shed the moment
we<00:02:22.209> haven't<00:02:22.450> got<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.690> space<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.230> dry<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
we haven't got the space to dry the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.250 
we haven't got the space to dry the
barley<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.240> play<00:02:25.420> straight<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> floor<00:02:26.520> so

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
barley and play straight on the floor so

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.979 
barley and play straight on the floor so
we<00:02:29.260> till<00:02:29.770> we<00:02:29.860> get<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> bit<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.989> tipple

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
we till we get a bit of the tipple

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.550 
we till we get a bit of the tipple
shifted<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.650> we<00:02:32.860> we<00:02:33.310> combine<00:02:34.380> pool<00:02:35.380> earlier

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
shifted that we we combine pool earlier

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.760 
shifted that we we combine pool earlier
in<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.980> week<00:02:36.160> I<00:02:36.310> suppose<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.700> was<00:02:37.200> right<00:02:38.200> so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
in the week I suppose it was right so

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.030 
in the week I suppose it was right so
that's<00:02:39.100> where<00:02:39.310> we<00:02:39.430> are<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.500> stay<00:02:41.500> tuned<00:02:41.830> to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
that's where we are and stay tuned to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.200 
that's where we are and stay tuned to
see<00:02:42.640> how<00:02:43.090> we<00:02:43.150> are<00:02:43.630> progressing
