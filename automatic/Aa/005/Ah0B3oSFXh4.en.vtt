00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.850
 juliana walking with another video lesson 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.230
 for the website the study class portal 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.490
 very hot spot 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.240
 and in this video we 'll be talking 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.000
 A little about print media is when 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.220
 I deal with talking about bidis in css 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.810
 I'm talking about a means of access 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.399
 how so imagine if I did not find the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.840
 pec on page back praying print 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.489
 on own website ok 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.309
 this is a means of access is accessing 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.450
 here via a print form 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.370
 OK 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.450
 or am I visualizing how it will 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.890
 get the impression 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.750
 only when you perform 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.360
 print google chrome that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.070
 automatically removes all 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.809
 background that I then put to this 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.629
 you have to have is this can be 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.460
 worked on css as he learns is a 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.899
 collective background pattern design 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.989
 What other things here that you can 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.420
 to withdraw soon or of the case here I could 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.970
 very well take away - this would not have 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.320
 no need but how not to go back 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.580
 to use my site as an example 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.710
 let's close here is using a 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.290
 lean document but first of all 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.090
 for you who likes work supports 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.840
 always proportion video exit all 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.240
 days goes in there study grows dot com 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.210
 goes down there and gives a short 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 You suck the continuity of the 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.810
 our work 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.700
 beauty then already close here have not here 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.950
 ss is happening here will not change 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.520
 to 000 you see it's working 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.439
 wonder it is already being loaded 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:55.649
 hockey as fff the bari background 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:02:00.810
 here i have a link or pee hfcs css 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.770
 in the middle this interesting guy in the middle 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.170
 access 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.280
 when I put media access screen 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.039
 I'm saying this is going to be here. 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.530
 accessed by a screen a screen then by 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.440
 computer screens 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.990
 notebooks and mobile 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.550
 Finally, the whole range of 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.250
 screen devices that we call 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.320
 rock projection are 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.260
 projection with its own name already says 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.080
 projectors translating the lane still 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.160
 brian we have some others who 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.810
 you can explore several of the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.670
 in my opinion this rock and 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.340
 people have another one still very nice 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.040
 called print or that is when the 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.510
 have the same print access 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.520
 so when will you print the page? 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.920
 you can filter the contents of 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.510
 silver printing offering the best 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.560
 possible experience for your user 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.300
 uac so wonder if you want it 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.270
 is compatible to be interpreted 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.340
 same way for all case devices 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.730
 all devices - then accesses 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.370
 You put some even coming 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.160
 default if you remove it here the media 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.370
 is by default as beauty or 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.860
 Everyone is here and I'm going to use it. 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.489
 just screen like any one pc that 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.790
 wonder is 5 to 1 against op 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.340
 will also continue the same thing now 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.709
 if I, for example, saw that I have h1 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.330
 change the color of this h1 aquino style 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.739
 color 0 will be f5 change the color blue 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.510
 if I give a control p the color still 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.400
 because it 's because I 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.430
 I have specified this hence that style 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.980
 and will only be applied to the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.870
 access screen then that's what I'm 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.320
 watching here when you played against 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.640
 P 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.120
 google chrome simulates for me 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.590
 print model automatically 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.489
 then this print model would already be 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.440
 without that in css right then basically 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.390
 here it is still black 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.730
 because a css was not loaded because 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.590
 is not the kind of media you have and 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.890
 This is very cool and when I put it 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.180
 I close the kibon against f5 I update 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.760
 gift against op 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.070
 he stays in case that means that the 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.590
 island is for all means of access 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.870
 available to the device all types of 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.530
 so that you can see that 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.450
 the same style that is affected in my 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.630
 document via screen 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.950
 it is also affected via print and this is 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.140
 very interesting is for you 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.460
 would work filtering offer as already 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.830
 I spoke the best experience for the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.270
 user then the more you can 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.880
 working on content delivery 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.950
 filtered from your user and becomes very 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.200
 great very good 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.880
 for example if you film goes there to 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.150
 filter your entire site as the user 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.670
 will print an article and you filter the 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.100
 content on this site is so you withdraw 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.230
 all unattractive and really focus on 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.720
 article user instead of seeing all that 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.060
 poet site all that that information 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.610
 unnecessary polluting the sight of him 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.740
 will see only your article so if this 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.690
 You, that way you can do it. 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.920
 offer a great experience 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.820
 because the user 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.280
 Okay, so here I've commented one 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.820
 another css that I have here since it is the 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:22.750
 print dots and ss is the css I created 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:26.530
 generic and the only difference is that 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.540
 I put print, that is when 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.480
 Found the foot here, I'll do it. 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.520
 changes which only influenced the 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.230
 means of print access or just one 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.480
 printed document 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.130
 so I have to lose points and ss 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.710
 comment the line, look, I just downloaded 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.320
 another css just to deal with it 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:48.580
 so I separated I made two layers this 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.300
 this organization is very nice and 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:56.170
 here for example let's give the h1 color 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:58.000
 for orange hours of f5 woke up to 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.570
 Gaucho is not orange but is a 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.490
 op 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:05.260
 wake up one turned orange then see 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:08.380
 that I can influence is in the case I 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.520
 I can make distinctions right then it was 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.020
 This is what I wanted to show 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.900
 I hope you liked it. 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.360
 enjoy sharing share why 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.500
 here is knowledge and leave that strong 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.500
 hug and until a next
