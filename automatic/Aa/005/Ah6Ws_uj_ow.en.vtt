right
removable<00:00:45.140> it's<00:00:45.710> always<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.070> more

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
removable it's always the more

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.290 
removable it's always the more
interesting<00:00:46.700> part<00:00:46.910> let's<00:00:47.090> talk<00:00:47.180> about

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
interesting part let's talk about

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.060 
interesting part let's talk about
removal<00:00:47.720> for<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:47.900> second<00:00:48.260> there's<00:00:48.890> three

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
removal for a second there's three

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.380 
removal for a second there's three
different<00:00:49.340> ways<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:49.579> can<00:00:49.700> remove<00:00:49.940> this<00:00:50.120> case

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
different ways you can remove this case

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.990 
different ways you can remove this case
for<00:00:51.200> me<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.800> simplest<00:00:52.160> way<00:00:52.310> I<00:00:52.340> remove<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:52.880> I

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
for me the simplest way I remove it is I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.970 
for me the simplest way I remove it is I
put<00:00:53.180> my<00:00:53.300> fingers<00:00:53.600> on<00:00:53.750> this<00:00:53.810> back<00:00:54.020> corner<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:54.650> I

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
put my fingers on this back corner and I

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.380 
put my fingers on this back corner and I
reach<00:00:55.160> it<00:00:55.340> on<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.520> sides<00:00:55.760> here<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:56.150> get<00:00:56.360> a

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
reach it on the sides here and get a

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.880 
reach it on the sides here and get a
little<00:00:56.600> bit<00:00:56.810> of<00:00:56.930> grip<00:00:57.110> on<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.380> sides<00:00:57.590> and

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
little bit of grip on the sides and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.010 
little bit of grip on the sides and
literally<00:00:58.520> just<00:00:58.700> kind<00:00:58.850> of<00:00:58.970> flex<00:00:59.239> it<00:00:59.450> and<00:00:59.630> the

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
literally just kind of flex it and the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.780 
literally just kind of flex it and the
same<00:01:00.170> thing<00:01:00.380> on<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.590> front<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:01.190> it'll<00:01:01.430> slide

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
same thing on the front and it'll slide

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.179 
same thing on the front and it'll slide
right<00:01:02.090> off<00:01:02.410> so<00:01:03.410> that's<00:01:03.590> one<00:01:03.739> way<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:03.890> can<00:01:04.070> get

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
right off so that's one way you can get

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.280 
right off so that's one way you can get
the<00:01:04.309> top<00:01:04.489> off<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:05.570> other<00:01:05.720> way<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:05.930> get<00:01:06.170> the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
the top off the other way you get the

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.930 
the top off the other way you get the
bottom<00:01:06.560> off<00:01:06.650> is<00:01:06.830> kind<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.100> same<00:01:07.280> way<00:01:07.430> you

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
bottom off is kind of the same way you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.550 
bottom off is kind of the same way you
can<00:01:08.090> literally<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:08.600> press<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.020> corners<00:01:09.380> off

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
can literally just press the corners off

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.730 
can literally just press the corners off
and<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.520> case<00:01:10.700> will<00:01:10.850> literally<00:01:11.120> come<00:01:11.360> out<00:01:11.510> off

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
and the case will literally come out off

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.230 
and the case will literally come out off
you'll<00:01:12.740> see<00:01:12.979> that<00:01:13.130> there's<00:01:13.340> some<00:01:13.520> really<00:01:13.820> tiny

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
you'll see that there's some really tiny

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.010 
you'll see that there's some really tiny
micro<00:01:15.200> snaps<00:01:15.590> in<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.220> corners<00:01:16.640> here<00:01:17.510> and<00:01:17.690> here

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
micro snaps in the corners here and here

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.750 
micro snaps in the corners here and here
and<00:01:18.770> then<00:01:18.950> there's<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.159> couple<00:01:19.400> of<00:01:19.610> other

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
and then there's a couple of other

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.219 
and then there's a couple of other
little<00:01:19.940> snaps<00:01:20.299> as<00:01:20.510> you<00:01:20.600> look<00:01:20.750> around<00:01:20.840> there's

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
little snaps as you look around there's

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.780 
little snaps as you look around there's
another<00:01:21.440> one<00:01:21.620> here<00:01:21.890> then<00:01:22.310> another<00:01:22.549> one<00:01:22.760> here

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
another one here then another one here

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.870 
another one here then another one here
so<00:01:23.510> four<00:01:23.840> snaps<00:01:24.170> on<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.440> bottom<00:01:24.799> on<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.850> top

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
so four snaps on the bottom on the top

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.730 
so four snaps on the bottom on the top
case<00:01:26.360> if<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.659> look<00:01:26.840> really<00:01:26.990> closely<00:01:27.290> as<00:01:27.650> you

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
case if you look really closely as you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.080 
case if you look really closely as you
look<00:01:27.890> at<00:01:28.010> that<00:01:28.190> you'll<00:01:28.370> see<00:01:28.430> there's<00:01:28.760> one

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
look at that you'll see there's one

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.180 
look at that you'll see there's one
that's<00:01:29.330> right<00:01:29.540> above<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.960> iSight<00:01:30.530> camera<00:01:31.010> and

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
that's right above the iSight camera and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.250 
that's right above the iSight camera and
then<00:01:31.670> two<00:01:31.880> snaps<00:01:32.240> on<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.450> either<00:01:32.720> side<00:01:32.960> so

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
then two snaps on the either side so
