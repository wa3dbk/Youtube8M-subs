so<00:01:44.520> as<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.090> said<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.450> frame<00:01:45.689> rates<00:01:45.960> he<00:01:46.110> kind<00:01:46.439> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
so as I said for frame rates he kind of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.289 
so as I said for frame rates he kind of
does<00:01:46.770> hit<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.369> takes<00:01:47.549> me<00:01:47.670> down<00:01:47.909> about<00:01:48.270> a

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
does hit you it takes me down about a

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.899 
does hit you it takes me down about a
good<00:01:48.570> 20<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.950> good<00:01:50.159> processor<00:01:50.700> so

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
good 20 but I have a good processor so

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.730 
good 20 but I have a good processor so
it<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.329> doesn't<00:01:51.720> matter<00:01:51.810> too<00:01:52.170> much

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it really doesn't matter too much

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.030 
it really doesn't matter too much
there's<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> overhead<00:01:54.240> panel

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
there's the overhead panel

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.640 
there's the overhead panel
up<00:01:55.280> there<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.080> while<00:01:57.260> we're<00:01:57.440> just<00:01:57.560> gonna

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
up there and so while we're just gonna

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.470 
up there and so while we're just gonna
do<00:01:57.830> a<00:01:57.860> quick<00:01:58.070> take<00:01:58.370> off<00:01:58.550> so<00:01:58.820> we<00:01:58.940> can<00:01:59.090> see<00:01:59.300> in

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
do a quick take off so we can see in

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.460 
do a quick take off so we can see in
here<00:01:59.690> everything<00:01:59.990> I've<00:02:00.110> never<00:02:00.290> actually

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
here everything I've never actually

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.230 
here everything I've never actually
tethered<00:02:00.950> oh<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:01.640> doesn't<00:02:01.850> look<00:02:02.030> cool

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
tethered oh this doesn't look cool

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.150 
tethered oh this doesn't look cool
whatever<00:02:03.020> actually<00:02:03.290> looked<00:02:03.620> back<00:02:03.800> here<00:02:04.040> to

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
whatever actually looked back here to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.640 
whatever actually looked back here to
see<00:02:04.310> what<00:02:04.490> uh<00:02:04.990> touched<00:02:05.990> anything<00:02:06.290> so<00:02:06.530> that

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
see what uh touched anything so that

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.880 
see what uh touched anything so that
happens<00:02:07.010> you<00:02:07.940> couldn't<00:02:08.300> open<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.890> because

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
happens you couldn't open that because

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.860 
happens you couldn't open that because
the<00:02:10.040> fire<00:02:10.250> extinguisher<00:02:10.790> would<00:02:10.910> go<00:02:11.090> off<00:02:11.270> and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
the fire extinguisher would go off and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.650 
the fire extinguisher would go off and
as<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:12.860> said<00:02:13.100> it's<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:13.460> it's<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:14.150> realistic<00:02:14.450> a

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
as I said it's just it's so realistic a

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.550 
as I said it's just it's so realistic a
good<00:02:14.870> there's<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.200> fold<00:02:15.470> out<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.950> does<00:02:16.330> nice

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
good there's this fold out it does nice

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.500 
good there's this fold out it does nice
you<00:02:18.560> know<00:02:18.650> I<00:02:18.680> said<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.040> could<00:02:19.190> open<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:20.390> I'm

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
you know I said that could open but I'm

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.930 
you know I said that could open but I'm
so<00:02:20.720> we're<00:02:20.930> actually<00:02:21.020> gonna<00:02:21.230> do<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.800> take<00:02:22.760> off

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
so we're actually gonna do a take off

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.790 
so we're actually gonna do a take off
from<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.660> angle<00:02:23.840> only<00:02:24.170> way<00:02:24.350> I<00:02:24.500> want<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.710> show

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
from this angle only way I want to show

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.220 
from this angle only way I want to show
you<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> flaps<00:02:25.220> first<00:02:25.550> take<00:02:25.940> off<00:02:26.090> flaps<00:02:26.360> make

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
you the flaps first take off flaps make

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.360 
you the flaps first take off flaps make
sure<00:02:27.380> they're<00:02:27.500> all<00:02:27.590> absolutely<00:02:27.740> so<00:02:28.160> look<00:02:28.310> a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
sure they're all absolutely so look a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.770 
sure they're all absolutely so look a
little<00:02:28.490> way<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.880> wings<00:02:29.060> move<00:02:29.300> on<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.540> flap

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
little way the wings move on the flap

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.280 
little way the wings move on the flap
and<00:02:30.220> they<00:02:31.220> sound<00:02:31.520> they<00:02:32.240> just<00:02:32.480> sound<00:02:32.690> good<00:02:33.020> they

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
and they sound they just sound good they

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.480 
and they sound they just sound good they
look<00:02:33.500> good<00:02:33.650> when<00:02:33.830> they<00:02:33.950> come<00:02:34.160> out<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.340> don't

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
look good when they come out I don't

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.790 
look good when they come out I don't
know<00:02:34.700> why<00:02:34.850> I<00:02:34.880> like<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.300> so<00:02:35.480> much<00:02:35.680> but<00:02:36.680> that

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
know why I like that so much but that

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.770 
know why I like that so much but that
just<00:02:36.980> makes<00:02:37.160> me<00:02:37.310> all<00:02:37.580> just<00:02:37.970> give<00:02:38.390> me<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> harder

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
just makes me all just give me a harder

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.420 
just makes me all just give me a harder
but<00:02:38.900> anyways<00:02:39.200> here<00:02:39.680> we<00:02:39.709> are<00:02:39.860> on<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.160> view<00:02:40.340> I'm

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
but anyways here we are on this view I'm

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.470 
but anyways here we are on this view I'm
gonna<00:02:40.550> take<00:02:40.730> off<00:02:40.850> through<00:02:41.030> this<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.360> you

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
gonna take off through this to you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.320 
gonna take off through this to you
because<00:02:41.630> it<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:43.070> best<00:02:43.250> sounding<00:02:44.120> like

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
because it is the best sounding like

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.020 
because it is the best sounding like
beauty<00:02:44.750> who<00:02:44.959> got<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.260> engine<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:45.980> there<00:02:46.850> we<00:02:46.940> go

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
beauty who got the engine so there we go

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.979 
beauty who got the engine so there we go
we're<00:02:47.209> gonna<00:02:47.270> give<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.540> full<00:02:47.780> power

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
we're gonna give the full power

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.600 
we're gonna give the full power
hopefully<00:02:48.470> no<00:02:48.620> warning<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.070> go<00:02:49.250> off<00:02:49.430> because

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
hopefully no warning to go off because

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.670 
hopefully no warning to go off because
uh<00:02:49.840> hopefully<00:02:50.840> have<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.050> right<00:02:51.200> flaps<00:02:51.470> on

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
uh hopefully have the right flaps on

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.800 
uh hopefully have the right flaps on
your<00:02:51.830> go

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810

that just sounds completely amazing okay
I'm<00:03:00.470> on<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.620> centerline<00:03:00.920> here<00:03:01.310> I'm<00:03:01.430> doing<00:03:01.640> it

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
I'm on the centerline here I'm doing it

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.730

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
Felicio so he goes rolling those engines

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.960 
Felicio so he goes rolling those engines
they<00:03:08.330> just<00:03:08.540> sound<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:09.170> sounds<00:03:10.040> something

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
at lower speed

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.150 
at lower speed
so<00:03:25.439> there<00:03:25.590> we<00:03:25.680> go

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
business I think he says gear up and the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.320 
business I think he says gear up and the
flight<00:03:34.020> dynamics<00:03:34.170> are<00:03:34.800> also<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.400> completely

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
flight dynamics are also just completely

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.020 
flight dynamics are also just completely
amazing<00:03:36.540> like<00:03:37.200> it's<00:03:37.410> just<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:38.430> turn<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:38.970> it

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
amazing like it's just you turn and it

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.540 
amazing like it's just you turn and it
doesn't<00:03:39.540> take<00:03:39.750> five<00:03:39.960> hours<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.440> respond<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:41.520> a

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
doesn't take five hours to respond to a
