00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.520

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.520
 Thanks to our sponsors 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.539
 hello to you marty and channel 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.279
 airsoftmag and finally got to 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.320
 garsing products 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.779
 today we look at winter boots 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.779
 cyclone model 0 650 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.320
 This model is designed for 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.340
 use in cold extreme 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.860
 cold conditions 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.770
 i.e. optimal for fishermen 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.559
 and hunters and just lovers of active 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.800
 winter leisure shoes are also very good 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.800
 during the thaw period because they 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 waterproof 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.259
 Well what can I say many perfect 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.560
 dry shoes don't let water through 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.210
 bottom and top 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.409
 that is, to extremely wet conditions 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.399
 to thaw and either when you walk on 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.490
 partially melted ice 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.970
 the shoes are perfect sole 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.740
 the shoe is double layered it is clearly visible 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.049
 the first layer is made of frost resistant 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.179
 wear-resistant rubber special winter 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.000
 protector which is directed to both 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.299
 the sides of the second sole layer is made of 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 polyurethane is soft 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.240
 plastic material which serves to 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.850
 thermal insulation does not lose its properties 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.799
 at temperatures from minus 60 to plus 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.709
 eighty degrees this layout 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.229
 The sole of two layers is very practical with 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.970
 one side polyurethane layer 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.599
 allows the sole to be soft and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.689
 heat resistant but the rubber layer does not give and 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:04.020
 slide on slippery surface under 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.869
 the sock and the back is reinforced with a special thermo 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.140
 plastic material also heel 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.670
 reinforced with a layer of polymer material 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.380
 most likely done specifically for 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.560

 thermoplastic rubber lining 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.060
 made of textile material with 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.870
 membrane hidra gar insulation 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.250
 thinsulate 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.030
 thousand one valve shoes semi deaf 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.350
 lacing consists of four rows 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.540
 metal loops and two types 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.920
 hooks which is very convenient when cords 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.090
 not a gloved boot hope that the review
