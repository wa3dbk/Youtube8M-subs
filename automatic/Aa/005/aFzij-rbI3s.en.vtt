similar<00:00:12.780> type<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.469> pistol<00:00:13.799> which<00:00:14.670> would

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
similar type of pistol which would

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.540 
similar type of pistol which would
actually<00:00:15.330> fire<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> 9<00:00:16.289> millimeter<00:00:16.529> by<00:00:17.100> 19<00:00:19.550> this

actually fire a 9 millimeter by 19 this

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.840 
actually fire a 9 millimeter by 19 this
is<00:00:20.699> just<00:00:20.910> an<00:00:21.090> outline<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:22.140> know<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.859> uh<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
is just an outline I know this uh the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.099 
is just an outline I know this uh the
bottom<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:26.070> bottom<00:00:26.430> half<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
bottom the the bottom half of the of the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.859 
bottom the the bottom half of the of the
gun<00:00:28.320> which<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> lower<00:00:29.609> receiver<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.510> know

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
gun which is a lower receiver I know

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.659 
gun which is a lower receiver I know
it's<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.320> little<00:00:31.590> bit<00:00:31.679> more<00:00:31.890> forward<00:00:32.279> than

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it's a little bit more forward than

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.240 
it's a little bit more forward than
expected<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:34.079> that's<00:00:34.290> because<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:35.040> need

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
expected but that's because you need

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.280 
expected but that's because you need
this<00:00:35.460> gun<00:00:35.700> instead<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.149> actually<00:00:36.480> having<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
this gun instead of actually having the

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.650 
this gun instead of actually having the
slide<00:00:37.649> move<00:00:38.219> backwards<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.059> then<00:00:39.120> forwards

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
slide move backwards and then forwards

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.080 
slide move backwards and then forwards
in<00:00:39.780> order<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> recog<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> hammer<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.850> then

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
in order to recog the hammer and then

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.740 
in order to recog the hammer and then
and<00:00:42.989> then<00:00:43.590> take<00:00:44.520> off<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> chain<00:00:44.969> take<00:00:45.480> off<00:00:45.629> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
and then take off the chain take off the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.389 
and then take off the chain take off the
bullet<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> chamber<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.070> chamber

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
bullet off the chamber and we chamber

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.430 
bullet off the chamber and we chamber
another<00:00:47.550> round<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.930> would<00:00:49.079> actually

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
another round this one would actually

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.369 
another round this one would actually
have<00:00:49.590> an<00:00:49.739> internal<00:00:50.340> bolt<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.050> this<00:00:52.050> bolt

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
have an internal bolt and this bolt

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.240 
have an internal bolt and this bolt
would<00:00:52.649> actually<00:00:53.780> would<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.960> all<00:00:55.170> those<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
would actually would do all those and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.900 
would actually would do all those and
also<00:00:56.699> rakaat<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> hammer<00:00:57.390> as<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.500> see

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
also rakaat the hammer as you can see

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.969 
also rakaat the hammer as you can see
already<00:01:00.469> started<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:03.379> is<00:01:04.379> similar<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
already started this is similar to the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.280 
already started this is similar to the
Ruger<00:01:05.250> Mark<00:01:05.369> 2<00:01:05.670> i'm<00:01:06.299> gonna<00:01:06.510> make<00:01:06.630> where<00:01:06.869> i'm

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
Ruger Mark 2 i'm gonna make where i'm

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.679 
Ruger Mark 2 i'm gonna make where i'm
gonna<00:01:07.560> make<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.860> where<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.340> hole<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.939> where

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
gonna make it where this hole is where

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.120 
gonna make it where this hole is where
i'm<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.220> big<00:01:11.460> pin<00:01:11.880> goes<00:01:12.510> into<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.260> holds

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
i'm the the big pin goes into that holds

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.330 
i'm the the big pin goes into that holds
the<00:01:14.390> bolt<00:01:15.409> inside<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.100> main<00:01:17.479> upper<00:01:18.479> receiver

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
the bolt inside the main upper receiver

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.100 
the bolt inside the main upper receiver
and<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.610> can<00:01:20.759> see<00:01:20.790> i<00:01:20.939> already<00:01:21.060> cut<00:01:21.360> off<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and as you can see i already cut off the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.660 
and as you can see i already cut off the
bottom<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.700> hammer<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.420> magazine

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
bottom so the hammer and the magazine

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.130 
bottom so the hammer and the magazine
where<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.759> magazine<00:01:27.180> would<00:01:27.360> feed<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.689> rounds

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
where the magazine would feed the rounds

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.190 
where the magazine would feed the rounds
into<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.880> right<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.150> already<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.479> already<00:01:30.750> did

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
into it right here already I already did

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.710 
into it right here already I already did
the<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:33.229> ejector<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.650> mean<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.720> extractor

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the the ejector and I mean the extractor

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.380 
the the ejector and I mean the extractor
and<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.920> i<00:01:37.950> already<00:01:38.159> cut<00:01:38.549> out<00:01:38.700> two<00:01:39.030> grooves

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and here i already cut out two grooves

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.780 
and here i already cut out two grooves
and<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:40.020> groove<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.740> higher<00:01:40.979> for

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
and one groove a little bit higher for

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.520 
and one groove a little bit higher for
the<00:01:41.909> ejector<00:01:42.680> i<00:01:43.759> also<00:01:44.759> made<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> little<00:01:45.750> round

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
the ejector i also made a little round

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.219 
the ejector i also made a little round
spacing<00:01:47.369> right<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.390> I'm<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.960> bullet

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
spacing right here so I'm the bullet

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.929 
spacing right here so I'm the bullet
could<00:01:49.409> actually<00:01:49.590> fit<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.189> there<00:01:50.369> snugly

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
could actually fit in there snugly

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.020 
could actually fit in there snugly
without<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> bolt<00:01:52.110> actually<00:01:53.090> moving<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.270> lot

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
without the bolt actually moving a lot

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.780 
without the bolt actually moving a lot
right<00:01:57.030> here<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.950> back<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.159> firing<00:01:59.399> pin

pin<00:02:21.300> in<00:02:21.420> there<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.810> little<00:02:22.500> spring<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.310> in

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
pin in there a little spring in here in

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.480 
pin in there a little spring in here in
order<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.990> make<00:02:24.990> sure<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.320> firing<00:02:25.830> pin<00:02:26.040> stays

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
order to make sure the firing pin stays

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.670 
order to make sure the firing pin stays
back<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.750> then<00:02:27.990> right<00:02:28.140> here<00:02:28.170> i<00:02:28.350> have<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
back and then right here i have the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.770 
back and then right here i have the
ejector<00:02:29.220> which<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.790> kind<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.180> made<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.600> little

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
ejector which I kind of made it a little

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.430 
ejector which I kind of made it a little
fat<00:02:31.310> they're<00:02:32.310> not<00:02:32.580> compared<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:33.600> real

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
fat they're not compared to like real

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.770 
fat they're not compared to like real
guns<00:02:34.710> but<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.310> is<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.580> easiest<00:02:35.880> way<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.360> can

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
guns but this is the easiest way I can

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.030 
guns but this is the easiest way I can
make<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.550> fold<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:40.050> on<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:40.800> top

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
make it I fold it in the the on this top

make it I fold it in the the on this top
right<00:02:41.220> here<00:02:41.430> and<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.650> grinded<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.770> off<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.220> order

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
right here and I grinded it off in order

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.270 
right here and I grinded it off in order
to<00:02:44.670> get<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.030> right<00:02:45.330> size<00:02:45.570> for<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.840> bullet

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
to get the right size for the bullet

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.790 
to get the right size for the bullet
right<00:02:47.280> here<00:02:47.490> i<00:02:47.520> have<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.360> pin<00:02:48.770> that<00:02:49.770> goes
