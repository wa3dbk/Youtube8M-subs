 So much so I can pick up Behrooz pop-under, but no matter powder 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:16.530

 Maybe a little bit changed. 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:53.590
 I usually have a great mind, or a really hard job 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:00.520
 When I was there, 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:07.810

 1 Give me a wardrobe room where I can really spring in the room 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:49.470
 But when one really came in and I heard this on the instrument, 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.909
 It 's a space where you can not move . 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.959
 It went on the air feces pick a team that door 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:05.549

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:16.290
 Prevent a practice never before dawn, I very common 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:18.060
 Neighbors did not like the manners. They could open up the walls and officially 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.190
 By writing letters 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:26.430

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.209
 He's using force. 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.799
 When you work with true that the principle of its own activities by any standard forward 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:53.310
 I wonder if you are 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:57.870
 Oh, the classic people, because I am Maybe I play the classic line 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.510
 The big hope that I could enjoy my closer 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:06.170
 I 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:09.110
 I can change the life of one of the music of classical music so that I can see it 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:16.519
 I'm going, and I think that deunyo 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:21.949
 But many people do not realize how much bigger and deeper 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:28.250
 I can not give you that impression because you do not know how to get it all done 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:30.050
 Hageodeunyo thought was going to feel a little bit with me, so I do Papi West 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.350
 Dear Chang 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.580
 It really looks different colors like this 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:43.669
 I have a lot of charts in 50 days these days combined . 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:50.060
 So in the end , through the challenge of the people, people closer to classical music 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:53.419
 I feel and feel more deeply impressed with the director of the child February . 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:57.110
 I wish people could do more. 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:00.470
 I was looking for a sponsored bottle twitter because I was terrorizing him. 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:05.900
 There are also fewer words kicks spent on cross-section 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:07.820
 Prerequisites for good practice, lunch, focusing on music as bursts sorry 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.180
 I think it's all inside 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:17.599
 Com add quite a few weeks, I wanted to see what state 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:23.300
 I really like music so I can ask you to concentrate And then when I saw the South 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:29.030
 How Smell ingabwa strange love like that could do well to concentrate 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.320
 I think you should practice on your knees really , that's the back of your plan . 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:36.080
 It's the same. 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:41.780
 Yes, I was like, not just wives neunge to establish that the repeated practice 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:47.389
 To express all the emotions that you really feel 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:51.530
 Even if some say it in a week and turn the vacuum cleaner on the right next to the main or 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.400
 You need such a state of immersion that you can not even call a name 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:06:00.979
 It was the same. 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:06.380
 4 At that time, the situation was mainly good for the generation. 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:08.090
 The musician now says that he wants to be a good person, 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.289
 What kind of person 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:17.090
 Some of the performers have really impressive performances. 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:20.300
 But you have the same kind of performance. 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:23.270
 I think it 's all out of my mind. 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.780
 Oh, even more churches 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:32.300
 I do not do it now . It's Aya. 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:37.610
 So using the same example is also going to be like that when I feel good 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:39.320
 Love and relaxed people and people who can go along well together. 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.169
 I think it's very important. 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:46.990
 4 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:52.330
 Ft the worst mum recognized in the world stage is a fool in France 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:57.810
