00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.770
 this is the new ferrari f 12 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.390
 berlinetta you can not even 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.110
 at all is the top model of 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.000
 ferrari the ferrari has only three 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.400
 twelve-cylinder sports car in the program 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.250
 this is the two-seater of the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.989
 classic gt with front engine and also 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.520
 for me alone because of the performance something 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.110
 very special but there will come later 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.770
 still to test now 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.770
 but now go 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.269
 740 ps that sounds crazy and that's it 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.829
 but also somewhere is 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.570
 fascinating for people who are looking for 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.590
 technology can inspire that is here 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.000
 a 6 3 liter twelve cylinder a v12 that 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.759
 means the cylinders lie in a v 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.430
 Arrangement in the back you hardly see anything 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.100
 you can see here is the ventilation of the 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.590
 motors here on this page and on the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.399
 the other side will be six each 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.289
 cylinder ventilated up here are the 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.149
 inlet ducts of the air then come the 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.130
 Sprit to the host injected and 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.270
 you can ignite this fascination 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.250
 Difficult to escape if ever 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.250
 can inspire a little bit of technology 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.380
 yes, what attracts attention when you look at it 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.180
 Ferrari f 12 times very concentrated 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.390
 Look, everything is not really 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.860
 wing the optics somehow disturb as well 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.380
 you sometimes see it in front of the nightclub 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.330
 so breakfast tray on the subaru or 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.820
 so that does not mean that none 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.630
 sophisticated aerodynamics would have but 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.550
 on the contrary 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.470
 Of course ferrari has a madness 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.540
 experience with this topic alone because of 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.170
 the formula 1 they have incredible 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.670
 efficient wind tunnel in maranello the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.890
 aerodynamics she is here, so to speak 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.590
 installed hidden that begins at at 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.180
 this patient spoiler here in front 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.920
 then we have a kind of arrow here 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.560
 bridge that's the name of the thing 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.330
 that leads the air through this becomes the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.400
 front car pressed even harder 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.340
 and then we have one back here 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.800
 diffuser on the with the air flows after 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.780
 from the top and thereby the car again 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.400
 on the street we have one 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.210
 disguised fully disguised 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.730
 underbody 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.030
 that means the aerodynamics take place outside 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.030
 instead of 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.519
 also here in the interior you can see the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.680
 close relationship between the 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.900
 motorsport between the formula 1 and the 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.360
 series cars from ferrari especially at 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.650
 steering wheel i have all the important ones 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.260
 Controls here in the steering wheel 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.390
 For example, the blinker unites the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.510
 are served here with your thumbs left 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.209
 and right here is the wiper 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.709
 was the light horn now is the 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.299
 Imagination for the shock absorbers so for 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.829
 the hertha and here are the 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.409
 different driving programs if I am 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.909
 now driving in the rain or in the dry 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.159
 or do I want to race? 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.420
 that's here in the steering wheel that unifies it 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.420
 Formula 1 for the road 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.090
 although the ferrari f 12 berlin something like 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:38.349
 a racing car is with its facilities of 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.730
 The power of 740 hp can be turned on 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.769
 do not extend the race track 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.310
 because at least in addition to betrayed comes 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.930
 the bringing of the ball is not in the height 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.940
 if I do not land those straight 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.940
 stop 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.210
 to fully accelerate my car to do so 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:58.070
 you need a freeway a free one 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:00.430
 opportunity at the time not all 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.430
 films 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.070
 as it is for a real gt 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.500
 the ferrari f 12 is not only fast 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.710
 but also practically the front engine 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.419
 allows a large trunk space here 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.610
 and there are two people in any case 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.330
 your luggage in and not just for 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.430
 weekend 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.230
 and the whole thing is still variable as well 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.110
 you can see this if you are here 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.830
 middle part takes out then fits there one 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.830
 whole lot pure 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.250
 I just have it just that 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.230
 consume after the sick 24 liters that 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.330
 has a ferrari over 35 years ago 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.530
 already used the engine power 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.500
 has doubled from 350 ps to over 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.940
 700 ps significantly over 700 ps of 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.250
 Consumption has remained the same 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.660
 if you had to ask me that 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.400
 technical progress only in the 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.870
 increase in engine power flow 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:25.220
 you would not have the consumption 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:27.710
 can lower my yes this 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.350
 car here is more than 260,000 euros 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.820
 No human needs so much 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.190
 is clear but you do not need one 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.380
 cheeseburger you do not need a hunger man 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.600
 does not need a bottle of wine the 250 euro 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.620
 costs but there are people who buy 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.330
 that they will find it nice 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.550
 I personally found the interesting 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.650
 Reactions of the people we saw 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.770
 have the one on our trip 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.470
 turk your cell phones and film or 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.940
 take pictures and have a smile 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.490
 in the face and the little boys the 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.470
 radiation as there are other this whole 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.630
 Petrich can not drive us that 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.680
 with ford focus with 130 ahead of us and 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.560
 do not let me overtake 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.810
 Of course polarized on the car 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.670
 Every case I personally finds horny 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.090
 but that is also mine 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.090
 career choices
