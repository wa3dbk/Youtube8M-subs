championship<00:00:07.740> it<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.340> Dolph<00:00:09.120> Ziggler<00:00:09.469> vs

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
championship it is Dolph Ziggler vs

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.950 
championship it is Dolph Ziggler vs
Cesaro<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.940> match<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.450> should<00:00:12.780> be

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
Cesaro so this is a match that should be

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.740 
Cesaro so this is a match that should be
probably<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.820> lengthy<00:00:14.820> one<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.299> I'm<00:00:15.509> thinking

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
probably a lengthy one and I'm thinking

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.830 
probably a lengthy one and I'm thinking
maybe<00:00:16.190> 15<00:00:17.190> minutes<00:00:17.640> or<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.390> think<00:00:18.630> this

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
maybe 15 minutes or so and I think this

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.840 
maybe 15 minutes or so and I think this
will<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> better<00:00:20.340> technical

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
will be one of the better technical

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.429 
will be one of the better technical
wrestling<00:00:21.480> matches<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:21.960> will<00:00:22.109> probably<00:00:22.289> be

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
wrestling matches this will probably be

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.150 
wrestling matches this will probably be
the<00:00:22.710> best<00:00:23.220> work<00:00:23.789> rate<00:00:24.150> match<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.720> best<00:00:25.160> you

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
the best work rate match the best you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.910 
the best work rate match the best you
match<00:00:26.400> on<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> card<00:00:27.349> besides<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.560> Hell<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.740> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
match on the card besides the Hell in a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.500 
match on the card besides the Hell in a
Cell<00:00:28.949> matches<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.210> without<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
Cell matches so you know without the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.299 
Cell matches so you know without the
stipulation<00:00:31.260> applied<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.859> think<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.219> is

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
stipulation applied to it I think it is

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.830 
stipulation applied to it I think it is
a<00:00:32.369> two<00:00:32.610> out<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.759> three<00:00:32.969> Falls<00:00:33.180> match<00:00:33.329> as<00:00:33.660> well

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
a two out of three Falls match as well

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.690 
a two out of three Falls match as well
which<00:00:34.320> does<00:00:34.559> add<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.579> will

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
which does add to it I think that will

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.010 
which does add to it I think that will
really<00:00:35.760> help<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.390> that's<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> good<00:00:36.690> decision

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
really help and that's a good decision

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
really help and that's a good decision
so<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> think<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:38.100> match<00:00:38.340> should<00:00:38.370> be<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> long

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
so I think this match should be a long

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150 
so I think this match should be a long
one<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.989> will<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> really<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:40.920> good

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
one and it will be a really really good

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.130 
one and it will be a really really good
one<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.399> think<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.910> I'm<00:00:42.030> expecting<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.690> lot

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
one I think that I'm expecting a lot

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.869 
one I think that I'm expecting a lot
between<00:00:43.290> these<00:00:43.590> two<00:00:43.770> guys<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.980> great<00:00:44.430> workers<00:00:44.789> I

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
between these two guys a great workers I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.910 
between these two guys a great workers I
think<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.800> really<00:00:46.800> good

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
think this is going to be a really good

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.479 
think this is going to be a really good
matchup<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.690> winner<00:00:48.930> though<00:00:49.140> it's

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
matchup as for the winner though it's

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.400 
matchup as for the winner though it's
really<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.480> opinion<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.020> Cesaro

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
really in my opinion I think Cesaro

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.020 
really in my opinion I think Cesaro
should<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.010> vicar<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> big<00:00:53.579> Cesaro

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
should get the vicar I'm a big Cesaro

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.439 
should get the vicar I'm a big Cesaro
fan<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.350> Ziggler<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:57.300> know

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
fan and I like Ziggler but like you know

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.380 
fan and I like Ziggler but like you know
my<00:00:58.340> favoritism<00:00:59.340> towards<00:00:59.640> Dolph<00:00:59.850> Ziggler<00:01:00.180> is

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
my favoritism towards Dolph Ziggler is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.119 
my favoritism towards Dolph Ziggler is
certainly<00:01:00.750> dwindling<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.440> I'm<00:01:01.559> really<00:01:01.980> not

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
certainly dwindling and I'm really not

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.359 
certainly dwindling and I'm really not
caring<00:01:02.550> for<00:01:02.820> him<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.000> much<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.480> used<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
caring for him as much as I used to

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.410 
caring for him as much as I used to
obviously<00:01:05.369> that's<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> bad<00:01:05.880> booking<00:01:06.299> that

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
obviously that's the bad booking that

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.000 
obviously that's the bad booking that
he's<00:01:06.630> been<00:01:06.840> getting<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.590> know<00:01:07.680> it's<00:01:07.830> hard

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
he's been getting and you know it's hard

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.469 
he's been getting and you know it's hard
to<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:08.549> into<00:01:08.820> Ziggler<00:01:09.119> because<00:01:09.390> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
to really get into Ziggler because you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.420 
to really get into Ziggler because you
know<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.990> any<00:01:10.350> moment<00:01:11.159> they<00:01:11.220> could<00:01:11.250> just

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
know that any moment they could just

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.550 
know that any moment they could just
stop<00:01:11.760> his<00:01:11.939> push<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.689> know<00:01:12.810> put<00:01:13.260> him<00:01:13.380> down

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
stop his push and you know put him down

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.140 
stop his push and you know put him down
again<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.950> that's<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> same<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.640> Cesaro<00:01:14.970> at

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150

this moment I've been in vixx's rfm but
right<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.090> hard<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> enjoy<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> Society

right now it's hard to enjoy the Society
Eric<00:01:19.950> tur<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.280> get<00:01:20.400> into<00:01:20.549> him<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
Eric tur and get into him because it you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.179 
Eric tur and get into him because it you
know<00:01:21.750> they're<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.409> down<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.710> Cesaro

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
know they're so up and down with Cesaro

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.980 
know they're so up and down with Cesaro
with<00:01:23.369> his<00:01:23.490> gimmick<00:01:23.820> changes<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.450> they're<00:01:24.600> his

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
with his gimmick changes and they're his

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.899 
with his gimmick changes and they're his
pushes<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.590> just<00:01:25.890> cannot<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.610> into<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
pushes you just cannot get into the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.840 
pushes you just cannot get into the
character<00:01:27.240> at<00:01:27.540> all<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:28.680> hopefully<00:01:29.009> Cesaro<00:01:29.400> can

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
character at all so hopefully Cesaro can

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.240 
character at all so hopefully Cesaro can
you<00:01:30.450> know<00:01:30.570> improve<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.290> get<00:01:31.380> himself<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.860> title

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you know improve and get himself a title

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
you know improve and get himself a title
because<00:01:33.119> i<00:01:33.180> think<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.479> IC<00:01:33.780> title<00:01:34.049> could

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
because i think the IC title could

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.920 
because i think the IC title could
really<00:01:35.130> helped<00:01:35.430> cesare<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> lot<00:01:36.570> more<00:01:36.750> they

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
really helped cesare a lot more they

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.450 
really helped cesare a lot more they
think<00:01:37.200> Ziegler<00:01:37.650> really<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.100> doing<00:01:38.369> anything

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
think Ziegler really is doing anything

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.340 
think Ziegler really is doing anything
for<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> belt<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.390> they<00:01:39.509> think<00:01:39.900> Ziggler

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
for the belt that they think Ziggler

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.800 
for the belt that they think Ziggler
really<00:01:40.680> needs<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.220> belt<00:01:41.430> all<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.850> much<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.299> I

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
really needs to belt all that much and I

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.910 
really needs to belt all that much and I
don't<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.170> they're<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.470> gonna<00:01:43.649> do

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
don't think they're really gonna do

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.560 
don't think they're really gonna do
anything<00:01:44.159> with<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.579> belt<00:01:44.820> with<00:01:45.000> dolls<00:01:45.240> ago<00:01:45.540> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
anything with the belt with dolls ago I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.960 
anything with the belt with dolls ago I
think<00:01:45.780> they're<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:45.930> kind<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.259> keeping<00:01:46.619> him

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
think they're just kind of keeping him

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.940 
think they're just kind of keeping him
keeping<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> title<00:01:48.420> warm<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.780> his<00:01:48.930> waist<00:01:49.200> for

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
keeping the title warm on his waist for

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.800 
keeping the title warm on his waist for
way<00:01:50.100> Barry<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.670> bad<00:01:50.820> news<00:01:50.850> about<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.420> come<00:01:51.600> back

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
way Barry or bad news about to come back

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.139 
way Barry or bad news about to come back
and<00:01:51.960> win<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.880> don't<00:01:53.939> know<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and win it so you know I don't know I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.069 
and win it so you know I don't know I
think<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:54.479> could<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:54.840> use<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
think they could really use the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.139 
think they could really use the
championship<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> little<00:01:56.040> bit<00:01:56.159> more<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
championship a little bit more with the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.940 
championship a little bit more with the
w/e<00:01:57.869> World<00:01:58.110> Heavyweight<00:01:58.259> Championship<00:01:58.770> out

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
w/e World Heavyweight Championship out

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.740 
w/e World Heavyweight Championship out
of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> picture<00:01:59.310> they<00:01:59.909> really<00:02:00.240> need<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.479> try

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
of the picture they really need to try

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.389 
of the picture they really need to try
and<00:02:00.869> start<00:02:01.110> pushing<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> IC<00:02:01.860> title<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.189> little

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and start pushing the IC title a little

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.800 
and start pushing the IC title a little
bit

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
bit

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.149 
bit
that's<00:02:03.020> something<00:02:03.200> that<00:02:03.320> failing<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:03.979> do<00:02:04.130> so

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
that's something that failing to do so

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.670 
that's something that failing to do so
hopefully<00:02:04.670> they<00:02:04.790> can<00:02:04.850> fix<00:02:04.970> that<00:02:05.390> but<00:02:06.200> hey<00:02:06.350> I

hopefully they can fix that but hey I

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.410

think Dolph super will walk away as the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.930 
think Dolph super will walk away as the
