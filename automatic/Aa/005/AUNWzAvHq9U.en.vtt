we do just have a bunch of three power
to<00:00:35.790> many<00:00:36.000> creatures<00:00:36.239> instead<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:37.469> rather<00:00:37.590> than

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
to many creatures instead so rather than

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
trying to go big with our devotion we're

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.119 
trying to go big with our devotion we're
just<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> try<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:39.930> beat<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> crap<00:00:40.980> out

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129

just going to try and beat the crap out
of<00:00:41.160> our<00:00:41.370> ponent<00:00:41.670> before<00:00:41.879> they<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.120> do

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
of our ponent before they can do

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.510 
of our ponent before they can do
anything<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.800> see<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.489> have

a 3 power creature for 2 mana with brush
Strider<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> brush<00:01:08.580> Strider<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.150> another

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
Strider so brush Strider is just another

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.000 
Strider so brush Strider is just another
aggressive<00:01:09.810> creature<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.500> cast<00:01:10.740> off

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
aggressive creature that we can cast off

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.160 
aggressive creature that we can cast off
of<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.250> burning<00:01:11.460> tree<00:01:11.670> emissary<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.930> allows

of a burning tree emissary that allows

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.440 
of a burning tree emissary that allows
us<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.560> further<00:01:13.890> evolve<00:01:14.250> our<00:01:14.460> experiment<00:01:15.000> 1<00:01:15.090> so

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
us to further evolve our experiment 1 so

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.200 
us to further evolve our experiment 1 so
with<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.380> type<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.830> build<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.909> place

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
with this type of build we have place

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.969 
with this type of build we have place
where<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.720> experiment<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
where we go experiment one on one and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.320 
where we go experiment one on one and
then<00:01:20.189> burning<00:01:20.430> tree<00:01:20.729> brushed<00:01:21.000> right<00:01:21.180> around

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
then burning tree brushed right around

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.359 
then burning tree brushed right around
to<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:22.200> allows<00:01:22.439> us<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> attack<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> 3

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to which allows us to attack with a 3

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.760 
to which allows us to attack with a 3
power<00:01:23.580> experiment<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.360> turn<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.810> wear<00:01:25.680> our

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
power experiment one on turn to wear our

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.890 
power experiment one on turn to wear our
ponent<00:01:26.130> probably<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.549> has<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.700> at<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.600> plant

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
ponent probably just has like at a plant

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
ponent probably just has like at a plant
in<00:01:27.990> play<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.530> scribe<00:01:28.799> yeah<00:01:29.250> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
in play because they scribe yeah that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.550 
in play because they scribe yeah that
doesn't<00:01:29.850> sound<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.299> very<00:01:30.540> realistic<00:01:31.170> turn

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
doesn't sound like a very realistic turn

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.749 
doesn't sound like a very realistic turn
to<00:01:31.740> though<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.250> missed<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
to though I think you missed like the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.940 
to though I think you missed like the
other<00:01:32.909> two<00:01:33.090> burning<00:01:33.360> trees<00:01:34.200> yeah<00:01:34.530> well

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
other two burning trees yeah well

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.140 
other two burning trees yeah well
unfortunately<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.579> not<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> evolve

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
unfortunately it's not going to evolve

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.149 
unfortunately it's not going to evolve
our<00:01:36.390> experiment<00:01:36.869> 1<00:01:36.960> anymore<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.590> don't<00:01:37.619> really

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
our experiment 1 anymore so don't really

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.999 
our experiment 1 anymore so don't really
need<00:01:38.280> them<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:39.060> I'll<00:01:39.180> take<00:01:39.360> them<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.770> then

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
need them but I'll take them and then

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.830 
need them but I'll take them and then
further<00:01:41.250> along<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.640> kalonian<00:01:42.509> Tusker

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
further along we have kalonian Tusker

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.300 
further along we have kalonian Tusker
with<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.140> another<00:01:43.350> 3<00:01:43.619> power<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.130> mana

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
with just another 3 power to mana

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
very good creature right now especially

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.139 
very good creature right now especially
the<00:01:48.810> deck<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:49.110> has<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.290> 100<00:01:49.799> guys<00:01:50.159> they're

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
deck it feels like it can have some very

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.400 
deck it feels like it can have some very
explosive<00:05:48.760> draws<00:05:49.150> it<00:05:49.930> doesn't<00:05:50.290> look<00:05:50.350> like

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
explosive draws it doesn't look like

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.690 
explosive draws it doesn't look like
it's<00:05:50.650> going<00:05:50.710> to<00:05:50.830> be<00:05:50.920> very<00:05:50.980> good<00:05:51.250> going<00:05:51.460> along

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
it's going to be very good going along

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.640 
it's going to be very good going along
as<00:05:51.940> if<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.420> don't<00:05:52.570> have<00:05:52.660> the<00:05:52.780> reach<00:05:52.960> that<00:05:53.290> most

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
as if you don't have the reach that most

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.040 
as if you don't have the reach that most
of<00:05:53.770> the<00:05:53.890> burned<00:05:54.070> X<00:05:54.280> have<00:05:54.520> but<00:05:55.360> we<00:05:55.450> do<00:05:55.570> have<00:05:55.750> a

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
of the burned X have but we do have a

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.800 
of the burned X have but we do have a
lot<00:05:56.260> more<00:05:56.410> powerful<00:05:56.650> creatures<00:05:57.130> and

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
lot more powerful creatures and

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.150 
lot more powerful creatures and
hopefully<00:05:58.810> brush<00:05:58.990> Strider<00:05:59.260> is<00:05:59.380> worth<00:06:00.010> its

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
hopefully brush Strider is worth its

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.540 
hopefully brush Strider is worth its
weight<00:06:00.310> in<00:06:00.370> gold<00:06:00.490> so<00:06:01.480> I<00:06:01.810> don't<00:06:02.260> know<00:06:02.350> if<00:06:02.410> he<00:06:02.500> is

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
weight in gold so I don't know if he is

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.320 
weight in gold so I don't know if he is
we're<00:06:03.550> going<00:06:03.640> to<00:06:03.700> find<00:06:03.910> out
