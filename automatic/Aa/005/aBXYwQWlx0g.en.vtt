Matthew<00:01:04.949> defensive<00:01:05.939> black<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.330> he<00:01:06.420> plays

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
corner and safety from LSU I think that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.219 
corner and safety from LSU I think that

they<00:02:38.760> struggled<00:02:39.210> on<00:02:39.270> offense<00:02:39.300> so<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.230> need<00:02:40.470> to

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
they struggled on offense so you need to

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.590

their depth they have Rob Housler who's
I'd<00:02:53.190> say<00:02:53.460> just<00:02:53.790> below<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.210> valuable<00:02:54.750> tight<00:02:55.140> end

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
I'd say just below a valuable tight end

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.780 
I'd say just below a valuable tight end
he's<00:02:55.440> not<00:02:55.590> consistent<00:02:56.100> enough<00:02:56.160> he<00:02:56.460> can<00:02:56.490> break

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
he's not consistent enough he can break

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.820

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
for like a shitty like veteran contract

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.260 
for like a shitty like veteran contract
deal<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.340> think<00:03:05.400> Eric<00:03:05.640> everyone<00:03:06.030> will<00:03:06.120> be<00:03:06.210> an

deal so I think Eric everyone will be an

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.290 
deal so I think Eric everyone will be an
absolute<00:03:06.690> beast<00:03:06.900> would<00:03:07.350> probably<00:03:07.740> be<00:03:08.300> best

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
absolute beast would probably be best
