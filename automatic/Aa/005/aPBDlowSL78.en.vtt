method I'm showing you how do you take
the<00:00:23.160> tire<00:00:23.340> off<00:00:23.369> using<00:00:24.000> tire<00:00:24.750> levers<00:00:25.170> that's

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the tire off using tire levers that's

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.130 
the tire off using tire levers that's
the<00:00:25.890> most<00:00:26.039> common<00:00:26.550> method<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.480> most<00:00:27.869> people

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
the most common method that most people

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.020 
the most common method that most people
use<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:29.130> does<00:00:29.160> work<00:00:29.730> pretty<00:00:30.060> well<00:00:32.030> there

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
use and it does work pretty well there

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.049 
use and it does work pretty well there
are<00:00:33.120> other<00:00:33.270> methods<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> lot

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
are other methods that I think are a lot

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.590 
are other methods that I think are a lot
better<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.660> easier<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.149> this

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
better and easier to do but for this

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.030 
better and easier to do but for this
video<00:00:39.809> I'm<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.440> showing<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.980> one

method so you usually need at least two
tire<00:00:43.950> levers<00:00:44.600> take<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.780> first<00:00:46.020> tire<00:00:46.260> lever

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
tire levers take the first tire lever

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.279 
tire levers take the first tire lever
stick<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:48.059> stick<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.260> like

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
stick it in like this stick it in like

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.360 
stick it in like this stick it in like
this<00:00:49.680> into<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> tire<00:00:51.829> take<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:53.010> second

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
lever and just move it I don't know

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.010 
lever and just move it I don't know
about<00:00:56.370> an<00:00:56.640> inch<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:57.030> two<00:00:57.180> away<00:00:57.449> from<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.899> other

that tube out okay you kind of pull the
tube<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.710> so

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
tube out like so

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.950 
tube out like so
peel<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> tire<00:01:30.720> back<00:01:30.990> pull<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> tube<00:01:31.950> out

peel the tire back pull the tube out

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.380 
peel the tire back pull the tube out
patch<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.229> or<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.860> your<00:01:34.979> new<00:01:35.130> tube<00:01:35.400> then

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.880 
patch it or get your new tube then
putting<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> back<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> exact<00:01:38.040> reverse

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.790 

so<00:01:43.430> you're<00:01:43.610> going<00:01:43.730> to<00:01:43.760> take<00:01:43.970> your<00:01:44.120> tube<00:01:44.800> it

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
so you're going to take your tube it

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.740 
so you're going to take your tube it
helps<00:01:46.130> if<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.340> have<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.550> tiny<00:01:46.880> bit<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.300> air<00:01:47.540> in

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
helps if you have a tiny bit of air in

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.020 
helps if you have a tiny bit of air in
it<00:01:47.870> but<00:01:48.320> it's<00:01:48.500> not<00:01:48.650> totally<00:01:49.130> necessary<00:01:49.460> it

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
it but it's not totally necessary it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.170 
it but it's not totally necessary it
does<00:01:50.180> make<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.540> a<00:01:50.570> little<00:01:50.660> easier<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:52.220> I<00:01:52.670> put

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
does make it a little easier so I put

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.420 
does make it a little easier so I put
the<00:01:53.330> valve<00:01:53.600> in<00:01:53.840> first<00:01:54.260> always<00:01:54.860> put<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.250> valve

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
the valve in first always put the valve

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.550 
the valve in first always put the valve
in<00:01:55.610> first<00:01:56.560> turn<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.590> tire<00:02:00.460> turn<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.580> tire

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
in first turn the tire turn the tire

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.860 
in first turn the tire turn the tire
away<00:02:03.560> from<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.370> and<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:05.210> find<00:02:05.479> it's<00:02:05.630> easy

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
away from you and I find it's easy

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.719 
away from you and I find it's easy
sometimes<00:02:06.229> at<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:06.710> stage<00:02:06.920> just<00:02:06.950> kind<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.520> lay

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
sometimes at this stage just kind of lay

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.719 
sometimes at this stage just kind of lay
the<00:02:07.880> wheel<00:02:08.030> down<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.330> he<00:02:09.050> tuck<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.619> tube<00:02:10.310> into

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
the wheel down and he tuck the tube into

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.940 
the wheel down and he tuck the tube into
the<00:02:10.850> tire<00:02:11.090> going<00:02:12.080> all<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.380> way<00:02:12.410> around<00:02:12.560> like

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
the tire going all the way around like

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.810 
the tire going all the way around like
so<00:02:16.450> just<00:02:17.450> tuck<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:18.400> then<00:02:19.400> when<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.670> get
