the face sculpt is consistent with the
helmeted<00:03:01.810> version<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.830> hair<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.099> sculpted

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
helmeted version the hair is sculpted

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.100 
helmeted version the hair is sculpted
really<00:03:03.700> nicely<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.150> think<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.690> color<00:03:04.900> they

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
really nicely I think the color they

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.839 
really nicely I think the color they
used<00:03:05.500> for<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:05.980> creases<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.459> everything<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.819> a

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
used for the creases and everything is a

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.309 
used for the creases and everything is a
little<00:03:07.060> too<00:03:07.330> dark<00:03:07.360> that's<00:03:07.900> pretty<00:03:08.170> much<00:03:08.260> a

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
little too dark that's pretty much a

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.620 
little too dark that's pretty much a
very<00:03:08.620> very<00:03:08.860> dark<00:03:09.280> brown<00:03:09.579> color<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:10.390> maybe<00:03:10.510> a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
very very dark brown color so maybe a

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.850 
very very dark brown color so maybe a
lighter<00:03:10.930> brown<00:03:11.200> color<00:03:11.260> would<00:03:11.650> have<00:03:11.739> been

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
lighter brown color would have been

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.589 
lighter brown color would have been
better<00:03:12.099> but<00:03:12.610> still<00:03:12.819> it's<00:03:13.090> kind<00:03:13.360> of<00:03:13.420> neat

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
better but still it's kind of neat

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.059 
better but still it's kind of neat
because<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.959> just<00:03:14.110> imagine<00:03:14.470> him<00:03:14.530> being<00:03:14.590> very

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
because you just imagine him being very

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.680 
because you just imagine him being very
dirty<00:03:15.489> and<00:03:15.790> everything<00:03:16.180> from<00:03:16.360> being<00:03:16.569> in

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
dirty and everything from being in

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.000 
dirty and everything from being in

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:19.599 
shadowing effect with the black right

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:20.879 
shadowing effect with the black right
there<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:19.959> everything<00:04:20.079> so<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.560> think<00:04:20.620> that's

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
there and everything so I think that's

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:21.990 
there and everything so I think that's
pretty<00:04:21.070> good<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.340> little<00:04:21.519> bit<00:04:21.609> of<00:04:21.669> a<00:04:21.729> splotch

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
pretty good a little bit of a splotch

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.339 
pretty good a little bit of a splotch
right<00:04:22.240> there<00:04:22.389> but<00:04:22.570> not<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.720> big<00:04:22.900> deal<00:04:23.139> the

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
right there but not a big deal the

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:24.750 
right there but not a big deal the
helmetless<00:04:23.620> version<00:04:24.130> doesn't<00:04:24.400> really<00:04:24.550> look

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
helmetless version doesn't really look

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.390 
helmetless version doesn't really look
up<00:04:24.970> so<00:04:25.419> well<00:04:25.690> it's<00:04:26.320> just<00:04:26.349> going<00:04:26.919> straight<00:04:27.250> on

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
up so well it's just going straight on

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.680 
up so well it's just going straight on
it<00:04:27.550> there<00:04:27.669> he<00:04:27.760> can't<00:04:27.940> move<00:04:28.120> his<00:04:28.180> head<00:04:28.389> down<00:04:28.630> a

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
it there he can't move his head down a

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.779 
it there he can't move his head down a
little<00:04:28.900> bit<00:04:29.110> he'll<00:04:29.530> rotate<00:04:29.919> side<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.370> side<00:04:30.550> and

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
little bit he'll rotate side to side and

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.670 
little bit he'll rotate side to side and
you<00:04:30.849> do<00:04:31.030> get<00:04:31.210> some<00:04:31.419> head<00:04:31.630> pivot<00:04:31.990> over<00:04:32.169> there<00:04:32.320> we

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
you do get some head pivot over there we

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.260 
you do get some head pivot over there we
can<00:04:32.800> pop<00:04:33.039> this<00:04:33.220> off<00:04:33.460> put<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.820> other<00:04:33.940> one<00:04:34.120> on

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
can pop this off put the other one on

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.029 
can pop this off put the other one on
the<00:04:34.450> helmet<00:04:34.810> version<00:04:35.110> I<00:04:35.200> feel<00:04:35.440> I<00:04:35.470> can<00:04:35.680> look<00:04:35.830> up

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
the helmet version I feel I can look up

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.589 
the helmet version I feel I can look up
a<00:04:36.130> little<00:04:36.460> bit<00:04:36.669> more<00:04:36.820> yeah<00:04:37.030> you<00:04:37.270> can<00:04:37.389> kind<00:04:37.510> of

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
a little bit more yeah you can kind of

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.089 
a little bit more yeah you can kind of
half<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:37.930> on<00:04:38.020> there<00:04:38.139> he's<00:04:38.320> looking<00:04:38.530> up<00:04:38.650> just<00:04:38.979> a

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
half it on there he's looking up just a

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.219 
half it on there he's looking up just a
tiny<00:04:39.340> bit<00:04:39.580> his<00:04:39.940> head<00:04:40.090> moves<00:04:40.300> down<00:04:40.599> side<00:04:41.050> to

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
tiny bit his head moves down side to

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.960 
tiny bit his head moves down side to
side<00:04:41.440> movement<00:04:41.740> over<00:04:42.159> here<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.640> do<00:04:42.789> get

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
side movement over here and you do get

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.399 
side movement over here and you do get
that<00:04:43.090> and<00:04:43.270> head<00:04:43.390> pivot<00:04:43.720> as<00:04:43.810> well<00:04:43.990> the

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
that and head pivot as well the

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.119 
that and head pivot as well the
shoulders<00:04:44.740> move

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
shoulders move

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.409 
shoulders move
or<00:04:45.339> you<00:04:45.489> could<00:04:45.610> rotate<00:04:45.759> them<00:04:46.059> all<00:04:46.239> the<00:04:46.360> way

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
or you could rotate them all the way

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.419 
or you could rotate them all the way
upwards<00:04:46.839> of<00:04:46.959> that<00:04:47.080> soft<00:04:47.439> cape<00:04:47.770> can<00:04:48.129> get<00:04:48.339> the

upwards of that soft cape can get the

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:49.559 
upwards of that soft cape can get the
arm<00:04:48.580> all<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:48.789> way<00:04:48.909> up<00:04:49.029> like<00:04:49.119> that<00:04:49.360> which<00:04:49.539> is

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
arm all the way up like that which is

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.869

left<00:04:55.749> side<00:04:55.809> or<00:04:56.080> I<00:04:56.110> talked<00:04:56.349> about<00:04:56.409> the<00:04:56.619> right

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:56.769 
left side or I talked about the right

00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:58.379 
left side or I talked about the right

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
side over here you get a good diaphragm

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.389 
side over here you get a good diaphragm
joint<00:04:58.629> that<00:04:58.809> moves<00:04:59.019> side<00:04:59.319> to<00:04:59.559> side<00:04:59.800> you<00:05:00.039> do<00:05:00.189> get

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:00.399 
joint that moves side to side you do get

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:02.850 
joint that moves side to side you do get
some<00:05:00.759> pivot<00:05:01.119> it<00:05:01.300> crunches<00:05:01.899> forward<00:05:02.259> nicely

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
some pivot it crunches forward nicely

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.739

which<00:05:03.069> I<00:05:03.189> like<00:05:03.369> that<00:05:03.580> and<00:05:03.789> it<00:05:03.939> moves<00:05:04.149> back<00:05:04.449> very

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:04.749 
which I like that and it moves back very

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:06.299 
which I like that and it moves back very
well<00:05:04.839> too<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:05.349> the<00:05:05.439> sculpting<00:05:05.860> comes<00:05:06.039> all<00:05:06.219> the

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:06.309 
well too and the sculpting comes all the

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:08.369

way through you get a waist joints count

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.139 
way through you get a waist joints count
tricky<00:05:08.679> but<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:08.949> got<00:05:09.069> to<00:05:09.159> grab<00:05:09.369> both<00:05:09.639> legs<00:05:09.969> and
