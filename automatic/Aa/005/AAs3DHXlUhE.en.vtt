00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 and mayn't yet be mistaking might every 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.259
 the ability to use more then we have 10 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.480
 still the same so friends with us 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.740
 350 350 mirror to be fed third 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.719
 two each t1 cunningham 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.269
 The team might play from the bottom base and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.060
 takes 3 weave and this means that it is not a fact 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.560
 that they will go the city and just wondering 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.080
 watch what can then bar zelenka 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.449
 immediately before or it can fork in where they are 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.980
 under the push 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.960
 1 pound a lot of that on respawn again 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.740
 stadiums you might teams this of course 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.540
 sadly i'm at home through neva poke a row 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.079
 they anet already this tactic course if not 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.410
 am wrong 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.260
 yes this course yesterday against him look at 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.300
 mind immediately took 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.489
 teams try to counter each other yes 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.079
 but yesterday they played a map against unity and so 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.250
 there about me yesterday this fight kind of came this 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.250
 first burned office 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.719
 there is a bunker you all yes for the situation saved 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.719
 unity command from that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.370
 lost course very tight rounds 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.290
 think up well what navi goes to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.299
 green flashes on like it was nothing to do with 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.860
 the whole team but also i think it is 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.840
 the most perfect diff I think that 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.360
 the team can make a mistake now seriously 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.460
 see they act out of it very 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.930
 aggressive now want a day can 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.049
 stress it may not be the court you know 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.780
 what could be an attempt to wait for one 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.530
 timings you have information wedding 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.110
 1 through break in 1 breaking everyone and everything 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.970
 in plain sight we go to the attack just 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.340
 instantly passed navi intelligence 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.659
 just a rod forward and one tank at zero and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.909
 mean they are for 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.439
 of the line will not come out strike cover 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.060
 just yes i most likely they won't come out 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.040
 line statement either come out right away 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.020
 We look that this is oil and product slide 1 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.670
 on the edge of the attack and the buzz of the line arrived 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.920
 grouped out and checked left free 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.750
 new passed further pass the same 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 purse most of the card 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.070
 teams might a maid do n't see it all 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.250
 Further here they stand on their first 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.469
 lines well and now the hour may be now 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.799
 the form is -2 and erase i just 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.719
 free yes again if it knows a 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.459
 we all can see everything is good one tapor is not 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.869
 I understand how it is not so cunning 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.580
 all will be able to continue to attack so 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.620
 it will be you clear capture someday 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.920
 base there is no branch warriors 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.000
 it met one just lighted up 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.569
 great great cross by left-hander on 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.989
 two riders still kirill 150 110 work 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.310
 further fulfills further will score it 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.230
 let's watch it disappeared from 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.290
 lit up but they will be broken water 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.569
 until the end of the 100 pda, the tank top highlighted it 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.760
 taken away job published as they say o 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.709
 wait mike go attack us 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.720
 come back there is a strike on 50100 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.640
 there is on the backlight eclipse 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.610
 so as if, well , look, they are already 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.440
 almost returned true fence not me 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.359
 really like the hands of the floor broke 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.000
 somehow they broke you and the wagons 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.620
 worked on the fence and not the fence 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.420
 formally broke the main part 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.069
 which will interfere well recovered 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.760
 mocha tree what are these sides of the team 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.989
 coins mayn’t understand the terrible thing 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.019
 really return the date the fence and 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.209
 everything breaks here is clear what makes navi 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.340
 Now you essentially take it too smart 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.159
 Originally it was as they say 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.140
 error error in their tactics is 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.909
 of and defenseless on center and here on and 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.370
 took advantage of this opportunity and how 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.349
 just go there where you want I do not know luck 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.519
 either super world champion training 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.590
 either overdone may 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.269
 but we must now bring everything to 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.290
 logical completion straight such 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.910
 one-time tactics tried 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.040
 use which either comes either 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.959
 does not enter and here is the same thing now 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.269
 He is doing what he leaving through the trailer 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.669
 and it mayn't fall for the light and 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.650
 work up all over the Sinai capture 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:39.480
 found this suicide this command my strike 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.819
 the second step works the third step flies 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.879
 not sleeping yet bypassed from capture. at 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.799
 capturing the base calculations sitting he really 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.870
 Recently, we are so beautiful more often 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.150
 but not east by was lucky korando 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.120
 blow very often you skinny here they are 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.819
 time and west for goes but navi here they are 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.549
 two seconds from dropping in and out 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.510
 children's base might tried again 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:06.030
 something interesting to perform but the beginning is not 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.669
 went from and blaze i look with each 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.799
 match just the tank is on fire there is a dan 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.079
 cinnamon but also a very light ensk for 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.780
 na'vi commands and a draw account 11 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.519
 remains the city ​​and 1 dynamic map 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.579
 that the doctor prescribed himmelsdorf and 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.079
 great mines 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.960
 how long do we have teams 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.490
 lose by probably better 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.590
 opponent tactics either at the expense of their 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.610
 shortcomings on tactics is not on the skill 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.610
 for no one there
